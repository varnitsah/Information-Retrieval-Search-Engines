illustrations  a l burt company publishers new york  copyright 1904 by little brown and company  all rights reserved     illustration let the boy have his chance said allan     the master mummer     book i     chapter i   sheets of virgin manuscript paper littered my desk the smoke of much uselessly consumed tobacco hung about the room in a little cloud many a time i had dipped my pen in the ink only to find myself a few minutes later scrawling ridiculous little figures upon the margin of my blottingpad it was not at all an auspicious start for one who sought immortality  there came a growl presently from the other side of the room where mabane attired in a disreputable smock with a short black pipe in the corner of his mouth was industriously defacing a small canvas mabane was tall and fair and lean with a mass of refractory hair which was the despair of his barber a scotchman with keen blue eyes and humorous mouth amply redeeming his face from the plainness which would otherwise have been its lot he also was in search of immortality  make a start for heavens sake arnold he implored to look at you is an incitement to laziness the worlds full of things to write about make a choice and have done with it write something even if you have to tear it up afterwards  i turned round in my chair and regarded mabane reproachfully  get on with your potboiler and leave me alone allan i said you do not understand my difficulties in the least it is simply a matter of selection my brain is full of ideasbrimming over i want to be sure that i am choosing the best  there came to me from across the room a grunt of contempt  potboiler indeed what about short stories at ten guineas a time must begin in the middle scented and padded to order anthony hopeish with the sugar of austin dobson and the pepper of kipling shaken on ad lib man alive do you know what potboilers are its a perfect conservatory youre living in got any tobacco arnold  i jerked my pouch across the room and it was caught with a deft little backward swing of the hand allan mabane was an mcc man and a favourite point with his captain  youve got me on the hip allan i answered rising suddenly from my chair and walking restlessly up and down the large bare room the devil himself might have put those words into your mouth they are potboilers every one of them and i am sick of it i want to do something altogether different i am sure that i can but i have got into the way of writing those other things and i cant get out of it that is why i am sitting here like an owl  mabane refilled his pipe and smoked contentedly  i know exactly how youre feeling old chap he said sympathetically i get a dash of the same thing sometimesgenerally in the springtime it begins with a sort of wistfulness a sense of expansion follows you go about all the time with your head in the clouds you want to collect all the beautiful things in life and express them oh i know all about it it generally means a girl where were you last night  i shrugged my shoulders  where i shall be tonight tomorrow nightwhere i was a year ago that is the trouble of it all one is always in the same place  he shook his head  it is a very bad attack he said your generalities may be all right but they are not convincing  i have not spoken a word to a woman except to mrs burdett for a week or more i declared  mabane resumed his work such a discussion his gesture seemed to indicate was not worth continuing but i continued following out my train of thought though i spoke as much to myself as to my friend  you are right about my stories i admitted i have painted rosecoloured pictures of an imaginary life and publishers have bought them and the public i suppose have read them i have dressed up puppets of wood and stone and set them moving like mechanical dollsovergilded artificial vulgar and all the time the real thing knocks at our doors  mabane stepped back from his canvas to examine critically the effect of an unexpected dash of colour  the public my dear greatson he said abstractedly do not want the real thingfrom you every man to his mêtier yours is to sing of blue skies and west winds of hayscented meadows and watteaulike revellers in a paradise as artificial as a dutch garden take my advice and keep your muse chained the other worlds are for the other writers  i was annoyed with mabane there was just sufficient truth in his words to make them sound brutal i answered him with some heat  not if i starve for it allan the whole cycle of life goes humming around us hour by hour it is here there everywhere i will bring a little of it into my work or i will write no more  mabane shook his head he was busy again upon his canvas  it is always the humourist he murmured who is ambitious to write a tragedyand vice versâ the only sane man is he who is conscious of his limitations  on the contrary i answered quickly the man who admits them is a fool i have made up my mind i will dress no more dolls in fine clothes and set them strutting across a rosegarlanded stage i will create or i will leave alone i will write of men and women or not at all  it will affect your income mabane said it will cost you money in postage stamps and your manuscripts will be declined with thanks  his gentle cynicism left me unmoved i had almost forgotten his presence i was standing over by the window looking out across a wilderness of housetops my own thoughts for the moment were sufficient i spoke it is true but i spoke to myself  a beginning i murmured that is all one wants it seems so hard and yetit ought to be so easy if one could but lift the roofscould but see for a moment underneath  i can save you the trouble mabane remarked cheerfully strolling over to my side where are you looking chertsey street eh well in all probability mamma is cooking the dinner mary is scrubbing the floor miss flora is dusting the drawingroom and miss louisa is practising her scales you have got a maggot in your brain greatson life such as you are thinking of is the most commonplace thing in the world the middleclasses havent the capacity for passioneven the tragedy of existence never troubles them dont try to stir up the muddy waters arnold write a pretty story about a princess and her lovers and draw your cheque  there are times allan i remarked thoughtfully when you are an intolerable nuisance  mabane shrugged his shoulders and returned to his work apparently he had reached a point in it which required his undivided attention for he relapsed almost at once into silence following his example i too returned to my desk and took up my pen as a rule my work came to me easily even now there were shadowy ideas well within my mental graspideas however which i was in the humour to repel rather than to invite for i knew very well whither they would lead meback to the creation of those lighter and more fanciful figures flitting always across the canvas of a painted world a certain facility for this sort of thing had brought me a reputation which i was already growing to hate more than ever i was determined not to yield mabanes words had come to me with a subtle note of mockery underlying their undoubted commonsense i thrust the memory of them on one side certain gifts i knew that i possessed i had a ready pen and a facile invention something had stirred in me a lateawakened but irresistible desire to apply them to a different purpose than ever before as i sat there the creations of my fancy flitted before me one by onedelicate perhaps and graceful thoughtfully conceived adequately completed yet i knew very well that they were like ripples upon the water creatures without lasting forms or shape images passing as easily as they had come into the mists of oblivion the human touch the transforming fire of life was wholly wanting these april creations of my braincarnival figures laughing and weeping with equal facility lacked always and altogether the blood and muscle of human creatures the mishaps of their lives struck never a tragic note always the thrill and stir of actual existence were wanting i would have no more of them i felt myself capable of other things i would wait until other things came  the door was pushed open and arthur smiled in upon us this third member of our bachelor household was younger than either mabane or myselfa smoothfaced handsome boy resplendent today in frockcoat and silk hat  hullo he exclaimed hard at work both of you  mabane laid down his brush and surveyed the newcomer critically  arthur he declared with slow emphasis you do us credityou do indeed i hope that you will show yourself to our worthy landlady and that you will linger upon the doorstep as long as possible this sort of thing is good for our waning credit i am no judge for i never possessed such a garment but there is something about the skirts of your frockcoat which appeals to me there is indeed arthur and then your tiethe cunning arrangement of it  oh rats the boy exclaimed laughing give me a couple of cigarettes theres a good chap and do we feed at home tonight  mabane produced the cigarettes and turned back to his work  we do he admitted with a sigh always on tuesdays you know bythebye are you going to the works in that costume  not likely its my day at the depôt worse luck arthur answered pausing to strike a match whats up with arnold  got the blues because his muse wont work mabane said he wants to strike out in a new linesomething bloodcurdling you knowtolstoilike or hall caineishhe doesnt care which he wants to do what nobody else ever willtake himself seriously i put it down in charity to dyspepsia  mabane is an ass i grunted be off arthur theres a good chap and dont listen to him he hasnt the least idea what he is talking about  arthur however happened to be in no hurry he tilted his hat on the back of his head and leaned upon the table  i have always noticed he remarked affably that under allans most asinine speeches there usually lurks a substratum of truth are you really going to write a serious novel arnold  i lit a cigarette and leaned back in my chair resignedly arthur was a most impenetrable person and if he meant to stay i knew very well that it was hopeless to attempt to hurry him  i had some idea of it i admitted bythebye arthur you are a person with a deep insight into life cant you give me a few hints i havent even made a start  arthur considered the matter in all seriousness  it is a bit difficult for you i daresay he remarked you stop indoors so much and when you do go out you mope off into the country by yourself you want to knock about the restaurants and places to get ideas thats what gorman always does you see you get all your characters from life in them and they seem so much more natural  and who i asked is mr gorman i do not recognize the name  pal of mine arthur answered easily i dont bring him here because hes a bit loud for you chaps writes stories for no end of papers illustrated bits and the cigarette journal print anything he cares to send i thought perhaps youd know the name  mabane went off into a peal of laughter behind his canvas the boy remained imperturbable  of course im not comparing his work with arnolds he declared arnolds stuff is no end better of course but after all the chaps got commonsense if they want me to draw a motor i go and sit down in front of it if arnold wants to write of real things real men and women you know he ought to go out and look for them if he sits here and just imagines them how can he be sure that they are the real thing see what i mean  there was a short silence arthur was swinging his long legs backwards and forwards and whistling softly to himself i looked at him for a moment curiously the words of an ancient proverb flitted through my brain  arthur i declared solemnly laying down my pen you are a prophet in disguise the prophet sent to lift the curtain which is before my eyes which way shall i go to find these real men and real women to look upon these tragic happenings for heavens sake direct me where for instance does mr gorman go  arthur swung himself off laughing  gorman goes everywhere he answered if i were you i should try one of the big railway stations so long  i rose to my feet and taking down my hat commenced to brush it mabane looked up from his work  where are you off to arnold he asked  some curious instinct or power of divination might indeed have given me a passing glimpse of the things which lay beyond through the portals of that day for i answered him seriously enougheven gravely  the prophet has spoken i said i must obey i shall start with charing cross     chapter ii   why the man should have spoken to me at all i could not tell yet it is certain that i heard his simple and courteous inquiry with a thrill of pleasure not unmixed with excitement from the first moment of my arrival upon the platform i had singled him out the only interesting figure in a crowd of nonentities perhaps i had lingered a little too closely by his side had manifested more curiosity in him than was altogether seemly at any rate he spoke to me  do you know if the continental train is punctual he asked  i have no idea i answered this guard would tell us perhaps  signalled in sir the man declared two minutes late only  my new acquaintance thanked me and lit a cigarette he seemed in no hurry to depart and i was equally anxious to engage him in conversation for although he was dressed with the trim and quiet precision of the foreigner or man of affairs there was something about his beardless face his broadly humorous mouth and easy nonchalant bearing which suggested the person who juggled always with the ball of life  marvellous he murmured looking after the guard two minutes late from parisand perhaps beyond it is a wonderful service now if i had come to meet any one and had a pressing appointment immediately afterwards this train would have been an hour late as it isah well one is foolish to grumble he added with a little shrug of the shoulders  you like me then i remarked are a loiterer  he flashed a keen glance upon me  i see that i have met he said slowly with someone of similar tastes to my own i will confess at once that you are right for myself i feel that there is nothing more interesting in this great city of yours than to watch the people coming and going from it all your railway stations fascinate me especially those which are the connecting links with other countries perhaps it is because i am an idle man and must needs find amusement somewhere  yet i objected for a single face or personality which is suggestive one sees a thousand of the type which only irritatesthe great rank and file of the commonplace i wonder after all whether the game is worth the candle  one in a thousand he repeated thoughtfully yet think what that one may meana walking drama a tragedy a comedy an epitome of life or death there is more to be read in the face of that one than in the three hundred pages of the novel over which we yawn ourselves to sleep here is the train now let us watch the people togetherthat is if you really mean that you have no friends to look out for  i really mean it i assured him i am here out of the idlest curiosity i am by profession a scribbler and i am in search of an idea  once more he regarded me curiously  your name is greatson is it notarnold greatson you were pointed out to me once at the vagabonds club and i never forget a face here they come look look  the train had come to a standstill people were streaming out upon the platform my companion laid his fingers upon my arm he talked rapidly but lightly  you see them my young friend he exclaimed those are returning tourists from switzerland the thin sharpfeatured girl there with a plaid skirt and a satchel is an american heavens how she talks she has lost a trunk the whole system will be turned upside down until she has found it or been compensated the two young men with her are silent they are wise alone she will prevail you see the man of commerce he is off already he has been to france perhaps to belgium also to buy silks and laces and the stout old gentleman see how happy he looks to be back again where english is spoken and he can pay his way in halfcrowns and shillings you see the milliners headwoman dressed with obtrusive smartness though everything seems a little awry she has been over to paris for the fashions in a few days her firm will send out a little circular and hampstead or balham will be much impressed andwhat do you make of those two my young friend  it seemed to me that my companions tone was changed that his whole appearance was different i was suddenly conscious of an irresistible conviction i did not believe any longer that he was like me an idle loiterer here i felt that his presence had a purpose and that it was connected in some measure with the two people to whom my attention was so suddenly drawn they were in that somewhat heterogeneous crowd sufficiently noticeable the man although he assumed the jauntiness of youth was past middleage and his mottled cheeks his thin watery eyes and thick red neck were the unmistakeable hallmarks of years of selfindulgence he was well dressed and groomed and his demeanour towards his companion was one of deferential good humour she however was a person of a very different order she was a girl apparently between fifteen and sixteen her figure as yet undeveloped her dresses a little too short her face was small and white her mouth had a most pathetic droop and in her eyeswonderful deep blue eyesthere was a curious look of shrinking fear beneath which flashed every now and then a gleam of positive terror her dark hair was arranged in a thick straight fringe upon her forehead and in a long plait behind after the schoolgirl fashion notwithstanding the gaucherie of her years and her apparent unhappiness she carried herself with a certain dignity and grace of movement which were wonderfully impressive i watched her admiringly  they are rather a puzzle i admitted i suppose they might very well be father and daughter it is certain that she is fresh from some convent boardingschool i dont like the way she looks at the man do you it is as though she were terrified to death i wonder if he is her father  my companion did not answer me he was straining forward as though anxious to hear the instructions which the man was giving to a porter about the luggage my presence seemed to be a thing which he had wholly forgotten the girl stood for a moment alone more than ever one seemed to perceive in her eyes the nameless fear of the hunted animal she looked around her furtively yet with a strange halfveiled wildness in her dilated eyes i should scarcely have been surprised to have seen her make a sudden dash for freedom presently however the man having identified all his luggage turned towards her  thats all right he declared cheerfully now i think that i shall take you straight away for lunch somewhere and then we must go to the shops are you hungry isobel  ii do not know she answered so tremulously that the words scarcely reached us though we were standing only a few feet away  we will soon find out he said hansom there café grand  the cab drove off and i realized then how completely for the last few moments i had forgotten my companion i turned to look for him and found him standing close to my side he was apparently absorbed in thought and seemed to have lost all interest in our surroundings his hands were thrust deep in his overcoat pockets and his eyes were fixed upon the ground the stream of people from the train had melted away now and we were almost alone upon the platform i hesitated for a moment and then walked slowly off i did not wish to seem discourteous to the man with whom i had exchanged a few remarks more intimate than those which usually pass between strangers but he had distinctly the air of one wishing to be alone and i was unwilling to seem intrusive i had barely taken a dozen steps however before i was overtaken my companion of a few minutes before was again by my side all traces of his recent preoccupation seemed to have vanished he was smoking a fresh cigarette and his bright deepset eyes were lit with gentle mirth  well mr novelist he exclaimed have you succeeded is your languid muse stirred have you seen a face a look a gestureanything to prick your imagination  i shrugged my shoulders  i have seen one thing i answered which it is not easy to forget i have seen fear and very pathetic it was  you mean  in the face of that child or rather girl with that coarselooking brute of a man  the light seemed to die out from my companions face once more he became stern and thoughtful  yes he agreed i too saw that if one were looking for tragedy one might perhaps find it there  we stood now together on the pavement outside the station my companion glanced at his watch  come he said i have a fancy that you and i might exchange a few ideas i am a lonely man and today i am not in the humour for solitude do me the favour to lunch with me  i did not hesitate for a moment it was exactly the sort of invitation which i had coveted  i shall be delighted i answered  i myself my companion continued have no gift for writing my talents such as they are lie in a different direction but i have been in many countries and adventures have come to me of various sorts i may be able even to start you on your wayif indeed the author of the lost princess is ever short of an idea  i smiled  i can assure you i said that my pilgrimage this morning has no other object than to find one i begin to fear that i have written too much lately at any rate the well of my inspiration if i may use so grandiloquent a term has run dry  he put up his stick and hailed a hansom  after all he said it is possibleyes it is possible that you may succeed adventures wait for us everywhere if only we go about in a proper frame of mind we will lunch i think at the café grand  i followed my prospective host into the cab was it altogether a coincidence i wondered that we were bound for the same restaurant whither the man and the girl had preceded us a few minutes before     chapter iii   mr grooten as my new acquaintance called himself belied neither his appearance nor his modest reference to himself he proved at once that he knew how to order a satisfactory luncheon going through the menu with the quiet deliberation of a connoisseur neither seeking nor accepting any advice from the darkvisaged waiter who stood by his side and finally writing out his few carefully chosen dishes with a special postscript as to the coffee which bythebye we were never to taste he then leaned over the table and began to talk  apparently my host had been in every country of the world and mixed with people of note in each his anecdotes were always pungent personal without being egotistical and savoured always with a certain dry and perfectly natural humour i found myself both interested and fascinated by his constant flow of reminiscences and yet at times my attention wandered for within a few yards of us were seated the man and the child  everything that was noticeable in their demeanour towards one another at the station was even more apparent here a bottle of champagne stood upon the table the man had ordered such a luncheon that the headwaiter was seldom far from his side and the manager in person had come to pay his respects he himself was apparently doing full justice to it his cheeks were flushed his eyes moist and his little bursts of laughter as he persevered in his attentions to his companion grew louder and more frequent but opposite to him the childs face was unchanged her glass was full of wine but she seemed never to touch it her long white fingers played with her bread but she seemed to eat little or nothing her face was pallid and drawn there was terrorabsolute undiluted terrorin her unnaturally large eyes often when the man spoke to her she shivered her eyes seemed constantly trying to escape his gaze wandering round the room the terror of a hunted animal in their soft luminous depths once they rested upon minei was seated in the corner facing herand it seemed to me that there was appealdesperate frenzied appealin that long tense look which thrilled all my pulses with passionate sympathy yet she held herself all the while stiff and erect there was a certain sustaining pride in her close firmset mouth there was never any sign of tears though more than once her lips parted for a moment in a pitiful quiver  the table at which we were sitting was just inside the door in the lefthand corner the man and the girl were upon the opposite side and a few yards further in the room my host with his face to the door could see neither of them therefore without turning round and owing to our table being pushed far into the corner only his back was visible to the people in the restaurant i sitting facing him had an excellent view of the girl and her companion and i was all the while a witness of the silent drama being played out between the two there came a time when i felt that i could stand it no longer i leaned over our small table and interrupted my companion in the middle of a story  forgive me i said but i wish you could see that childs face there is something wrong i am sure she is terrified to death look that brute is trying to force her to drink her wine i really cant sit and watch it any longer  the man who was my host and who had called himself mr grooten nodded his head slightly i knew at once however that he was in close sympathy with me  i have been watching them he said there is a mirror over your head i have seen everything it is a hideouslooking affair but what can one do  i know what i am going to do at any rate i said laying my serviette deliberately upon the table i dont care what happens but i am going to speak to the child  mr grooten raised his eyebrows beyond this faint expression of surprise his face betrayed neither approval nor disapproval  what will you gain he asked  probably nothing i answered and yet i shall try all the same i dare not go away with the memory of that childs face haunting me i must make an effort even though it seems ridiculous i cant help it  my companion smiled softly  as you will my impetuous young friend he said this promises to be interesting i will await your return  i did not hesitate any longer i rose to my feet and crossed the space which lay between the two tables as i drew nearer to her i watched the childs face at first a flash of desperate hope seemed suddenly to illumine it then a fear more abject even than before took its place as she glanced at her companion she watched me come reading without a doubt the purpose in my mind with a sort of fascinated wonder her eyes were still fastened upon mine when at last i paused before her i leaned over the table keeping my shoulder turned upon the man  you will forgive me i said to her in a low tone but i believe that you are in trouble can i help you dont be afraid to tell me if i can  youyou are very kind sir she began breathlessly i  her companion intervened astonishment and anger combined to render his voice unsteady  eh whats this who the devil are you sir and what do you mean by speaking to my ward  i disregarded his interruption altogether i still addressed myself only to the child and i spoke as encouragingly as i could  dont be afraid to tell me i said think that i am your brother i want to help you if i can  oh if you only could she moaned  her companion seized me by the arm and forced me to turn round his face was red almost to suffocation and two thick blue veins stood out upon his forehead in ugly fashion his voice was scarcely articulate by reason of his attempt to keep it low  of all the infernal impertinence what do you mean by it sir who are you how dare you force yourself upon strangers in this fashion  i am quite aware that i am doing an unusual thing i answered and i perhaps deserve all that you can say to me at the same time i am here to have my question answered you have a child with you who is apparently terrified to death i insist upon hearing from her own lips whether she is in need of friends  white and mute she looked from one to the other it was the man who answered  if this were not a public place he said still struggling with his anger id punish you as you deserve you impudent young cub this young lady is my ward and i have just brought her from a convent where she has lived since she was three years old she is strange and shy of course and i was perhaps wrong to bring her to a public place i did it however out of kindness i wanted her to enjoy herself but i perhaps did not appreciate her sensitiveness and the fact that only a few days ago she parted with the friends with whom she has lived all her life now sir he added with a sneer upon his coarse lips i have been compelled to answer your questions to avoid a disturbance in a public place but i promise you that if you do not make yourself scarce in thirty seconds i will send for the manager  i looked once more at the child from whose white set face every gleam of hope seemed to have fled  i can do nothing for you then i asked  her eyes met mine helplessly she shook her head she did not speak at all  is it truewhat he has told me i asked  she murmured an assent so faint that though i was bending over her it scarcely did more than reach my ears i could do no more i turned away and resumed my seat grooten smiled at me  well sir knight errant he said lightly so you could not free the maiden  i was made to feel and look like a fool of course i answered but i dont mind about that to tell you the truth i am not satisfied now the man says that he is her guardian and that he has just brought her from a convent where she has lived all her life he vouchsafed to explain things to me to avoid a row but he was desperately angry she has never been out of the convent since she was three years old and she is very nervous and shy that was his story and he told it plausibly enough i could not get anything out of her except an admission that what he said was the truth  mr grooten nodded thoughtfully  after all he said she is only a child fourteen or fifteen at the most i should suppose i have paid the bill and as you see i have my coat on are you ready  directly i have finished my coffee i answered it looks too good to leave  finish it by all means he answered i am in no particular hurry bythebye i forget whether i showed you this  he drew a small shining weapon with rather a long barrel from his pocket but though he invited me to inspect it he retained it in his own hand  i bought it in new york a few months ago he remarked it is the latest weapon of destruction invented  is it a revolver i asked a little puzzled by its shape  not exactly he answered fingering it carelessly it is in reality a sort of airgun with a wonderful compression and a most ingenious silencer quite as deadly they say as any firearm ever invented it ejects a cylindricallyshaped bullet tapered down almost to the fineness of a needle now he added with a faint smile and a rapid glance round the room if only one dared he turned in his chair and i saw the thing steal out below his cuff one could free the child quite easilyquite easily  it was all over in a momenta wonderful tense moment during which i sat frozen to my chair stricken dumb and motionless with the tragedy which it seemed that i alone had witnessed for there had been a little puff of sound so slight that no other ears had noticed it the seat in front of me was empty and the man on my right had fallen forwards his hand pressed to his side his face curiously livid patchy with streaks of dark colour his eyes bulbous waiters still hurried to and fro the hum of conversation was uninterrupted and then suddenly it camea cry of breathless horror of mortal unexpected agonya cry it seemed of death the waiters stopped in their places to gaze breathlessly at the spot from which the cry had come a silver dish fell clattering from the fingers of one and its contents rolled unnoticed about the floor the murmur of voices the rise and fall of laughter and speech ceased as though an unseen finger had been pressed upon the lips of everyone in the room men rose in their places women craned their necks for a second or two the whole place was like a tableau of arrested motion then there was a rush towards the table across which the man had fallen a doubledup heap a few feet away with only that narrow margin of tablecloth between them the girl sat and stared at him still white and panicstricken yet with a curious change in her face from which all the dumb terror which had first attracted my attention seemed to have passed away     chapter iv   the manager who was very flurried closed the door of the little room into which the wounded man had been carried  can you tell me his name or shall we look for his cardcase he asked  i glanced towards the child she was by far the most composed of the three only she remained with her back turned steadily upon the sofa  his name is delahaye she said major sir william delahaye i think they called him  and where does he livein london tell me his address i will send a cab there at once  i do not know his address the child answered i do not know where he lives  the manager stared at her  you were with him were you not he asked  yes  then surely you must know something more about him than just his name  he called himself my guardian i believe that when i was very young he took me to the convent where i have been ever since two days ago he came to fetch me away  what is your name  isobel de sorrens  you are not related to him then  she shuddered a little  i hope not she said simply  well where was he taking you to the manager asked impatiently surely there must be someone i can send to  i believe that he has a house in london the child said i really do not know anything more you could send to madame richard at the convent st argueil i suppose she knows all about him she told me that i was to consider him my guardian  the manager turned to me i was an occasional customer and he knew who i was  can you tell me anything about him mr greatson the doctor will be here in a moment but i feel that i ought to be sending for some of his friends i am afraid that he is very ill  you were not in the room at the time it happened i remarked  the manager shook his head  no i was in the office  have you sent for the police i asked  police no he exclaimed what have the police to do with it it was an ordinary fit surely  i felt that i had held my peace long enough  it was not a fit at all i said gravely he was shot with a sort of airgun by a man sitting at my table i think that you ought to send for the police at once the mans name was grooten but i know nothing else about him  the manager was for a moment speechless the child looked at me eagerly  it was the little old gentleman who was sitting with you who did it she exclaimed i saw him at charing cross  yes it was he i answered  the child turned away  perhaps after all then she murmured to herself i may have friends in the world  the manager whose name was huber was inclined to be incredulous  an airgun would have made as much noise as a revolver he said are you sure of what you say mr greatson  there is no doubt at all about it i answered and you ought to inform the police at once this mangrooten he called himselfpulled the pistol out of his pocket and was pretending to show it to me when he fired the shot he told me that it was a new invention which he had bought in america and which was quite noiseless  the manager hurried from the room the child and i were alone except for the man on the couch every now and then he groaneda sound i could not hear without a shiver the child however was unmoved she fixed her dark eyes on me  do you think that he will get away she asked eagerly  you mean the man who shot major delahaye  yes  i think that it is very likely he has a good start and i expect that he had made his arrangements  i hope he does she murmured passionately i wish that i could help him  you have no idea who he was i asked i do not believe that grooten was his real name  she shook her head  i have never seen him before in my life she said if i did know i should not tell anyone  the doctor came at last in reality it was barely five minutes since he had been sent for but time dragged itself along slowly in that little room directly afterwards huber the manager returned followed by a sergeant of the police we all waited for the doctors examination i fetched a chair for the child and she thanked me with a wan little smile always she sat with her back to the sofa there was something terribly suggestive in her utter lack of sympathy with the wounded man  the doctor finished his examination at last he came towards us  the wound is a very curious one he said and i am afraid that the bullet will be difficult to extract but it is not in itself serious it is really only a flesh wound but the man is suffering from severe shock and i dont like the action of his heart he can be removed quite safely if you like i will telephone for an ambulance and take him to the hospital do you know anything about this affair sergeant  very little as yet sir the man answered i want this gentlemans description of the person who showed him the pistol the commissionaire saw him leave i understand and one of the waiters saw something in his hand was he a friend of yours sir  i only know his name i answered he called himself mr grooten and i judged him to be a foreigner though he spoke perfect english he seemed to be about fifty years old cleanshaven and of under medium height  too vague the sergeant remarked had he any peculiarity of feature or expression anything which would help towards identification  none that i can remember i answered  how was he dressed  quietly i could not remember anything that he wore  did he give you any idea of his intention did he speak of major delahaye at all as though he knew him  i shook my head  we simply both remarked i said slowly that thisyoung lady seemed to be very frightened of her companion and i do not think that we formed a favourable impression of him he gave me not the slightest intimation however of his intention to interfere  it could not have been an accident i suppose mr huber suggested  i might have thought so i answered if he had not immediately left the place he disappeared so quickly that i did not even see him go  you sat by accident at the same table the sergeant asked  no we came together i answered we met at charing cross and he spoke to me he knew my name and reminded me that we had once met at the vagabonds club  did you remember him  i cannot say that i did i answered  and afterwards  we talked together for some time and when we left the station he asked me to lunch here  did he arrive by train or was he meeting anyone at charing cross the sergeant asked  neither so far as i could see i answered he seemed to be simply loitering i ought to tell you though that we saw major delahaye and this young lady arrive by the continental train and he seemed to be interested in them  the sergeant turned to isobel  did you know him he asked  no she answered i did not notice him at the station at all i saw that he was sitting at the same table downstairs as this gentleman but i am quite sure that i have never seen him before in my life  the sergeant put away his pocketbook  i am very sorry to trouble you he said but i think it would be better for you all to come to bow street and see the superintendent  i am quite willing to do so i answered though i can tell him no more than i have told you  the child moved suddenly towards me her thin shabbily gloved fingers gripped my arm with almost painful force her eyes were full of passionate appeal  i may go with you she murmured you will not leave me alone  the young lady will be required also the sergeant remarked  we will go together of course i said gently come     chapter v   we crossed the road from the policestation and found ourselves in one of the narrow streets fringing covent garden the air was fragrant here with the perfume of white and purple lilac great baskets full of which were piled up in the gutter the girl half closed her eyes  delicious she murmured this reminds me of st argueil you have flowers too then in london  i bought her a handful which she sniffed and held to her face with delight  ah she said a little sadly i had forgotten that there were any beautiful things left in the world thank you so much mr arnold  at your age i said cheerfully you will soon find out that the worldeven londonis a treasurehouse of beautiful things  she looked down the narrow untidy street strewn with the refuse from the market waggons and trucks which blocked the way making all but pedestrian traffic an impossibilityat the piles of empty baskets in the gutter and the slatternly crowd of loiterers then she looked up at me with a faint smile  londonis not all like this then she remarked  i shook my head  this is a back street almost a slum i said i daresay you have lived in the country always and just at first it does not seem possible that there should be anything beautiful about a great city when you get a little older i think that you will see things differently the beauty of a great city thronged with men and women is a more subtle thing than the mere joy of meadows and hills and country lanesbut it exists all the same and now i continued stopping short upon the pavement i must take you to your friends tell me where they live you have the address perhaps  what friends she asked me with wideopen eyes  you told the superintendent of police that you had friends in london i reminded her  then she smiled at mea very dazzling smile which showed all her white teeth and which seemed somehow to become reflected in her dark blue eyes  but i meant you she exclaimed i thought that you knew that there is no one else you are my friend i know very well for you came and spoke kindly to me when i was terrifiedterrified to death  the shadow of gravity rested only for a moment upon her face she laughed gaily at my consternation  then where am i to take you i asked  stupid she murmured i am going with you of course whywhyyou dont mind do you she asked with a sudden catch in her throat  i felt like a brute and i hastened to make what amends i could i smiled at her reassuringly  mind of course i dont mind i declared only you see there are three of usall menand we live together i was afraid  i shall not mind that at all she interrupted cheerfully if they are nice like you i think that it will be delightful there were only girls at the convent you know and the sisters and a few masters who came to teach us things but they were not allowed to speak to us except to give out the lessons and they were very stupid i do not think that i shall be any trouble to you at all i will try not to be  i looked at hera little helplessly after all though she was tall for her years she was only a child her dress was of an awkward length her long straight fringe and plaited hair the coiffure of the schoolroom the most surprising thing of all in connection with her was that she showed no signs of the tragedy which had so recently been played out around her her eyes had lost their nameless fear there was even colour in her cheeks  come along then i said we will turn into the strand and take a hansom  she walked buoyantly along by my side as tall within an inch or so as myself and with a certain elegance in her gait a little hard to reconcile with her years all the while she looked eagerly about her her eyes shining with curiosity  we passed through paris at night she said with a little reminiscent shudder as though every thought connected with that journey were a torture and i have never really been in a great city before i hope you meant what you said she added looking up at me with a quick smile and that there are parts of london more beautiful than this  many i assured her you shall see the parks the rhododendrons will be out soon and i think that you will find them beautiful though of course the town can never be like the country heres a hansom with a good horse jump in                                       i think that our arrival at number 4 earls crescent created quite as much sensation as i had anticipated when i opened the door of the large barelyfurnished room which we called our workshop arthur sprang from the table on which he had been lounging and mabane who was still working dropped his brush in sheer amazement i turned towards the girl  these are my friends isobel of whom i have been telling you i said this is mr arthur fielding who is the ornamental member of the establishment and that is mr allan mabane who paints very bad pictures but who contrives to make other people think that they are worth buying allan this young lady miss isobel de sorrens and i have had a little adventure together i will explain all about it later on  they both advanced with extended hands the girl as though suddenly conscious of her position gave a hand to each and looked at them almost piteously  you will not mind my coming she begged with a tremulous little note of appeal in her tone i do not seem to have any friends and mr arnold has been so kind to me if i may stay here for a little while i will tryoh i am sure that i will not be in anyones way  the pathos of her breathless little speech was almost irresistible the child as she stood there in the centre of the room looking eagerly from one to the other conquered easily i do not know if either of the other two were conscious of the new note of life which she seemed to bring with her into our shabby smokesmelling room but to me it came home even in those first few moments with wonderful poignancy an alien note it was but a wonderfully sweet one we three men had drifted away from the whole world of our womenkind she seemed to bring us back instantly into touch with some of the few better and rarer memories round which the selfishness of life is always building a thicker crust for one thing at that moment i was deeply gratefulthat i knew my friends my task was made a sinecure  my dear young lady mabane exclaimed with unmistakeable earnestness you are heartily welcome we are delighted to see you here  more than welcome arthur declared we are all one here you know miss de sorrens and if you are arnolds friend you must be ours  for the first time tears stood in her eyes she brushed them proudly away  you are very very kind she said i cannot tell you how grateful i am to you both  arthur rushed for our one easychair and insisted upon installing her in it mabane lit a stove and left the room swinging a kettle i drew a little sigh of relief and threw my hat into a corner apparently she had conquered my friends as easily as she had conquered me  arthur i said please entertain miss de sorrens for a few moments will you i must go and interview mrs burdett  ill do my best arnold he assured me mrs burdetts in the kitchen i think she came in just before you  mrs burdett was our housekeeper and sole domestic she was a hardfeatured but kindly old woman with a caustic tongue and a soft heart she heard my story unmoved betraying neither enthusiasm or disapproval when i had finished she simply set her cap straight and rubbed her hands upon her apron  id like to see the child as you call her mr arnold she said you young gentlemen are so easy deceived and its an unusual thing that youre proposing not to say inconvenient  so i took mrs burdett back with me to the studio as we opened the door the music of the girls strange little foreign laugh was ringing through the room arthur was mounted upon his hobby talking of the delights of motoring and she was listening with sparkling eyes they stopped at once as we entered  this is mrs burdett isobel i said who looks after us here and who is going to take charge of you she will show you your room im sorry that you will find it so tiny but you can see that we are a little cramped here  isobel rose at once  you should have seen our cells at st argueil she exclaimed smiling some of us who were tall could scarcely stand upright may i come with you mrs burdett  mrs burdetts tone and answer relieved me of one more anxiety the door closed upon them we three men were alone  is this mabane asked curiously a practical joke or a part of your plot what does it all mean where on earth did you come across the child who is she  i took a cigarette from my case and lit it  the responsibility for the whole affair i declared remains with arthur  the boy whistled softly he looked at me with wideopen eyes  come he declared i like that why i have never seen the girl before in my life or anyone like her where do i come in i should like to know  it was you i said who started me off to charing cross  you mean to say that you picked her up there mabane exclaimed  i will tell you the whole story i answered she comes with the halo of tragedy about her listen  then i told them of the things which had happened to me during the last few hours     chapter vi   i certainly could not complain of any lack of interest on the part of my auditors they listened to every word of my story with rapt attention when i had finished they were both silent for several moments mabane eyed me curiously i think that at first he scarcely knew whether to believe me altogether serious  the man who was with the girl arthur asked at lastthis major delahaye or whatever his name wasis he dead  he was alive two hours ago i answered  will he recover  i believe that there is just a bare chanceno more i answered he had a weak heart and the shock was almost enough to kill him  and your friendthe man who shot himwhere is he mabane asked is he in custody  i shook my head  he disappeared i answered as though by magic you see we were sitting at the table next the door and he had every opportunity for slipping out unnoticed  it was at the café grand you said wasnt it arthur asked  i nodded  how about the commissionaire then  he saw the man come out but he took no particular notice of him i answered he crossed the street at an ordinary walking pace and he was out of sight before the commotion inside began  it seems to me mabane remarked that you must have found yourself in rather an awkward position  i did i answered grimly of course my story sounded a bit thin and the police made me go to the station with them as luck would have it however i knew the inspector and i managed to convince him that i was telling the truth or i doubt whether they would have let me go i suppose i added a little doubtfully that you fellows must think me a perfect idiot for bringing the child here but upon my word i dont know what else i could have done i simply couldnt leave her there or in the streets im awfully sorry  dont be an ass arthur interrupted energetically of course you couldnt do anything but bring her here you acted like a sensible chap for once  have you questioned her mabane asked about her friends if she has none in london she must have some somewhere  i have questioned her i answered but not very successfully she appears to know nothing about her relations or even her parentage she has been at the convent ever since she can remember and she has seen no one outside it except this man who took her there and came to fetch her away  and what relation is he allan asked  none he called himself simply her guardian  arthur walked across the room for his pipe and commenced to fill it  well he said you are like the man in the scriptures who found what he went out for to see youve got your adventure at any rate all owing to my advice too hullo  we all turned round the door of the room was suddenly opened and closed my host of a few hours ago stood upon the threshold smiling suavely upon us he wore a low black hat and a coat somewhat thicker than the season of the year seemed to demand every article of attire was different but his face seemed to defy disguise i should have known mr grooten anywhere  his unexpected presence seemed to deprive me almost of my wits i simply gaped at him like the others  great heavens i exclaimed you here  he stood quite still for a moment listening then he glanced sharply around the room he looked at mabane and he looked at arthur finally he addressed me  i fancy that i am a fairly obvious apparition he remarked where is the child  she is here i answered in another room with our housekeeper just now but  i have only a few seconds to spare mr grooten interrupted ruthlessly listen to me you have chosen to interfere in this concern and you must take your part in it now you have the child and you must keep her for a time you must not let her go on any account unfortunately the man who sold me that pistol was a liar delahaye is not dead it is possible even that he may recover will you swear to keep the child from him  i hesitated it seemed to me that grooten was taking a great deal for granted  you must remember i said that i have absolutely no legal hold upon her if delahaye is her guardian it will be quite easy for him to take her away  he is not her legal guardian grooten said sharply he has no just claim upon her at all  neither have i i reminded him  you have possession grooten exclaimed i tell you that neither delahaye if he lives nor any other person will appeal to the law to force you to give the child up this is the truth i see you still hesitate listen this also is truth the child is in danger from delahayehideous unmentionable danger  i never thought of doubting his word truth blazed out from his keen grey eyes his words carried conviction with them  i will keep the child i promised him but tell me who you are and what you have to do with her  no matter he answered swiftly i lay this thing upon you a charge upon your honour guard the child if delahaye recovers there will be trouble you must brave it out you are an englishman you are one of a stubborn honourable race do my bidding in this matter and you shall learn what gratitude can mean  once more he listened for a moment intently then he continued  i am followed by the police he said they may be here at any moment you can tell them of my visit if it is necessary my escape is provided for  but surely you will tell me something else about the child i exclaimed tell me at least  he held out his hand  you are safer to know nothing he said quickly be faithful to what you have promised and you will never regret it  with almost incredible swiftness he disappeared we all three looked at one another speechless then from outside came the sound of light footsteps and a laugh as from the throat of a singing bird the door was thrown open and isobel entered  such a funny little man has just gone out she exclaimed he had a handkerchief tied round his face as though he had been fighting what lazy people she added looking around i expected to find tea ready will you please tell me some more about motorcars mr arthur  she sat on a stool in our midst and chattered while we fed her with cakes and screamed with laughter at mabanes toast the tragedy of a few hours ago seemed to have passed already from her mind she was all charm and irresponsibility the gaunt bare room which for years had mocked all our efforts at decoration seemed suddenly a beautiful place easily and with the effortless grace of her fifteen years she laughed her way into our hearts     chapter vii   arnold  i waved my left hand  dont disturb me for a few minutes allan theres a good chap i begged im hard at it  found your plot then eh  ive got a start anyhow give me half an hour i only want to set the thing going  mabane grunted and took up his brush for once i was thankful that we were alone at last i saw my way after weeks of ineffective scribbling a glimpse of the real thing had come to me  the stiffness had gone from my brain and fingers my pen flew over the paper the joy of creation sang once more in my heart tingled in all my pulses we worked together and in silence for an hour or more then with a little sigh of satisfaction i leaned back in my chair  the story goes then mabane remarked  yes it goes i assented my eyes fixed absently upon the loose sheets of manuscript strewn all over my desk already i was finding it hard to tear my thoughts away from it  there was a short silence then mabane who had been filling his pipe came over to my side  you heard from the convent this morning arnold  yes the letter is here read it  mabane shook his head  i cant read french he said  they want her back again i told him thoughtfully the woman appears to be honest enough she admits that they have no absolute claimthey do not even know her parentage they have been paid she says regularly and well for the childs education and if she is now without a home they would like her to go back to them she thinks it possible that major delahayes relatives or the people for whom he acted might continue the payments but they are willing to take their risk of that the long and short of it is that they want her back again  as a pupil still mabane asked  they would train her for a teacher in that case she would have to serve a sort of novitiate she would practically become a nun  mabane withdrew his pipe from his mouth and looked thoughtfully into the bowl of it  i never had a sister he said and i really know nothing whatever about children but does it occur to you arnold that thisyoung lady seems particularly adapted for a convent  i believe i said firmly that it would be misery for her  mabane walked over to his canvas and came back again  what about delahaye he asked  he is still unconscious at the hospital i answered  mabane hesitated  i do not wish to seem intrusive arnold he said but i cant help remembering that a certain lady with whom you were very friendly once married a delahaye  i nodded  i should have told you in any case i said this is the manmajor sir william delahaye whom eileen marigold married  then surely you recognized him in the restaurant  i never met him i answered this marriage was arranged very quickly as you know and i was abroad when it took place i called on lady delahaye twice but i did not meet her husband on either occasion  mabane fingered the loose sheets of my manuscript idly  your story arnold he said is having a tragic birth will delahaye really die do you think  the doctors are not very hopeful i told him the wound itself is not mortal but the shock seems to have affected him seriously he is not a young man and he has lived hard all his days  if he dies mabane said thoughtfully your friend grooten i think you said he called himself will have to disappear altogether in that case i suppose weshall be compelled to send the child back to the convent  unless  unless what  unless we provide for her ourselves i answered boldly  mabane smoked furiously for a few moments his hands were thrust deep down in his trousers pockets he looked fixedly out of the window  arnold he said abruptly do you believe in presentiments  it depends whether they affect me favourably or the reverse i answered carelessly you scotchmen are all so superstitious  you may call it superstition mabane continued everything of the sort which an ignorant man cannot understand he calls superstition but if you like i will tell you something which is surely going to happen i will tell you what i have seen  i leaned forward in my chair and looked curiously into allans face his hard somewhat commonplace features seemed touched for the moment by some transfiguring fire his keen bluegrey eyes were as soft and luminous as a girls he had actually the appearance of a man who sees a little way beyond the border even then i could not take him seriously  speak sir prophet i exclaimed with a little laugh let my eyes also be touched with fire let me see what you see  mabane showed no sign of annoyance he looked at me composedly  do not be a fool arnold he said you may believe or disbelieve but some day you will know that the things which i have in my mind are true  i think that i was a little bewildered i realized now what at first i had been inclined to doubtthat mabane was wholly in earnest unconsciously my attitude towards him changed it is hard to mock a man who believes in himself  go ahead then allan i said quietly remember that you have told me nothing yet  mabane turned towards me he spoke slowly his face was seriousalmost solemn  the man delahaye will never claim the child he said i think that he will die the man who shot him has gonewe shall not hear of him again not for many years if at all he has gone like a stone dropped into a bottomless tarn we shall not send the child back to the convent she will remain here  he paused as though expecting me to speak i shrugged my shoulders  come i said i shall not quarrel with your prophecy so far allan the introduction of a feminine element here seems a little incongruous but after all she is very young  mabane unclasped his arms and looked thoughtfully around the room already there was a change since a few days ago the ornaments and furniture were free from dust there were two great bowls of flowers upon the table some studies which had hung upon the wall were replaced with others of a more sedate character the atmosphere of the place was different wild untidiness had given place to some semblance of order there was an attempt everywhere at repression mabane knocked the ashes from his pipe  for five years he said abstractedly you and i and arthur have lived here together are you satisfied with those five years think  i looked from my desk out of the window over the housetops up into the sunshine and i too was grave satisfied is anyone short of a fool ever satisfied  no i am not i admitted a little bitterly  tell me what you think of these five years arnold tell me the truth mabane persisted let me know if your thoughts are the same as mine  drift i answered we have worked a little and thought a littlebut our feet have been on the earth a great deal oftener than our heads have touched the clouds  drift mabane repeated it is a true word we have gained a little experience of the wrong sort we have learnt how to adapt our poor little gifts to the whim of the moment such as our talent has been we have made a servant of it to minister to our physical necessities we have lived little lives arnoldvery little lives  go on i murmured this at least is truth  mabane paused he looked at his pipe but he did not relight it  there is a change coming he said slowly we are going to drift no longer we are going to be drawn into the maelstrom of life what it may mean for you and for me and for the boy i do not know it will change usit must change our work i shall paint no more guesses at realismafter someone else and you will write no more of princesses or pull the strings of tinseldecked puppets so that they may dance their way through the pages of your gailydressed novels and an end has come to these things arnold no i am not raving nor is this a jest wait  you speak i told him like a seer since when was it given to you to read the future so glibly my friend  mabane looked at me with grave eyes there was no shadow of levity in his manner  i am not a superstitious man arnold he said but i come after all of hillfolk and i believe that there are times when one can feel and see the shadow of coming things my grandfather knew the day of his death and spoke of it my father made his will before he set foot on the steamer which went to the bottom on a calm day between dover and ostend nothing of this sort has ever come to me before you yourself have called me too hardheaded too material for an artist so i have always thought myselfuntil today today i feel differently  is it this child then who is to open the gates of the world to us i asked  remember mabane answered that before many months have passed she will be a woman  i moved in my chair a little uneasily  i wonder i said half to myself whether i did well to bring her here  mabane laughed shortly  it was not you who brought her he declared she was sent  sent  aye these things are not of our choosing arnold there is something behind which drives the great wheels you can call it fate or god according to your philosophy it is there all the time the one eternal force  i looked at mabane steadfastly he did not flinch  psychologically my dear allan i said you appear to be in a very interesting state just now  mabane shrugged his shoulders he crossed the room for some tobacco and began to refill his pipe  well he said i have finished tomorrow i suppose i shall want to kick myself for having said as much as i have listen here they come  isobel came into the room followed by arthur in a leather jacket and breeches her cheeks were pink her eyes danced with excitement she threw off her tamoshanter and stood deftly rearranging for a moment her windtossed hair  glorious she exclaimed oh it has been glorious mr arthur how can i thank you i have never enjoyed myself so much in my life if the sister superior could only have seen meand the girls  motoring i presume mabane remarked is amongst the pleasures denied to the young ladies of the convent  she laughed gaily  pleasures why there are no pleasures for those poor girls one may not even smile and as for games even they are not permitted i think that it is shameful to make such a purgatory of a place one may not one could not be happy there it is not allowed  she caught the look which flashed from mabane to me and turned instantly around  oh monsieur arnold she cried breathlessly you do not thinki shall not have to return there  not likely arthur interposed with vigour by jove if anyone shut you up there again id come and fetch you out  she threw a quick glance of gratitude towards him but her eyes returned almost immediately to mine she waited anxiously for me to speak  if we can possibly prevent it i said slowly you shall never return there i do not think that it is at all the proper place for you but you must remember that we are after all people of no authority someone might come forward tomorrow with a legal right to claim you and we should be helpless  illustration if we can possibly prevent it i said slowly you shall never return there  slowly the colour died away from her cheeks her eyes became preternaturally bright and anxious  there is no one she faltered except that man he called himself my guardian  had you seen him before he came to the convent and fetched you away i asked  only once she answered he came to st argueil about a year ago i hated him then i have hated him ever since i think that if all men were like that i would be content to stay in the convent all my life  you dont remember the circumstances under which he took you there i suppose mabane asked thoughtfully  she shook her head  i do not remember being taken there at all she answered i think that i was not more than four or five years old  and all the time no one else has been to see you or written to you i asked  no one  she smothered a little sob as she answered me it was as though my questions and mabanes although i had asked them gently enough had suddenly brought home to her a fuller sense of her complete loneliness her eyes were full of tears she held herself proudly and she fought hard for her selfcontrol arthur glanced indignantly at both of us he had the wit however to remain silent  there are just one or two more questions isobel i said which i must ask you some time or other  now please then she begged  did major delahaye ever mention his wife to you  never  you did not even know then when you arrived in london where he was taking you  i knew nothing she admitted he behaved very strangely and i was miserable every moment of the time i was with him i understood that i was to have a companion and live in london  i felt my blood run cold for a moment i did not dare to look at mabane  i do not think i said that you need fear anything more from major delahaye even if he should recover  you mean she cried breathlessly  we should never give you up to him i declared firmly  thank god she murmured mr arnold she added looking at me eagerly i can paint and sing and play the piano cant people earn money sometimes by doing these things i would workoh i am not afraid to work couldnt i stay here for a little while  of course you can i assured her and there is no need at all for you to think about earning money yet it is not that which troubles us at all it is the fact that we have no legal claim upon you and people may come forward at any moment who have  arthur glanced towards her triumphantly  what did i tell you he exclaimed  she looked timidly across at mabane  the other gentleman wont mind she asked timidly  mabane smiled at her and his smile was a revelation even to us who knew him so well  my dear young lady he said you will be more than welcome i have just been telling arnold that your coming will make the world a different place for us  the girls smile was illumining it seemed to include us all she held out both her hands mabane seized one and bent over it with the air of a courtier the other was offered to me arthur was content to beam upon us all from the background at that precise moment came a tap at the door mrs burdett brought in a telegram  i tore it open and hastily reading it passed it on to mabane he hesitated for a moment and then turned gravely to isobel  major delahaye will not trouble you any more he said he died in the hospital an hour ago     chapter viii   a shade more to the right please there just as you are now dont move in five minutes i shall have finished for the day  isobel smiled  i think that your five minutes she said last sometimes for a very long time but i am not tiredno not at all i can stay like this if you wish until the light goes  you are splendid mabane murmured the best sitteroh hang it whos that  there is certainly some one at the door isobel remarked  mabane paused in his work to shout fiercely come in i too looked up from my writing a woman was ushered into the rooma woman dressed in fashionable mourning of medium height and with a wealth of fair fluffy hair which seemed to mock the restraining black bands mrs burdett visibly impressed lingered in the background  the woman paused and looked around she looked at me and the pen slipped from my nerveless fingers i rose to my feet  eillady delahaye i exclaimed  she inclined her head her demeanour was cold almost belligerent  i am glad to find you here arnold greatson she said you are a friend i believe of the man who murdered my husband  you have been misinformed lady delahaye i answered quietly i was not even an acquaintance of his we met that day for the first time  by the faintest possible curl of the lips she expressed her contemptuous disbelief  ah she said i remember your story at the inquest you will forgive me if in company i believe with the majority who heard it i find it a trifle improbable  i looked at her gravely this was the woman with whom i had once believed myself in love the woman who had jilted me to marry a man of whom even his friends found it hard to speak well  lady delahaye i said my story may have sounded strangely but it was true i presume that you did not come here solely with the purpose of expressing your amiable opinion of my veracity  you are quite right she admitted drily i did not  she was silent for a few moments her eyes were fixed upon isobel and i did not like their expression  may i offer you a chair lady delahaye i asked  thank you i prefer to standhere she answered this i believe is the young person who was with my husband  she extended a sombrely gloved forefinger towards isobel who met her gaze unflinchingly  that is the young lady i answered have you anything to say to her  my errand here is with her lady delahaye declared what is it that you call yourself girl  isobel was a little bewildered she seemed scarcely able to appreciate lady delahayes attitude  my name she said is isobel de sorrens  you asserted at the inquest lady delahaye continued that my husband was your guardian what did you mean by such an extraordinary statement  isobel seemed suddenly to grasp the situation her finely arched eyebrows were raised her cheeks were pink her eyes sparkling she rose slowly to her feet and child though she was the dignity of her demeanour was such that lady delahaye with her accusing forefinger seemed to shrink into insignificance  i think she said that you are a very rude person major delahaye took me to the convent of st argueil when i was four years old and left me there he visited me twelve months ago and brought me to england you know when i was with him for less than twentyfour hours and i was very unhappy indeed all the time i did not understand the things which he said to me nor did i like him at all i think that if he had left me out of his sight for a moment i should have run away  lady delahaye was very pale and her eyes were full of unpleasant things i found myself looking at her and marvelling at the folly which i had long since forgotten  you perhaps complained of himto his murderer it is you no doubt who are responsible for my husbands death  isobels lips curled contemptuously  major delahaye she said did not permit me to speak to anyone as for the man whom you call his murderer i never saw him before in my life nor should i recognize him again if i saw him now i do not know why you come here and say all these unkind things to me i have done you no harm i am very sorry about major delahaye butbut  her lips quivered i hastily interposed  lady delahaye i said i do not know what the immediate object of your visit here may be but  the immediate object of my visit she interrupted coldly is as repugnant to me mr greatson as it may possibly be disappointing to you i am here however to carry out my husbands last wish this child herself has asserted that he was her guardian by his death that most unwelcome post devolves upon me  isobel turned white as though stung by a sudden apprehension she looked towards me and i took her hand in mine lady delahaye smiled unpleasantly upon us both  you mean i said that you wish to take her away from us  wish lady delahaye repeated coldly i can assure you that i am not consulting my own wishes upon the subject at all what i am doing is simply my duty the child had better get her hat on  isobel did not move but she turned very pale her eyes seemed fastened upon mine she waited for me to speak the situation was embarrassing enough so far as i was concerned for lady delahaye was obviously in earnest i tried to gain time  may i ask what your intentions are with regard to the child you intend to take her to your hometo adopt her i suppose  lady delahaye regarded me with cold surprise  certainly not she answered i shall find a fitting position for her in her own station of life  may i assume then i continued with some eagerness that you know what that is you are acquainted perhaps with her parentage  she returned my gaze steadily  i may be she answered that however is beside the question i intend to do my duty by the child if you have been put to any expense with regard to her you can mention the amount and i will defray it i have answered enough questions what is your name childisobel get ready to come with me  isobel answered her steadily but her eyes were filled with shrinking fear  i do not wish to come with you she said i do not like you at all  lady delahaye raised her eyebrows it seemed to me that in a quiet way she was becoming angry  unfortunately she said your liking or disliking me makes very little difference i have no choice in the matter at all the care of you has devolved upon me and i must undertake it you had better come at once  isobel trembled where she stood i judged it time to intervene  lady delahaye i said the duty of looking after this child is evidently a distasteful one to you we will relieve you of it she can remain with us  lady delahaye looked at me in astonishment then she laughed and it seemed to all of us that we had never heard a more unpleasant travesty of mirth  indeed she exclaimed and may i ask of whom your household consists  of myself and my two friends mabane and fielding we have a most responsible housekeeper however who will be able to look after the child  until she herself can qualify for the position i presume lady delahaye remarked drily what a delightful arrangement a sort of cooperative household quite arcadian i am sure and so truly philanthropic you have changed a good deal during the last few years mr arnold greatson to be able to stand there and make such an extraordinary proposition to me  i was determined not to lose my temper though as a matter of fact i was fiercely angry  lady delahaye i said we are not prepared to give this child up to you it will perhaps help to shorten aa painful interview if you will accept that from me as final  the change in isobel was marvellous the brilliant colour streamed into her cheeks her longdrawn quivering sigh of relief seemed in the momentary silence which followed my pronouncement a very audible thing lady delahaye looked at me as though she doubted the meaning of my words  you are aware she said that this will mean great unpleasantness for you you know the law  i neither know it nor wish to know it i answered we shall not give up the child  i glanced at mabane his confirmation was swift and decisive  i am entirely in accord with my friend madam he said with grim precision  the law will compel you she declared  we will do our best then he answered to cheat the law  i should like to add lady delahaye i continued that our housekeeper who has been in the service of my family for over thirty years has willingly undertaken the care of the child and i can assure you in case you should have any anxieties concerning her that she will be as safe under our charge as in your own  lady delahaye moved towards the door on the threshold she turned and laid her hand upon my arm i was preparing to show her out there was meaning in her eyes as she leaned towards me  mr greatson she said we were once friends or i should drive straight from here to my solicitors i presume you are aware that your present attitude is capable of very serious misrepresentation  i must take the risk of that lady delahaye i answered i ask you to remember however that the law would also require you to prove your guardianship do you yourself know anything of the childs parentage  she did not answer me directly  i shall give you she said twentyfour hours for reflection at the end of that time if i do not hear from you i shall apply to the courts  i held the door open and bowed  you will doubtless act i said according to your discretion  the moment seemed propitious for her departure all that had to be said had surely passed between us yet she seemed for some reason unwilling to go  i am not sure mr greatson she said that i can find my way out will you be so good as to see me to my carriage  i had no alternative but to obey our rooms were on the fifth floor of a block of flats overlooking chelsea embankment and we had no lift we descended two flights of the stone stairs in silence then she suddenly laid her fingers upon my arm  arnold she said softly i never thought that we should meet again like this  nor i lady delahaye i answered truthfully enough  you have changed  i looked at her she had the grace to blush  oh i know that i behaved badly she murmured but think how poor we were and oh how weary i was of poverty if i had refused major delahaye i think that my mother would have turned me out of doors i wrote and told you all about it  yes i admitted you wrote  and you never answered my letter  it seemed to me i remarked that it needed no answer  and afterwards she said i wrote and asked you to come and see me  lady delahaye i began  eileen she interrupted  very well then if you will have it so eileen i said you have alluded to events which i have forgotten whether you or i behaved well or ill does not matter in the least now it is all over and done with  you mean then that i am unforgiven  on the contrary i assured her i have nothing to forgive  she flashed a swift glance of reproach up on me to my amazement there were tears in her eyes  mr greatson she said i can find my way to the street alone i will not trouble you further  she swept away with a dignity which became her better than her previous attitude there was nothing left for me to do but to turn back     chapter ix   isobel was standing quite still in the middle of the room her hands tightly clenched a spot of colour aflame in her cheeks arthur who had passed lady delahaye and me upon the stairs had apparently just been told the object of her visit  oh i hate that woman isobel exclaimed as i entered i hate her i would rather die than go to her i would rather go back to the convent she looks at me as though i were something to be despised something which should not be allowed to go alive upon the earth  arthur would have spoken but mabane interrupted him he laid his hand gently upon her shoulder  isobel he said gently you need have no fear i know how arnold feels about it and i can speak for myself also you shall not go to her we will not give you up i do not believe that she will go to the courts at all i doubt if she has any claim  why wed hide you run away with you anything arthur declared impetuously dont you be scared isobel i dont believe she can do a thing the laws like a great fat animal it takes a plaguey lot to move it and then it moves as slowly as a steamroller well dodge it somehow  she gave them a hand each her action was almost regal it some way it seemed that in according her our protection we were receiving rather than conferring a favour  my friends she said you are so kind that i have no words with which to thank you but you will believe that i am grateful  it was then for the first time that they saw me upon the threshold isobel looked at me anxiously  she has gone  i nodded  i do not think that she will trouble us again just yet i said at the same time we must be prepared tell me whereabouts is this school from which you came isobel  st argueil it is about three hours journey from paris why do you ask  because i think that i must go there i answered we must try and find out what legal claims major delahaye had upon you what is the name of the principal  madame richard is the lay principal isobel answered but sister ursula is really the head of the place we girls saw her though very seldomonly those who were going to remain she added with a little shudder  and this madame richard i asked is she a kindly sort of a person  isobel shook her head doubtfully  i did not like her she said she is very stern she is not kind to anyone  nevertheless i suppose she will tell me what she knows i said give me the bradshaw allan and that old continental guide  i presently became immersed in planning out my route when at last i looked up mabane was working steadily the others had gone i looked round the room  where are arthur and isobel i asked  he shrugged his shoulders  like calling to like he remarked tersely they have gone trailing  i put the bradshaw down  i shall leave for paris at midnight mabane i said  he nodded  it seems to be the most sensible thing to do he remarked there is no other way of getting to the bottom of the affair  so i went to pack my bag and within an hour i was on my way to france                                       i rose to my feet after a somewhat lengthy wait and bowed between this newcomer and myself across the stone floor lay the sunlight a long yellow stream which seemed to me the only living thing which i had as yet seen in this strange grimlooking building i spoke in indifferent french she answered me in perfect english  i have the honour to address  madame richard i am the lay principal of the convent will you permit me  the blind fell and there was no more sunlight i was conscious of a sudden chill the bare room with its stoneflagged floor its plain deal furniture depressed me no less than the cold forbidding appearance of the woman who stood now motionless before me she was paler than any woman whom i had ever seen in my life a living person she seemed the personification of lifelessness her black hair was streaked with grey her dress which suggested a uniform in its severity knew no adornment save the plain ivory cross which hung from an almost invisible chain about her neck her expression indicated neither curiosity nor courtesy she simply waited i although as a rule i had no great difficulty in finding words felt myself almost embarrassed  i have come from london to see you i said my name is greatsonarnold greatson  there was not a quiver of expression in her cold acknowledgment of my declaration nevertheless at that moment i received an inspiration i was perfectly sure that she knew who i was and what i had come for  i have come to know i continued if you can give me any information as to the friends or parentage of a young lady who was recently i believe a pupil of yoursa miss isobel de sorrens  the young lady is still in your charge i hear madame richard remarked quietly  notwithstanding my inspiration i was startled  how do you know that i asked  we despatched a messenger only yesterday to escort isobel back here madame richard answered your address was the destination given us  may i ask who gave it you at whose instigation you sent  at the instigation of those who have the right to consider themselves isobels guardians madame richard said quietly  isobels guardians i repeated softly but surely you know madame richardyou have heard of the tragedy which happened in london major delahaye died last week  we have been informed of the occurrence she answered her tone as perfectly emotionless as though she had been discussing the veriest trifle we were content to recognize major delahaye as representing those who have the right to dispose of isobels future his death however alters many things isobel will be placed in even surer hands  isobel has i presume then relatives living i remarked may i know their names  madame richard was silent for a moment she was regarding me steadily i even fancied that the ghost of a hard smile trembled upon her lips  i have no authority to disclose any information whatever she said  i bowed  i have no desire to seem inquisitive i said on the other hand i and my friends are greatly interested in the child i will be frank with you madame richard we have no claim upon her i know but we should certainly require to know something about the people into whose charge she was to pass before we gave her up  she is to come back here madame richard answered calmly we are ready to receive her she has lived with us for ten years i presume under the circumstances and when i add that it is the desire of those who are responsible for her that she should immediately return to us that you will not hesitate to send her  madame richard i answered gravely you who live so far from the world lose touch sometimes with its worst side we others to our sorrow know more though our experience is dearly enough bought let me tell you that i should hesitate at any time to give back the child into the care of those who sent her out into the world alone with such a man as major delahaye  madame richard touched the cross which hung upon her bosom her eyes it seemed to me narrowed a little  major delahaye she said was the nominee of those who have the right to dispose of the child  then i answered i shall require their right proven before isobel leaves us i do not wish to speak ill of the dead but i was present when major delahaye was shot and i am not sure that the bullet of his assassin did not prevent a worse crime the child was terrified to death it is my honest conviction that her fear was not uncalled for  madame richard raised her hand slightly  monsieur she said such matters are not our concern it is because of the passions and evil doing of the world outside that we cling so closely here to our own doctrine of isolation whatever she may have suffered isobel will learn to forget here in the blessed years which lie before her the memory of her unhappy pilgrimage will grow dim and faint it may even be for the best that she has realized for a moment the shadow of evil things  isobel is intended then i asked  for the church madame richard answered that is the present decision of those who have the right to decide for her we ourselves do not care to take pupils who have no idea at all of the novitiate occasionally we are disappointed and those in whom we have placed faith are tempted back into the world but we do our best while they are here to show them the better way we feared that we had lost isobel we shall be all the more happy to welcome her back  i shivered a little i could not help feeling the cold repression of the place a vision of thin greygowned figures with pallid faces and weary discontented eyes haunted me i tried to fancy isobel amongst them it was preposterous  madame i said i do not believe that isobel is adapted by nature or disposition for such a life  the desire for holiness madame richard answered is never very apparent in the young it is the childs great good fortune that she will grow into it  i am afraid i answered that our views upon this matter are too far apart to render discussion profitable you have spoken of those who have the right to dispose of the childs future i will go and see them  it is not necessary madame richard answered we will send to england for the child  do i understand madame richard i said that you decline to give me the address of those who stand behind you in the disposal of isobel  they would not discuss the matter with you she answered calmly their decision is already made isobel is for the church  i took up my hat  i will not detain you any further madame i said  a messenger is already in london to bring back the child she remarked  as to that i answered it is perhaps better to be frank with you madame richard your messenger will return alone  for the first time the womans face showed some signs of feeling her dark eyebrows contracted a little her expression was coldly repellent  you have no claim upon the child she said  neither do i know of any other person who has i answered  we have had the charge of her for ten years that itself is a claim it is unseemly that she should remain with you  madame i answered isobel is meant for lifenot a living death  the woman crossed herself  there is but one life she said we wish to prepare isobel for it  madame i said as to that argument between us is impossible i shall consult with my friends your messenger shall bring back word as to our decision  the face of the woman grew darker  but surely she protested you will not dare to keep the child  madame i answered humanity makes sometimes strange claims upon us isobel is as yet a child she came into my keeping by the strangest of chances i did not seek the charge of her it was to tell the truth an embarrassment to me yet she is under my care today and i shall do what i believe to be the right thing  monsieur she said you are interfering in matters greater than you have any knowledge of  it is in your power i reminded her to enlighten me  it is not a power which i am able to use she answered  then i will not detain you further madame i said  as i passed out she leaned over towards me she had already rung a bell and outside i could hear the shuffling footsteps of the old servant who had admitted me  monsieur she said if you keep the child you make enemiesvery powerful enemies it is long since i lived in the world but i think that the times have not changed very much of the childs parentage i may not tell you but as i hope for salvation i will tell you this it will be better for you and better for the child that she comes back here even to embrace what you have called the living death  madame i said i will consider all these things  it will be well for you to do so monsieur she said with meaning an enemy of those in whose name i have spoken must needs be a holy man for he lives hand in hand with death     chapter x   so i was driven back to argueil the redtiled sleepy old town with its great gaunt church whose windows as the lumbering cart descended the hill were stained bloodred by the dying sunset behind on the hillside was the convent with its avenue of stunted elms its closebarred windows its terrible prisonlike silence as i looked behind holding on to the sides of the springless cart to avoid being jostled into the road i found myself shivering the convent boardingschools which i had heard of had been very different sort of places even after my brief visit there this return into the fresh country air the smell of the fields the colour and life of the rolling landscape were blessed things i was more than ever satisfied with my decision it was not possible to send the child back to such a place  across a great vineyard plain through which the narrow white road ran like a tightly drawn band of ribbon i came presently to the village of argueil the street which led to the inn was paved with the most abominable cobbles and i was forced to hold my hat with one hand and the side of the cart with the other my bluesmocked driver pulled up with a flourish in front of the ancient gateway of the leon dor and i was very nearly precipitated on to the top of the broadbacked horse as i gathered myself together i was conscious of a soft peal of laughtera womans laughter which came from the arched entrance to the inn i looked up quickly a too familiar figure was standing there watching melady delahaye trim elegant a trifle supercilious by her side stood the innkeeper whiteaproned and obsequious  i clambered down on to the pavement and lady delahaye advanced a little way to meet me she held out a delicately gloved hand and smiled  you must forgive my laughing arnold she said really you looked too funny in that terrible cart what an odd meeting isnt it have you a few minutes to spare  i believe i answered that i cannot get away from this place till the evening shall we go in and sit down  she shook her head  the innparlour is too stuffy she answered i was obliged to come out myself for some fresh air let us walk up the street  i paid for my conveyance and we strolled along the broad sidewalk lady delahaye seemed inclined to thrust the onus of commencing our conversation upon me  i presume i said that we are here with the same object  she glanced at me curiously  indeed she remarked then tell me why you came  to discover that childs parentage if possible i answered promptly i want to discover who her friends are who really has the right to take charge of her  you perplex me arnold she said thoughtfully i do not understand your position in the matter i always looked upon you as a somewhat indolent person yet i find you now taking any amount of trouble in a matter which really does not concern you at all whence all this goodnature  lady delahaye  eileen she interrupted softly  lady delahaye i answered firmly you must forgive me if i remind you that i have no longer the right to call you by any other name i am not goodnatured and i am afraid that i am still indolent nevertheless i am interested in this child and i intend to do my utmost to prevent her returning to this place  i am still in the dark she said looking at me curiously she is nothing to you a more unsuitable home for her than with three young men i cannot imagine you seem to want to keep her there why she is a child today it is truebut in little more than a years time she will be a woman the position then for you will be full of embarrassments  i find the position now i answered equally embarrassing we can only give the child up to you send her back to the convent or keep her ourselves of the three we prefer to keep her  you seem to have a great distaste for the convent she remarked but that is because you are not a catholic and you do not understand these things she would at least be safe there and in time i think happy  we were at the head of the village street now upon a slight eminence i pointed backwards to the prisonlike building standing grim and desolate on the bare hillside  i should consider myself no less a murderer than the man who shot your husband i answered if i sent her there i have made all the enquiries i could in the neighbourhood and i have added to them my own impressions the secular part of the place may be conducted as other places of its sort but the great object of madame richards sister is to pass her pupils from that into the religious portion isobel is not adapted for such a life  lady delahaye shrugged her shoulders  well she said i am a catholic so of course i dont agree with you but why do you hesitate to give the child up to me  i was silent for a moment it was not easy to put my feeling into words  lady delahaye i said you must forgive my reminding you that on the occasion of your visit to us you did not attempt to conceal the fact that your feelings towards her were inimical beyond that i was pledged not to hand her back into your husbands care and  pledged by whom she asked quickly  i am afraid i said that i cannot answer you that question  she flashed an angry glance upon me  you pretend that the man who called himself grooten was not your friend yet you have been in communication with him since  i saw mr grooten for the first time in my life on the morning of that day i answered  you know where he is now she asked watching me keenly  i have not the slightest idea i wish that i did know i declared truthfully there is no man whom i am more anxious to see  you would of course inform the police she asked  i am afraid not i answered  again she was angry this time scarcely without reason  your sympathies in short are with the murderer rather than with his victimthe man who was shot without warning in the back it accords i presume with your idea of fair play  lady delahaye i said the subject is unpleasant and futile let us return to the inn  she turned abruptly around she made a little motion as of dismissal but i remained by her side  bythebye i said we were to exchange confidences you are here of course to visit the convent why  she smiled enigmatically  i am not sure my very simple conspirator she said whether i will imitate your frankness you see you have blundered into a somewhat more important matter than you have any idea of but i will tell you this if you like you may call that place a prison or any hard names you pleaseyet it is destined to be isobels home not only that but it is her only chance i am putting you on your guard you see but i do not think that it matters you are fighting against hopeless odds and if by any chance you should succeed your success would be the most terrible thing which could happen to isobel  i walked by her side for a moment in silence there was in her words and tone some underlying note of fear some suggestion of hidden danger which brought back to my mind at once the farewell speech of madame richard there was something ominous too in her presence here  lady delahaye i said as lightly as possible you have told me a great deal and less than nothing at all yet i gather that you know more about the child and her history than you have led me to suppose  yes she admitted that is perhaps true  why not let me share your knowledge i suggested boldly  you carry candour she remarked smiling to absurdity we are on opposite sides ah how delicious this is  we were regaining the centre of the little town by a footpath which for some distance had followed the river and now turning almost at right angles skirted a cherry orchard in late blossom the perfume of the pink and white buds swaying slightly in the breeze came to us botha waft of delicate and poignant freshness lady delahaye stood still and half closed her eyes  how perfectly delicious she murmured arnmr greatson do get me just the tiniest piece i cant quite reach  i broke off a small branch and she thrust it into the bosom of her dress the orchard was gay with bees and a few early butterflies blue and white and orange coloured in the porch of a redtiled cottage a few yards away a girl was singing suddenly i stopped and pointed  look  an avenue with a gate at the end led through the orchard and under the drooping boughs we caught a glimpse of the convent away on the hillside greyer and more stern than ever it seemed through the delicate framework of soft green foliage and blossoms  lady delahaye i said you are yourself a young woman could you bear to think of banishing from your life for ever all the colour and the sweet places all the joy of living would you be content to build for yourself a tomb to commit yourself to a living death  she answered me instantly almost impulsively  there is all the difference in the world she declared i am a woman although i am not old i know what life is i know what it would be to give it up but the childshe knows nothing she is too young to know what lies before her as yet her eyes are not opened very soon she would be content there  i shook my head i did not agree with lady delahaye  indeed no i protested you reckon nothing for disposition in her heart the song of life is already formed the joy of it is already stirring in her blood the convent would be slow torture to her she shall not go there  lady delahaye smiledmirthlessly yet as one who has some hidden knowledge which she may not share  you think yourself her friend she said in reality you are her enemy if not the convent then worse may befall her  i shrugged my shoulders  as to that i said we shall see  we resumed our walk again we were nearing the inn lady delahaye looked at me every now and then curiously my feeling towards her had grown more and more belligerent  you puzzle me arnold she said softly after all isobel is but a child what cunning tune can she have played upon your heartstrings that you should espouse her cause with so much fervour if she were a few years older one could perhaps understand  i disregarded her innuendo  lady delahaye i said if you were as much her friend as i believe that i am you would not hesitate to tell me all that you know i have no other wish than to see her safe and amongst her friends but i will give her up to no one whom i believe to be her enemy  arnold she answered gravely i can only repeat what i have told you before you are interfering in greater concerns than you know of even if i would i dare not give you any information the fate of this child insignificant in herself though she is is bound up with very important issues  our eyes met for a moment the expression in hers puzzled mepuzzled me to such an extent that i made her no answer slowly she extended her hand  at least she said let us part friendsunless you choose to be gallant and wait here for me until tomorrow it is a dreary journey home alone  i took her hand readily enough  friends by all means i answered but i must get back to paris tonight a messenger from madame richard is already waiting for me in london  she withdrew her hand quickly and turned away  it must be as you will of course she said coldly i do not wish to detain you  nevertheless her farewell look haunted me as i sped across the great fertile plain on my way to paris     chapter xi   mabane laid down his brush arthur sprang from his seat upon the table and greeted me with a shout isobel said nothing but her dark blue eyes were fastened upon my face as though seeking to read her fate there they had evidently been waiting for my coming i remember thinking it strange even then that these other two men should apparently share to the fullest degree my own interest in the childs fate  i have failed i announced shortly  i took isobels hand it was cold as ice and i could feel that she was trembling violently  madame richard would tell me nothing isobel i said i believe that she knows all about you and i believe that lady delahaye does too but they will tell me nothing  and she demanded with quivering lips and  it is for you to decide i said gravely lady delahaye wants you so does madame richard on the other hand if you like to stay with us until someone proves their right to take you away you will be very welcome isobel stop one moment i added hastily for i saw the quick colour stream into her cheeks and the impetuous words already trembling upon her lips i want you to remember this madame richard makes no secret of her own wishes as regards your future she desires you to take the veil you have lived at the convent so i presume you are able to judge for yourself as regards that lady delahaye on the other hand is a rich woman and she professes to be your friend your life with her if she chose to make it so would be an easy and a pleasant one we as you know are poor we have very little indeed to offer you we live what most people call a shiftless life we have money one day and none the next our surroundings and our associations are not in the least like what a child of your age should become accustomed to nine people out of ten would probably pronounce us utterly unsuitable guardians for you it is only right that you should understand these things  she looked at me with tearbedimmed eyes  i want to stay with you she pleaded dont send me awayoh dont i hate the convent and i am afraid of lady delahaye i will do everything i can not to be a nuisance to you i am not afraid to work or to help mrs burdett only let me stay  i smiled and looked around at the others  it is settled i declared we appoint ourselves your guardians you agree mabane  most heartily he answered  and you arthur  great heavens yes he answered vehemently  you are very good she murmured very good to me all my life i shall remember this  she held out both her hands her eyes were fixed still upon mine mabane laid his hand upon her shoulder  dear child he said do not forget that there are three of us i too am very happy to be one of your guardians  she gave him the hand which arthur had seized upon i think that we had none of us before seen a smile so dazzling as hers  dear friends she murmured i only hope that you will never regret this great great kindness  then suddenly she flitted away and went to her room we three men were left alone  i think that for the first few moments there was some slight awkwardness for we were men and we spoke seldom of the things which touched us most arthur however broke almost immediately into speech and relieved the tension  and to think that it was i he exclaimed who sent you out plot hunting to the station arnold what a sensible chap you are  we all laughed  a good many people mabane remarked quietly would call us three fools tell us arnold did you really discover nothing  absolutely nothing i declared stop though i did find out this there is some secret about the childs parentage i have spoken with two people who know it and one of them warned me that in keeping the child we were interfering in a greater matter than we had any idea of of course it might have been a bluff but i fancy that lady delahaye was in earnest  you do not think mabane asked that she was major delahayes daughter  i do not i answered with a little shudder i am sure that she was not  whoever she is arthur declared theres one thing jolly certain and that is shes thoroughbred she has the most marvellous nerve i ever knew we got in a tight corner this morning i took her down to guildford in a trailer and i had to jump the pavement to avoid a runaway she never flinched for a moment half the girls i know would have squealed like mad she only laughed and asked whether she should get out shes as thoroughbred as they make them  perhaps i answered but im not going to have you risk her life with your beastly motoring arthur take her out in a car if you want to whos this  we turned towards the door was it the ghost of madame richard who stood there pale cold and in the sombre garb of her sisterhood  this lady has been before mabane said placing a chair for her she has come from the convent and she brought a letter from madame richard  you are mr greatson she asked  i bowed and took the letter which she handed to me i tore it open it contained a few lines only       sir       i have been informed of the unfortunate event which has placed      under your protection one of my late pupils isobel de sorrens we      are willing and anxious to receive her back here and i have sent      the bearer to accompany her upon the journey she will also defray      what expenses her sojourn with you may have occasioned       i am sir yours respectfully       emily richard  i put the letter back in the envelope and laid it upon the table  i have seen madame richard i said the child will remain with us for the present  the cold dark eyes met mine searchingly  but monsieur the woman said how can that be you are not a relative you surely have no claim  it will save time perhaps i interrupted if i explain that i have discussed all these matters with madame richard and the decision which i have come to is final the child remains here  the woman looked at me steadfastly  madame richard will not be satisfied with that decision she said you will be forced to give her up  and why i asked should a penniless orphan as i understand isobel is be of so much interest to madame richard  the woman watched me still and listened to my words as though seeking to discover in them some hidden meaning then she leaned a little towards me  can i speak with you alone monsieur she said  these are my friends i answered from whom i have no secrets  none  none i repeated  she hesitated then although the door was fast closed she dropped her voice  you knowwho the child is she said softly  upon my word i do not i answered i saw the man under whose care she was shot and i brought her here because she was friendless i know no more about her  that she said quietly is hard to believe  i have no interest in your belief or disbelief i answered pardon me if i add madame that i have no interest in the continuation of this conversation  she rose at once  you are either a very brave man she said or a very simple one i shall await further instructions from madame richard  she departed silently and without any leavetaking we all three looked at one another  now what in thunder did she mean by that arthur exclaimed blankly  it appears to me mabane said that you went plot hunting with a vengeance arnold  arthur was walking restlessly up and down the room his hands in his pockets a discontented frown upon his smooth young face he stopped suddenly in front of us  i dont know much about the law you fellows he said but it seems to me that any of these people who seem to want to take isobel away from us have only to go before the court and establish some sort of a legal claim and we should have to give her up  that is true enough i admitted the strange part of it is though that no one seems inclined to take this course  arthur threw down a letter upon the table  this came for you yesterday arnold he said i havent opened it of course but you can see from the name at the back of the envelope that it is from a firm of solicitors  i took it up and opened it at once i knew quite well what arthur feared this is what i read       17 lincolns inn london       dear sir       we beg to inform you that we have been instructed by a client who      desires to remain anonymous to open for you at the london and      westminster bank an account on your behalf as guardian of miss      isobel de sorrens a young lady who we understand is at present      in your care       the amount placed at our disposal is three hundred a year we      shall be happy to furnish you with cheque book and full authority      to make use of this sum if you will favour us with a call      accompanied by the young lady but we are not in a position to      afford you any information whatever as to our clients identity       trusting to have the pleasure of seeing you shortly       we are yours truly       hamilton  place  i laid the letter on the table without a word mabane and arthur in turn read it then there was an ominous silence i think that we all had the same thought it was arthur however who expressed it  what beastly rot he exclaimed  i turned to mabane  i imagine he said that we should not be justified in refusing this offer at the same time if anyone has the right to provide for the child why do they not come forward and claim her  at that moment isobel came in i took up the letter and placed it in her hand  isobel i said we want you to read this  she read it and handed it back to me without a word we were all watching her eagerly she looked at me appealingly  is it necessary she asked for me to accept this money  tell us i said exactly how you feel  i think she said that if there is anyone from whom i have the right to accept all this money i ought to know who they are i do not want to be a burden upon anyone she added hesitatingly but i would rather work every moment of the dayoh i think that i would rather starve than touch this money unless i know who it is that offers it  i laughed as i tore the letter in half  dear child i said resting my hand upon her shoulder that is what we all hoped that you would say     chapter xii   lady delahaye sank down upon the couch against which i had been standing  poor bored man she exclaimed with mock sympathy i ought to have asked some entertaining people oughtnt i there isnt a soul here for you to talk to  on the contrary i answered there are a good many more people here than i expected to see i understood that you were to be alone  and you probably think that i ought to be she remarked well i never was conventional you know that i shut myself up for a month now i expect my friends to come and console me  it is not likely i said that you will be disappointed  she shrugged her shoulders  perhaps not those whom i do not want will come of course as for the otherswell  she looked up at me i sat down by her side  ah that is nice of you she said softly i wanted to have a quiet talk tell me why you are looking so glum  i was not conscious of it i answered to tell you the truth i was wondering whether isobel were not a little young to bring to a gathering of this description  my dear arnold she murmured there are only one or two of my particular friends here the rest dropped in by accident isobel does not seem to me to be particularly out of place and she is certainly enjoying herself  the echoes of her light laugh reached us just then several men were standing over her chair she was the centre of what seemed to be a very amusing conversation arthur was standing on the outskirts of the group apparently a little dull  she enjoys herself always i answered she is of that disposition still  she put her hands up to her ears  come i wont be lectured she exclaimed seriously i wanted you here i had something to say to yousomething particular  waiving the other matter then i said i am wholly at your service  i may be prolix she said quietly forgive me if i am but i want you to understand me i am beginning to see that i have adopted a wrong position with regard to a certain matter which we have discussed at your rooms and at argueil i want to reopen the subject from an entirely different point of view  you mean i said the subject of isobel  of course the first time i came to see you lady delahaye said looking up at me with penitence in her blue eyes i was horrid i am very very sorry i did not know then who isobel was and i was angry with everyonewith poor will with the child herself and with you you must forgive me i was very much upset  i will never think of it again i promised her  then again at argueil she continued i adopted a wrong tone altogether yours was the more natural the more human point of view there are certain very grave reasons why the child would be very much better out of the world a life of seclusion would i believe in the end when she is able to understand be the happiest for her and yetshe ought to have her chance  i am glad that you admit that i murmured  now i am going to ask you something she went on you will not be angry with me i am sure do you think that a girl of isobels age and appearance is in her proper place in bachelor quarters living with three young men  i do not i admitted i look upon it as a most regrettable necessity still you must not make it sound worse than it is we have a housekeeper who is the very essence of respectability and isobel is under her care  i want to make it no longer a necessity lady delahaye said smiling i want to relieve you and your conscience at the same time of a very awkward incubus listen this is what i propose let isobel come to me for a year i shall treat her as my own daughter she will have plenty of amusement there are the theatres and no end of scratch entertainments where one can take a girl of her age who is too young for society she will mix with young people of her own age she will have every advantage which to speak frankly must be denied to her in her present position at the end of that year i shall tell her her history it is a sad and a miserable one you may as well know that now she can then take her choice of the convent or any other mode of life which between us we can make possible for her and i am very much inclined to believe arnold that she will choose the convent  is there any real reason lady delahaye i asked why you should not tell me now what you propose to tell isobel in a years time there have been so many mysterious circumstances in connection with this affair that it is hard to come to any decision when one is ignorant of so much  there are reasonsgrave reasonswhy i can tell you nothing she answered indeed i would like to arnold she continued earnestly but my position is a very difficult one i think that you might trust me a little  i am sure that you wish to do what is best i said a little awkwardly but you must see that my position also is a little difficult i too am under a promise  her eyes flashed indignantly  to the man who killed my husband the man whom you are shielding she exclaimed indignantly i think that you might at least have the grace to leave him out of the conversation  i have never introduced him i answered i do not wish to do so as to shielding him i have not the slightest idea as to his whereabouts be reasonable lady delahaye i  reasonable she interrupted that is what i want you to be ask yourself a plain question which is the more fitting place for hermy house or your chambers  she pointed to isobel who was leaning back in her chair laughing heartily into the face of a young man who was bending over her by chance she looked just then older even than her years and arthurs glum figure too in the background was suggestive  your house without a doubt i answered gravely if it is the house of a friend  her satin slipper beat the ground impatiently she looked at me with a frown upon her face  do you believe then she asked that i am her enemy does my offer sound like it  indeed no i answered rising i am going to give isobel herself a chance of accepting or declining it  i crossed the room isobel seeing me come rose at once  is it time for us to go she asked  not quite i answered go and talk to lady delahaye for a few minutes she has something to say to you  isobel made a little grimace so slight that only i could notice it and took my place upon the sofa i talked for a few minutes with some of the men whom i knew and then arthur touched me on the arm  cant we go arnold he exclaimed a little peevishly ive never been so bored in all my life  we must wait for a few minutes i answered isobel is talking to lady delahaye  i dont know a soul here and im dying for a cigarette  i pointed through the curtain to the anteroom adjoining  you can smoke in there i remarked ill introduce you to miss ernston if you like the girl who drives the big panhard in the park i heard her say that she was going in there to get one of lady delahayes russian cigarettes  arthur shook his head he was covertly watching isobel sitting on the sofa  ill go in and have the cigarette he said but arnold theres no fresh move on is there youre looking pretty glum  i shook my head  no there is nothing exactly fresh i answered come along and smoke will you i want lady delahaye and isobel to have their talk out  he followed me reluctantly into the smaller of lady delahayes receptionrooms where we smoked for a few minutes in silence then mabel ernston stopped to speak to me for a moment and i introduced arthur i left them talking motors and stepped back into the other room isobel had already risen to her feet and lady delahaye was looking at her curiously as though uncertain how far she had been successful she saw me enter and beckoned me to approach  i think that isobel is tired she said in a tone which was meant to be kind she has promised to come and see me again  isobel looked at me her mouth which a few minutes before had been curved with smiles was straight now and resolutely set she was distinctly paler and her manner seemed to have acquired a new gravity i must confess that my first impulse was one of relief isobel had not found lady delahayes offer then so wonderfully attractive  do you mind coming home now arnold she asked i did not know that it was so late  i saw lady delahayes face darken at her simple use of my christian name and the touch of her fingers upon my arm arthur heard our voices and came to us at once so we took leave of our hostess and turned homewards  for a long time we walked almost in silence then isobel turned towards me with a new gravity in her face and an unusual hesitation in her tone  arnold she said lady delahaye has been pointing out to me one or two things which i had not thought of before i suppose she meant to be kind i suppose it is right that i should know but her voice trembledi wish she had not told me  lady delahaye is an interfering old cat arthur exclaimed viciously dont take any notice of her isobel  but i must know she answered whether the things which she said were true  they were probably exaggerations i said cheerfully but let us hear them at any rate  she said isobel continued looking steadily in front of her that you were all three very poor indeed and that i had no right to come and live with you and make you poorer still when i had a home offered me elsewhere she said that i should disturb your whole life that you would have to give up many things which were a pleasure to you and you would not be able to succeed so well with your work as you would have to write altogether for money and she said that i should be grown up soon and ought to live where there are women and when i told her about mrs burdett she laughed unpleasantly and said that she did not count at all and that is whyshe wants meto go there  again the shadow of tragedy gleamed in the childs white face her face was strained her eyes had lost the deep softness of their colouring and there lurked once more in their depths the terror of nameless things to me the sight of her like this was so piteous that i wasted not a moment in endeavouring to reassure her  rubbish i exclaimed cheerfully sheer and unadulterated rubbish we are not rich isobel but the trifle the care of you will cost us amounts to nothing at all we are willing and able to take charge of you as well as we can you know that  ah she drew a long sigh of relief it was wonderful how her face changed  but why is lady delahaye so cruelwhy is she so anxious that i should not stay with you she said  i laughed  lady delahaye is mysterious i answered i have come to the conclusion isobel that you must be a princess in disguise and that lady delahaye wants to claim all the rewards for having taken charge of you  dont be silly she laughed princesses are not brought up at madame richards without relations or friends to visit them and no pocket money  nevertheless i answered when i consider the number of people who are interested in you and lady delahayes extraordinary persistence i am inclined to stick to my theory we shall look upon you isobel as an investment and some day you shall reward us all  her hand slipped into mine her eyes were soft enough now  dear friend she murmured i think that it is my heart only which will reward youmy great great gratitude i am afraid of lady delahaye arnold there are things in her eyes when she looks at me which make me shiver do not let us go there again please  arthur broke in impetuously  you shall go nowhere you dont want to isobel arnold and i will see to that  andabout the other thingshe mentioned isobel began  she was right and wrong i answered of course it would be better for you if one of us had a sister or a mother living with us but mrs burdett has always seemed to us like a mother and i thinkthat it will be all right i concluded a little lamely we need not worry about that at present at any rate come weve had a dull afternoon and i sold a story yesterday lets go to fasolas and have a halfcrown dinner  im on arthur declared well go and fetch allan  you dear isobel exclaimed i shall wear my new hat     book ii     chapter i   i have no doubt mabane said gloomily that arthur is right he ought to know more about it than old fogies like you and me arnold we had the money and we ought to have insisted upon it you gave way far too easily  thats all very well i protested but i dont take in a womans fashion paper and isobel assured us that the hat was all right she looks well enough in it surely  isobel looks ripping arthur declared but then she looks ripping in anything all the same the hats oldfashioned you look at the hats those girls are wearing whove just come inflat bunchy things with flowers under the brim thats the style just now  isobel shall have one then i declared we will take her west tomorrow we can afford it very well  she came up to us beaming she was a year older and her skirts were a foot longer her figure was perhaps a shade more developed and her manner a little more assured in other respects she was unchanged  what are you two old dears worrying about she exclaimed lightly you have the air of conspirators no secrets from me please what is it all about  we are lamenting the antiquity of your hat mabane answered gravely arthur assures us that it is out of date it ought to be flat and bunchy and it isnt  geese she exclaimed lightly both of you arthur im ashamed of you you may know something about motors but you are very ignorant indeed about hats come along all of you and gaze at my miniatures i am longing to see how they look framed  as regards the hat i began  i will not hear anything more about it she interrupted laughing of course if you dont like to be seen with meoh why look look  we had stopped before a case of miniatures in the front row were two somewhat larger than the others and isobels first serious attempts behind each was stuck a little ivory board bearing the magic word sold  sold arthur exclaimed incredulously  it may be a mistake i said slowly  mabane and i exchanged glances we knew very well that though the miniatures showed promise of talent they were amateurish and imperfect and the reserve which we had placed upon them was quite out of all proportion to their merit it must surely be a mistake we followed isobel across the room a little elderly gentleman was sitting before a desk engaged in the leisurely contemplation of a small open ledger isobel had halted in front of him there was a delicate flush of pink on her cheeks and her eyes were brilliant  are my miniatures sold please she exclaimed my name is miss de sorrens they have a small ivory board just behind them which says sold  the elderly gentleman looked up and surveyed her calmly over the top of his spectacles  what did you say that your name was madam and the number of your miniatures he enquired  miss isobel de sorrens she answered breathlessly and my miniatures are number two hundred and seven and eighta portrait of an elderly lady and two hundred and eightyninea child  the little old gentleman turned over the pages of his ledger in very leisurely fashion and consulted a recent entry  your miniatures are sold miss de sorrens he said for the reserve price placed upon themtwenty guineas each the money will be paid to you on the close of the exhibition according to our usual custom  please tell me who bought them she begged i want to be quite sure that there is no mistake  there is certainly no mistake he answered smiling the first one was bought bylet me seea nobleman in the suite of the archduchess of bristlaw the baron von leibingen i believe that her highness is proposing to visit the exhibition this afternoon the other purchaser paid cash but refused his name ah excuse me  he rose hastily and moved towards the door a little group of people were entering before whom the bystanders gave way with all that respect which the british public invariably displays for royalty isobel watched them with frank and eager interest mabane and i moved over to her side  is it true i asked her  he says so she answered still a little bewildered arnold can you imagine it forty guineas ii  there followed an amazing interlude the little party of newcomers before whom everyone was obsequiously giving way came face to face with us mabane and i stepped back at once but isobel remained motionless an extraordinary change had come over her her eyes seemed fastened upon the woman who was the central figure of the little procession and the girl who walked by her side someone whispered to her to move back she took no notice she seemed as though she had not heard royalty raised its lorgnettes and dropped them with a crash upon the polished wood floor then those who were quick to understand knew that something lay beneath this unusual awkwardness  the manager of the gallery who catalogue in hand had been prepared personally to conduct the royal party round looked about him wondering as to the cause of the contretemps his eyes fell upon isobel  please step back he whispered to her angrily dont you see that the princess is here and the archduchess of bristlaw clear the way please  the manager was a small man and isobels eyes travelled over his head she did not seem to hear him speak the archduchess recovered herself she took the shattered lorgnettes from the hand of her ladyinwaiting she pointed to isobel  who is this young person she asked calmly does she wish to speak to me  a wave of colour swept into isobels cheeks she drew back at once  i beg your pardon madame she said but even when she had rejoined my side her eyes remained fixed upon the face of the archduchess and her companion  there was a general movement forward one of the ladies in the suite however lingered behind our eyes met and lady delahaye held out her hand  your ward is growing she murmured in inches if not in manners when are you going to engage a chaperon for her  when i think it necessary lady delahaye i answered with a bow  you artists havesuch strange ideas she remarked smiling up at me you wish isobel to remain a child of nature perhaps yet you must admit that a few lessons in deportment would be of advantage  to the archduchess apparently i answered one does not often see a great lady so embarrassed  lady delahaye shrugged her shoulders she dropped her voice a little  are we never to meet without quarrelling arnold she whispered looking up into my eyes it used not to be like this  lady delahaye i said it is not my fault we seem to have taken opposite sides in a game which i for one do not understand twice during the last six months you have made attempts which can scarcely be called honourable to take isobel from us our rooms are continually watched we dare not let the child go out alone now this woman from madame richards has come to live in the same building she too watches  it is only the beginning arnold she said quietly i told you more than a year ago that you were interfering in graver concerns than you imagined why dont you be wise and let the child go the care of her will bring nothing but trouble upon you  her words struck home more surely than she imagined for in my heart had lain dormant for months the fear of what was to come the shadow which was already creeping over our lives nevertheless i answered her lightly  you know my obstinacy of old lady delahaye i said we are wasting words i think  she shrugged her shoulders and passed on mabane touched me on the shoulder  isobel would like to go he said arthur and she are at the door already  i turned to leave the place we were already in the passage which led into bond street when i felt myself touched upon the shoulder a tall fair young man with his hair brushed back and very blue eyes who had been in the suite of the archduchess addressed me  pardon me he said but you are mr arnold greatson i believe  i acknowledged the fact  the archduchess of bristlaw begs that you will spare her a moment she will not detain you longer  i turned to mabane  take isobel home i said i will follow presently  we reentered the gallery the majority of the royal party were busy examining the miniatures the archduchess was talking earnestly to lady delahaye in a remote corner my guide led me directly to her  her highness permits me to present you he said to me this is mr arnold greatson your highness  the archduchess acknowledged my bow graciously  you are the mr arnold greatson who writes such charming stories she said yes it is so is it not  your highness is very kind i answered  i learn she continued that you are also the guardian of the young lady who gave us all such a start pardon me but you surely seem a little young for such a post  the circumstances your highness i answered were a little exceptional  she nodded thoughtfully  yes yes so i have heard lady delahaye has been telling me the story i understand that you have never been able to discover the childs parentage that is very strange  there are other things in connection with my ward your highness i said which seem to me equally inexplicable  yes i am very interested will you tell me what they are  by all means i answered i refer to the fact that though no one has come forward openly to claim the child indirect efforts to induce her to leave us are continually being made by persons who seem to desire anonymity whenever she has been alone in the streets she has been accosted under various pretexts  the archduchess was politely surprised  but surely you are aware she remarked of the source of some at least of these attempts  madame richard i said the principal of the convent where isobel was educated seems particularly anxious to have her return there  the archduchess nodded her head slowly  well she said is that so much to be wondered at even we who are of the world might consideryou must pardon me mr greatson if i speak franklythe girls present position an undesirable one how do you suppose then that the principal of a convent boardingschool whose sister i believe is a nun would be likely to regard the same thing  your highness knows then of the convent i remarked  the archduchess lifted her eyebrows lightly her gesture seemed intended to convey to me the fact that she had not sent for me to answer my questions i remained unabashed however and waited for her reply several curious facts were beginning to group themselves together in my mind  i have heard of the place she said coldly i believe it to be an excellent institution i sent for you mr greatson not however to discuss such matters but solely to ask for information as to the childs parentage it seems that you are unable to give me this  lady delahaye knows as muchprobably morethan i i answered  it seemed to me that the archduchess and lady delahaye exchanged quick glances i affected however to have noticed nothing  i will be quite candid with you mr greatson the archduchess continued my interest in the girl arises of course from the wonderful likeness to my own daughter and to other members of my family your ward herself was obviously struck with it i must confess that i too received something of a shock  i think i answered that it was apparent to all of us  the archduchess coughed for a royal personage she seemed to find some little difficulty in proceeding  the history of our family is naturally a matter of common knowledge she said slowly any connection with it therefore which this child might be able to claim would be of that order which you as a man of the world would doubtless understand nevertheless i am sufficiently interested in her to be inclined to take any steps which might be necessary for her welfare i propose to set some enquiries on foot providing that the result of them be as i suspect i presume you would have no objection to relinquish the child to my protection  your highness i answered i could not answer such a question as that without consideration or without consulting isobel herself  the archduchess frowned upon me and i was at once made conscious that i had fallen under her displeasure i fancy however that i appeared as i felt quite unimpressed  i cannot understand any hesitation whatsoever upon your part mr greatson she said under my care the childs future would be fittingly provided for her position with you must be at the best an equivocal one  your highness i answered steadily my friends and i are handicapped perhaps by our sex but we have a housekeeper who is an old family servant and a model of respectability in all ways and at all times we have treated isobel as a very dear sister the position may seem an equivocal oneto a certain order of minds those who know us i may venture to say see nothing harmful to the child in our guardianship  the archduchess stared at me and i gathered that she was not used to anything save implicit obedience from those to whom she made suggestions she stared and then she laughed softly there was more than a spice of malice in her mirth  which of you three young men are going to fall in love with her she asked bluntly you call her a child but she is almost a woman and she is beautiful she will be very beautiful  your highness i answered coldly it is a matter which we have not as yet permitted ourselves to consider  the archduchess was displeased with me and she took no further pains to hide her displeasure  mr greatson she said with a little wave of dismissal for the present i have no more to say  she turned her back upon me and i at once left the gallery     chapter ii   i walked home with but one thought in my mind the archduchess had put into wordsvery plain blunt wordswhat as yet i had scarcely dared harbour in my mind as a fugitive idea she had done me in that respect good service she had brought to a sudden crisis an issue which it was folly any longer to evade i meant to speak now and have done with it i walked through the busy streets a dreaming man it was for the last time henceforth even the dream must pass  i found mabane and arthur alone for which i was sufficiently thankful there was no longer any excuse for delay mabane had taken possession of the easychair and was smoking his largest pipe arthur was walking restlessly up and down the room evidently they had been discussing between them the events of the afternoon for there was a sudden silence when i entered and they both waited eagerly for me to speak i closed the door carefully behind me and took a cigarette from the box on my desk  what did the archduchess want arthur asked bluntly  i will tell you all that she said presently i answered in effect it was the same as the others she too wanted isobel  shall we have to give her up arthur demanded  we will discuss that another time i said i am glad to find that you are both here there is another matter concerning which i think that we ought to come to an understanding as soon as possible it has been in my mind for a long while  about isobel arthur interrupted  about isobel i assented  they were both attentive mabanes expression was purely negative arthur on the other hand was distinctly nervous i think that from the first he had some idea what it was that i wanted to say  isobel when she came to us little more than a year ago i continued was a child we have always treated her and i believe thought of her as a child it was perhaps a daring experiment to have brought her here at all and yet i am inclined to think that under the circumstances it was the best thing for her and from another point of view an excellent thing for us  excellent why it has made all the difference in the world arthur declared vigorously  i see that you follow me i agreed her coming seems to have steadied us up all round the changes which we were obliged to make in our manner of living have all been for the better i am afraid that we were drifting allan and i at any rate into a somewhat objectless sort of existence and our work was beginning to show the signs of it the coming of isobel seems to have changed all that you allan know that you have never done better work in your life than during the last year your portrait of her was an inspiration some of those smaller studies show signs of a talent which i think has surprised everyone except arthur and myself who knew what you could do when you settled down to it i too have been more successful as you know i have done better work and more of it you agree with me so far allan  there is no doubt at all about it mabane said slowly there has been a different atmosphere about the place since the child came and we have thrived in it we are all better much the better for her coming  i am glad that you appreciate this allan i said this sort of thing is rather hard to put into words but i believe that you fellows understand exactly what i mean we have had to amuse her and in doing so we have developed simpler and better tastes for ourselves weve had to give up a lot of things and a lot of friends weve been much better without  its true every word of it arnold mabane admitted knocking out the ashes from his pipe weve chucked the musichalls for the theatres and our lazy slacking sundays with a night at the club afterwards for long wholesome days in the countryvery jolly days too were better men in our small way for the childs coming arnold you can take that for granted now go on with what you have to say i suppose this is all a prelude to something or other  even then i hesitated for my task was not an easy one and all the while arthur who maintained an uneasy silence was watching me furtively it was as though he knew from the first what it was that i was leading up to and i seemed to be conscious already of his passionate though unspoken resistance  it was a child i said at last whom we took into our lives today she is a woman  then arthur could keep silence no longer there was a pink flush in his cheeks which were still as smooth as a girls but the passion in his tone was the passion of a man  you are not thinking arnoldyou would not be so mad as to think of giving her up to any of these people he exclaimed they are her enemies all of them i am sure of it  i am coming to that presently i went on you know what happened this afternoon you saw the likeness the amazing likeness between isobel and that other girl the daughter of the archduchess the archduchess was herself very much impressed with it without a doubt she knows isobels history she went so far as to tell me that she believed isobel to be morganatically connected with her own family the house of waldenburg she offered to take her under her own protection  you did not consent arthur exclaimed  i neither consented nor absolutely refused i answered it was not a matter to be decided on the spur of the moment but the more i think of it the more i am puzzled madame richard wants isobel she was not satisfied with our refusal to give her up she sent that messenger of hers back with fresh offers and when again we refused the woman takes up her quarters here always spying upon us always accosting isobel on any excuse madame richard may be a very good woman but i have seen and spoken with her and i do not for one moment believe that her extraordinary persistence is for isobels sake alone then lady delahaye has never ceased from worrying us she has tried threats persuasions and entreaties she has tried by every means in her power to induce us to give up the child to her and now we have the archduchess to deal with and it seems to me that we are getting very near the heart of the matter the archduchess is a daughter of one of the royal houses of europe and major delahaye was once attaché at her fathers court then there is grooten the man who shot delahaye his interest in her is so strong that he risks his life and commits a crime to save her from a man whom he believes to be a source of danger to her he sends her money every quarter which as you know we have never touchedit stands in her name if ever she should require it grooten is a man into whose charge we could not possibly give her and yet of all these people he is the only one whom i would trustthe only one whom i feel instinctively means well by her madame richard wants her lady delahaye wants her and behind them both there is the archduchess who also wants her i have thought this matter over and so far as i am concerned i have decided  not to give her up to any of them arthur exclaimed sharply  to give her up to no one who is not prepared to go into court and establish a legal claim i continued it is very simple and i think very reasonable when she leaves us it shall be to take up an accredited and definite station in life the time may come at any moment we must always be prepared for it but until it does we will not even parley any longer with these people who come to us and hint at mysterious things  arthur wrung my hand he was apparently much relieved and he did not know what was coming  arnold you are a brick he exclaimed thats sound commonsenseevery word youve uttered let them prove their claim to her  i agree with every word you have spoken allan said quietly in response to a look from me the child is at least safe with us and she is not wasting her time she has talent and she has application i for my part shall be very sorry indeed when the time comes as i suppose it will come some day for her to go  then i mustered up my courage and said that which i had known from the first would be difficult  there is one thing more i said and i want to say it to you now it may seem to you both unnecessary perhaps it is still it is better that we should come to an understanding about it a year has passed since isobel the child came to us today she is a woman if we still keep her with us there must be a bond a covenant between us and our honour must stand pledged to keep it i think that you both know very well what i mean i hope that you will both agree with me  i paused for a moment but i received no encouragement from either of them they were both silent and arthurs eyes were questioning mine fiercely i addressed myself more particularly to him  allan and i are elderly persons compared with you arthur i said but we might still be described at a stretch as young men if we decide to remain isobels guardians there is a further and a deeper duty devolving upon us than the obvious one of treating her with all respect it is possible that she might come to feel a preference for one of usa sense of gratitude the natural sentiment of her coming womanhood even the fact of continual propinquity might encourage it isobel is charming she will be beautiful the position if any one of us relaxed in the slightest degree might become critical you must understand what i mean i am sure even if i am not expressing it very clearly isobel sees few if any other men it is possible it is almost certain that she belongs to a class whose position and ideas are far removed from ours there must be no sentimental relations established between her and any one of us we are her brothers she is our sister so it must remain while she is under our charge this must be agreed upon between us  there was a dead almost an ominous silence mabane was standing with his arms folded and his face turned a little away i appealed first to him  allan i said you agree with me  absolutely he answered i agree with every word you have said  i turned to arthur  and you arthur  he did not at once reply the colour was coming and going in his cheeks and he was playing nervously with his watchchain when he raised his eyes to mine the slight belligerency of his earlier manner was more clearly defined  i think he said that there is another side to the question isobel is the sort of girl whom fellows are bound to notice besides being so jolly goodlooking she is such ripping good form and that sort of thing what you are proposing arnold is simply that we should stand on one side altogether and leave isobel for any other fellow who happens to come along  it scarcely amounts to that i answered no other man is likely to see much of her while she is under our care afterwards of course the conditions are different our covenant the covenant to which i am asking you to agree comes to an end when she leaves us  you see arthur protested it is a little different isnt it for you fellows not that im comparing myself with you of course in any sort of way youre both heaps cleverer than i am and all that but isobel and i are nearer the same age and weve been about together such a lot motoring and all that and had such good times you understand what i mean dont you of course that sort of thing that sort of thingyou know brings a fellow and a girl together so liking the same things and being about the same age it isnt quite like that with you two is it now  again there was silence mabane had withdrawn his pipe from his mouth and was looking steadfastly into the bowl as for me i found it wholly impossible to analyse my sensations all the time arthur was looking eagerly from one to the other of us i recovered myself with an effort and answered him  we will not dispute the position with you arthur i said quietly we will admit all that you say we will admit therefore that by all natural laws you are the one on whom the burden of keeping this covenant must fall most heavily that fact may make it a little harder for you than for us but it does not alter the position in any way there must be no attempt at sentiment between isobel and any one of us if by any chance the opening should come from her it must be ignored and discouraged  i cant for the life of me see why arthur declared and iwell its no use beating about the bush isobel is the only girl in the world i could ever look at i am fond of her i cant help it i love her there  mabane mercifully took up the burden of speech  have you said anything to her he asked  no  not a word  not a word arthur declared she is too young she has not begun to think about those things yet but she is wonderful and i love her it is all very well for you two he continued earnestly you are both over thirty and confirmed bachelors im only just twentyfour and ive never cared for a girl a snap of the fingers yet i dont care any more about knocking about of course ive done a bit at it like everyone else but isobel has knocked all that out of me i should be quite content to settle down tomorrow  i tried to put myself in his place to enter for a moment into his point of view yet i am afraid that i must have seemed very unsympathetic  arthur i said i am sorry for you but it wont do i fancy that before long she will be removed from us altogether for her sake and the sake of our own honour no word of what you have told us must pass your lips unless you can promise that  i hesitated arthur had risen to his feet the colour had mounted to his temples his eyes were bright with anger  i will not promise it he declared i love isobel and very soon i mean to tell her so  then it must be under another roof i answered if you will not promise to keep absolutely silent until we at least know exactly what her parentage is you must leave us  arthur took up his hat  very well he said shortly i will send for my things tomorrow  he left the room without another word to either of us     chapter iii   in diplomacy the baron remarked blandly as also i believe in affairs of commerce the dinnertable is frequently chosen as a fitting place for the commencement of delicate negotiations for a bargainno but when three mentake ourselves for instancehave a matter of some importance to discuss i can conceive no better opportunity for the preliminaryskirmishing shall i saythan the present  i raised my glass and looked thoughtfully at the pale amber wine bubbling up from the stem  from a certain point of view i answered i entirely agree with you yet you must remember that the host has always the advantage  in the present case the baron said with a smile that amounts to nothing for you practically gave me my answer before we sat down to dinner if i am able to induce you to change your mindwell so much the better if notwell i can have nothing to complain of  i am glad i answered that you appreciate our position with regard to the present custody of the child which i take it is what you want to discuss with us our minds are practically made up my friend and i have both agreed that we will continue the charge of her until she is claimed by someone who is in a position to do so openlysomeone in short who has a legal right  the baron nodded gravely  an excellent decision he said no one could possibly quarrel with it yet it is a privilege to be able to tell you some facts which may perhaps affect your point of view i can explain to you why this open claim is not made  we are here i answered to listen to whatever you may have to say  weallan and iwere dining with the baron at claridges an appointment which he had begged us to make had been changed into a dinner invitation at his earnest request there was a likelihood he told us of his being summoned abroad at any moment and he was particularly anxious not to leave the hotel pending the arrival of a cablegram so far his demeanour had been courtesy and consideration itself but under the mans geniality and almost excessive bonhomie both allan and myself were conscious of a certain nervous impatience only partially concealed whatever proposal he might have to make to us our acceptance of it was without doubt a matter of great importance to him the more we realized this the more we wondered  i only wish he said with emphasis that it was within my power to lay the cards upon the table before you to tell you the whole truth i do not think then that you would hesitate for a single second but that i cannot do the honour of a great house mr greatson is involved in this matter into which you have been so strangely drawn i must leave blanks in my story which you must fill in for yourselves you and mr mabane there are things which i may notdare nottell you if i could you would wonder no longer that those who desire to take over the charge of the child wish to do so without publicity and without any appeal to the courts  the archduchess i remarked gave me some hint as to the nature of these difficulties  the baron emptied his glass and called for another bottle of wine then he looked carefully around him a quite unnecessary precaution for our table was in a remote corner of the room and there were very few dining  it is no longer he said a matter of surmise with us as to who the child you call isobel de sorrens really is she is of the house of waldenburg she carries her descent written in her face a hallmark no one could deny upon the archduchess and others of her great family must rest always the shadow of a grave stigma so long as the child remains in the hands of strangers an alien from her own country the archduchess wishes at once and quietly to assume the charge of her she is conscious of your services she feels that you have probably saved the child from a fate which it is not easy to contemplate calmly she authorizes me therefore to treat with you in the most generous fashion  that is a phrase i remarked which i do not altogether understand  later the baron said with a meaning look i will make myself clear in the meantime let me recommend this soufflé mr mabane you are drinking nothing would you prefer your wine a shade colder  not for me allan declared i prefer champagne at its natural temperature the wine is far too good to have its flavour frozen out of it apropos of what you were saying baron there is one question which i should like to ask you why was major delahaye sent to st argueil for isobel and what was he supposed to do with her  i do not think that the baron liked the question he hesitated for several moments before he answered it  major delahaye was not sent he said he went on his own account he was the only person who knew the childs whereabouts  and what do you suppose his object was in bringing her away from the convent allan persisted  i do not know the baron answered all i can say is that it pleases me vastly more to find the child in your keeping than in his  was the man who shot him i asked concerned in the childs earlier history  i cannot place him at all the baron answered i should imagine that his quarrel with major delahaye was a personal one and had no bearing upon the child few men had more enemies than delahaye one does not wish to speak ill of the dead but he was a bully and a brute all his days  a servant in plain black livery brought a sealed note to our host and stood respectfully by his side while he read it it obviously consisted of but a few words yet the baron continued to hold it in front of him for nearly a minute finally he crushed it in his hand and dismissed the servant  there is no answer he said i shall wait upon her highness in an hour  our dinner was over both mabane and myself had declined dessert our host rose  gentlemen he said i have ordered coffee in the smokingroom the headwaiter has told me of some wonderful brandy and i have some cigars which i am anxious for you to try will you come this way  we were the only occupants of the smokingroom the baron appropriated a corner and left us to fetch the cigars mabane lit a cigarette and leaned back in an easychair  it seems to me arnold he said that you are like the man who found what he went out for to see you wanted tragedyand you came very near it i do not quite see what the end of all these things will be our host  there is a disappointment in store for him i fancy i interrupted he is a very faithful servant of the archduchess and he has worked hard for her from his point of view his arguments are reasonable enough all that he says is plausibleand yetone feels that there is something behind it all allan i dont trust one of these people i cant  nor i allan answered softly for the baron had already entered the room  he brought with him some wonderful cabanas and immediately afterwards coffee and liqueurs were served the moment the waiter had disappeared he threw off all reserve  come he said i am no longer your host we meet here on equal terms i have an offer to make to you which i think you will find astonishing the fact is her highness is anxious to run no risk of any resurrection of a certain scandal she has commissioned me to beg your acceptanceyou and your friendof these he laid down two separate pieces of paper upon the table she wishes to relieve you as soon as possible tonight if you can arrange itof the care of a certain young lady there need be no hesitation about your acceptance royalty as you know has special privileges so far as regards bounty and her highness appreciates most heartily the care and kindness which the child has received at your hands  i stared at my piece of paper it was a cheque for five thousand pounds i looked at mabanes it was a cheque for a like amount then i looked up at the baron the perspiration was standing out upon his forehead he was watching us as a man might watch one in whose hands lay the power of life or death i resisted my first impulse which was simply to tear the cheque in two i simply pushed it back across the table  baron i said if this is meant as a recompense for any kindness which we have shown to a friendless child it is unnecessary and unacceptable if it is meant i added more slowly for a bribe it is not enough  call it what you will he answered quickly name your own price for the childbrought heretonight  no price that you or your mistress could pay baron i answered quietly i told you my ultimatum two hours ago the child remains with us until she is claimed by one who has a legal right and is not afraid to invoke the law  but i have explained the position the baron protested you must understand why we cannot bring such a matter as this into the courts  your story is ingenious and pardon me it may be true i answered we require proof  the barons face was not pleasant to look upon  you doubt my word sirmy word and the word of the archduchess  i rose to my feet mabane followed my example i felt that a storm was pending  baron i said there are some causes which make strange demands upon the best of us a man may lie to save a womans honour or if he be a politician for the good of his country i cannot discuss this matter any further with you my sole regret is that we ever discussed it at all my friend and i must wish you goodnight  by heavens you shall not go the baron exclaimed what right have you to the child none at all her highness wishes to be generous it pleases you to flout her generosity mr arnold greatson you are a fool dont you see that you are a pigmy who has stolen through the back door into the world where great things are dealt with you have no place there you cannot keep the child away from us you have no influence no money you are nobody if you think  mabane interposed  baron he said if you were not still in a sense our host i should knock you down as it is permit me to tell you that you are talking nonsense  the baron drew a sharp quick breath  you are right he said shortly i am a fool to discuss this with you at all it is not worth while the archduchess out of kindness would have treated you as friends you decline good you shall be treatedas you deserve  the baron threw open the door and bowed us out the commissionaire helped us on with our coats and summoned a hansom we were just driving off when a man in a long travelling coat who had been standing outside the swingdoor of the hotel calmly swung himself up into the cab and motioned to us to make room i stared at him in blank amazement  hullo i exclaimed what  it is i my friend mr grooten answered calmly tell the man to drive to your rooms     chapter iv   i am staying at claridges or rather i was mr grooten remarked as we turned into brook street i saw you with leibingen and i have been waiting for you we will talk i think at your rooms  whereupon he lit a fresh cigarette and did not speak a word until we had reached our destination isobel had gone to bed and our sittingroom was empty i turned up the lamp and pushed a chair towards him in various small ways he seemed to have succeeded in effecting a wonderful change in his appearance his hair was differently arranged and much greyer his face was pale and drawn as though with illness but for his voice and his broad humorous mouth i doubt whether i should immediately have recognized him  i perceive he said that i am not forgotten it is very flattering my friends abroad tell me that i have altered a good deal during the last twelve months  you have altered without a doubt i admitted but the circumstances connected with our first meeting were scarcely such as tend towards forgetfulness you remember my friend mr allan mabane  perfectly he assented with a courteous little wave of the hand i am very glad to have come across you both again so opportunely i only arrived in england a few days ago but i did not hope to have this pleasure until the morning at the earliest you expected to have heard from me perhaps before  i dont know about that i answered but i can assure you that we are both very glad to see you for more reasons than one there are a good many things which we are anxious to discuss with you  the pleasure then is mutual mr grooten remarked affably isobel is i trust well  she is quite well i answered  you are helping her to spend her time profitably i am glad to find he continued i saw two miniatures of hers yesterday at the mordaunt rooms  isobel has gifts i said we are doing our best to assist her in their development  mr grooten raised his eyes to mine he looked at me steadily  why have you refused to use the money which i placed to your credit at the national bank for her he asked  because i answered we are not aware what right you have to provide for her  mr grooten smiled upon usmuch as a sphynx might have smiled it had the effect of making us both feel very young  my claim he murmured must surely be as good as yours  perhaps i admitted at any rate the money remains there in her name she may find herself in greater need of it later on in life  mr grooten seemed to find some amusement in the idea  no he said i do not think that that is likely you could safely have used the money but as you have notwell it is of small consequence i presume that attempts have been made to withdraw the child from your care  several i told him madame richard and lady delahaye were equally importunate  grooten nodded  you have shown he said an admirable discretion in refusing to give her up to either of them  and today i continued a third claimant to the care of her has intervened the archduchess of bristlaw herself has offered to relieve us of our guardianship  mr grooten dropped the cigarette which he had only just lit and seemed for the moment unconscious of the fact he made no effort to pick it up he quivered as though someone had struck him a blow for a man whose impassivity was almost a part of himself he was evidently deeply agitated  the archduchesshas seen isobel he muttered  they met by chance at the mordaunt rooms a few afternoons ago i told him the archduchess was accompanied by a girl of about isobels age we came upon them suddenly and the likeness was so marvellous that we were all startled there was something in the nature of a scene we left the gallery at once but the archduchess sent one of her suite for me i had some conversation with her concerning isobel  can you repeat it grooten asked  in substanceyes i told him the archduchess plainly hinted that she believed isobel to be connected morganatically with her family she wished to take her under her own charge and provide for her  and you  i thought it best to take some time for reflection i had some idea of looking up the history of the archduchesss family  you made no promise  certainly not to tell you the truth i was influenced by the presence of lady delahaye amongst the royal party i have no faith in lady delahayes good intentions with regard to isobel  mr grooten flashed a quick glance upon me  yet he said softly report says that you and lady delahaye have been very good friends  that i answered is beside the mark i knew her before her marriage but i have seen very little of her since as a matter of fact our relations at the present time are scarcely amicable we have had a difference of opinion concerning our guardianship of isobel lady delahaye does not approve of her presence here with us  mr grooten smiled  that he said is probable may i proceed to ask a somewhat impertinent question you were the guests tonight i believe of the baron von leibingen who is i understand a persona grata with the archduchess i presume that your meeting in some way concerned isobel  isobel was the sole cause of it i answered the archduchess is a woman who perseveres she declined to consider that my reply to her first tentative offer was in any way final she passed the matter on to the baron and certainly until he lost his temper towards the end of our interview he was a very efficient ambassador he proved to us quite clearly that it was our duty to give isobel up to those who had a better right to assume the charge of her and he wound up by handing us cheques fori think it was five thousand pounds each wasnt it allan  mr grooten leaned back in his chair and laughed silently yet with obvious enjoyment  that poor von leibingen he murmured how he blunders his way through life yet my friend i am afraid that this charge which i so thoughtlessly laid upon you is proving very troublesome and you perceive that i do not even offer you a cheque  allan suddenly rose up and knocked the ashes from his pipe into the fire  you do not offer us a cheque mr grooten he said quietly because you have perceptions but there is another way in which you can recompense us for the trifling inconveniences to which we have been put you can make our task easierand more dignified you can answer a question which i think i may say that we have an absolute right to ask you  mr grooten inclined his head slightly he made no remark allan turned to me  arnold he said this is more your affair than mine for it is you who have borne the brunt of it from the first i do not wish to interfere in it unduly but from every point of view i think that the time has come when all this mystery concerning isobels antecedents should be so far as we are concerned at any rate cleared up our hands would be immensely strengthened by the knowledge of the truth your friend here mr grooten can tell us if he will ask him to do so i will go further i will even say that we have a right to insist upon it  mr grooten sat immovable one could scarcely gather from his face that he had heard a word of allans speech  you are quite right allan i answered mr grooten i continued turning towards him you are the best judge as to whether your presence in this country is altogether wise but i can assure you that for the last six months we have looked for you every day and for this same reason we want that question answered the time has come when in common justice to us and the child the whole thing should be cleared up whatever knowledge rests with you is safe also with us i think that we have proved that i think that we have earned our right to your complete confidence mabane and i you can consider as one in this matter you can speak before him as though we were alone now tell us the whole truth  i cannot mr grooten answered simply  there was a certain crisp definiteness about those two words which carried conviction with them mabane and i were a little staggered our position was such a strong one our request so reasonable that i think that we had never realized the possibility of a refusal  may i ask you this mabane said do you expect that we shall continue ouri suppose we may call it guardianshipof isobel in the face of your present attitude  i hope so for the present our visitor admitted softly  notwithstanding mabane continued our absolute ignorance of everything connected with her our lack of any sort of claim or title to the charge of her and the increasing number of people who still persist in trying to take her from us  mr grooten shrugged his shoulders  you omit to mention the factors in the situation which may be said to be on your side he murmured  i should be interested to know what those are i remarked  certainly the first and most powerful of all is of course possession  mabane nodded  and after that  the fact that not one of the three people who have appealed to you for the charge of the child is in a position to use the only real force which exists in this land i mean the law grooten continued  this kept us silent again for a moment mabane i could see was getting a little ruffled  you pelt us with enigmas sir he said you answer our questions only by propounding fresh conundrums one thing at least you may feel disposed to tell us what is your own relationship to isobel  none mr grooten answered  your interest then  mr grooten remained silent he sat in his chair very still and very quiet yet in his eyes there shone for a moment something which seemed to bring into the little room the shadow of great things mabane and i both felt it we had the sense of having been left behind the little man in his chair seemed to have been lifted out of our reach into the mightier world of passion and suffering and selfconquest  i loved her mother he said softly i was the man whom her mother loved  there was a silence between us then we had no more to say we were at that moment his bounden slaves but by some evil chance after a lengthened pause he continued  i alas could do little for the child yet when i heard that harm was threatened to her through that scamp delahaye i crossed the ocean at an hours notice i saved her from him he deserved his fate but i am no murderer by profession and the shock unnerved me for a time then  hush mabane cried  i sprang to the door it had been thrust about a foot open from outside came the sound of angry voices followed by a moments silence then a quick shrill cry of triumph  let me in oh you shall not stop me now i am going to see the man who boasts of being my husbands murderer  it was the voice of lady delahaye she was already upon the threshold i sprang to the table and saw her coming already she was behind the screen stealing into the room her head thrust forward her lips parted a peculiar glitter in her eyes for a moment i stood rigid the sight of her fascinated methere was something so wholly animallike in the stealthy triumph of her tiptoe approach i recovered myself just in time one more step a turn of her head and she would have seen grooten my finger pressed down the catch of the lamp and a sudden darkness filled the room  she stopped short her fierce little cry of anger told me exactly where she was i stepped forward and caught her wrists firmly then i faced where i knew grooten was still sitting i could see the red end of his cigarette still in his mouth  leave the room at once i said you can push the screen on one side and you are within a yard of the door then please do exactly as i say and dont reply  let go my hands sir arnold how dare you let me go or ill scream the place down mr mabane you will not permit this she cried in a fury  mabane closed the door through which grooten had already issued and i heard the key turn in the lock i released lady delahayes hands and she sprang away from me as the flame from the lamp which allan had just rekindled gained in power we saw her still shaking the handle but with her back now against the wall turned to face us she was calmer than i had expected but it was a terrible look which she flashed upon us  illustration she was calmer than i had expected but it was a terrible look which she flashed upon us  in how many minutes she asked may i be released  allan whispered in my ear  in five minutes lady delahaye i said i regret very much the necessity for keeping you at all may i offer you a chair  you may offer me nothing sir except your silence she answered swiftly  she meant it too i know the signs of anger in a womans face as well as most men and they were written there plainly enough so for a most uncomfortable period of time we waited there until allan after a glance at his watch went and opened the door she passed out without remark but from the threshold outside she turned and looked at me  i warned you once before arnold greatson she said that you were meddling with greater concerns than you knew of and that harm would come to you for it now you have chosen to shield a murderer and to use your strength upon a woman these things will not go unforgotten  mabane closed the door and threw himself into an easy chair  for two easygoing sort of fellows arnold he said to me we seem to be making a lot of enemies dont you think it would be a good idea if we drew stumps for a bit  meaning i asked  roseleys  well go tomorrow i declared     chapter v   i have never seen anything like this isobel said softly i looked up from the writingpad on my knee and she met my glance with a smile of contrition  ah she said i forgot that i must not talk indeed i did not mean to butlook  i followed her eyes  well i said tell me what you see  there are so many beautiful things she murmured do you see how thick and green the grass is in the meadows there how the quaker grasses glimmeryou call them so do you notand how those yellow cowslips shine like gold what a world of colour it all seems london is so grey and cold and herelook at the sea and the sky with all those dear little fleecy white clouds and the pink and white of all those wild roses wound in and out of the hedges oh arnold it is all beautiful  even without a motorcar i remarked  she looked at me a little resentfully  motoring is very delightful she said although you do not like it of course it would be nice if arthur were here  she looked away from me seawards and i found myself studying her expression with an interest which had something more in it than mere curiosity at odd times lately i had fancied that i could see it coming today for the first time i was sure the smooth transparency of childhood the unrestrained but almost animal play of features and eyes reproducing with photographic accuracy every small emotion and joythese things were passing away even before her time the child was seeking knowledge as she sat there with her steadfast eyes fixed upon the smooth blue line where sea and sky met who could tell what thoughts were passing in her mind not i not mabane nor any of us into whose care she had come only i knew that she saw new things that the rush of a more complex and stronger life was already troubling her the sweet pangs of its birth were already tugging at her heartstrings my pencil rested idly in my fingers my eyes like hers sought that distant line beyond which lies ever the world of ones own creation what did she see there i wondered never again should i be able to ask with the full certainty of knowing all that was in her mind the time had come for delicate reserves the time when the child of yesterday with the first faint notes of a new and wonderful song stealing into her heart must fence her new modesty around with many sweet elusions and barriers fairy creations to be swept aside later on in one glad momentby the one chosen person there was a coldness in my heart when i realized that the time had come even for the child who had tripped so lightly into our lives so short a time ago to pass away from us into that other and more complex world it was the decree of sex natures immutable law sundering playfellows severing friendships driving its unwilling victims into opposite corners of the world with all the pitilessness of natural law nevertheless the thought of these things as i looked at isobel made me sad she was young indeed for these days to come for the shadows to steal into her eyes and the song of trouble to grow in her heart  tell me i asked softly what you see beyond that blue line  i can tell you more easily she said glancing down with a faint smile at my empty pages what i see by my sidea very lazy man and she continued crumpling a little ball of heather in her fingers and throwing it with unerring aim at allan another one over there  my picture allan protested is finished  nonsense she exclaimed preparing to rise but he waved her back  in my mind he added dont misunderstand me the casual and ignorant observer glancing just now at my canvas might come to the same conclusion as youa conclusion bythebye entirely erroneous i will admit that my canvas is unspoilt nevertheless my picture is painted  she looked across at him reproachfully  allan how dare you she exclaimed only arnold has the right to be subtle i have always regarded you as a straightforward and honest person dont disappoint me  st andrew forbid it allan declared my meaning is painfully simple i build up my picture first in my mind its transmission to canvas is purely mechanical here goes  he took up his palette and in a few moments was hard at work isobel pointed downwards to my writingpad  can you too match allans excuse she asked is your story already written  i shook my head  i have been watching you i answered besides for a perfectly lazy person are you not rather a hard taskmistress consider that this is our first day of summerthe first time we have seen the sun make diamonds on the sea the first west wind which has come to us with the scent of cowslips and wild roses i claim the right to be lazy if i want to be  she smiled  the poet she murmured finds these things inspiring  the poet i answered is an ordinary creature nowadays he eats muttonchops plays golf and has a banking account the real man of feeling isobel is the man who knows how to be idle believe me there is a certain vulgarity in seeking to make a stockintrade of these delicious moments  that is not fair she protested how should we all live if none of you did any work  for your age isobel i declared seriously you are very nearly a practical person you make me more than ever anxious for an answer to my last question what were you thinking of just now  her eyes seemed to drift away from mine a touch of her new seriousness returned she pointed to that thin blue line  beyond there she said is tomorrow and all the tomorrows to come one sees a very little way  our limitations i answered are lifes lesson to us if tomorrow is hidden so much the more reason that we should live today  without thought for the morrow  without care for it i answered are we not bohemians and is it not our text  she shook her head  it is not yours she answered slowly i am sure of that  i looked at her quickly  what do you mean  just what i say she answered gravely men and women to whom the present is sufficient surely cannot achieve very much in life all the time they must concentrate powers which need expansion i think that it must be those who try to climb the walls those even who tear their fingers and their hearts in the great struggle for freedom who can make themselves capable of great things even if escape is impossible but i do not think that escape is so impossible after all is it there have been men and women too who have lived in all times to whom there have been no tomorrows or any yesterdays only it seems rather hard that life for those who seek it must always be a battle  i did not answer her for several minutes it was true then that the old days had passed away isobel the child whom we had known and loved so well had disappeared it was isobel the incomprehensible who was taking her place what might the change not mean for us  later we walked back over an open heath yellow with gorse and faintly pink with the promise of the heather to come isobel carried her hat in her hand she walked with her head thrown back and a smile playing every now and then upon her lips she was so completely absorbed that i found myself every now and then watching her half expecting i believe to find some physical change to accord with that other more mysterious evolution she walked with all the grace of long limbs and unfettered clothing her figure though perfectly graceful and with that same peculiar distinction which had first attracted me was as yet wholly immature but in the face itself there were signs of a coming change wherein it might lie i could not tell but it was there an intangible and wholly elusive thing i think that a certain fear of it and what it might mean oppressed me with the sense of coming trouble i was more fully conscious then than ever before of the moral responsibility of our peculiar charge  we crossed a straight dusty road cleaving the rolling moor like a belt of ribbon isobel looked thoughtfully along it  i wonder she said when arthur will come down  the folly of a man is a thing sometimes outside his own power of control a second before i had been wondering of whom and what she had been thinking  not just yet im afraid allan answered stopping to light his pipe it is not easy for him to get backwards and forwards and i believe that he is by way of being rather busy just now  what a nuisance isobel declared looking behind her regretfully the roads about here seem so good  the roads are good but the heath is better allan answered i will race you for half a pound of chocolates to that clump of pines  you are such a slow starter she laughed bounding away before he had time to drop his easel make it a pound  i picked up allans easel and strolled away after them was it the motoring i wondered which had prompted her halfwistful question or had i been wise too late arthur had been very confident so much that he had said had carried with it a certain ring of truth youth and the temperament of youth were surely irresistible like calls to like across the garden of spring flowers with a cry which no interloper can still no wanderer of later years can stifle somehow it seemed to me just then that the sun had ceased to shine and a touch of winter after all was lingering in the western breeze  they disappeared round the pine plantation isobel leading by a few yards her skirts blowing in the wind running still with superb and untired grace i climbed a bank to gain a better view of the finish and became suddenly aware that i was not the only interested spectator of their struggle about a hundred yards to my left a man was standing on the top of the same bank a pair of fieldglasses glued to his eyes watching intently the spot where they might be expected to reappear the sight of him took me by surprise a few moments ago i could have sworn that there was not a human being within a mile of us there was only one explanation of his appearance he must have been concealed in the dry mossy ditch at the foot of the bank it was possible of course that he might have been like us a casual wayfarer and yet the suddenness of his appearance the intentness of his watch both had their effect upon me i moved a few yards towards him with what object i perhaps scarcely knew a dry twig snapped beneath my feet he became suddenly aware of my approach then indeed my suspicions took definite shape for without a moments hesitation the man turned and strode away in the opposite direction  i shouted to him he took no notice i shouted again and he only increased his pace i watched him disappear and i no longer had any doubts at all he was not in the least like a tramp and his flight could bear but one interpretation isobel was not safe even here we had been followed from londonwe were being watched every hour for the first time i began seriously to doubt what the end of these things might be     chapter vi   silence and perfume and moonflooded meadows allan murmured arnold we shall all become corrupted you will take to writing pastorals and ii  isobel from her seat between us smiled up at him touched by the yellow moonlight her face seemed almost ethereal  you she said should paint a vision of the enchanted land you see those blurred woods and the fields sloping up to the mists isnt that a perfect impression of the world unseen half understood oh how can you talk of such a place corrupting anybody allan  i withdraw the term he answered yet arnold knows what i meant very well this place soothes while the city frets which state of mind do you think miss isobel draws from a man his best work  dont ask me enigmas allan she murmured i am too happy to think too happy to want to do anything more than exist i wish we lived here always why didnt we come here long ago  you forget the wonders of our climate i remarked a month ago you might have stood where you are now and seen nothing you would have shivered with the cold the field scents the birds the very insects were unborn it is all a matter of seasons what today is beautiful was yesterday a desert  she shook her head slowly bareheaded she was leaning now over the little gate and her eyes sought the stars  i will not believe it she declared i will not believe that it is not always beautiful here arnold allan can you smell the honeysuckle  and the hay allan answered smoking vigorously tomorrow we shall be sneezing every few minutes have you ever had hay fever isobel  she laughed at him scornfully  you poor old thing she exclaimed you should wear a hat  a hat allan protested is of no avail against hay fever its the most insidious thing in the world and is no respecter of youth you my dear isobel might be its first victim  pooh i catch nothing she declared and you mustnt either im sure you ought to be able to paint some beautiful pictures down here allan and arnold you shall have your writingtable out under the chestnut tree there you will be so comfortable and im sure youll be able to finish your story splendidly  you are very anxious to dispose of us all here isobel i remarked what do you propose to do yourself  oh paint a little i suppose she answered andthink there is so much to think about here  i shook my head  i am beginning to wonder i said whether we did wisely to bring you  and why  this thinking you are speaking of it is bad  you are foolish why should i not want to think  if you begin to think you will begin to doubt i answered and if you begin to doubt you will begin to understand the person who once understands you know is never again really happy  isobel came and stood in front of me  arnold she said  well  i wish you wouldnt talk to me always as though i were a baby she said thoughtfully  i took her hand and made her sit down by my side  come i protested that is not at all fair i can assure you that i was taking you most seriously the people who get most out of life are the people who avoid the analytical attitude who enjoy but who do not seek to understand who worship form and external beauty without the desire to penetrate below to understand the inner meaning of what they find so beautiful  that she said sounds a little difficult but i do not see how people can enjoy meaningless things  the source of all beauty is disillusioning  seriously mabane interrupted if this conversation develops i am going indoors does arnold want to penetrate into the hidden meaning of that crickets chirpor is he going to give us the chemical formula for the smell of the honeysuckle  isobel laughed  he is rather trying tonight isnt he she declared listen is that someone going by  the footsteps of a man were clearly audible passing along the dusty little strip of road which fronted our cottage leaning forward i saw a tall dark figure pass slowly by from his height and upright carriage i thought that it must be the village policeman and i called out goodnight my greeting met with no response i shrugged my shoulders  some of these village people are not particularly civil i remarked  mabane rose to his feet and strolled to the hedge  those were not the footsteps of a villager he remarked listen  we stood quite still the footsteps had ceased although there was no other habitation for more than half a mile along the road we could see nothing but i noticed that mabane was leaning a little forward and gazing with a curious intentness at the open common on the other side of the road he stood up presently and knocked the ashes from his pipe  what do you say to a drink arnold he suggested  come along i answered theres some whisky and soda on the sideboard  isobel laughed at us she would have lingered where she was but allan passed his arm through hers  sentiment must not make you lazy isobel he declared i decline to mix my own whisky and soda arnold he whispered drawing me back as she stepped past us through the wideopen window i wonder if it has occurred to you that if any of our friends who are so anxious to obtain possession of isobel were to attempt a coup down here we should be rather in a mess were a mile from the village and lord knows how many from a policestation and there isnt a door in the cottage a man couldnt break open with his fist  what made you think of itjust now i asked  three men passed by following that last fellowon the edge of the common ive got eyes like a cat in the dark you know and i could see that they were trying to get by unnoticed of course there may be nothing in it butthanks isobel by jove thats good  i slipped upstairs to my room and on my return handed allan something which he thrust quietly into his pocket then we went out again into the garden i drew mabane on one side for a moment  i dont think theres anything in it allan i whispered it would be too clumsy for any of our friendsand too risky  it neednt be either allan answered but i daresay youre right  then we hastened once more to the front gate summoned there by isobels cry  listen she exclaimed holding up her hand  we stood by her side from somewhere out of the night there came to our ears the faint distant throbbing of an engine neither allan nor i realized what it was but isobel who had stepped out on to the road knew at once  look she cried suddenly  we followed her outstretched finger far away on the top of a distant hill but moving towards us all the time with marvellous swiftness we saw a small but brilliant light  a motor bicycle she cried i believe it is arthur it sounds just like his machine  arthur it was white with dust and breathless his first greeting was for isobel who welcomed him with both hands outstretched and a delight which she made no effort to conceal overwhelming him with questions frankly joyful at his coming mabane and i stood silent in the background and we avoided each others eyes it was at that moment perhaps that i for the first time realized the tragedy into which we were slowly drifting isobel had forgotten us she was wholly absorbed in her joy at arthurs unexpected appearance the thing which in my quieter moments had begun already vaguely to trouble mea thing of slow and painful growthassumed for the first time a certain definiteness i looked a little way into the future and it seemed to me that there were evil times coming  arthur approached us presently with outstretched hand his manner was half apologetic half triumphant he seemed to be saying to himself that isobels reception of him must surely have opened our eyes  your coming i suppose arthur mabane said quietly signifies  that i accept your terms for the present arthur answered in a low tone i had to see you there are strangers continually watching our diggings and making inquiries about isobel there are things happening which i cannot understand at all  i glanced towards isobel  we will talk about it after she has gone to bed i said come in and have some supper now  he drew me a little on one side  you remember the chap who was with the archduchess at the mordaunt rooms  yes  he was at the hotel in guildford when i stopped for tea with two other men theyre in a great daimter car and theyre coming this way i heard them ask about the roads  how far were they behind you i asked  they must be close up he answered listen  another motor isobel cried suddenly can you not hear it  there was no mistaking the sound the deep low throbbing of a powerful engine as yet some distance away i was conscious of a curious sense of uneasiness  isobel i said would you mind going indoors  indoors indeed she laughed but no i must see this motorcar  i stepped quickly up to her and laid my hand upon her arm  isobel i said earnestly you do not understand i do not wish to frighten you but i am afraid that the men in this car are coming here and it is better that you should be out of the way they want to take you from us go inside and lock yourself in your room  she looked at me half puzzled half resentful the car was close at hand now we ourselves were almost in the path of its flaring searchlights  arnold you are joking of course she exclaimed they cannot take me away i would not go  the car had stopped it contained four men one of whom at once alighted and advanced towards us i knew him by his voice and figure it was the baron von leibingen     chapter vii   i made no movement towards opening the gate the newcomer advanced to within a few feet of me and then paused he leaned a little forward he was doubtful as i could see of my identity  can you tell me he asked raising his hat if this is roseleys cottage the residence of mr arnold greatson  do you forget all your acquaintances so quickly baron i answered this is roseleys and i am arnold greatson  your voice he declared is sufficient i can assure you that it is a matter of eyesight not of memory in the dark i am always as blind as a bat  it is i remarked a very common happening you are motoring i see you have chosen a very delightful night but are you notpardon mea little off the track you are on your way to the south coast i presume  on the contrary the baron answered our destination is here will you permit me to apologise for the lateness of my visit we were unfortunately delayed for several hours by a mishap to our automobile or i should have had the honour of presenting myself during the afternoon  i did not offer to move  perhaps i said as it is certainly very late and we were on the point of retiring you will permit me to inquire at once into the nature of the business which procures for me the honour of this visit  my visitor paused his hand was upon the gate so was mine keeping it all the time fast closed  you will permit me he said making an attempt to enter  i regret i answered that at this late hour i am not prepared to offer you any hospitality if you will come and see me tomorrow morning i shall be happy to hear what you have to say  my visitor did not remove his hand from the gate it seemed to me that his tone became more belligerent  you are discomposed to see us mr greatson he said me and my friends as you see he added with a little wave of his hand i am not alone i have only to regret that you have made this visit necessary we have come to induce you if possible to change your mind and to give up the young lady in whom the archduchess has been graciously pleased to interest herself to those who have a better claim upon her  it is not a matter i answered which i am prepared to discuss at this houror with you  as to that the young man answered i am the envoy of her royal highness as i can speedily convince you if you will  it is unnecessary i answered the archduchess has already had my answer will you allow me to wish you goodnight  i wish mr greatson the young man said that you would discuss this matter with me in a reasonable spirit  at a reasonable hour i answered i might be prepared to do so but certainly not now  it seemed to me that his hand upon the gate tightened he certainly showed no signs of accepting the dismissal which i was trying to force upon him  i have endeavoured to explain my late arrival he said you must not believe me guilty of wilful discourtesy as for the rest mr greatson what does it matter whether the hour is late or early the matter is an important one between ourselves her highness has made up her mind to undertake the charge of the young lady and i may tell you that when her highness has made up her mind to anything she is not one to be disappointed  in her own country i said the will of the archduchess is doubtless paramount out here however she must take her chance amongst the others  but you have no claimno shadow of a claim upon the child the baron declared  if the archduchess thinks she has a better i answered the law courts are open to her  my visitor was apparently becoming annoyed there were traces of irritation in his tone  do you imagine my dear mr greatson he said that her highness can possibly desire to bring before the notice of the world the peccadiloes of her illustrious relative no the law courts are not to be thought of we rely upon your good sense  and failing that  the baron hesitated it seemed to me that he was peering into the shadows beyond the hedge  the position he murmured is a singular one where neither side for different reasons is disposed to submit its case to the courts then it must be admitted that possession becomes a very important feature in the case  that i remarked is entirely my view may i take the liberty baron von leibingen of wishing you goodnight i see no advantage in continuing this discussion  possession for the moment he said slowly is with you have you reflected mr greatson that it may not always be so  will you favour me i said by becoming a little more explicit  with pleasure the baron answered quickly i have three friends here with me and we are all armed your cottage is surrounded by half a dozen morefriendswho are also armed we are here to take isobel de sorrens back with us and we mean to do it on my honour mr greatson no harm is intended to her she will be as safe with the archduchess as with her own mother  if you dont take your hand off my gate in two seconds i said you will regret it all your life  he sprang forward but i fired over his shoulder and with an oath he backed into the road isobel meanwhile now thoroughly alarmed turned and ran towards the house only to find the path already blocked by two men who had stepped silently out from the low hedge which separated the garden from the fields beyond allan promptly knocked one of them down only to find himself struggling with the other isobel whose skirts were caught by the fallen man tried in vain to release herself i dared scarcely turn my head for my levelled revolver was keeping in check the baron and his three friends  baron i said your methods savour a little too much of comic opera you have mistaken your country andus there are three of us and if you force us to fightwell we shall fight the advantage of numbers is with you i admit for the rest if you succeed tonight you will be in the police court tomorrow  the baron made no answer i felt that he was watching the struggle which was going on behind my back i heard isobel shriek and the sound maddened me i left it to the baron to do his worst i sprang backwards and brought the butt end of my revolver down upon the skull of the man who was dragging her across the lawn then i passed my arm round her waist and called out once more to the baron who had passed through the gate and was coming rapidly towards us  you fool i cried unless you call off your hired gang and leave this place at once every newspaper in london shall advertise isobels name and presence here tomorrow  it was a chance shot but it went home i saw him stop short and i heard his little broken exclamation  but you do not know who she is he cried  i know very well indeed i answered  just then mabane broke loose from the man with whom he had been struggling and rushed to arthurs assistance the baron raised his hand and shouted something in german instantly our assailants seemed to melt away the baron stepped on to the strip of lawn and raised his hand  i call a truce mr greatson he said i desire to speak with you  i released my hold upon isobel and turned to mabane arthur too breathless but unhurt had struggled to his feet  take her into the house i said quickly but her grasp only tightened upon my arm  i will not leave you arnold she said i shall stay here they will not dare to touch me  i tried to disengage her arm but she was persistent she took no notice of allan who tried to lead her away i stole a glance at her through the darkness her face was white but there were no signs of fear there nor were there any signs of childishness in her manner or bearing she carried herself like an angry young princess and her eyes seemed lit with smouldering fire as clinging to my arm she leaned a little forwards toward the baron  why am i spoken of she cried passionately as though i were a baby a thing of no account to be carried away to your mistress or disposed of according to your liking do you think that i would come baron von leibingen  she broke off suddenly she leaned a little further forward her lips were parted the fire in her eyes had given way to a great wonder and the breathlessness of her silence was like a thing to be felt it held us all dumb we waitedwe scarcely knew for what only we knew that she had something more to say and we were impelled to wait for her words  i have seen you before she cried with a strange note of wonder in her tone your face comes back to meonly it was a long time agoa long long time where was it baron von leibingen  i heard his smothered exclamation he drew quickly a step backwards as though he sought to evade her searching gaze  you are mistaken young lady he said i know nothing of you beyond the fact that the lady whom i have the honour to serve desires to be your friend  it is not true she answered i remember youa long way backand the memory comes to me like an evil thought i will not come to you you may kill me but i will not come alive  indeed you are mistaken he persisted though he sought still the shadow of a rhododendron bush and his voice quivered with nervous anxiety you have never seen me before surely the archduchess the daughter of a king is not one whose proffered kindness it is well to slight think again young lady her highness will make your future her special charge  if your visit tonight sir she answered is a mark of the archduchesss goodwill to me i can well dispense with it i have given you my answer  you will remember baron i said speaking at random but gravely and as though some special meaning lurked in my words that this young lady comes of a race who do not readily change she has made her choice and her answer to you is my answer she will remain with us  the baron stepped out again into the richscented twilight  you hold strong cards mr arnold greatson he said but i see their backs only how do i know that you speak the truth from whom have you learnt the story of this young ladys antecedents  from mr grooten i answered boldly  i do not know the name the baron protested  he is the man i said who set isobel free  the baron said something to himself in german which i did not understand  you mean the man who shot major delahaye he asked  i do  then i would to heaven i knew whose identity that name conceals he cried fiercely  you would not dare to publish it i answered for to do so would be to give isobels story to the world  and why should i shrink from that he asked  i laughed  ask your august mistress i declared it seems to me that we know more than you think  the baron looked over his shoulder and spoke to his companions from that moment i knew that we had conquered one of them left and went outside to where the motorcar with its great flaring lights still stood then the baron faced me once more  mr greatson he said you are playing a game of your own and for the moment i must admit that you hold the tricks against me but it is well that i should give you once more this warning if you should decide upon taking one false stepyou perhaps know very well what i meanthings will go ill with youvery ill indeed  then he turned away and our little garden was freed from the presence of all of them we heard the starting of the car presently it glided away we listened to its throbbing growing fainter and fainter in the distance then there was silence a faint breeze had sprung up and was rustling in the shrubs from somewhere across the moor we heard the melancholy cry of the corncrakes a great sob of relief broke from isobels throatthen suddenly her arm grew heavy upon mine we hurried her into the house     chapter viii   the perfume from a drooping lilacbush a few feet away from the open casement was mingled with the fainter odour of jessamine and homely stocks in the soft morning sunshine the terrors of last night seemed a thing far removed from us we sat at breakfast in our little sittingroom and as though by common though unspoken consent we treated the whole affair as a gigantic joke we ignored its darker aspect we spoke of it as an operabouffe attempt never likely to be repeatedthe harebrained scheme of a mad foreigner over anxious to earn the favour of his mistress but beneath all our light talk was an undernote of seriousness i think that mabane and i at any rate realized perhaps for the first time that the situation so far as isobel was concerned was fast becoming an impossible one  after breakfast we all strolled out into the garden isobel with her hands full of flowers flitted in and out amongst the rosebushes laughing and talking with all the invincible gaiety of lighthearted youth and arthur hung all the while about her his eyes following her every movement telling her all the while by every action and lookif indeed the time had come for her to discern such thingsall that our compact forbade him to utter presently i slipped away and shutting myself up in the tiny room where i worked drew out my papers in a few minutes i had made a start i passed with a little unconscious sigh of relief into the detachment which was fast becoming the one luxury of my life  an hour may have passed perhaps more when i was interrupted i heard the door softly opened and light footsteps crossed the room to my side isobels hand rested on my shoulder and she looked down at my work  arnold she exclaimed how dare you you promised to read your story when you had finished six chapters and you are working on chapter twenty now  her long white forefinger pointed accusingly to the heading of my last page then i realized with a sudden flash of apprehension why i had not kept my promisewhy i could never keep it the story which flowed so smoothly from my pen was a record of my own emotions my own sufferings even her name had usurped the name of my heroine and stared up at me from the halffinished page it was my own story which was written there my own unhappiness which throbbed through every word and sentence with a little nervous gesture i covered over the open sheets i rose hastily to my feet and i drew her away from the table  another time isobel i said it is too glorious a day to spend indoors and arthur has taken holiday too tell me what shall we do  she looked at me a little doubtfully i had grown into the habit of consulting her about my work of reading most of it to her sometimes too she acted as my secretary perhaps she saw something of the trouble in my face for she answered me very softly  i should like she said to sit there before the open window on a cushion and to have you sit down in that easychair and read to me that is how i choose to spend the morning  i shook my head  how about the others i asked  oh arthur and allan can go for a walk she declared  what selfishness i answered as lightly as i could arthur must go back to town tonight he says i think that we ought all to spend the day together dont you i rather thought that you young people would have been off somewhere directly after breakfast  she looked at me earnestly  of course she said if you want to be left alone  but i dont i interrupted reaching for my hat i want to come too  you nice old thing she exclaimed passing her arm through mine well walk to heather hill arthur says that we can see the sea from there come along  so we started away the four of us together presently however arthur and isobel drew away in front allan with a little grunt stopped to light his pipe  arthur may keep his compact in the letter he said but in the spirit he breaks it every time their eyes meet you cant blame him its human nature after allthe gravitation of youth arnold im afraid you awoke to your responsibilities too late  you thinkthat she understands i asked quietly  why not she is almost a woman and she is older than her years look at them now he wants to talk seriously and she is teasing him all the time she has the instinct of her sex she will conceal what she feels until thepsychological moment but she does feelshe begins to understand i am sure of it watch them  we kept silence for a while i myself struggling with a sickening sense of despair against this newborn and most colossal folly i think that i was always possessed of an average amount of selfcontrol but my great fear now was lest my secret should in any way escape me mabanes words had carried conviction with them life itself for these few deadly minutes seemed changed the birds had ceased to sing and the warmth of the sunshine had faded out of the fluttering east wind i saw no longer the heath starred with yellow and purple blooms the distant line of blue hills the turf was no longer springy beneath my feet a grey mist hung over the joyous summer morning i was back again on my way from bow street threading a difficult passage through the market baskets of covent garden the child stepping blithely by my side graceful even then notwithstanding her immatureness and quaintly attractive though her deep blue eyes were full of tears and the white terror had not passed wholly from her face it was those few moments of her complete and trustful helplessness which had transformed my life for me those few moments in which the huge folly of these later days had been born for her very coming seemed to have been at a chosen timeat one of those periods of weariness which a man must feel whose sympathy with and desire for life leads him into many and devious forms of distraction only to find in time the same dregs at the bottom of the cup the joy of her fresh childish beauty her pure sweet trustfulness at all times a delicate flattery to any man just the more so to me a little inclined towards selfdistrust was like a fragrant a heartstirring memory even now i looked back upon these years which lay between her youth and my fast approaching middleagegrey weary years whose follies seemed now to rise up and stalk by my side the ghosts of misspent days ghosts of the sickly reasonings of a sham philosophy which lead into the broad way because its thoroughfares are easy and pleasant and pressed by the feet of the great majority i kept my eyes fixed upon the ground and i felt that strange thrill of despair pulling at my heartstrings dragging me downwardsthe despair which is almost akin to physical suffering and then a voice came floating back to me down the west wind its call at such a moment seemed almost symbolical  come along you very lazy people arnold may i walk with you for a little way arthur is not at all brilliant this morning and he does not amuse me  i am afraid i began that as an entertainer  oh you want to smoke your pipe in peace of course she interrupted laughing and passing her arm through mine well i am not going to allow it i want youto tell me things  so our little procession was reformed mabane and arthur with his hands deep in his pockets and an angry frown upon his forehead walked on ahead behind came isobel and iisobel with her hands clasped behind her her head a little thrown back a faint wistful smile lightening the unusual gravity of her face i looked at her in wonder  come i said what are the things you want me to talk to you about and why are you tired of talking nonsense with arthur  she did not look at me but the smile faded from her lips her eyes were still fixed steadily ahead  i believe you think arnold she said quietly that i am still a baby  i saw her lips quiver for a moment and my selfishness melted away i thought only of her  no i do not think that isobel i said gently only if i were you i would not be in too great a hurry to grow up it is when one is young after all that one walks in the gardens of life afterwardswhen one has passed through the portalsoutside the roads are dusty and the way a little wearisome stay in the gardens isobel as long as you can believe me that life outside has many disappointments and many sorrows your time will come soon enough  she smiled at me a little enigmatically  and you she asked have you closed the gates of the garden behind you  i am nearer forty than thirty i answered i have grey hairs and i am getting a little bald i may still be of some use in the world and there are very beautiful places where i may rest and even find happiness but they are not like the gardens of youth there is no other place like them all of us who have hurried so eagerly away isobel look back sometimesand long  she shook her head perhaps a little of the sadness of my mood had after all found its way into my tone for she looked at me with the shadow of a reproach in her deep blue eyes a faint tenderness which seemed to me more beautiful than anything i had ever seen  i do not think that i like your allegory arnold she said after all the gardens are the nursery of life are they not the great things of the world are all outside  i held my breath for a moment in amazement since when had thoughts like this come to her i knew then that the days of her childhood were numbered indeed that underneath the fresh joyous grace of her delightful youth the womans instincts were stirring and i was afraid  the great things isobel i said slowly look very fine from a distance but the power of accomplishment is not given to all of us every triumph and every success has its reverse side its sorrowful side for instance the whole judgment of the world is by comparison a great picture which brings fame to a man eclipses the work and lessens the reputation of another a successful book takes not a place of its own but the place of another mans work who must needs suffer for your success life is a battle truly enough but it is always civil war the striving of humanity against itself that is why what looks so great to you from behind the hedge may seem a very hollow thing when you have won the power to call it your own  she looked at me as though wondering how far i were in earnest  i think she said smiling that you are trying to confuse me of course i have not thought much about such things but when i am a little older if there was anything i could do i should simply try to do it in the best possible way and i should feel that i was doing what was right there is room for a great many people in the world arnolda great many novelists and a great many artists and a great many thinkers some of us must be content with lesser places i for one  i walked home with allan and i spoke to him seriously  there is a duty before us i said which up to now we have shirked the time has come when we must undertake it in earnest  you mean  we must abandon our negative attitude isobel comes i am very sure from no ordinary people we must find out her place in life and restore her to it she is a child no longer it is not fitting that she should stay with us  mabane too was for a moment sad and silent his face fell into stern lines but when he answered me his tone was steady and resolute enough  you are right arnold he answered we had better go back to london and begin at once  it was perhaps a little ominous that i should find waiting for me on our return a telegram from grooten  i must see you tonight shall call at your rooms twelve oclock     chapter ix   isobel interrupted the discussion with an imperative little tap upon the table  please listen all of you she exclaimed i have something to say and an invitation for you all  we had been dining at a little italian restaurant on our way home and over our coffee had been considering how to spend the rest of the evening arthur had declared for a music hall mabane and i were indifferent isobel up to now had said nothing  all my life she said slowly i have been wanting to see feurgéres he is in london for one week with rejani and if we can get seats i am going to take you all i have twenty pounds in my pocket from that nice man mr grooten who bought my other miniature and i want to spend some of it  arthur who understood no french shook his head  not the slightest chance of seats he declared theyve all been booked for weeks  they often have some returned at the theatre isobel answered at least if you others do not mind we will go and see  your proposal isobel allan said gravely indicates a certain amount of recklessness which reflects little credit upon us your guardians i propose  please do not be tiresome she interrupted arnold you will come with me will you not  i shall be delighted i answered i am sure that we all shall only i am afraid that we shall not get in  we paid the bill and walked to the theatre the man at the ticketoffice shook his head at our request for seats people had been waiting in the streets since morning for the unreserved places and the others had been booked weeks ago but as we were turning away the telephone in his office rang and he called us back  i have just had four stalls returned he said you can have them if you like  we are in morning dress i remarked doubtfully  they are in the back row so you can have them if you care to he answered  what luck isobel exclaimed delighted arnold how glorious here is my purse will you pay for me please  so we went in just as the curtain rose upon the first act of rostands great play the house was packed with an immense audience one box alone the stage box on the left was empty i leaned over to isobel and would have told her the story which all the world knew  you see that box i whispered wherever he plays it is always empty  i know she answered his wife used to sit therealways in the same place and after her death whatever theatre he played at he always insisted upon having it kept empty they say that on great nights when the people go almost wild with enthusiasm he looks into the shadows there almost as though he really saw her still sitting in her old place it is a beautiful story  done for effect arthur muttered and was promptly snubbed as he deserved they were friends again immediately afterwards however and i saw him attempt to hold her hand for a moment decidedly it was time that we carried out our new resolution  i think that from the moment i took my seat i was conscious in some mysterious way of the coming of great things there was a thrill of excitement in the air a sort of stifled electricity which one realizes often amongst a highly cultured audience awaiting the production of a great work but apart from this sensation of which i was fully conscious i felt a curious sense of nervousness stealing in upon me for which i could in no way account i knew what it meant only when amidst a storm of cheers feurgéres entered then indeed i knew  i kept silent for which i was thankful but the programme in my hand was crumpled into a little ball and the figures upon the stage moved as though in a mist before my eyes isobel noticed nothing for her whole breathless attention was riveted upon the play i came to myself with the rich sweet voice of the man so tender so infinitely pathetic ringing with a curious familiarity in my ears from that moment i followed the movement of the play  the curtain went down upon the first act amidst a silence so intense that it seemed as though people might be listening still for the echoes of that sad sweet voice which had been playing so effectively upon their heartstrings then came the storm of applause which lasted for several minutes i turned towards isobel she was sitting very still and she did not join in the enthusiasm which seemed to find its way straight from the hearts of the men and women who sat about us but her eyes were wet with tears her lips a little parted she gazed at the man whom incessant calls had brought at last a little wearily before the curtain as one might look at a god and their eyes met he did not start or betray himself in any wayperhaps his training befriended him there but as he left the stage he staggered and i saw his hand go to clutch the curtain for support i knew then that before the night was over isobels history would no longer be a secret to us  she turned to me with a little smile of apology there was a new look in her face too she spoke gravely  was i very stupid i am sorry but i could not help it i have never seen anything like this before it is wonderful  we talked quietly of the play and i was astonished at the keenness of her perceptions the unerring ease with which she had realized and appreciated the selfabnegation which was the great underlying motif of the whole drama and in the midst of our conversation what i had expected happened a note was brought to me by an attendant  come to me after the next act and bring her an attendant will be waiting for you at your lefthand door of egress  mabane and arthur had gone out to have a smoke i had still a moment before the curtain went up i leaned over towards isobel  isobel i said i am going to tell you something which will surprise you very much it is necessary that i tell you at once if you answer me at all do not speak above a whisper  she only slightly moved her head i had not any fear of her betraying herself  you have seen feurgéres before it was in the café he was my companion when i saw you first  mr grooten she murmured so softly that her lips seemed scarcely to move  i nodded assent  you knew  not until tonight  she was very pale but her selfcontrol was complete  he wishes usyou and ito go round to his room after this act you will be prepared  of course she answered simply  mabane and arthur came back and the latter whispered several times in her ear i doubt however whether she heard anything she sat through the whole of the next act like one in a dream only her eyes never left the stagenever left indeed the figure of the man from whom all the greatness of the play seemed to flow as the curtain fell i leaned over to arthur  isobel and i are going to pay a visit i said we shall be back in time for the next act  a visit he repeated doubtfully is there anyone we know here then  allan will explain i answered you had better tell him i whispered to mabane  allan was looking very serious i think that he questioned the wisdom of what i was doing  you are going to see him he asked in a low tone  he has sent for us i answered  we found the attendant waiting and by a devious route along many passages and through many doors we reached our destination at last our guide knocked at a door on which was hanging a little board with the name of monsieur feurgéres painted across it almost immediately we were bidden to enter monsieur feurgéres was sitting with his back to us before a long dressingtable he turned at once to the servant who stood by his side  come back five minutes before my call he ordered that will be in about twenty minutes from now  the man bowed and silently withdrew not until he had left the room did feurgéres move from his place then he arose to his feet and held out his hands to isobel  i knew your mother isobel he said simply     chapter x   isobel never hesitated i think that instinctively she accepted him without demur her eyes flashed back to him all those nameless things which his own greeting had left unspoken she took his hands and looked him frankly in the face  all my life she said softly i have wanted to meet someone who could say that to me  he was dressed in a suit of mediæval court clothes black from head to foot and fashioned according to the period of the play in which he was acting but if he had worn the garments of a pierrot or a clown one would never have noticed it the mans individuality magnetic and irresistible triumphed easily mr grooten had passed away it was the great feurgéres whose sad shining eyes lingered so wistfully upon isobels face  i can say more than that he went on and now that i see you isobel i wonder that i have not said it long ago you are like her childvery like her  i am glad isobel murmured please tell meeverything  everythingfor meis soon told he answered his voice dropping almost to a whisper his eyes still fixed upon isobels yet looking her through as though she were a shadow i loved your mother i was the manwhom your mother loved the years of my life began and ended there  their hands had fallen apart a little while before but isobel with an impulsive gesture stooped down and raised the fingers of his left hand to her lips i turned away it seemed like sacrilege to watch a mans soul shining in his eyes i walked to the other end of the long narrow room and examined the swords which lay ready for use against the wall it was not many minutes however before feurgéres recalled me  tonight he said i was coming to see mr greatson  it is better she murmured to have met you like this  he smiled very slightly yet it seemed to me that the curve of his lips was almost a caress there was certainly nothing left now of mr grooten  i think that i too am glad he said your mother suffered all her life because she permitted herself to care for me we mummers you see isobel though the world loves to be amused are always a little outside the pale i think he added with a curious little note of bitterness in his tone that we are not reckoned worthy or capable of the domestic affections  you do not believeyou cannot believe she murmured that there are many people who are so foolish it is the dwellers in the world who are mummersthose who live their foolish orderly lives with their eyes closed and oppressed all the while with a nervous fear of what their neighbours are thinking of them those are the mummersbut youyou monsieur are feurgéresthe artist you make music on the heartstrings of the world  for myself i was astonished i had not often seen isobel so deeply moved i had never known her so ready so earnest of speech but feurgéres was almost agitated for the first time i saw him without the mask of his perfect selfcontrol his cheeks were flushed his eyes were soft as a womans he raised isobels hand to his lips and his voice when he spoke shook with real emotion  you are the daughter of your mother dear isobel he said beyond that what is there that i can sayi who loved her  you can tell me about her isobel said gently that is what i have been hoping for  a little a very little he answered and more tonight if you will i have already written to mr greatson and i meant in a few hours to tell him everything but i would have you know this isobel and remember it always your mother was a holy woman for my sake for the sake of the love she bore me she abandoned a great position she broke down all the barriers of race and all the conventions of a lifetime she lost every friend she had in the world she even perhaps in some measure neglected her duty to you yet you were seldom out of her thoughts and her last words committed you to my distant care i have perhaps illfulfilled her charge isobel yet i have been watching over you sometimes when you have not known it  you were my saviour once she said you and arnold here when i sorely needed help  i came from america at a moments notice he said when it seemed to me that you might need my help i broke the greatest contract i had ever signed and i placed my liberty if not my life at the mercy of your wonderful police system but those things count for little i have been forced isobel to leave you very much to yourself you come of a race who would regard any association with me as defilement and there is always the chance that you may be able to take your proper position in the world that is why it has been my duty to keep away from you why i have been forced to leave to others what i would gladly have done myself tonight you will understand everything  nothing that you can tell me of my family or myself she answered will ever make me forget that whereas of them i know nothing you have been my guardian angel it was you who rescued me from the one person in this world of whom i have been miserably hatefully afraid it was not my family who saved me it was you  a shrill bell was ringing outside we heard the commotion of hurrying footsteps the callboys summons the creaking of moving scenery feurgéres glanced at the watch which stood upon his table his manner seemed to undergo a sudden change the man no longer revealed himself  the curtain is going up he said i can stay with you but two minutes longer i am coming to see mr greatson tonight isobel after the performance and i wish to see him alone this is at once our meeting and our farewell  our farewell she repeated doubtfully surely you are not going to leave usso soon you cannot mean that  tomorrow he said i leave for st petersburg my engagement there has been made many months ago but even if it were not so dear child our ways through life must always lie far apart if the necessity for it had not existed i should not have left you to the care ofof even mr greatson to be your guardian isobel would not be seemly that you will better understandtomorrow  indeed she protested i would sooner hear it now from your own lipsif indeed it must be so  he shook his head very slowly but with a decision more finite than the most emphatic negation which words could have framed  i must go away isobel he said and you and i must remain apart i will only ask you to remember me by this i am the man your mother loved nothing else in my life is worth consideringbut that i am one of those with whom fate has dealt a little hardly i am as weary of my work as i am of life itself i go on because it was her wish but i cannot forget the past remainsa blazing page of light the present is a very empty and a very cold place my days here are a sort of aftermath my life ended with hers tonight for one momenti want you to take her place  isobel looked at him eagerly  tell me how she begged tell me what to do  it may sound very foolish he said with a faint smile but i have a fancy and i am sure that you will do as i ask i want you to sit where she sat night after night you will find some flowers in her chair keep them they were the ones she preferred  there was an imperative knocking at the door feurgéres caught up his plumed hat and sword  i am ready he said quietly mr greatson my servant will take you to the box which i beg that you and isobel will occupy for the rest of the evening it is a harmless whim of mine and i trust that it will not inconvenience you  with scarcely another word he left us and a moment later we heard the roar of applause which greeted his appearance on the stage isobels eyes kindled and she moved restlessly towards the door  i do hope she said that someone will come for us soon i want to hear every word i hate to miss any of it  the darkvisaged servant stood upon the threshold  i have orders from monsieur feurgéres he announced respectfully to conduct you to his box if mademoiselle will permit  we followed him on tiptoe to the front of the house he unlocked the door of the lefthand stage box with a key which he took from his pocket  monsieur will permit me to remark he whispered that this is the first time since i have been in the service of monsieur feurgéres that anyone has occupied his private box i trust that mademoiselle will be comfortable  then the door closed behind him and we were left to ourselves     chapter xi   isobel her chair drawn a little behind the curtain was almost invisible from the house with both hands she held the cluster of pink roses which she had found upon the seat gravely but with wonderful selfcomposure she followed the action of the play with an intentness which never faltered occasionally she leaned a little forward and at such moments her profile passed the droop of the curtain and was visible to the greater part of the audience it was immediately after one of such movements that i noticed some commotion amongst the occupants of the box opposite to us their attention seemed suddenly drawn towards isobeltwo sets of operaglasses were steadily levelled at her a woman whose neck and arms were ablaze with diamonds raised her lorgnettes and regardless of the progress of the play kept them fixed in our direction i changed my position to obtain a better view of these people and immediately i understood  i saw the house now for the first time and i saw something which pleased me very little we were immediately opposite the royal box which with the one adjoining was occupied by a very brilliant little party the archduchess was there it was she whose lorgnettes were still unfalteringly directed towards isobel lady delahaye sat in the background and a greater personage than either occupied the chair next to the archduchess soon i saw that they were all whispering together all still looking from isobel towards the stage and from the stage to isobel and in the background was a man whose coat was covered with orders and who held himself like a soldier he looked at isobel as one might look at a ghost i stood back almost hidden in the shadows and i wondered more than ever what the end of all these things might be  towards the close of the act that wonderful voice with its low burden of sorrow so marvellously controlled drew me against my will to the front of the box he stood there with outstretched arms the prototype of all pathos and the low words drawn as it were against his will from his tremulous lips kept the whole house breathless his arms dropped to his side the curtain commenced to fall in that moment his eyes suddenly uplifted met mine it seemed to me that they were charged with meaning and i read their message rightly after all though i am not sure that i needed any warning  the curtain fell there was twenty minutes interval isobel sat back in her chair and her hand lingered lovingly about the roses which lay upon her lap i did not speak to her i knew that she was living in a little world of her own into which any ordinary intrusion was almost sacrilege arthur and allan had left their places i judged rightly that they had gone home so i sat by myself and waited for what i knew was sure to happen  and presently it camethe knock at the box door for which i had been listening i rose and opened it a tall young englishman with smooth parted hair whose evening attire was so immaculate as to become almost an offence stood and stared at me through his eyeglass  mr greatson he suggested mr arnold greatson  i acknowledged the fact with becoming meekness  my name is milton he saidcaptain angus milton i am in the suite of the archduchess for this evening her highness occupies the box opposite to yours  i bowed  i have noticed the fact i answered the archduchess has been good enough to favour us with some attention  the young man stared at me for some moments i found myself able to endure his scrutiny  her highness desires that you and the young ladyfor the first time he bowed towards isobelwill be so good as to come to the anteroom of the royal box she is anxious for a few minutes conversation with you  the archduchess i answered does us too much honour i shall be glad however if you will inform her that we will take another opportunity of waiting upon her miss de sorrens is much interested in the play  the young man dropped his eyeglass i was proud of the fact that i had succeeded in surprising him  you mean he exclaimed softly that you wontthat you dont want to come  precisely i answered i have already had the honour of one interview with the archduchess and i imagine that no useful purpose would be served by reopening the subject of our discussion  the young lady then he remarked turning again to isobel  the young lady remains under my charge i answered you will be so good as to express my regrets to the archduchess  he hesitated for a moment and then with a slight bow to isobel left us she spoke to me and we had been so long silent that our voices sounded strange  thank you arnold she said quietly this is all so wonderful that i could not bear to have it disturbed  i pray that it may not be i answered the archduchesss interest is flattering but mysterious i for one do not trust her i wish  i broke off in my speech for i saw that the principal seat in the opposite box was vacant as for isobel i doubt whether she noticed my sudden pause her hands were still caressing the soft pink blossoms in her lap her eyes were fixed upon vacancy she was in a sort of dream from which i did not care to rouse her i knew very well that the awakening would come fast enough  another imperative tap upon the door i opened it and the archduchess swept past me in the darkness of our box her diamonds glittered like fire the perfume from her draperies was stronger by far than the delicate fragrance of the roses which isobel still held me she ignored altogether she went straight up to isobel and stooping down rested her gloved hand upon the girls shoulder  i sent for you just now she said did you not understand  isobel raised her eyebrows the archduchess was angry and her voice betrayed her  i do not know any reason isobel answered why i should do your bidding  illustration i do not know any reason isobel answered why i should do your bidding  the archduchess was silent for a moment i think that she was waiting until she could control her voice  isobel she said i will tell you a very good reason i cannot keep silence any longer they will not give you up to me any other way so i have come to claim you openly you shall know the truth i am your mothers sister  isobel rose slowly to her feet she was as tall as the archduchess and the likeness which had always haunted me was unmistakable only isobel was of the finer mould and her eyes were different  why did you not tell me this beforeat the mordaunt rooms for instance she asked  you came upon me like a thunderclap the archduchess answered quickly for years we had lost all trace of you besides there were reasonsyou know that there were reasons why i might surely have been forgiven for hesitating but let that go we had better have your story blazoned out once more to the world than that you should live your life in this holeandcorner fashion i shall take you back to waldenburg i presume sir she added turning suddenly towards me that even you will not question my right to assume the guardianship of my own niece  the memory of feurgéres look came to my aid or i scarcely know how i should have answered her  your highness i said it is for isobel to decide she is no longer a child only i would remind you that you have on more than one occasion endeavoured to assume that guardianship without mentioning any such relationship  you know isobels history the archduchess answered can you wonder that i was anxious to avoid all publicity  your highness i said we do not know isobels historyyet we shall hear it tonight  he has not told youyet she asked incredulously  he is coming to my rooms tonight i answered  you shall hear it before then she exclaimed with a little laugh put on your hat child we will drive to my house you and i and mr greatson and i will tell you everything you will know then how greatly that man insulted you by daring to allow you to occupy this box to approach you at all  madame isobel said i thank you but i wish to hear the end of the play and as for my history monsieur feurgéres has promised to tell it to mr greatson tonight  i saw the archduchesss teeth meet and a spot of colour that burned in her cheeks  you talk like a fool child she said fiercely you are being deceived on every side it is not fit that that man should come into your presence it is a disgrace that you should mention his name  mrmonsieur feurgéres has proved himself my friend isobel answered quietly  the archduchesss eyes were burning she was a woman of violent temper and it was fast becoming beyond her control  child she said i am your aunt the daughter of the king of waldenburg you too are of the same race you know well that i speak the truth how dare you talk to me of a creature like feurgéres you have our blood in your veins i command you to come with me and break off at once and for ever these remarkable associations you shall make what return you will later on to those whom you may thinkshe darted a contemptuous glance at mehave been your friends but from this moment i claim you come  isobel looked her aunt in the face she spoke courteously but without faltering  madame she said it is not possible for me to do as you ask whatever plans are made for my future it is to my dear friend here she said looking across at me with shining eyes that i owe everything and as for monsieur feurgéres i have promised him to occupy this box for this evening and i shall do so  the archduchess was very white  you force me to tell you child she said this creature feurgéres was your mothers  your highness i cried  she stopped short and bit her lip isobel was very pale but she pointed to the door the orchestra had commenced to play  madame she said monsieur feurgéres loved my mother i shall keep my word to him  there was a soft knock at the door captain milton stood on the threshold  your highness he said bowing low the curtain will rise in thirty seconds  the archduchess left us without a word     chapter xii   it was not often we permitted ourselves such luxuries but as we left the theatre i caught a glimpse of isobels white face more clearly visible now than in the dimly lit box and i knew that bravely though she had carried herself through the whole of that trying evening she was not far from breaking down so i called a hansom and she sank back in a corner with a little sigh of relief i lit a cigarette and suddenly i felt a cold little hand steal into mine i set my teeth and held it firmly  arnold she whispered and her voice was none too steady i hate that woman i do not care if she is my aunt andarnold  yes  i believe that she hates me too she looks at me as though i were something unpleasant as though she wished me dead i will not go to her arnold say that i shall not  for a moment i was silent her little womanish airs of the last few months the quaint effort of dignity with which it seemed to have pleased her to add all that was possible to her years had wholly departed she was a child again with frightened eyes and quivering lips the child who had walked so easily into our hearts in those first days of her terror to think of her as such again was almost a relief  dear isobel i said the archduchess has told me now two different stories concerning you she appears to be very anxious to have you in her care but her methods up to the present have been very strange we shall not give you up to her unless we are obliged but  please what arnold she interrupted anxiously  if the archduchess is indeed your aunt as she says she is you must have hundreds of other relations many of whom you would without doubt find very different people besides in that case you see isobel you ought to be living altogether differently it is absurd for you to be grubbing along with us in an attic when you ought to be living in a palace with plenty of money and servants and beautiful frocks and all that sort of thing you understand me dont you i concluded a little lamely for the steady gaze of those deep blue frightened eyes was a little disconcerting  no i do not she answered if i am a waldenburg and the niece of the archduchess why was i left alone at that convent for all those years and who was responsible for sending that man to fetch me awaythat terrible man how are they going to explain that these wonderful relations of mine oh arnold arnold she cried suddenly swaying over towards me in the cab i dont want to leave youall do not send me away promise that you will not  a child i told myself fiercely a mere child this nevertheless i was thankful for the darkness of the silent street into which we had turned the darkness which hid my face from her her soft breath was upon my cheek her beautiful head very near my shoulder oh i had need of all my strength of all my commonsense  dear isobel i said looking straight ahead of me out of the cab i cannot make you any promise all must depend upon what monsieur feurgéres tells us tonight nothing would make meall of ushappier than to keep you with us always but it may not be our duty to keep you or yours to stay until we have heard feurgéres story we are in the dark  she shrank as it seemed into herself her eyes followed mine hauntingly  arnold she said with a little tremor in her tone you are not very kind to me tonight and i feelthat i wantpeople to be kind to me just now  i bent down and i raised her hands to my lips and kissed them  my dear child i said dont forget that i am your guardian and i have to think for youa long way ahead as for the rest i have not a single thought or hope in life which is not concerned for your happiness  i like that better she murmured butyou are very fond of my hands  fortunately the cab pulled up with a jerk i paid the man and we commenced to climb up the stone steps towards our rooms isobel who was generally a couple of flights ahead slipped her hand through my arm and leaned heavily upon me  arnold she whispered why would you not read your story to me tell me please  my dear child i exclaimed what made you think of that just now  she leaned forward i think that she was trying to look into my face  never mind please tell me she begged  i will read it some day i answered it is so incomplete i think i shall have to rewrite it  she shook her head  you have always read to me before just as you have written it i think that you are not quite so nice to me arnold as you were i havent done anything that you do not like have i because i am sure that you are different  you absurd child i answered smiling at her as cheerfully as i could you are in an imaginative frame of mind tonight  it is not that you look at me differently you do not seem to want to have me with you so much and  i stopped her we had reached the fourth floor where our apartments were with the key in the lock i turned and faced her for a moment she was as tall as i and a certain grace of carriage which she had always possessed and which had grown with her years redeemed her completely from the gaucherie of her uncomfortable age her features had gained in strength and lost nothing in delicacy she wore even her simple clothes with the nameless grace which must surely have come to her from inheritance i spoke to her then seriously yet if i had tried i could not have kept the kindness from my tone  dear isobel i said if there is any differencethink a year ago you were a child today you are a woman you must understand that side by side with the pleasure of having you with usthe greatest pleasure that has ever come into our lives isobelhas come a certain amount of responsibility  i am becoming a trouble to you then she exclaimed breathlessly  a trouble isobel  i suppose i weakened for a moment some trick of tone or expression must have let in the daylight for she suddenly held out her hands with a soft little cry and then as she stood there her eyes shining the old delightful smile curving her lips the door before which she stood was thrown open and arthur stood there he had on his hat and coat and i saw at once that he was not himself his cheeks were flushed with anger and he looked at us with a black frown  so youve come back then he exclaimed allan and i got tired of waiting just in time to say goodbye isobel im off  off but where she asked looking at him in surprise  i left them and passed on into our studio sittingroom where mabane was filling his pipe  whats the matter with arthur i asked  off his chump allan answered gravely dont take any notice of him  isobel and he were still talking together arthurs voice was a little raisedthen it suddenly dropped  i think allan said that you had better interfere arthur has lost his temper i am afraid  he will break the compact i exclaimed  i am afraid so  i stepped back into the little hall they were talking together earnestly arthur looked up and glared at me  arthur i said allan and i want a few words with you before you goif you are going out tonight  in a moment he answered i have something to say to isobel  but isobel had gone he looked for a moment at the door of her room through which she had vanished and then he turned on his heel and followed me he threw his hat upon the table and faced us both defiantly  it is i he said who have something to say to you and id like to get it over quick dn your hypocritical compact arnold greatson there youre in love with isobel any fool can see it and you want to keep the child all to yourself  allan took a quick step forward but i held out my hand  dont interfere allan i said let him say all that he has to say  i mean to arthur continued and i hope youll like it the compact was a fraud from beginning to end and ill have no more to do with it isobels too old to live here with you fellows and im going to ask her to marry me im going to advise her to go and stay with lady delahaye who wants her and im going to marry her from there if shell have me  lady delahaye i repeated thoughtfully you have been in communication with her have you  yes i have and i think shes right isobel ought to have some women friends she may have enemies but im not so sure about that lady delahaye isnt one of them at any rate the people who want to get her away from here may be her best friends after all  is that all arthur  its enough isnt it he answered doggedly  quite now listen i said tonight we are going to hear isobels history we are going to know who she is and all about her stay with us and you shall share the knowledge as for the rest you have been talking like a fool we do not wish to take you seriously we took up the charge of isobel jointly if the time has come now for us to give her up i should like us all to be in agreement it is very likely that the time has come i too think that in many ways it would be for her benefit we are prepared to give her up when we know the proper people to undertake the care of herbut never arthur to lady delahaye  arthur smiled slowly but it was not a pleasant smile  ah he said i forgot lady delahaye is an old friend of yours isnt she  your insinuations are childish arthur i answered lady delahaye is an old friend of the archduchesss and their interest in isobel is identical for many reasons i am going to know isobels history before i give her up to either of them  and who is going to tell it to you he asked  feurgéres i answered he sent for us at the theatre tonight he is coming on here  there was a sharp tapping at the door i moved across the room to open it arthur threw his hat upon the table  i will wait he declared     chapter xiii   we all knew isobels history it had taken barely twenty minutes to tell it but they had been twenty minutes of tragedy we were all i think in different ways affected monsieur feurgéres alone sat back in his seat like a carved image his face white and haggard his deepset eyes fixed upon vacancy we felt that he had passed wholly away from the world of present things he himself was lingering amongst the shadows of that wonderful past upon which he had only a moment before dropped the curtain he had told us to ask him questions but i for my part felt that questions just then were a sacrilege arthur however seemed to feel nothing of this it was he who took the lead  isobel then he said is the granddaughter of the king of waldenburg the only child of his eldest daughter her mother was divorced from her husband prince of herrshoff and afterwards married to you what about her father  he died two years after the divorce was granted feurgéres said without turning his head isobel was hurried away from the court through the influence of her aunt the archduchess of bristlaw and sent to a convent in france it was not intended that she should ever reappear at the court of waldenburg  why not  the king is very old and he is the richest man in europe isobel is the daughter of his eldest and favourite child the archduchess also has a daughter and failing isobel she will inherit  has the king i asked taken any steps to discover isobel  he has been told that she is dead feurgéres answered  we were all silent then for several minutes the things which we had heard were strange enough but they let in a flood of light upon all the events of the last few months it was feurgéres himself who broke in upon our thoughts  gentlemen he said there is another thing which i must tell you  his voice was very low but firm he had turned in his chair and was facing us all his eyes were no longer vacant he spoke as one speaks of sacred things  all europe he said was pleased to discuss what was called the elopement of the princess isobel with feurgéres the player the gutterpress of the world filled their columns with sensational and scandalous lies we at no time made any reply there was no need if now i break the silence of years it is that isobel shall know the truth it is you mr greatson who will tell her this and many other things listen carefully to what i say the husband of the princess isobel was a blackguard a man unfit for the society of any selfrespecting woman she was living in misery when i was bidden to the court of waldenburg i was made the more welcome there perhaps because i myself am a descendant of an ancient and honourable french family i met the princess isobel often and we grew to love each other of the struggle which ensued between her sense of duty and my persuasions i say nothing she was a highly sensitive and very intellectual woman and she had a profound conviction of the unalienable right of a woman to live out her life to its fullest capacity to gather into it to the full all that is best and greatest her position at waldenburg was impossible i proved it to her i prevailed but  he paused and held up his hand  the whole story of our elopement was a lie there was no elopement the princess isobel left her husband accompanied only by a maid and a ladyinwaiting they lived quietly in paris until her husband procured his divorce then we were married but until then we had not met since our parting at waldenburg isobels mother was ever a pure and holy woman let isobel know that let her know that the greatest and most wonderful sacrifice a woman ever made was surely herswhen she denied herself her own daughter lest the merest shadow of shame should rest upon her in later years it is for that same reason that i myself have kept away from isobel i have watched over her always but at a distance that is why i am content to stand aside even now and yield up my place to strangers  it was arthur again who questioned him  mr feurgéres he said you have told us wonderful things about isobel you have told us wonderful things about the past but you have not spoken at all about the future is it your wish that she returns to waldenburg or is she to remain isobel de sorrens  feurgéres turned his head and looked searchingly at arthur the boys face was flushed with excitement he made no effort to conceal his great interest feurgéres looked at him steadfastly and it was long before he spoke  you are asking me he said slowly the very question which i have been asking myself for a long time isobels proper place is at waldenburg and yet there are many and grave reasons why i dread her going there the king is an old man the court is ruled by the archduchess a hard unscrupulous woman already she has schemed to get the child into her power i dread the thought of her there alone and friendless her mother spoke of this to me upon her deathbed she shrank always from the idea that even the shadow of those hideous calumnies which oppressed her own life should darken a single moment of isobels i believe that if she were here at this moment she would place the two issues before her and bid her take her choice i think that it is what we must do  arthur stood up he looked very eager and handsome though a little boyish  monsieur feurgéres he said i love isobel give her to me and i will look after her future i am not rich but i will make a home for her she is too old to stay here with us any longer i will make her happy indeed i will  monsieur feurgéres looked back at that vacant spot upon the wall and was silent for some time it was impossible to gather anything from his face though arthur watched him fixedly all the time  and isobel he asked at length  i have not spoken to her arthur said there was a compact between us that we should not whilst she was under our care  monsieur feurgéres turned to me  that sounds like a compact of your making arnold greatson he said what am i to say to your friend  it is surely i said for isobel to decide it is only another issue to be placed before her with those others of which you have spoken you say that you must leave for st petersburg tomorrow will you see her now  he shook his head i might almost have imagined him indifferent but for the sudden twitching of his lips the almost pitiful craving which flashed out for a moment from his deepset eyes these were signs which came and went so quickly that i doubt if either of the others observed them but i at least understood  i will not see her at all he said it is better that i should not if she should decide upon waldenburg the less she has seen of me the better i leave it to you arnold greatson to put these matters faithfully before isobel i claim no guardianship over her her mothers sole desire was that when she had reached her present age the whole truth should be placed before her and she should decide exactly as she thought best that is my charge upon you he continued looking me steadfastly in the face and i know that you will fulfil it i shall send you my address in case it is necessary to communicate with me  he rose to his feet prepared for departure arthur intercepted him  if isobel will have me then he said you will not object  isobel shall make her own choice of these various issues he answered i claim no guardianship over her at all if any further decision has to be given you must look to mr greatson  arthur did look at me but his eyes fell quickly he turned once more to monsieur feurgéres  whether you claim it or not he said you are really her guardian not arnold i shall tell her that you left her free to choose  i have said all that i have to say monsieur feurgéres replied except this to you mr greatson he added turning to me you can have no longer any hesitation in using the money which stands in isobels name at the national bank you will find that it has accumulated and i have also added to it isobel will always be reasonably well off for i have left all that i myself possess to her with the exception of one legacy  without any further form of farewell he passed away from us it was so obviously his wish to be allowed to depart that we none of us cared to stop him then we all three looked at one another  tomorrow mabane said you must tell isobel  why not tonight arthur interposed  why not tonight indeed isobels soft voice asked if indeed there is anything more to tell  we were all thunderstruck as she glided out from behind the screen which shielded the inner door the door which led to her room it needed only a single glance into her face to assure us that she knew everything her eyes were still soft with tears shining like stars as she stood and looked at me across the floor her cheeks were pale and her lips were still quivering  i heard my name she said the door was unfastened so i stole out and i think that i am glad i did i had a right to know all that i have heard it is very wonderful i keep thinking and thinking and even now i cannot realize  you heard everything isobel arthur exclaimed meaningly  everything she answered her eyes suddenly seeking the carpet i thank you all for what you have said and done for me tomorrow i think i shall know better how i feel about these things  quite right isobel allan said quietly there are great issues before you and you should live with them for a little while do not decide anything hastily  arthur pressed forward to her side  you will give me your hand isobel he pleaded you will say goodnight  she gave it to him passively he raised it to his lips it was his active pronouncement of himself as her suitor i watched her closely and so did allan but she gave no sign she held out her hand to us tooa cold sad little hand it feltand turned away there was something curiously subdued about her movements as well as her silence as she passed out of sight  arthur took up his hat he was nervous and uneasy his tone was almost threatening  i shall be here early in the morning he said i suppose you will allow me to see isobel  by all means i answered as things are now you need not go away unless you like your room is still empty our compact is at an end stay if you will  he hesitated for a moment and then threw down his hat he sank into an easy chair and covered his face with his hands  ive been a beast i know he half sobbed i cant help it isobel is everything in the world to me you fellows cant imagine how i care for her  i laid my hand upon his shouldera little wearily perhaps though i tried to infuse some sympathy into my tone  cheer up arthur i said you have your chance dont make a trouble of it yet  arthur shook his head despondently  i think he said that she will go to waldenburg     book iii     chapter i   arthur flung himself into the room pale holloweyed the picture of despair  any news he cried hopelessly enough for he had seen my face  none i answered  anything from feurgéres  not yet  tell me againwhere did you telegraph him  dover calais paris ostend brussels cologne  and no reply  as yet none  let us look again at the note you found  i smoothed it out upon the table we had read it many times       there is something else which i must tell you before i leave      england come to me at once the bearer will bring you come alone       henri feurgÉres       psyou will be back in an hour disturb no one it is possible      that i may ask you to keep secret what i have to say  this note i remarked tapping it with my forefinger was taken in to isobel by mrs burdett at a quarter to eight it was brought she said by a respectable middleaged woman with whom isobel left the place soon after eight we heard of this an hour later at eleven oclock we began the search for monsieur feurgéres at three allan discovered that he had left the savoy hotel at ten for st petersburg since then we have sent seven telegrams the delivery of which is very problematicaland we have heardnothing  allan laid his hand gently upon my shoulder  we may get a reply from feurgéres at any moment he said but there will be no news of isobel that note is a forgery arnold  i am afraid it is i admitted feurgéres was a man of his word he would never have sent for isobel  then she is lost to us arthur groaned  i caught up my hat and coat  not yet i said i will go and see what lady delahaye has to say about this it can do no harm at any rate  shall i come arthur asked half rising from his chair  i would rather go alone i answered                                       the butler who knew me by sight was courteous but doubtful  her ladyship has been receiving all the afternoon he told me but i believe that she has gone to her rooms now her ladyship dines early tonight because of the opera i will send your name up if you like sir  i walked restlessly up and down the hall for ten minutes then a ladys maid suddenly appeared through a green baize door and beckoned me to follow her  her ladyship will see you upstairs sir if you will come this way she announced  i followed her into a little boudoir lady delahaye in a blue dressinggown was lying upon a sofa she eyed me as i entered with a curious smile  this is indeed an unexpected pleasure she murmured do sit down somewhere it is long past my hour of receiving and i am just getting ready for dinner but i positively could not send you away now please tell me all about it  you know why i have come then i remarked  my dear man i havent the least idea she protested it is sheer unadulterated curiosity which made me send perkins for you up here were not at all upon the sort of terms you know she added looking up at me with her big blue eyes for this sort of thing  isobel left us this morning i said bluntly she received a note signed feurgéres which i am sure was a forgery she left us at eight oclock and she has not returned  lady delahaye looked at me with a faint smile her expression puzzled me i was not even able to guess at the thoughts which lay underneath her words  how anxious you must be she murmured do you know i always wondered whether isobel would not some day weary of your milkandwater bohemianism your scotch friend is worthy no doubt but dull and the boy was too hopelessly in love to be amusing and as for youwellyou would do very nicely no doubt my dear arnold but you are too stuffed up with principles for a girl of isobels antecedents so she has cut the gordian knot herself well i am sorry  you are sorry i repeated why  she smiled sweetly at me  because my dear friend has promised me that wonderful emerald necklace if i could get the child away from you and i think that very soon with the help of that stupid boy i should have succeeded she said regretfully such emeralds arnold and you know how anything green suits me  you do not doubt then but that it is the archduchess who has done this i said  lady delahaye lifted her eyebrows  either the archduchess or isobel has walked off of her own sweet will she remarked calmly in any case you have lost the child and i have lost my necklace i positively cannot risk losing my dinner too she added with a glance at the clock so i am afraidi am so sorry but i must ask you to go away come and see me again wont you perhaps we can be friends again now that this bone of contention is removed  i have never desired anything else lady delahaye i said but if my friendship is really of any value to you if you would care to earn my deepest gratitude you could easily do so  really in what manner  by helping me to regain possession of the child  she laughed at me softly at first and then without restraint finally she rang the bell  my dear arnold she exclaimed wiping her eyes you are really too naïve you amuse me more than i can tell you my maid will show you the way downstairs do come and see me again soon goodbye  so that was the end of any hope we may have had of help from lady delahaye i called a hansom outside and drove at once to blenheim house the temporary residence of the archduchess and her suite a footman passed me on to a more important person who was sitting at a round table in the hall with a visitors book open before him i explained to him my desire to obtain a few moments audience with the archduchess but he only smiled and shook his head  it is quite impossible for her highness to see anyone now before her departure sir he said if you are connected with the press i can only tell you what i have told all the others we have received a telegram from illghera with grave news concerning the health of his majesty the king of waldenburg and notwithstanding the indisposition of the princess adelaide the archduchess has arranged to leave for illghera at once a fuller explanation will appear in the court circular and the archduchess is particularly anxious to express her great regret to all those whom the cancellation of her engagements may inconvenience goodday sir  the man recommenced his task which was apparently the copying out of a list of names from the visitors book and signed to the footman with his penholder to show me out but i stood my ground  you are leaving today then i said  we are leaving today the man assented without glancing up from his task we are naturally very busy  can i see the baron von leibingen i asked  it is quite impossible sir the man answered shortly he is engaged with her highness  i will wait i declared  then i must trouble you sir to wait outside he said with a little gesture of impatience i do not wish to seem uncivil but my orders today are peremptory  at that moment a door opened and a man came across the hall slowly drawing on his gloves i looked up and saw the baron von leibingen he recognized me at once and bowed courteously at the same time there was something in his manner which gave me the impression that he was not altogether pleased to see me  is there anything i can do for you mr greatson he asked pausing for a moment by my side  i am anxious to obtain five minutes interview with the archduchess i answered if you could manage that for me i should be exceedingly obliged  he shook his head  it is quite impossible he said decisively you have heard of the serious news from illghera without doubt we shall be on our way there in a few hours  i drew him a little on one side  is isobel here baron i asked bluntly  i beg your pardonis who here he inquired with the air of one who is puzzled by an incomprehensible question  isobelthe princess isobel if you likehas been lured from our care by a forged message we know her history now and we are able to understand the nature of the interest which your mistress has shown in her therefore when i find her missing i come to you i want to know if she is in this house  if she were the baron remarked i and everyone else who knows anything about it would say at once that she was in her proper place if she were i should most earnestly advise the archduchess to keep her here but i regret to say that she is not to tell you the truth the archduchess is so annoyed at the young ladys refusal to accept her protection that she has lost all interest in her i doubt whether she would receive her now if she came  perhaps i remarked slowly she has gone to illghera  it is of course the baron agreed not an impossibility  if i do not succeed in my search i said it is to illghera that i shall come  you will find it the baron assured me with a smile a most charming place i shall be delighted to renew our acquaintance there  his majesty i continued is i have heard very accessible i shall be able to tell him isobels story you may keep the child away from him baron but you cannot prevent his learning the fact of her existence and her history  my young friend the baron answered edging his way towards the door your enigmas at another time would be most interesting but at present i have affairs on hand and i am pressed for time i will permit myself to say however that you are altogether deceiving yourself it was the one wish of the archduchess to have taken isobel to her grandfather and begged him to recognize her  you decline to meet me fairly thento tell me the truth mind i firmly believe that isobel is now under your control i shall not rest until i have discovered her  then you may discover my young friend the baron said putting on his hat and turning resolutely away the true meaning of the word weariness you are a fool to ask me any questions at all we are on opposite sides if i knew where the child was you are the last person whom i should tell her place is anywheresave with you  he bowed and turned away whispering as he passed to a footman who at once approached me i allowed myself to be shown out as a matter of fact i had no alternative but on the steps was an english servant in the blenheim livery i slipped half a sovereign into his hand  can you tell me what time the archduchess leaves and from what station i asked  i am not quite sure about the time sir the man answered but the buses are ordered from charing cross and they are to be here at eight tonight  it was already past seven i lit a cigarette and strolled on towards the station     chapter ii   at charing cross station a strange thing happened the continental train arrived whilst i was sauntering about the platform and out of it within a few feet of me stepped feurgéres he was pale and haggard and he leaned heavily upon the arm of his servant as he stepped out of his carriage when he saw me however he held out his hand and smiled  you expected me then he exclaimed  not i i answered you have taken my breath away  i had your telegram at brussels he explained i wired st petersburg at once and turned back any news  none i answered  what are you doing here  i told him in a few rapid words he listened intently nodding his head every now and then  the archduchess has her he said and if only one of us had the ghost of a legal claim upon the child our difficulties would end she is an unscrupulous woman but there are things which even she dare not do what are they doing over there  he pointed to the next platform i took him by the arm and dragged him along  it is the special i exclaimed we must see them start  red drugget was being stretched across the platform and to my dismay the barricades were rolled across the luggage was already in the van and the guard was looking at his watch then a small brougham drove rapidly up and stopped opposite to the saloon baron von leibingen descended and was immediately followed by the archduchess together they helped from the carriage and across the platform a dark tall girl at the first sight of whom my heart began to beat wildly then i remembered the likeness between the cousins and what i had heard of the princess adelaides indisposition she was almost carried into the saloon and at the last moment she looked swiftly almost fearfully around her i could scarcely contain myself the likeness was marvellous as the train steamed out of the station feurgéres pushed aside the barricade and walked straight up to the stationmaster  i want a special he said to catch the boat i am feurgéres and i am due at petersburg wednesday  the stationmaster shook his head  you can have a special sir in twenty minutes but you cannot catch the boat the one i have just sent off would never do it but the boat has a royal command to wait for her  cant you give me an engine which will make up the twenty minutes feurgéres asked  it is impossible sir the stationmaster answered we have not an engine built which would come within ten miles an hour of that one  very good feurgéres said i will have the special at any rate be so good as to give your orders at once  you will gain nothing if you want to get on sir the stationmaster remarked an ordinary train will leave here in two hours which will catch the next boat  the special in twenty minutes feurgéres answered sharply forty pounds is it not it is here  the stationmaster hurried away i scarcely understood feurgéres haste to reach dover when i told him so he only laughed and led me away towards the refreshmentroom he ordered luncheon baskets to be sent out to the train and he made me drink a brandyandsoda then he took me by the arm  you are not much of a conspirator my friend arnold greatson he said you have been within a dozen yards of isobel within the last few minutes and you have not recognized her  i stopped short that wonderful likeness flashed once more back upon my mind certainly in the mordaunt rooms it had not been so noticeable and her eyes i looked at feurgéres and he nodded  the princess adelaide either remains in england or has gone on quietly ahead he said they have dressed isobel in her clothes and the general public could never tell the difference you see how difficult they have made it for us to approach her they will be hedged around like this all across the continent oh it was a very clever move  i scarcely answered him my eyes were fixed upon the tangled wilderness of red and green lights amongst which that train had disappeared what had they done to her these people that she should scarcely have been able to crawl across the platform what had they done to make her accept their bidding and leave england without a word or message to any of us it had not been of her own choice i was sure enough of that  come feurgéres said quietly  i followed him to the platform where the saloon carriage and engine were already drawn up feurgéres brought with him his servant and all his luggage a few curious porters and bystanders saw us start no one however manifested any particular interest in us there was no one whose business it seemed to be to watch us  i sat back in my corner and looked out into the darkness feurgéres opposite to me was leaning back with halfclosed eyes from his soft regular breathing it seemed almost as though he slept for me there was no thought of rest or sleep i made plans only to discard them rehearsed speeches appeals threats only to realize their hopeless ineffectiveness and underneath it all was a dull constant pain the pain which stays  our journey was about threeparts over when feurgéres suddenly sat up in his seat and opening his dressingcase drew out a continental timetable  in a sense that stationmaster was right he remarked turning over the leaves we shall not reach paris any the sooner for taking this special train on the other hand we shall have time to ascertain in dover whether our friends really have gone on to calais or whether they by any chance changed their minds and took the ostend boat i sincerely trust that that course will not have presented itself to them  why i asked  somewhere on the journey he remarked they must pause they will have to exchange isobel for the princess adelaide and make their plans for the disposal of isobel if they should do this say in brussels we shall be at a great disadvantage if however they should stay in paris we should be in a different position altogether the chief of the police is my friend i am known there and can command as good service as the archduchess herself we must hope that it will be paris if so we shall arrivelet me see six hours behind them but supposing they do break their connection we shall have still five hours in paris with them before they can get on if they are cautious they will go to illghera viâ brussels and their own country if however they do not seriously regard the matter of pursuit they will go direct  a few moments later we came to a standstill in the town station feurgéres let down the window and talked for a few minutes with the stationmaster then he resumed his seat  we will go on to the quay he said it is almost certain that our friends left by the paris boat we shall have four hours to wait but we can secure our cabins and perhaps sleep  we moved slowly on to the quay a few enquiries there completely assured us midway across the channel plainly visible still was a disappearing green light  thats the marie louise sir a seaman told me left here five and twenty minutes ago the parties you were enquiring about boarded her right enough the young lady had almost to be carried shes the new turbine boat and she ought to be across in about half an hour from now  monsieur feurgéres engaged the best cabin on the steamer and his servant fitted me up a dressingcase with necessaries for the journey from his masters ample store then we went into the saloon and had some supper afterwards we stood upon deck watching the passengers come on board from the train which had just arrived suddenly i seized feurgéres by the arm and dragged him inside the cabin  the princess adelaide i exclaimed look  we saw her distinctly from the window she was dressed very plainly and wore a heavy veil which she had just raised she stood within a few feet of us talking to the maid who seemed to be her sole companion  find my cabin mason she ordered i shall lie down directly we start i am always ill upon these wretched night boats it is a most unpleasant arrangement this  feurgéres looked at me and smiled  isobels features he remarked but not her voice you see we are on the right track we must contrive to keep out of that young ladys way                                       to keep out of the way of the princess adelaide was easy enough presuming that she kept her word and remained in her cabin i watched her enter it and close the door afterwards i wrapped myself in an ulster of feurgéres and went out on deck it was a fine night but windy and a little dark i lit a pipe and leaned over the side i had scarcely been there two minutes when i heard a light footstep coming along the deck and pause a few feet away a girls voice addressed me  can you tell me what that light is  i knew who it was at once it was the most hideous illfortune i answered gruffly and without turning my head  folkestone harbour  i thought that after that she must surely go away but she did nothing of the sort she came and leaned over the rail by my side  you are mr arnold greatson are you not  my heart sank and i could have cursed my folly for leaving my cabin however since i was discovered there was nothing to do but to make the best of it  yes i am arnold greatson i admitted  i wonder if you know who i am she asked  you are the princess adelaide of  she held up her hand  stop please i see that you know for some mysterious reason i am travelling almost alone and under another name which i do not like at all you are very fond of my cousin isobel are you not mr greatson  i tried to see her face but it was half turned away from me her voice however reminded me a little of isobels  yes i admitted slowly you see she was under our care for some time and we all grew very fond of her  but youyou especially i mean she went on do not be afraid of me mr greatson i know that my mother is very angry with you and has tried to take isobel away but if i were she i would not come i think that she must be very much happier as she is  ii am too old i said slowly to dare to be fond of anyonein that way  how foolish she murmured do you know mr greatson that i am only eighteen and that i am betrothed to the king of saxonia he is over forty very short and he has horrid turnedup black moustaches he is willing to marry me because i am to have a great fortune and my mother is willing for me to marry him because i shall be a queen but that is not happiness is it  i am afraid not i answered  mr greatson she continued i feel that i can talk to you like this because i have read your books i like the heroes so much and of course i like the stories too i think that isobel is very wise not to want to come back to waldenburg i wish that i were free as she is and had not to do things because i am a princess and i am sure that she is very fond of you  princess i began  she stopped me  if you knew how i hated that word she murmured i may never see you again you know after this evening so it really does not matterbut would you mind calling me adelaide  adelaide then i said may i ask you a question  as many as you like  do you know where isobel is now  her surprise was obviously genuine  why of course not is she not at your house in london  i shook my head  she is a few hours in front of us on her way to paris i said with your mother and the baron von leibingen and the rest of your people she is travelling in your clothes and in your name that is why you were left to follow as quietly as possible  she laid her hand upon my arm her eyes were full of tears and her voice shook  oh i am so sorry she cried softly so very sorry why cannot my mother leave her alone with you i am sure she would be happier  i think so too i answered that is why i am going to try and fetch her back  she looked at me very anxiously  mr greatson she said you do not know my mother if she makes up her mind to anything she is terribly hard to change i do hope that you succeed though why ever did isobel leave you  she received a forged letter written in somebody elses name i said how your mother has induced her to stay since though i do not know she looked very ill at charing cross and she had to be helped into the train  the princess adelaide went very white  it was she i heard this morningcry out she murmured they told me it was one of the servants who had had an accident mr greatson this is terrible  she turned her head away and i could see that she was crying  you must not distress yourself i said kindly i daresay that it will all come right you will see isobel i think in paris if you do will you give her a message  of course i will she answered  tell her that we are close at hand and that we have powerful friends i whispered we shall get to see her somehow or other and if she chooses to return she shall  yes anything else  i think not i answered  do you not want to send her your love she asked with a faint smile  of course i said slowly  she leaned a little over towards me  mr greatson she said do you know what i should want you to do if i were isobelwhat i am quite sure that she must want you to do now  tell me  why marry her she would be quite safe then wouldnt she  i tried to smile in a noncommittal sort of way but i am afraid there were things in my face beyond my power to control  you forget i answered i am thirtyfour and isobel is only eighteen besides there is someone else who wants to marry isobel he is young and they have been great friends always i think that she is fond of him  she shook her head doubtfully  i do not think that thirtyfour is old at all and if you care for isobel i would not let anyone else marry her she declared is that calais  yes  i think that i will go now in case my maid should see us together she said oh i can tell you where we are going in paris will that help you  of course it will i answered  number 17 rue henriette she whispered please come a little further this way a moment  i obeyed her at once we were quite out of sight now in the quietest corner of the ship  mr greatson she said you will think that i am a very strange girl i am going to be married in a few months to a man i do not care for one little bit and it seems to me that that will be the end of my life i want you to marry isobel and i hope you will both be very happyandwill you please kiss me once i am isobels cousin you know  i leaned forward and touched her lips then i grasped her hands warmly  you are very very kind i said gratefully and you cant think how much happier you have made me feel if onlyyou were not a princess  she flitted away into the darkness with a little broken laugh she passed me half an hour later in the customs house with a languid impassive stare which even her mother could not have excelled     chapter iii   feurgéres looked at me in surprise  what have you been doing to yourself he exclaimed is the fresh air so wonderful a tonic or have you been asleep and dreaming of paradise  i laughed  the sea air was well enough i answered but i have been having a most interesting conversation  with whom he asked  the princess adelaide  he drew a little closer to me  you are serious  undoubtedly listen  then i told him of my conversation with isobels cousin excepting the last episode his gratification was scarcely equal to mine he was a little thoughtful for some time afterwards i am sure he felt that i had been indiscreet  the princess adelaide i said will not betray us i am sure of that she will tell her mother nothing  these waldenburgs he answered gravely are a crafty race it is in their blood they cannot help it  isobel is a waldenburg i reminded him  she is her mothers daughter he said there is always one alien temperament in a family  in this case i declared two  he shrugged his shoulders  we shall soon know he said whether this young lady is honest or not a man will meet us at paris with an exact record of the doings of the archduchess and her party we shall know then where isobel is if the address is the same as that given you by the princess adelaide i will believe in her  but not till then i remarked smiling  not till then he assented  before we left calais feurgéres sent more telegrams and for an hour afterwards he sat opposite to me with wideopen eyes seeing nothing as was very evident save the images created by his own thoughts as we reached amiens however he spoke to me  you had better try and get some sleep he said you may have little time for rest in paris  and you i asked  it is another matter he answered i am accustomed to sleeping very little and besides it is probable that this affair may become one which it will be necessary for you to follow up alone the sight of me or the mention of my name is like poison to all the waldenburgs they would only be the more bitter and hard to deal with if they knew that i too had joined in the chase i hope to be able to do my share secretly  i followed his suggestion and slept more or less fitfully all the way to paris i was awakened to find that the train had come to a standstill we were already in the station and as i hastily collected my belongings i saw that feurgéres had left me and was standing on the platform talking earnestly to a pale dark young frenchman sombrely dressed and of insignificant appearance i joined him just as his companion departed he turned towards me with a peculiar smile  my apologies to the princess he said the address is correct they have gone to a suite of rooms belonging to the baron von leibingen  they are there still then i exclaimed  they are there still feurgéres assented and they show no immediate signs of moving on they are apparently waiting for someoneperhaps for the princess adelaide inside the house and out they are being closely watched and directly their plans are made i shall know of them  i looked as i felt a little surprised feurgéres smiled  i am at home here he said and i have friends come my own apartments are scarcely a stonesthrow away from the rue henriette estere will see our things safely through the customs  we drove through the cold grey twilight to the rue de st antoine where feurgéres apartments were to my surprise servants were at hand expecting us and i was shown at once into a suite of rooms in one of which was a great marble bath all ready for use some coffee and a change of clothes were brought me all my wants seemed to have been anticipated and provided for i had always imagined feurgéres to be a man of very simple and homely tastes but there were no traces of it in his home he showed me some of the rooms while we waited for breakfast rooms handsomely furnished and decorated full of art treasures and curios of many sorts collected from many countries  but in a sense it was like a dead house one felt that it might be a dwelling of ghosts there were nowhere any signs of the rooms being used the habitable air was absent everything was in perfect order there was no dust none of the chilliness of disuse yet one seemed to feel everywhere the sadness of places which exist only for their history one door only remained closed and that feurgéres unlocked with a little key which hung from his chain but he did not invite me to enter  you will excuse me for a few moments he said my housekeeper will show you into the breakfastroom please do not wait for me  an old lady very primly dressed in black and wearing a curious cap with long white strings bustled me away as feurgéres opened the door of the room in front of which we had been standing the air seemed instantly sweet with the perfume of flowers the old lady sighed as she poured me out some coffee i am ashamed to say that i felt and doubtless i looked curious  would it not be as well for me to wait for monsieur feurgéres i asked he will not be very long i suppose  the old lady shook her head sadly  ah but one cannot say she answered monsieur had better begin his breakfast  your master has perhaps someone waiting to see him i remarked  madame tobainshe told me her nameshook her head once more she spoke softly almost as though she were speaking of something sacred  monsieur did not know perhapsit was the chamber of madame always monsieur spends several hours a day there when he is in paris and always after he has performed at the theatre he returns immediately to sit there no one else is allowed to enter only i when monsieur is away am permitted once a day to fill it with fresh flowersflowers always the most expensive and rare ah such devotion and for the dead too one finds it seldom indeed it is the great artists only who can feel like that  she wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron dropped me a curtsey and withdrew feurgéres came in presently and i avoided looking at him for the first few minutes to tell the truth there was a lump in my own throat when he spoke however his tone was as usual  i shall ask you he said to stay indoors but to be prepared to start away at a moments notice i am going to make a few enquiries myself  his voice drew my eyes to his face and i was astonished at his appearance the skin seemed tightly drawn about his cheeks and he was very white as though in contradiction to his illlooks however his eyes were unusually brilliant and clear and his manner almost buoyant  forgive me monsieur feurgéres i said but it seems to me that you had better rest for a while you have been travelling longer than i have and you are tired  he smiled at me almost gaily  on the contrary he declared i never felt more vigorous i  he stopped short and walked the length of the room when he returned he was very grave but the smile was still upon his lips he laid his hand almost affectionately upon my shoulder  my dear friend he said softly i think that you are the only one to whom i have felt it possible to speak of the things which lie so near my heart for i think that you too are one of those who know and who must know what it is to suffer we who carry the iron in our hearts you know are sometimes drawn together the things which we may hide from the world we cannot hide from one another only for you there is hope for me there has been the wonderful past people have pitied me often my friend for what they have called my lonely life they little know i am not a sentimentalist i speak of real things isobel my wife died to the world and was buried to me she lives always just nowi have been with her she sat in her old chair and her eyes smiled again their marvellous welcome to me onlyand this is why i speak to you of these thingsthere was a difference  he was silent for a few minutes when he continued his voice was a little softer but no less firm  dear friend he said i will be honest when isobel was taken from me i had days and hours of hideous agony but it was the craving for her body only the touch of her lips the caress of her hands the sound of her voice her spirit has been with me always at first perhaps her coming was faint and indefinable but with every day i realized her more fully i called her and she sat in her box and watched me play and kissed her roses to me i close the door upon the world and call her back to her room call her into my arms whisper the old words call her those names which she loves bestand she is there and all my burden of sorrow falls away my friend a great love can do this a great pure love can mock even at the grave  i clasped his hand in mine  i think i said that i will never pity you again you have triumphed even over fateeven over those terrible relentless laws which sometimes make a ghastly nightmare of life even to the happiest of us you have turned sorrow into joy it is a great deed you have made my own suffering seem almost a vulgar thing  ah no he said for you too there is hope you too know that we need never be the idle resistless slaves of fatelike those others will and faith and purity can kindle a magic flame to lighten the darkness of the greatest sorrow i speak to you of these thingsnowbecause i think that the end is near  he suddenly sank into a chair i looked at him in alarm but his face was radiant there was no sign of any illness there  you are young arnold greatson he said they tell me that you will be famous yet you are not one of those to turn your face to the wall because the greatest gift of life is withheld from you that is why i have lifted the curtain of my own days i know you and i know that you will triumph it is a world of compensations after all for those who have the wit to understand  i think that he had more to say to me but we were interrupted there was a knock at the door and the man entered whom i had seen talking with feurgéres upon the platform of the railway station feurgéres rose at once calm and prepared they talked for a while so rapidly that i could not follow them then he turned to me  they are preparing for a move he announced they are going south as though for marseilles and illghera but they insist upon a special train they have declined a saloon attached to the train de luxe and monsieur estere here has doubts as to their real destination wait here until i return be prepared for a journey                                       they left me alone i lit a cigarette and settled down to read in less than half an hour however i was disturbed there was a knock at the door and madame tobain entered  there is a lady here sir who desires to see monsieur she announced  a fair slight woman in a long travelling cloak brushed past her she raised her veil and i started at once to my feet it was lady delahaye     chapter iv   it did not need a word from lady delahaye to acquaint me fully with what had happened indeed my only wonder had been that this knowledge had not come to her before she greeted me with a smile but her face was full of purpose  where is he she asked simply  not here i answered  she seated herself and began to unpin the travelling veil from her hat  so i perceive she remarked he will return  yes i admitted he will return  she folded the veil upon her knee and looked across at me thoughtfully  what an idiot i have been she murmured after all that emerald necklace might easily have been mine  i am not so sure about that i answered i think i know what is in your mind but i might remind you that suspicion is one thing and proof another  the motive she answered is the difficult thing and that is found i suppose the police are good for something they should be able to work backwards from a certainty  are you i asked going to employ the police dont you think that for the good of everyone and even for your husbands own sake the thing had better remain where it is  she laughed scornfully  you would have me let the man go free who shot another in the back treacherously and without warning she exclaimed thank you for your advice arnold greatson i have a different purpose in my mind  i moved my chair and drew a little nearer to her  lady delahaye i began  the use of my christian name she murmured would perhaps make your persuasions more effective at any rate you might try i have never forbidden you to use it  if you have any regard for me at all then eileen i said you will think seriously before you take any steps against monsieur feurgéres remember that he had or thought he had very strong reasons for acting as he did looking at it charitably your husbands proceedings were open to very grave misconstruction there will be a great deal of unpleasant scandal if the story is raked up again and isobels whole history will be told in court how will that suit the archduchess  not at all lady delahaye admitted frankly but the archduchess is not the only person to be considered you seem to forget that this is no trifling matter it is a murderer whom you are shielding the man who killed my husband whom you would have me let go free  technically i admitted not actually your husband did not die of his wound he was in a very bad state of health  i cannot recognize the distinction lady delahaye declared coldly he died from shock following it  consider for a moment the position of monsieur feurgéres i pleaded isobel was the only child of the woman whom he had dearly loved the care of her was a charge upon his conscience and upon his honour any open association with him he felt might be to her detriment later on in life all that he could do was to watch over her from a distance he saw her as he imagined in danger what course was open to him forget for the moment that major delahaye was your husband put yourself in the place of feurgéres what could he do but strike  he broke the law she said coldly the law of men and of god he must take the consequences i am not a vindictive woman i would have forgiven him for making a scene for striking my husband or taking away the child by force but he went too far  have you i asked been to the police  not yet  i caught at this faint hope  you came here to see him first you have something to proposesome compromise  she shook her head slowly  between monsieur feurgéres and myself she said there can be no question of anything of the sort there is nothing which he could offer me nothing within his power to offer which could influence me in the slightest  then why i asked are you here  to see you she answered i want to ask you this arnold you wish monsieur feurgéres to go free you wish to stay my hand what price are you willing to pay  i looked at her blankly as yet her meaning was hidden from me  any price i declared  then she leaned over towards me  what is he to you arnoldthis man she asked softly you are wonderfully loyal to some of your friends  i know the story of his life i answered and it is enough besides he is an old man and i fancy that his health is failing let him end his days in peace you will never regret it eileen if my gratitude is worth anything to you  i want she interrupted more than your gratitude  we sat looking at each other for a moment in a silence which i for my part could not have broken i read in her face in her altered expression and the softened gleam of her eyes all that i was expected to read i said nothing  it is not so very many years arnold she went on since you cared for me or said that you did i have not changed so much have i give up this senseless pursuit of a child oh you guard your secret very bravely but you cannot hide the truth from me it is not all philanthropy which has made you such a squire of dames you believe that you care for herthat child arnold it is a foolish fancy you belong to different hemispheres you are twice her age it will be years before she can even realize what life and love may be give it all up she is in safe hands now come back to london with me and monsieur feurgéres shall go free  monsieur feurgéres madame thanks you  he had entered the room softly and stood at the end of the screen lady delahayes face darkened  may i ask sir how long you have been playing the eavesdropper she demanded  not so long madame as i should have desired he answered yet long enough to understand this my young friend here seems to be trying to bargain with you for my safety madame i cannot allow it if your silence is indeed to be bought the terms must be arranged between you and me  she looked at him a trifle insolently  i have already explained to mr greatson she remarked that bargaining between you and me is impossible because you have nothing to offer which could tempt me  and mr greatson has  that monsieur she answered is between mr greatson and myself  monsieur feurgéres stood his ground  lady delahaye he said i want you to listen to me for a moment it is not a justification which i am attempting it is just a word or two of explanation to which i trust you will not refuse to listen  if you think it worth while she answered coldly  he shrugged his shoulders  who can tell i have the fancy however to assure you that what took place that day at the café grand was not the impulsive act of a man inspired with a homicidal mania but was the necessary outcome of a long sequence of events you know the peculiar relations existing between isobel and myself i had not the right to approach her or to assume any overt act of guardianship any association with me would at once have imperilled any chance she may have possessed of being restored to her rightful position at waldenburg i accordingly could only watch over her by means of spies this i have always done  with what object monsieur feurgéres lady delahaye asked you could never have interfered  the care of isobelthe distant care of herwas a charge laid upon me by her mother feurgéres answered it was therefore sacred i trusted to fate to find those who might intervene where i dared not and fate sent me at a very critical moment mr arnold greatson lady delahaye to speak ill of a woman is no pleasant taskto speak ill of the dead is more painful still yet these are facts the archduchess was willing to go to any lengths to prevent isobels creditable and honourable appearance in waldenburg it was the archduchess who after what she has termed her sisters disgrace sent isobel secretly to the convent and your husband lady delahaye who took her there it was your husband who brought her away and it was the announcement of his visit to the convent and an illadvised confidence to a friend at his club in paris which brought me home from america i will only say that i had reason to suspect major delahaye as the guardian of isobeleven the archduchess was ignorant of the position which he had assumed since i became a player there are many who forget that my family is noble major delahaye was one of these he returned a letter which i wrote to him with a contemptuous remark only my friend the duc dautrien saw him on my behalf from him your husband received a second and a very plain warning he disregarded it once more i wrote i warned him that if he took isobel from the convent he went to his death that is all  there was a silence lady delahaye was very pale she looked imploringly at me  monsieur feurgéres she said i am not your judge i do not wish to seem vindictive will you leave me with mr greatson for a few minutes  madame i cannot he answered gravely apart from the fact that i decline to have my safety purchased for me especially by one to whom i already owe too much it is necessary that mr greatson leaves this house within the next quarter of an hour  i sprang to my feet i forgot lady delahaye i forgot that this mans life and freedom rested at her disposal the great selfishness was upon me  i am ready i exclaimed  lady delahaye looked and she understood slowly she rose to her feet and crossed the room towards the door i was tonguetied i made no protestasked no questions feurgéres opened the door for her and summoned his servant but no word of any sort passed between them then he turned suddenly to me his tone was changed he was quick and alert  arnold he said the rest is with you they are taking her to the convent madame richard is here and the cardinal de vaux they have a plotbut never mind that if she passes the threshold of the convent she is lost it is for you to prevent it  i am ready i cried  he opened a desk and tossed me a small revolver  estere waits below in the carriage he will drive with you to the station you take the ordinary express to marcon there an automobile waits for you and you must start for the convent the driver has the route remember this you must go alone you must overtake them use force if necessary if you failisobel is lost  i shall not fail i answered grimly  bring her back arnold he said with a sudden change in his tone i want to see her once more  i left him there and glancing upwards from the street as the carriage drove off i waved my hand to the slim black figure at the window whose wan weary eyes watched our departure with an expression which at the time i could not fathom it was not until i was actually in the train that i remembered what lady delahayes silent departure might mean for him     chapter v   our plans were skilfully enough laid but the archduchess also had missed nothing we rushed through the village of argueil without having seen any sign of the carriage and it was not until we had reached the vineyardbordered road beyond that we saw it at last climbing the last hill to the convent  shall we catch it i gasped  the chauffeur only smiled  monsieur may rest assured he answered changing into his fourth speed notwithstanding the slight ascent  halfway up the hill we were barely one hundred yards behind the man glanced at me for instructions  blow your horn i said  he obeyed the carriage drew to the side of the road we rushed by and i caught a glimpse of three faces my spirits rose there was only the baron to deal with madame richard and isobel were the other occupants of the carriage  stop and draw the car across the road i ordered  the man obeyed i sprang to the ground the baron had his head out of the window and the driver was flogging his horses  if you do not stop i called out i shall shoot your horses  the driver took no notice he had flogged his horses into a gallop and was coming straight at me i fired and one of the horses after a wild plunge came down dragging the other with him and breaking the pole the driver was thrown on to the top of them and rolled off into the hedge cursing volubly the baron leaned out of the window and he had something in his hand which gleamed like silver in the sunlight  i have had enough of you my young friend he said fiercely and instantly fired  an unseen hand struck his arm as he pulled the trigger i felt my hat quiver upon my head as i sprung forward the baron had no time to fire again i caught him by the throat and dragged him into the road  i have had more than enough of you you blackguard i muttered and i shook him till he groaned and threw him across the road  isobel stretched out her arms to meisobel herself but how pale and changed  arnold arnold take me away she moaned  i would have lifted her out but madame richard had seized her  the child is vowed she said you shall not touch her she belongs to god  then give her to me i cried for i swear she is nearer to heaven in my arms than yours  the womans black eyes flashed terrible things at me and she wound herself round isobel with a marvellous strength for a moment i was helpless  madame i said i have never yet raised my hand against a woman but if you do not release that girl this moment i shall have to forget your sex  never she shrieked help baron cocher  some bluebloused men looked up from their work in the vineyards a long way off it was no time for hesitation i set my teeth and i caught hold of the womans arms her bones cracked in my hands before she let go isobel at last was free  jump up and get in the automobile isobel i said bear up dear it is only for a moment now  half fainting she staggered out and groped her way across the road once she nearly fell but my chauffeur leaped down and caught her then madame richard looked in my eyes and cursed me with slow solemn words  i sprang away from her she followed i jumped into the automobile she stood in front of it and dared us to start the driver backed a little suddenly shot forward and with a wonderful curve avoided her she ran to meet the peasants who were streaming now across the fields we could hear for a few minutes her shrill cries to them then the vineyards became patchwork and the still air a rushing wind our chauffeur sat grim and motionless like a figure of fate and we did our forty miles an hour  you have orders i asked him once  but yes monsieur he answered we go to parisand avoid the telegraph offices  all the while isobel was only partially conscious gradually however her colour became more natural and at last she opened her eyes and smiled at me her fingers faintly pressed mine she said nothing then but in about half an hour she made an effort to sit up  dear arnold she murmured you are indeed my guardian oh  she broke off and shuddered violently  please dont try to talk yet i said i shouldnt have been much of a guardian should i if i hadnt fetched you out of this scrape besides it was monsieur feurgéres who planned everything  arnold she murmured ihavent eaten anything for some time they put things in my food to make me drowsy so i dared not  under my breath i made large demands upon my stock of profanity then i leaned over and spoke to the chauffeur we were passing through a small town and he at once slackened pace and pulled up at a small restaurant with the first mouthful of soup isobels youth and strength seemed to reassert themselves after a cutlet and a glass of wine she had colour and began to talk she even grumbled when i denied her coffee and hurried her off again in the automobile she came close to my side and with a shyness quite new to her linked her arm in mine so we sped once more on our way to paris  conversation had isobel been fit for it was scarcely possible but in a disjointed sort of way she tried to tell me things  i was inside the house she said and the door of the room was locked before i knew that monsieur feurgéres was not therethat the letter was not a true one my aunt came and talked to me she tried to be kind at first afterwards she was very angry she said that my grandfather was an old man that he wished to see me before he died i must go with her at once i said that i would go if i might see you first but that only made her more angry still she said that my life had been a disgrace to our family that i must not mention your name that i must speak as though i had just left the convent then i too lost my temper i said that i would not go to illghera i did not want to see my grandfather or any of my relations they had left me alone so many years that now i could do without them altogether she never interrupted me she looked at me all the time with a still cold smile when i had finished she said only we shall see and she left me alone they brought me food and after i had taken some of it i was ill after that everything seemed like a dream i simply moved about as they told me and i did not seem to care much what happened then in paris adelaide came into my room she brought me some chocolate and she told me that you were near i think that i should have died but for her i began to listen to what they said i found out that they never meant to take me to illghera it was the convent all the time adelaide brought me more chocolate and kissed me then i made up my mind to fight i would not take their food i told myself all the time that i was not illi would not be ill that is why i was able to look out for you to strike at the baron when he tried to shoot you and to walk by myself arnold why does my aunt hate me so  i did not answer her for even as she talked her voice grew fainter and fainter and in a moment or two she was in a dead sleep her head fell upon my shoulder her hand rested in mine so she remained until we reached the outskirts of paris then the noise of passing vehicles and the altered motion of the car over the large cobblestones woke her she pressed my arm  i am safe arnold she murmured with a shade of anxiety still in her tone  quite i assured her  in a few moments we turned into the rue de st antoine and drew up before monsieur feurgéres house in the hall we met tobain i could see that she had been weeping and her tone as she took me a little on one side was full of anxiety  monsieur she murmured i am afraid  i stopped her  the young lady first i said she has been ill where shall i take her  she threw open the door of the diningroom a small round table elegantly appointed was spread with such a supper as feurgéres knew well how to order there was a gold foiled bottle flowers salads and fruits tobain nodded vigorously as she drew up a chair for isobel  it was monsieur himself who ordered everything she exclaimed he was so particular that everything should be of the best and the wine he fetched himself  where is monsieur feurgéres i asked struck by some note of hidden feeling in her tone  i will take you to him she answered if mademoiselle will wait here  in the hall she no longer concealed her fears  monsieur she said i am afraid soon after you had left and the master had given his orders for the supper he called me to him he was standing before the door of madames chamber the room which it is not permitted to enter and his hands and arms were full of flowers he had been to the florists himself i knew for there were more than usual tobain he said always as you know i lock the door of this room when i enter today i shall not do so but you must understand that no one is permitted to enter but my friend mr arnold greatson who will return this evening those are my orders tobain but monsieur dejeuner remember tobainmr arnold greatson only then i caught a glimpse of his face monsieur and i was afraid i have been afraid ever since it was the face of a young man so brilliant so eager i was at my masters marriage and the look was there then he went in and he closed the door and since then monsieur i have heard no sound and many hours have passed monsieur will please enter quickly  for myself i shared too tobains nameless apprehensions i left her and knocked softly at the door there was no answer so i entered  the room was in darkness but the opening of the door touched a spring under the carpet and several heavilyshaded electric lamps filled the apartment with a soft dim light monsieur feurgéres was sitting opposite to me his eyes closed a faint smile upon his lips he had the air of a man who slept with a good conscience and whose dreams were of the pleasantest close drawn to his was another chair against which he leaned somewhat and over the arm of which one hand was stretched resting gently upon the soft mass of deep pink roses whose perfume made fragrant the whole room i spoke to him  monsieur feurgéres i cried it is done i have brought isobel she is here  there was no answer had i indeed expected any i could almost have believed that the smile so light and delicate a thing which quivered upon his pale lips deepened a little as i spoke but that of course was fancy for monsieur feurgéres had won his hearts desire softly and with fingers which felt almost sacrilegious i broke off one of the blossoms with which the empty chair was laden and with it in my hands i went back to isobel     chapter vi   isobel knew the whole truth i told her one eveningthe only one on which we two had dined out together alone i think that the weather had tempted me to this indulgence which i had up to now so carefully avoided an early summer with its long still evenings had driven us out of doors the leaves which rustled over our heads stirred by the faintest of evening breezes made sweeter music for us than the violins of the more fashionable restaurants and no carved ceiling could be so beautiful as the starstrewn sky above i omitted nothing i laid the whole situation before her when i had finished she was very white and very quiet  and now that you have told me all this she asked after a long silence does it remain for me to make my choice even now i do not see my way at all clearly my relations do not want me monsieur feurgéres has left me some money cannot i choose for myself how i shall spend my life  i am afraid i answered that you may not for my part i am bound to say isobel that i think monsieur feurgéres was right the letter of which i have told you and which i found in my room was written only a few hours before his death at such a time a man sees clearly you are not only yourself the princess isobel of waldenburg but you have a grandfather who has never recovered the loss of your mother and of you it was not his fault or by his wish that you were sent away from waldenburg he has been deceived all the time by your aunt the archduchess i think that it is your duty to go to him  you will come with me she murmured anxiously  i shall not leave you i answered slowly until you are in his charge but afterwards  well she interrupted anxiously  afterwards i said firmly keeping my eyes away from her and bracing myself for the effort our ways must lie apart isobel you are the daughter of one of europes great families you have a future which is almost a destiny you must fulfil your obligations  i saw the look in her face and my heart ached for her i leaned forward in my chair  dear child i said remember that this is what your mother would have wished monsieur feurgéres believed this before he died and i think that no one else could tell so well what she would have desired for you just now it may seem a little hard to go amongst strangers to begin life all over again at your age but after all we must believe that it is the right thing  her face was turned away from me but i could see that her cheeks were pale and her lips trembling she said nothing i fancied because she dared not trust her voice above the tops of the trees the yellow moon was slowly rising from a few yards away came all the varied clatter of the boulevard and around us little groups and couples of people were gaygay with the invincible imperishable gaiety of the frenchman who dines the whiteaproned waiters smiled as with deft hands they served a different course or with a few wonderful touches removed all traces of the repast and served coffee and liqueurs upon a spotless cloth and amidst it all i watched with aching heart isobel the child of today the woman of tomorrow as she fought her battle  her face seemed marblewhite in the strange light half natural half artificial when she spoke at last she still kept her face turned away from me  the right thing she murmured that is what i want to do i want to do what she would have wished but just now it seems a little hard i do not want to be a princess i do not want to be rich monsieur feurgéres has made me independent and that is all i desire i would like to be free to live always my own lifefree like you and allan who paint and write and think for i too would love so much to be an artist but it seems that all these things have been decided for meby you and monsieur feurgéres no she added quickly i know very well that you are right i am willing to do what monsieur feurgéres thinks that my mother would have wished i will go to my grandfather and if he wishes it i will stay with him but there will be a condition  she turned at last and looked at me the lines of her mouth had altered the carriage of her head a subtle change in her tone told their own story it was the princess isobel who spoke  i will not have my mother ignored or spoken of as one who forgot her rank and station these are all very well but they are trifles compared with the great things of life i am proud of my mothers courage i am proud of the love which made his life after she had gone so beautiful i know that you understand me arnold but i do not think that those others will they must bear with me or i shall not stay  i looked at her wonderingly it seemed to me so strange that under our very eyes the child whom i had led by the hand through covent garden on that bright spring morning should have developed in thought and mind under our own roof and with so little conscious instruction into a woman of perceptions and character somewhere the seed of these things must have lain hidden one knows so little after all of those whom one knows best  it is a fair condition isobel i said you are going into a world which is hedged about with conventions and prejudices the things which are so clear to you and to me they may look at differently you must be received as your mothers daughter and not as the kings granddaughter  she nodded gravely then she leaned across the table and looked into my eyes notwithstanding her pallor and her black dress i was forced to realize what i ever forbade my thoughts to dwell uponher great and increasing beauty she looked into my eyes and my heart stood still  arnold she murmured shall you miss me  my heel dug into the turf beneath my foot my eyes fell from hers i dared not look at her  we shall all miss you so much i said gravely that life will never be the same again to us you made it beautiful for a little time and your absence will be hard to bear i suppose we shall all turn to hard work i added with an attempt at lightness allan will paint his great picture arthur will invent a new motor and make his fortune and i shall write my immortal story  the story she said which you would not show me  show her how could i when i knew that for one who read between the lines the story of my own suffering was there my secret had been hard enough to keep faithfully even from her to whom the truth had she ever divined it must have seemed so incredible  that one perhaps i answered lightly or the next who can tell one is never a judge of ones own work you know  why would you not show me that story arnold she asked softly  i met her eyes fixed upon me with a peculiar intentness i tried to escape them but i could not it was impossible for me to lie to her my voice shook as i answered her  dont ask me isobel i said we all make mistakes sometime you know not to show you that story when you asked me was one of mine  if you had it here  if i had it here i would show it you i declared  she sighed she did not seem altogether satisfied  sometimes arnold she said thoughtfully you puzzle me very much you treat me always as though i were a child you keep me at arms length always as though there were between us some impassable barrier as though it could never be possible for you to come into my world or for me to pass into yours i know that you are wiser and cleverer than i am but i can learn i have been learning all the time are we always to remain at this great distance  dear isobel i answered you forget that i am more than twice your age you are eighteen and i am thirtyfour i cannot make myself young like you i cannot call back the years however much i might wish to do so and for the rest i have been your guardian i a poor writer of no particular family and very meagre fortune and you my ward a princess standing at the opposite pole of life i have had to remember these things isobel  she leaned a little further across the table again her eyes held mine and i felt my heart beat like a boys at the touch of her soft white fingers as she laid her hand on mine  i wish she murmured oh i wish  so weve found you at last have we  isobels speech was never ended mabane and arthur stood within a few feet of us the former grave the latter white and angry i rose slowly to my feet and held out my hand to allan  i am glad to see you allan i said  he looked first at my hand and afterwards at me then with a sigh of relief he took it and nearly wrung it off  and i cant tell you how glad i am to see you both again he exclaimed weve heard strange storiesor rather arthur hasfrom his friend lady delahaye and at last we decided to come over and find out all about it for ourselves dont take any notice of arthur he added under his breath hes not quite himself  arthur was standing with his back to me talking to isobel certainly her welcome was flattering enough i realized with a sudden gravity that i had not heard her laugh like this since she had been in england arthur continued talking in a low earnest tone  how did you find us i asked allan  we called at the rue de st antoine he answered the housekeeper said that she had heard you talk about dining at one of these places arnold  well  why are you and isobel staying on in paris  first of all i answered promptly we had to stay for the funeral and now there are some legal formalities which cannot be finished until tomorrow i am monsieur feurgéres executor allan and he has left me twenty thousand pounds isobel has the rest  i am delighted old chap mabane declared heartily in fact ill drink your health  i called a waiter and ordered liqueurs arthur took his with an ill grace and he still avoided any direct speech with me isobel was evidently uneasy and looked at me once or twice as though anxious that i should break up their têteàtête but when i had paid the bill and we rose to go allan passed his arm through mine and i was forced to let the two go on  let the boy have his chance allan said pausing a little as we turned into the boulevard hes in such a state that he wont listen to reason only from her  but i protested it is absurd for him to speak to her does he know who she is the princess isobel of waldenburg their little kingdom is small enough but they play at royalty there  allan nodded  he knows but hes a goodlooking boy and the girls have spoilt him a little he has an idea that she cares for him  impossible i declared sharply  no not impossible allan answered shaking his head they have been together a great deal you must remember and arthur can be a very delightful companion when he chooses no it isnt impossible arnold  i shook my head  isobels future is already arranged i said in three days time i am taking her to her grandfather if he receives her as i believe that he will receive her she will pass out of our lives as easily as she came into them she will marry a grand duke perhaps even a petty king she will be plunged into all manner of excitements and gaiety her years with us will never be mentioned at court she herself will soon learn to look back on them as a quaint episode  you do not believe it arnold mabane declared scornfully  heaven only knows what i believe i answered with a little burst of bitterness look at that  we had reached the rue de st antoine isobel stood in the doorway at the apartments waiting for us but arthur had already disappeared     chapter vii   i examined the tickets carefully and placed them in my pocketbook then i paused to light a cigarette on my way out of the office and almost immediately felt a hand upon my arm i looked at first at the hand it was feminine and delicately gloved then i looked upwards into the blue eyes of lady delahaye  abominable she murmured you are not glad to see me  i raised my hat  the boulevard des italiennes i said has never seemed to me to be a place peculiarly suitable for the display of emotion  come and try the rue strelitz she answered smiling  i glanced down at her she was gowned even more perfectly than usualparisienne to the fingertips she had too all the delightful confidence of a woman who knows that she is looking her best  i smiled back at her it was impossible to take her seriously  your invitation i said sounds most attractive but i am curious to know what would happen to me in the rue strelitz should i be offered poison in a jewelled cup or disposed of in a cruder fashion let me make my will first and i will come i am really curious  arnold she said looking up at me with very bright eyes you are brutal  not quite that i hope i protested  let me tell you something she continued  we were in rather a conspicuous position lady delahaye seemed suddenly to realize it  may i beg for your escort a little way she said i am not comfortable upon the boulevard alone  you could scarcely fail i remarked throwing away my cigarette to be an object of attention from the frenchman who is above all things a judge of your sex i will accompany you a little way with pleasure shall we take a fiacre  i would rather walk she answered do you mind coming this way i will not take you far  i have two whole unoccupied hours i assured her which are very much at your service  where then she asked is isobel  shopping with tobain i answered  are you not afraid she asked with a smile to send her out alone with tobain  not in the least i answered monsieur feurgéres only friend in paris was the chief commissioner of police and he has been good enough to take great interest in us isobel is well watched  i wonder she said after a moments pause whether you have still any faith in me  my dear lady  i wish i could make you believe me theher highnessshe prefers us here to call her madamehas relinquished altogether her designs against you she desires an alliance  is this i asked an invitation to me to join in the spoils am i to become murderer or poisoner or abductor or what  lady delahaye bit her lip  you are altogether too severe she said madame simply realizes that she has been mistaken she is willing for isobel to be restored to her grandfather it will mean a million or so less dowry for adelaide but that must be faced madame desires to make peace with you  i am charmed i answered may i ask exactly what this means  lady delahaye smiled up at me  the archduchess will explain to you herself she said i am taking you to her  i slackened my pace  i think not i said to tell you the truth the archduchess terrifies me i see myself inveigled into a room with a trapdoor or knocked on the head by hired bullies and all manner of disagreeable things no lady delahaye i think that i will not run the risk  she laughed softly  i know that you will come she said softly  and why i asked  because you are a man and you do not know fear  i raised my hat and proceeded  my head is turned i said nothing flatters a coward so much as the imputation of bravery i think that i shall go with you anywhere  evento the rue strelitz  my courage may fail me at the last moment i answered at present it feels equal even to the rue strelitz  again she laughed  you are a fraud arnold she declared as if we did not knowi and madame and all of us that in paris even throughout france you could walk safely into any den of thieves you choose your courage isnt worth a snap of the fingers any man can be brave who has the archangels of dotant at his elbows  what an easily pricked reputation i answered regretfully well it is true dotant was feurgéres greatest friend and even isobel might walk the streets of paris alone and in safety hence i presume the amiable desire of the archduchess for an alliance  lady delahaye shrugged her laceclad shoulders  my dear arnold she said for myself i adore candour and why should i try and deceive you madame has played a losing game and knows it she has the courage to admit defeat she can still offer enough to make an alliance desirable for instance those tickets in your pocket for illghera will take you there it is true but they will not take you into the presence of the king  the king i remarked pensively leads a retired life  he does lady delahaye answered he has the greatest objection to visitors and for a stranger to obtain an audience is almost an impossibility he never leaves the grounds of the villa and his secretary who opens all his letters isa friend of madames  you have put your case admirably i remarked if madame is sincere i should at least like to hear what she has to say  lady delahaye drew a little sigh of content  at last she exclaimed i do believe that you are going to behave like a reasonable person  i could not refrain from the natural retort  i have an idea i said that up to now my actions have been fairly well justified  we were mounting the steps of her house she looked round and raised her eyebrows  we must let bygones be bygones she said madame has declared that henceforth she adjures all intrigue  a footman took my hat and stick in the hall lady delahaye led me into a small boudoir leading out of a larger room she herself only opened the door and closed it remaining outside i was alone with the archduchess  she rose slowly to her feet a very graceful and majesticlooking person with a suggestion of isobel in her thin neck and the pose of her head she did not hold out her hand and she surveyed me very critically i ventured to bestow something of the same attention upon her she was certainly a very beautiful woman and her expression by no means displeasing she had isobels dark blue eyes and there was a humorous line about her mouth which astonished me  i am not offering you my hand mr greatson she said because i presume that until we understand each other better it would be a mere matter of form still i am glad that you have come to see me  i am very glad too madame i answered especially if my visit leads to a cessation of the somewhat remarkable proceedings of the last few weeks  the archduchess smiled  well she said i am forced to admit myself beaten i have been illserved it is true but i suppose my methods are antiquated  they belong properly i admitted to a few centuries ago  madame smiled a little queerly  a few centuries ago she said i fancy that if our family history is true the affair would have been more simple  i can well believe it i answered  madame relapsed into her chair from which i judged that the preliminary skirmishing was over  you will please to be seated mr greatson  i obeyed  i am not going to play the hypocrite with you sir she said quietly it is not worth while is it the object of the struggle between us has been on my part to keep isobel and her grandfather apart you have doubtless correctly gauged my motive isobels mother was my fathers favourite child if he had an idea that her child was alive he would receive her without a word she would completely usurp the place of adelaide my own daughter in his affectionand in his will  in his will i repeated quietly yes i understand  madame nodded  it is quite simple she said for myself i am willing to admit that i am an ambitious woman money for its own sake i take no heed of but it remains always one of the great levers of the world and it is the only lever by means of which i can gain what i desire i never forget that the country over which my father rules was once an absolute kingdom and semiroyalty does not appeal to me the betrothal of my daughter adelaide to ferdinand of saxonia was of my planning entirely the dowry required by the council of saxonia is so large that it could not possibly be paid if any portion of my fathers fortune great though it is is diverted towards isobel hence my desire to keep isobel and her grandfather apart  madame i said you are candour itself i can only regret that it is my hard fate to oppose such admirable plans  i have been given to understand the archduchess said that it is now your intention to take isobel yourself to illghera  the tickets i murmured are in my pocket  madame bowed  well she said i have seen and heard enough of you to make no further effort to thwart or even to influence you yet i have a proposition to make first of all consider these things if we come to no arrangement with each other i shall use every means i can to prevent your obtaining an interview with my father everything is in my favour he is very old he has a hatred of strangers he grants audiences to no one he never passes outside the grounds of the villa and all the gates are guarded by sentries who admit no one save those who have the entrée then if you attempt to approach him by correspondence his private secretary who opens every letter is one of my own appointing i have exaggerated none of these things it will be difficult for you to approach the king you may succeedyou seem to have the knack of successbut it will take time isobels reappearance will be without dignity and open to many remarks for various reasons you may even fail to convince my father and if you failed the first time there would be no second opportunity  what you say madame i admitted is reasonable i have never assumed that as yet my task is completed i recognize fully the difficulties that are still before me  you have commonsense mr greatson i am glad to see she continued i am the more inclined to hope that you will accede to my proposition briefly it is this let me have the credit of bringing isobel to her grandfather her year in london would at all times in these days of scandal be a somewhat delicate matter to publish what you have done you have done as i very well know from no hope of or desire for reward efface yourself it will be for isobels good i myself shall stand sponsor for her to the world i shall have discovered her in the convent here and i shall take her back to her rightful place with triumph all your difficulties then will vanish your end will have been creditably and adequately attained for myself the advantage is obvious a difference to adelaide it must make but it will inevitably be less if the credit of her discovery remains with me have i made myself clear mr greatson  perfectly i answered but you forget there is isobel herself to be considered she is no longer a child she has opinions and a will of her own  she owes too much to you madame replied quietly to disregard your wishes  i believed from the first that the woman was in earnest and her proposal an honest one and yet i hesitated the past was a little recent she showed that she read my thoughts  come she said i will prove to you that i mean what i say tonight i will give a dinnerpartyinformal it is true but the prince of cleves my cousin the cardinal and your own ambassador shall come i will introduce isobel as my niece the affair will then be established do you consent  for one moment i hesitated i knew very well what my answer meant absolute effacement the tearing out of my life for ever of what had become the sweetest part of it in that single moment it seemed to me that i realized with something like complete despair the barrenness of the days to come  madame if isobel is to be persuaded i answered i consent     chapter viii   this then the prince remarked raising his eyeglass is the young lady whose romantic history you have been recounting to me but my dear lady she is charming  madame held out her hands affectionately and kissed isobel who had entered the room with her cousin on both cheeks then she took her by the hand and presented her to the prince of cleves and several others of the company isobel was a little pale but her manner was perfectly easy and selfpossessed she was dressed somewhat to my surprise in the deepest mourning and she even wore a band of black velvet around her neck  my dear child her aunt said pleasantly i scarcely think that your toilette is a compliment to us all white should be your colour for many years to come  isobel raised her eyes her tone was no louder than ordinary but somehow her voice seemed to be possessed of unusually penetrating qualities  my dear aunt she said you forget i am in mourning for my stepfather monsieur feurgéres who was very good to me  a company of perfectly bred people accepted the remark in sympathetic silence there was not even an eyebrow raised but i fancy that isobels words calmly spoken and with obvious intent struck the keynote of her future relations with her aunt  isobel a few minutes later brought her cousin over to me  adelaide is very anxious to know you arnold she said quietly this was all the introduction she offered immediately afterwards her aunt called isobel away to be presented to a new arrival  mr greatson adelaide said earnestly i cannot tell you how delighted i am that all this trouble is over and that isobel is coming to us but i thinki think she is paying too great a price i think my mother is hatefully wickedly cruel  my dear young lady i protested i do not think that you must say that your mothers conditions are necessary in fact whether she made them or not i think that they would be inevitable  you are not even to come to illghera with us not to visit us even  i shook my head  i belong to the great family of bohemians i reminded her who have no possessions and but one dress suit what should i do at court  what indeed she answered with a little sigh for you are a citizen of the greater world  there is no such thing i answered we carry our own world with us we make it small or large with our own hands  for some she murmured the task then is very difficult where one lives in a forcinghouse of conventions and the doors are fast locked it is very easy to be stifled but it is hard indeed to breathe  princess i said gravely have you examined the windows  i do not understand you she answered  but it is simple surely i declared even if you must remain in the forcinghouse it is for you to open the windows and breathe what air you will for your thoughts at least are free and it is of our thoughts that our lives are fashioned  she sighed  ah mr greatson she said one does not talk like that at court  you have a great opportunity i answered character is a flower which blossoms in all manner of places sometimes it comes nearest to perfection in the most unlikely spots prosperity and sunshine are not the best things in the world for it sometimes in the gloomy and desolate places its growth is the sturdiest and its flowers the sweetest  the service of dinner had been announced the english ambassador took adelaide away from me but as she accepted his arm she looked me in the eyes with a grave but wonderfully sweet smile  i thank you very much mr greatson she said our little conversation has been most pleasant  the archduchess swept up to me she was looking a little annoyed  mr greatson she said isobel is pleading shynessan absurd excuse she insists that you take her in to dinner i suppose she must have her own way tonight but it is annoying  madame looked at me as though it were my fault that her plans were disarranged which was a little unfair and then isobel very serene but with that weary look about the eyes which seemed only to have increased during the evening came quietly up and took my arm  if this is to be our last evening arnold we will at least spend as much of it as possible together she said gently i will be a very dutiful niece aunt tomorrow  we moved off together but not before i was struck with something singular in madames expression she stood looking at us two as though some wholly new idea had presented itself to her she did not follow us into the diningroom for some few moments  the dinner itself for an informal one was a very brilliant function there were eighteen of us at a large round table which would easily have accommodated twentyfour the cardinal whose scarlet robes in themselves formed a strange note of colour sat on the archduchesss right touching scarcely any of the dishes which were continually presented to him and sipping occasionally from the glass of water at his side the other men and women were all distinguished and their conversation mostly carried on in french was apt and at times brilliant isobel and i perhaps the former particularly contributed least to the general fund isobel met the advances of her righthand neighbour with the barest of monosyllables lady delahaye who sat on my left left me for the most part discreetly alone yet we two spoke very little i could see that isobel was disposed to be hysterical and that her outward calm was only attained by means of an unnatural effort yet i fancied that my being near soothed her and every time i spoke to her or she to me a certain relief came into her face all the while i was conscious of one strange thing the archduchess although she had the cardinal on one side and the prince of cleves on the other was continually watching us her interest in their conversation was purely superficial her interest in us on the contrary was an absorbing one i could not understand it at all  the conclusion of dinner was marked by an absence of all ceremony the cigarettes had already been passed round before the archduchess rose but those who chose to remain at the table did so isobel leaned over and whispered in my ear  come with me into the drawingroom i want to talk to you  i obeyed and the archduchess seemed to me purposely to leave us alone we sat in a quiet corner and when i saw that there were tears in isobels eyes i knew that my time of trial was not yet over  arnold she said quietly you carewhether i am happy or not you have done so much for meyou must care  you cannot doubt it isobel i answered  i do not this sort of life will not suit me at all i do not trust my aunt i am weary of strangers let us give it all up take me back to london with you i feel as though i were going into prison  dear isobel i said you must remember why we decided that it was right for you to rejoin your people  oh i know she answered but even to the last monsieur feurgéres hesitated my mother would never have wished me to be miserable  i shook my head  i believe that feurgéres was right i answered i believe that your mother would wish to see you in your rightful place i believe that it is your duty to claim it  then i think that for the first time isobel was unfair to me and spoke words which hurt  you do not wish to have me back again she said slowly i have been a trouble to you i know and i have upset your life you want me to go away  i did not answer her i could not she leaned forward and looked into my face and instantly her tone changed her soft fingers clutched mine for a moment  dear arnold she whispered i am sorry forgive me i will do what you think best i did not mean to hurt you  i am quite sure that you did not isobel i answered listen i am speaking now for allan as well as for myself and for arthur too to tear you out of our lives is the hardest thing we have ever had to do your coming changed everything for us we were never so happy before we shall never know anything like it again if you were what we thought a nameless and friendless child you would be welcome back again more welcome than i can tell you but you have your own life to live and it is not ours you have your own place to fill in the world and forgive me your mothers memory to vindicate monsieur feurgéres was right for her sake you must claim the things that are yours  but shall i never see you again arnold she asked with a little catch in her breath  i set my teeth i could see that the archduchess was watching us  our ways must lie far apart isobel i said but who can say many things may happen the princess isobel may visit the studios when she is in london or at homburg she may patronize the poor writer whose books she knows  isobel sat and listened to me with stony face  i wonder she murmured why the way to ones duty lies always through hell  isobels lips were quivering and i dared make no effort to console her the archduchess came suddenly across the room to us and bent affectionately over isobel  my dear child she said you are overtired go and talk to adelaide she is alone in the musicroom i have something to say to mr greatson  isobel rose and left us at once the archduchess took her place she was carrying a fan of black ostrich feathers and she waved it languidly for some time as though in deep thought  mr greatson she said at length  i turned and found her eyes fixed curiously upon me these were moments which i remembered all my life and every little detail in connection with them seemed flashed into my memory the strange perfume something like the burning of wood spice wafted towards me by her fan the glitter of the blue black sequins which covered her magnificent gown the faint smile upon her parted lips and the meaning in her eyesall these things made their instantaneous and ineffaceable impression then she leaned a little closer to me  mr greatson she repeated i know your secret     chapter ix   i am afraid that for the moment i lost my selfpossession i had gone through so much during the last few hours and this woman spoke with such confidenceso quietly and yet with such absolute convictionthat i felt the barriers which i had built about myself crumbling away i answered her lamely and without conviction  my secret i do not know what you mean i have no secret  the black feathers fluttered backwards and forwards once more she regarded me still with the same quiet smile  you love my niece mr greatson she said  madame i answered you are jesting  indeed i am not she declared i have made a statement which is perfectly true  i deny it i exclaimed hoarsely  you can deny it as much as you like if you think it worth while to perjure yourself she replied coolly the truth remains i have had a good deal of experience in such matters you love isobel and i am not at all sure that isobel does not love you  madame i protested such statements are absurd i am no longer a young man i am thirtyfour years old i have no longer any thought of marriage isobel is no more than a child i was nearly her present age when she was born the whole idea as i trust you will see is ridiculous  the archduchess regarded me still with unchanged face  your protestations mr greatson she said amuse but utterly fail to convince me  let us drop the subject then i said hastily at least if you persist in your hallucination i hope you will believe this i have never spoken a word of what could be called lovemaking to the child in my life  i believe you implicitly she answered promptly i believe that i know and can appreciate your position let me tell you that i honour you for it  madame i murmured you are very good let us now abandon the subject  by no means she answered on the contrary i should like to discuss it with you fully  madame i exclaimed  let us suppose for a moment she went on calmly that i am correct that you really love isobel but that your peculiar position has imposed upon your sense of honour the necessity for silence well your guardianship of her may now be considered to have ended from tonight it has passed into my hands still you would say the difference between your positions is immeasurable you are i doubt not a gentleman by birth but isobel comes from one of the ancient and noble families of the world and might almost expect to share a throne with the man whom she elects to marry it is true in effect mr greatson that you are of different worlds  madame i answered why do you trouble to demonstrate such obvious facts they are incontestable but supposing for a moment that your surmises concerning myself were true you will understand that they are painful for me to listen to  you must have patience mr greatson she said quietly at present i am feeling my way through my thoughts there is rash blood in isobels veins and i should like her life to be happier than her mothers she is unconventional and a lover of freedom the etiquette of our court at illghera will chafe her continually i wonder mr greatson if she would not be happiermarried to some one of humbler birth perhaps but who can give her the sort of life she desires  i was for a moment dumb with astonishment apart from the amazement of the whole thing the archduchess was not in the least the sort of person to be seriously interested in the abstract question of isobels happiness at least i should not have supposed her capable of it i imagine that she must have read my thoughts for after a searching glance at me she continued  you doubt my disinterestedness mr greatson perhaps you are right i wish the child well but there is also this fact to be considered isobel married to an english gentleman such as say yourself would be no longer a serious rival to my daughter in the affections of her grandfather  then indeed i began to understand what a woman of resource she watched me closely behind the feathers of her fan  come she said this time my plot is an innocent one and it is for isobels happiness as well as for my daughters benefit speak to her now marry her at once here in paris and i will give her for dowry twenty thousand pounds  i ground my heel into the carpet and i was grateful for those long black feathers which waved gracefully in front of my face for i was temptedsorely tempted the womans words rang like mad music in my brain speak to her why not it was the great joy of the world which waited for me to pluck it why not i was not an old man the child was fond of me a single word of compliance and i might step into my kingdom oh the rapture of it the wonderful joy of taking her hands in mine of dropping once and for ever the mask from my face the gag from my tongue a rush of wild thoughts turned me dizzy my secret was no longer a secret at all the archduchess leaned a little closer to me and whispered behind those fluttering feathers  you are a very wonderful person mr greatson that you have kept silence so long the necessity for it has passed the child loves you i am sure of it  but my moment of weakness was over i had a sudden vision of feurgéres standing on the stage listening with bowed head to the thunder of applause but with his eyes turned always to the darkened box with its lonely bouquet of pink roseslonely to all save him who alone saw the hand which held themof feurgéres in his sanctuary bending lovingly over that chair empty to all save him feurgéres with that smile of unearthly happiness upon his lipscalm debonair and steadfast this was the man who had trusted me i raised my head  madame i said quietly what you suggest is impossible  she stared at me in incredulous astonishment  but i do not understand she exclaimed weakly you agree surely  i shook my head  on the contrary madame i said i beg that you will not allude further to the matter  the archduchess muttered something in german to herself which i did not understand perhaps it was just as well  you will vouchsafe me she begged speaking very slowly and keeping her eyes fixed on me some reason for your refusal  i will give you two i answered first it is contrary to the spirit of my promise to monsieur feurgéres  her lip curled  well  secondly i continued i should be taking a dishonourable advantage of my position with regard to isobel she is very grateful to me and she would very likely mistake her sentiments if i were to speak to her as you suggest she is too young to know what love is she has met no young men of her own rank she does not understand in the least what sort of position is in store for her  these are your reasons then  i venture to think that they are sufficient ones madame i answered  the archduchess rose  we shall need a new cervantes she remarked to do justice to the englishman of today i shall keep my word mr greatson as regards isobel and i can promise you this if gaiety and eligible suitors and the luxury of her new life are not sufficient to stifle any sentimental follies she may be nursing just now i will not rest till i find other means adelaides future is arranged i will set myself to make isobels equally brilliant i will make her the beauty of europe she shall forget in a month the squalid days of her life with you and your friends in an attic  so long as isobel is happy i answered my mission is accomplished and i am content  you are a fool and a liar she answered contemptuously you will love her all your days and you know it you will grow to curse the memory of this hour in which you threw away the only chance you will ever have of winning her the only chance mind i will answer for that i wish you goodevening mr greatson you are excused isobel as you are aware remains here you will find her in the musicroom with adelaide go and make your adieux and make them quickly you will be interrupted in three minutes  she swept away from me with only the slightest inclination of her head i made my way to the musicroom where isobel and her cousin were sitting together directly i entered the latter with a little nod of curious meaning to me rose and left us alone i held out my hands  isobel dear i said this must beour farewell thenfor a time  she placed her hands in mine they were as cold as ice her cheeks were white her eyes seemed fastened upon mine all the while her bosom was heaving convulsively but she said nothing  i can only wish you what arthur and allan have already wished you i said happiness you have every chance of it dear you surely deserve it for you brightened up our dull lives so that we can no one of us ever forget you think of us sometimes goodbye  i stooped and kissed her lightly on the cheek but suddenly her arms were wound around my neck with a strength which was amazing she held me to her  arnold she sobbed oh arnold  her lips were upon mine and in another second i should have been lost for my arms would have been around her the door opened and closed we heard the jingling of sequins the sweep of a silken train the archduchess had entered isobels arms fell from my neck but her cheeks were scarlet and her eyes like stars  youare going she pleaded  i am going i answered huskily  the archduchess came down the room humming a light tune  so the dread farewell is over then she exclaimed with light good humour come child no red eyes remember a waldenburg weeps only twice in her life once more goodnight mr greatson  i had reached the door isobel was standing still with outstretched arms the archduchess glided between usand i went                                       the next morning i travelled unseen by the riviera express to which the saloon of the archduchess had been attached all the way to illghera i saw her driven with the others to the villa  two days afterwards from a hill overlooking the grounds i saw an old gentleman in a pony chaise preceded by two footmen in dark green livery adelaide walked on one side and isobel on the other that night i left illghera for england     chapter x   i knew the moment i opened the door that changes were on foot our studio sittingroom was dismantled of many of its treasures allan with his coat off and a pipe in his mouth was throwing odds and ends in a promiscuous sort of way into a huge trunk which stood open upon the floor arthur a few yards off was rolling a cigarette  our meeting was not wholly free from embarrassment i think that for the first time in our lives there was a cloud between allan and myself he stood up and faced me squarely  arnold he said where is isobel  in illghera with her grandfather i answered where else should she be  are you sure  i have seen her there with my own eyes i affirmed  there was a moments pause i saw the two exchange glances then allan held out his hand  that damned woman again he exclaimed forgive me arnold  willingly i answered when i know what for  suspecting you lady delahaye wrote arthur a note in which she said that the archduchess and you had made fresh plans you can guess what they were and illghera was off you did hurry us away from paris a bit you know and i was fool enough to imagine for a moment that there might be something in it forgive me arnold he added holding out his hand  and me arthur exclaimed extending his  i held out a hand to each there was something grimly humorous in this reception after all that i had suffered during the last few days my first impulse of anger died away almost as quickly as it had been conceived  my friends i said the archduchess did propose some such scheme to me but you forget that my honour was involved not only to you not only to the child but to a dead man i can look you both in the face and assure you that in word and letter i have been faithful to my trust  i knew it allan declared gruffly dear old chap forgive me  i am the brute who dangled the letter before his eyes arthur exclaimed bitterly and i am the only one of the three who has broken our covenant  my dear friends i said slowly the things which are past let us forget isobel has gone back to the life which claimed her no barrier which human hand could rear could separate her from us so effectually and irrevocably as the mere fact that she has taken up the position which belongs to her she is the princess isobel of waldenburg a kings grandchild and we arewhat we are let me now make my confession to you i too loved her  the two hands which held mine tightened for a moment their grasp the old camaraderie was established once more  it is i who was responsible for her coming i continued it is only fitting that i too should suffer how she grew into our hearts you all know she has gone and nothing can ever be the same yet i for one do not regret it i regret nothing i am content to live with the memory of these wonderful days she spent with us  and i allan declared  and i arthur echoed  i wrung their hands for it was a joy to me to feel that we had come once more into complete accord  you know what sort of a state we were drifting into when she came i continued we were like thousands of others we were rubbing shoulders hour by hour and day by day with the world which takes no account of beautiful things she came and laid the magicians hand upon our lives we had perforce to alter our ways to alter our surroundings our amusements our ideals joy came with her and pain may find a secret place in our hearts now that she has gone but i do not think that either of us would willingly blot out from his life these last two years would you arthur  not i he declared we had to learn ourselves to teach her to chuck the things that were rotten anyhow just because she was around jolly good for us too  i agree with arthur and you allan said i agree with all that you have said the child was dear to me too so dear that i do not think that it would be easy to go back to our old life without her that is why  he glanced around the room our hands fell apart i lit a cigarette and looked at the open trunk  you are going away allan  he nodded  im off to canada he said ive an old uncle there whos worth looking after and hes always bothering me to pay him a visit right time of the year tooand hang it all arnold ive sat here for a week in front of an empty canvas and id go to hell sooner than stand it any longer  and you arthur  i have been appointed manager of our paris depôt arthur answered a little grandiloquently i couldnt refuse it much better pay and more fun and all that sort of thing andoh hang it all arnold is it likely a fellow could stay here now shes gone he wound up with a little catch in his throat  so the old days were over i looked at my desk and by the side of it was the chair in which she used sometimes to sit while i read to her then i think that i too was glad that this change was to come  there is one thing arnold mabane said quietly about her things we locked the door of her room mrs burdett has packed up most of her clothes but there are the ornaments and a few little things of her own we should like to go inarthur and i we have waited for you  we will go now i answered she will have no need of anything that she has left behind we will each choose a keepsake and lock the rest up  we entered the room all together almost on tiptoe if we had been wearing hats i am sure that we should have taken them off how with such trifling means at her command she could have left behind in that tiny chamber so potent an impression of daintiness and comfort i cannot tell but there it was her little bed with its spotless counterpane was hung with pink muslin there was a lace spread upon her toilettable on which her little oddments of silver made a brave show only one thing seemed out of place a worn little slipper peeping out from under a chair i thrust it into my pocket the others took some trifle from the table then as silently as we had entered we left the room as i turned the key i choked down something in my throat and did my best to laugha little unnaturally i am afraid  come i cried it is i who am responsible for this attack of sentiment i will show you how to get rid of it you dine with me at hautboys i have moneylots of it feurgéres left me twenty thousand pounds hautboys and a magnum of the best how long will you fellows be dressing  they tried to fall into my mood allan mixed cocktails we drank and smoked and shouted to one another uproariously from our rooms as we changed our clothes we drove to hautboys three in a hansom and arthur spent his usual five minutes chaffing the young lady behind the tiny bar but when the wine came and our glasses were filled a sudden silence fell upon us we looked at each other and we all knew what was in the minds of all of us it was allan who spoke  to isobel he said softly  we drank in silence each busy with his own thoughts but afterwards arthur raised his glass high above his head  to the princess isobel he cried long life and good luck to her  afterwards there were no more toasts                                       arthur and allan went their several ways within twentyfour hours of our farewell dinner i saw them both off and i forced them with great difficulty to share to some small extent in feurgéres legacy then i took some rooms near my club in the heart of london and line for line word for word i rewrote the whole of the story which i had not dared to show to isobel determined that the one thing i still had which was part of her body and soul should be the best that my brain and skill could fashion so the winter and the early spring passed and then my story was published     chapter xi   a miracle of white daintiness from the spotless muslin of her gown to the creamy lace which hung from her parasol so far as toilette went lady delahaye was always an artist yet my pulses were unmoved and my heart unstirred as she stood under my dark cedartree and welcomed me with all the expression which her tone and eyes could command  so you see sir hermit she murmured what happens to those who will not go to the mountain seriously i hope you are glad to see me  why not i answered calmly will you come inside or shall we sit here in the shade  here by all means she answered subsiding gracefully into a wicker chair  you will let me order you some tea  she checked my movement towards the house  for heavens sake no i have been paying calls all the afternoon with mrs jerningham and you know what that means she has gone to the hall now and i am to pick her up in half an hour  you are staying at eastford house then i remarked  for a few days can you guess why  the house parties there have the reputation of being amusing i suggested  she shook her head  it was not that can you make no better guess  i am a dunce at riddles i admitted  you are a dunce at many things she replied the reason i came was because i knew that you were living in these parts and i had a fancy to see you again  you are very good i remarked  she looked at me critically  you have not changed she said slowly one would almost say that the life of a recluse agrees with you you have by no means the white and wasted look which i expected is it fame which you have found so potent a tonic  i laughed lightly  dont call it fame i answered success if you will my profession is so much of a lottery a whiff of public opinion a criticism which hits the popular fancy and the bubble is floated im not pretending that i dont appreciate it but it was a stroke of luck all the same  she was silent for a few moments from outside we could hear the jingling of harness as mrs jerninghams fat bays resented the onslaught of officious flies nearer at hand there was only the lazy humming of bees to break the stillness of the summer afternoon lady delahaye sighed  you are talking nonsense and you know it she said i do not want to flatter you any man who has the trick of the pen and chooses to give himself wholly and utterly away can write a powerful story  i am afraid that i do not understand you i protested  yes you do you cut open your own heart and you offered the world a magnifying glass to study its wounds you wrote your own story you told the tale of your own suffering of course it was strong of course it rang with all the truth of genius so you loved that child arnold you a man of the world not a callow schoolboy you loved her magnificently did she know  she did not know i answered she never will know  she may read the book  she may read it and yet not know i answered  it is true she murmured unless she loved herself she might not understand  again we were silent for a while the perfume of the cedars floated upon the hot breathless air lady delahaye half closed her eyes and leaned back  you read the newspapers sir hermit  sometimes  you have heard the news from waldenburg  i read of the kings death  and of the betrothal of the princess isobel  yes i have read also of that  the cousins will both be the consorts of reigning sovereigns small though their kingdoms may be one reads great things of adelaide her people call her already the wellbeloved  a swift rush of thought carried me back to the dark stormy crossing when the rain had beaten in our faces and the wind came booming down the channel adelaide stood once more by my side i heard the quiet bitter words the low passionate cry of her troubled heart the wellbeloved of her people after all race tells  i spoke but twice alone to the princess adelaide i said i learnt enough of her however to be sure that in any position she would do the thing that was right and gracious  and so will isobel lady delahaye said i know the race well the men are degenerates but the women have nerve to rule and courage to hold their own against the world isobels future may well be the more brilliant of the two can you realize i wonder that isobel of waldenburg was once the child who filled your brain with such strange fancies  i never think i answered of isobel of waldenburg  you are wise she answered she is as surely separated from us eternally as though she had made that little journey from which one does not return yet youyou are going to hug your wounds all your life is that wise my friend  i laughed softly  you are mistaken i assured her i have no woundsnot even regrets i believe that there are few men happier look at my home  it is beautiful she admitted  my gardens my flowers my cedartree and my books i said these are all a joy to me what more can a man want friends have moods and they pass away out of ones life the friends who smile from my study wall are patient and always ready there is one to fit every hour they do not change they are always ready to show me the way into the world beautiful to cheer me when i am sad to laugh with me when i am gay you must not waste any sympathy on me lady delahaye the man who has learnt to live alone is the man who has learnt the greatest lesson life has to teach he is the man for whom the sun shines always who carries with him for ever the magic key  lady delahaye disturbed the smoothness of my turf with the point of her parasol  are there no times she asked in a low tone when these things fail you no times when like calls for like when the human part of you finds the comfort of ashes a dead thing you and your books and your flowers she cried scornfully raising her head and looking at me with heightened colour bah you are a man are you not like the others how long will these content you how long will you stop your ears and forget that life has passions and joys which these dead things can never yield to you  until i answered the magician comes who can make me believe it and i am afraid lady delahaye that he has passed me by  she rose to her feet  i am answered she said i promise you that i will not intrude again into this paradise of wood and stone give me a cigarette to keep off these flies and take me down to the carriage thanks if one might venture upon a prophecy my dear arnold i think that i can see your fate very clearly written i do not even need your hand to read it  would the spell i asked be broken if i shared the knowledge  not in the least she answered with a hard little laugh you will become one of those halfmad sort of creatures whom people call cranks or you will marry your housekeeper in either case you will deserve your fate  so lady delahaye drove away down the white dusty road and i walked back to the study from whence her coming had brought me as i sat down to my interrupted work i smiled how little she understood  i wrote till seven oclock punctually at that hour there was a discreet knock at the door and my servant reminded me that it was time to change at a quarter before eight i strolled into the garden and selected a piece of heliotrope for the buttonhole of my dinner coat a few minutes later my dinner was served  my table was a small round one set in front of the open french windows looking a little to the right i could see the extent of my domaina low laurel hedge a sloping field beyond in which my two alderneys were standing almost kneedeep amongst the buttercups a ring fence a paddock and beyond the road to the left were my gardens the sweetness of which came stealing through the window with the very faintest breath of the slowly moving air bordered by that ancient red brick wall mellowed and crumbling with the sun and west winds of generations and in front of me my lawn and the cedartree under which lady delahaye had sat an hour or so ago and prophesied evil things my lips parted into a smile as i thought of her words did she indeed think me a creature so weak as to pile gloom on the top of sorrow to shut my eyes to all the joys of life because supreme happiness was denied me to play skittles with my selfrespect andmarry a kitchenmaid i who had turned over great pages in the book of life i who had known feurgéres wallace had left the room for a moment and i raised my glass full of clear amber wine and drank silently my evening toast i drank to the memory of the greatest love i had ever known to the man whose strong and beautiful life had taught me how to fashion my own perhaps my thoughts flashed a little further afield it was so always when i thought of feurgéres but it was to the joyous and wonderful memory of those earlier days to isobel the child i drank isobel of waldenburg had passed away into the world of shadows i courted no heartaches by vain thoughts of her i pored over no papers to find mention of her name i was content with what had gone before  i morbid lady delahaye had judged me wrongly indeed i before whom two great worlds stretched themselves continually full of countless treasures always changing yet always beautiful only yesterday i had seen the sun rise i had seen the still slumbering world break into quivering life i had seen the curtain roll up on a new act of this most wonderful of all plays to the music of an orchestra hidden indeed in my grove of chestnuts but sweeter more joyous more full of the promise of perfect things than ever a violin touched by human fingers then the thrushes had hopped out on to my dewspangled lawn where before the hot sun the grey gossamerlike mist was vanishing like breath from a mirror my roses raised their heads and the breeze from the westa lazy fluttering breezeborrowed their sweetness my peaches cracked through their full skins upon the wall and the bees commenced their eternal lullaby of murmuring sounds then at nightsuch a night as this too promised to bei had watched the shadows come creeping over the land when the sun had set and the moon had barely risen a new order of things had come the fire of the day was replaced by the infinite peace of night beyond the confines of my little domain the whole world lay hushed and hidden there were few stars as yet to mock with their passionless serenity the toilers of the earth worn out with the long days struggle only a great quieta great peaceful quietand the shadows of dim things  i morbid with eyes to see these things with a whole room full of waiting friends ready at a touch of my fingers the turning of a page to take me by the hand and lead into even other worlds as beautiful as this to scale with me the mountains or to wander along the flowerstrewn valleys lady delahaye was a very foolish woman she had seen nothing of my wellordered household of the ease the luxurysimple yet almost sybariticwith which i had surrounded myself she did not understand life from my point of viewlife as feurgéres had lived it the life sentimental but not passionate the life to be evolved by will from the tangle of bruised hopes and hot desires the life  i set down my glass empty the last drop had tasted like vinegar always one has to fight and for a while i sat in silence before my table piled now with dishes of fruit my hands gripped the sides of my chair my eyes were fixed upon a twinkling light which had shot out from the distant hillside always one has to fight for the things worth havingand the pain soon passes  in a few minutes i rose i lit a cigarette from the box which wallace had placed at my elbow and with a handful more in my pocket i stepped outside on the lawn under the cedartree something was lyingsomething pink and fluffy and very soft to the fingers as i held it at arms length a faint familiar perfume stole up from its flouncy depths the pain was all gone now i smiled as i looked at it it was lady delahayes parasol  i turned it over meditatively the fancy seized me that it had been left there on purposemy last chance eastford house was barely a mile and a half awaya very reasonable afterdinner stroll i smiled to myself as i summoned wallace from the diningroom  take this parasol over to eastford house as soon as you have served my coffee i directed lady delahaye must have left it here this afternoon  very good sir wallace answered relieving me of my burden and carrying it into the house  then i departed on my usual evening pilgrimage i entered the flower garden by a little iron gate and walked slowly amongst my roses here the air was full of delicate scentslavender insistent mignonette faint but penetrating homely wallflowers sweet even as the roses themselves night insects now were buzzing around me the bushes took to themselves phantasmal shapes even the path very narrow and overgrown was hard to find i filled my hand with flowers and made my way slowly back to the cedartree the shadows were deeper now it was the one hour of darkness before the rising of the late moon i threw myself into a low chair and the flowers on to the seat which encircled the cedartree oh wonderful feurgéres who had taught me the sweetness of such moments as this  always she came the same way yet tonight it seemed to me that a startling note of reality heralded her coming the ghostliness of her movements that noiseless flitting across the lawn were changed almost i could have sworn that the little iron gate had indeed been opened and closed that real footsteps had fallen lightly enough but with actual sound upon the gravel path that i could hear the soft swish of a real dress from the slim white figure which came hesitatingly across the lawn oh feurgéres was a great man it was a great thing which he had taught me my pulses were thrilled with expectant joy reality itself could be no more real but tonighttonight was a triumph indeed she was dressed differently she wore a long white travelling cloak a veil pushed back from her hat i did not understand my fancy had never dressed her like this that little cry her pause had i indeed done greater things than feurgéres and summoned to my side real flesh and blood  arnold  i gripped the sides of my chair i felt my breath coming shorter a cry i could not keep it back from my quivering lips  isobel  i could not move i was afraid of what i had done and then she dropped on her knees by my side and real arms were about my neck real kisses were upon my lips then i no longer had any fear for from whatever world she had come the joy of it was like a foretaste of heaven i drew her to me held her passionately and i knew that this was no creature of my minds fashioning but a live woman whose heart beat so wildly against my own  it was all adelaide she murmured presently she brought me your book and afterwards we talked she was alone with my grandfatherand then he sent for me i was afraid for this was in his last days shall i tell you what he said arnold  yes i answered tightening my grasp upon her go on talking for i was fighting still for belief  he took my hand quite calmly and i knew at once that i had nothing to fear isobel he said they tell me that you have your mothers blood in your veins that freedom means more to you than ambition that you are a woman first and a waldenburg afterwards is this true then i told him everything and he kissed me go your own way isobel he said but stay with me while i live adelaide has shown me many things which i did not understand poor child he sent for his lawyers arnold and he made me a poor woman i am much too poor to be a princess any longerunless i may be yours  then i believedthis the strangest of all things that may happen to a man my garden of fancies which feurgéres had shown me so well how to cultivate passed away into the mists before the moon rose paradise was there   the
