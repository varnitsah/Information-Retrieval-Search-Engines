18464645	out of times abyss   by  edgar rice burroughs   jtable 5 5 1   chapter i  this is the tale of bradley after he left fort dinosaur upon the west coast of the great lake that is in the center of the island  upon the fourth day of september 1916 he set out with four companions sinclair brady james and tippet to search along the base of the barrier cliffs for a point at which they might be scaled  through the heavy caspakian air beneath the swollen sun the five men marched northwest from fort dinosaur now waistdeep in lush jungle grasses starred with myriad gorgeous blooms now across open meadowland and parklike expanses and again plunging into dense forests of eucalyptus and acacia and giant arboreous ferns with feathered fronds waving gently a hundred feet above their heads  about them upon the ground among the trees and in the air over them moved and swung and soared the countless forms of caspaks teeming life  always were they menaced by some frightful thing and seldom were their rifles cool yet even in the brief time they had dwelt upon caprona they had become callous to danger so that they swung along laughing and chatting like soldiers on a summer hike  this reminds me of south clark street remarked brady who had once served on the traffic squad in chicago and as no one asked him why he volunteered that it was because its no place for an irishman  south clark street and heaven have something in common then suggested sinclair  james and tippet laughed and then a hideous growl broke from a dense thicket ahead and diverted their attention to other matters  one of them behemoths of oly writ muttered tippet as they came to a halt and with guns ready awaited the almost inevitable charge  hungry lot o beggars these said bradley always trying to eat everything they see  for a moment no further sound came from the thicket  he may be feeding now suggested bradley  well try to go around him  cant waste ammunition  wont last forever  follow me  and he set off at right angles to their former course hoping to avert a charge  they had taken a dozen steps perhaps when the thicket moved to the advance of the thing within it the leafy branches parted and the hideous head of a gigantic bear emerged  pick your trees whispered bradley  cant waste ammunition  the men looked about them  the bear took a couple of steps forward still growling menacingly  he was exposed to the shoulders now tippet took one look at the monster and bolted for the nearest tree and then the bear charged  he charged straight for tippet  the other men scattered for the various trees they had selectedall except bradley  he stood watching tippet and the bear  the man had a good start and the tree was not far away but the speed of the enormous creature behind him was something to marvel at yet tippet was in a fair way to make his sanctuary when his foot caught in a tangle of roots and down he went his rifle flying from his hand and falling several yards away  instantly bradleys piece was at his shoulder there was a sharp report answered by a roar of mingled rage and pain from the carnivore  tippet attempted to scramble to his feet  lie still shouted bradley  cant waste ammunition  the bear halted in its tracks wheeled toward bradley and then back again toward tippet  again the formers rifle spit angrily and the bear turned again in his direction  bradley shouted loudly  come on you behemoth of holy writ he cried  come on you duffer  cant waste ammunition  and as he saw the bear apparently upon the verge of deciding to charge him he encouraged the idea by backing rapidly away knowing that an angry beast will more often charge one who moves than one who lies still  and the bear did charge  like a bolt of lightning he flashed down upon the englishman  now run  bradley called to tippet and himself turned in flight toward a nearby tree  the other men now safely ensconced upon various branches watched the race with breathless interest  would bradley make it  it seemed scarce possible  and if he didnt  james gasped at the thought  six feet at the shoulder stood the frightful mountain of bloodmad flesh and bone and sinew that was bearing down with the speed of an express train upon the seemingly slowmoving man  it all happened in a few seconds but they were seconds that seemed like hours to the men who watched  they saw tippet leap to his feet at bradleys shouted warning  they saw him run stooping to recover his rifle as he passed the spot where it had fallen  they saw him glance back toward bradley and then they saw him stop short of the tree that might have given him safety and turn back in the direction of the bear firing as he ran tippet raced after the great cave bearthe monstrous thing that should have been extinct ages beforeran for it and fired even as the beast was almost upon bradley  the men in the trees scarcely breathed  it seemed to them such a futile thing for tippet to do and tippet of all men  they had never looked upon tippet as a cowardthere seemed to be no cowards among that strangely assorted company that fate had gathered together from the four corners of the earthbut tippet was considered a cautious man  overcautious some thought him  how futile he and his little popgun appeared as he dashed after that living engine of destruction  but oh how glorious it was some such thought as this that ran through bradys mind though articulated it might have been expressed otherwise albeit more forcefully  just then it occurred to brady to fire and he too opened upon the bear but at the same instant the animal stumbled and fell forward though still growling most fearsomely  tippet never stopped running or firing until he stood within a foot of the brute which lay almost touching bradley and was already struggling to regain its feet placing the muzzle of his gun against the bears ear tippet pulled the trigger  the creature sank limply to the ground and bradley scrambled to his feet  good work tippet he said  mightily obliged to youawful waste of ammunition really  and then they resumed the march and in fifteen minutes the encounter had ceased even to be a topic of conversation  for two days they continued upon their perilous way  already the cliffs loomed high and forbidding close ahead without sign of break to encourage hope that somewhere they might be scaled  late in the afternoon the party crossed a small stream of warm water upon the sluggishly moving surface of which floated countless millions of tiny green eggs surrounded by a light scum of the same color though of a darker shade  their past experience of caspak had taught them that they might expect to come upon a stagnant pool of warm water if they followed the stream to its source but there they were almost certain to find some of caspaks grotesque manlike creatures  already since they had disembarked from the u33 after its perilous trip through the subterranean channel beneath the barrier cliffs had brought them into the inland sea of caspak had they encountered what had appeared to be three distinct types of these creatures  there had been the pure apeshuge gorillalike beastsand those who walked a trifle more erect and had features with just a shade more of the human cast about them  then there were men like ahm whom they had captured and confined at the fortahm the clubman  wellknown clubman tyler had called him  ahm and his people had knowledge of a speech  they had a language in which they were unlike the race just inferior to them and they walked much more erect and were less hairy but it was principally the fact that they possessed a spoken language and carried a weapon that differentiated them from the others  all of these peoples had proven belligerent in the extreme  in common with the rest of the fauna of caprona the first law of nature as they seemed to understand it was to killkillkill  and so it was that bradley had no desire to follow up the little stream toward the pool near which were sure to be the caves of some savage tribe but fortune played him an unkind trick for the pool was much closer than he imagined its southern end reaching fully a mile south of the point at which they crossed the stream and so it was that after forcing their way through a tangle of jungle vegetation they came out upon the edge of the pool which they had wished to avoid  almost simultaneously there appeared south of them a party of naked men armed with clubs and hatchets  both parties halted as they caught sight of one another  the men from the fort saw before them a hunting party evidently returning to its caves or village laden with meat they were large men with features closely resembling those of the african negro though their skins were white  short hair grew upon a large portion of their limbs and bodies which still retained a considerable trace of apish progenitors  they were however a distinctly higher type than the bolu or clubmen  bradley would have been glad to have averted a meeting but as he desired to lead his party south around the end of the pool and as it was hemmed in by the jungle on one side and the water on the other there seemed no escape from an encounter  on the chance that he might avoid a clash bradley stepped forward with upraised hand  we are friends he called in the tongue of ahm the bolu who had been held a prisoner at the fort permit us to pass in peace  we will not harm you  at this the hatchetmen set up a great jabbering with much laughter loud and boisterous  no shouted one you will not harm us for we shall kill you  come  we kill  we kill and with hideous shouts they charged down upon the europeans  sinclair you may fire said bradley quietly  pick off the leader cant waste ammunition  the englishman raised his piece to his shoulder and took quick aim at the breast of the yelling savage leaping toward them  directly behind the leader came another hatchetman and with the report of sinclairs rifle both warriors lunged forward in the tall grass pierced by the same bullet  the effect upon the rest of the band was electrical  as one man they came to a sudden halt wheeled to the east and dashed into the jungle where the men could hear them forcing their way in an effort to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the authors of this new and frightful noise that killed warriors at a great distance  both the savages were dead when bradley approached to examine them and as the europeans gathered around other eyes were bent upon them with greater curiosity than they displayed for the victim of sinclairs bullet  when the party again took up the march around the southern end of the pool the owner of the eyes followed themlarge round eyes almost expressionless except for a certain cold cruelty which glinted malignly from under their pale gray irises  all unconscious of the stalker the men came late in the afternoon to a spot which seemed favorable as a campsite  a cold spring bubbled from the base of a rocky formation which overhung and partially encircled a small inclosure  at bradleys command the men took up the duties assigned themgathering wood building a cookfire and preparing the evening meal  it was while they were thus engaged that bradys attention was attracted by the dismal flapping of huge wings he glanced up expecting to see one of the great flying reptiles of a bygone age his rifle ready in his hand  brady was a brave man  he had groped his way up narrow tenement stairs and taken an armed maniac from a dark room without turning a hair but now as he looked up he went white and staggered back  gawd he almost screamed  what is it  attracted by bradys cry the others seized their rifles as they followed his wideeyed frozen gaze nor was there one of them that was not moved by some species of terror or awe  then brady spoke again in an almost inaudible voice  holy mother protect usits a banshee  bradley always cool almost to indifference in the face of danger felt a strange creeping sensation run over his flesh as slowly not a hundred feet above them the thing flapped itself across the sky its huge round eyes glaring down upon them  and until it disappeared over the tops of the trees of a nearby wood the five men stood as though paralyzed their eyes never leaving the weird shape nor never one of them appearing to recall that he grasped a loaded rifle in his hands  with the passing of the thing came the reaction  tippet sank to the ground and buried his face in his hands  oh gord he moaned  tyke me awy from this orful plice  brady recovered from the first shock swore loud and luridly  he called upon all the saints to witness that he was unafraid and that anybody with half an eye could have seen that the creature was nothing more than one av thim flyin alligators that they all were familiar with  yes said sinclair with fine sarcasm weve saw so many of them with white shrouds on em  shut up you fool growled brady  if you know so much tell us what it was after bein then  then he turned toward bradley  what was it sor do you think he asked  bradley shook his head  i dont know he said  it looked like a winged human being clothed in a flowing white robe  its face was more human than otherwise  that is the way it looked to me but what it really was i cant even guess for such a creature is as far beyond my experience or knowledge as it is beyond yours  all that i am sure of is that whatever else it may have been it was quite materialit was no ghost rather just another of the strange forms of life which we have met here and with which we should be accustomed by this time  tippet looked up  his face was still ashy  yer cawnt tell me he cried  hi seen hit  blime hi seen hit  hit was ha dead man flyin through the hair  didnt hi see is heyes  oh gord didnt hi see em  it didnt look like any beast or reptile to me spoke up sinclair it was lookin right down at me when i looked up and i saw its face plain as i see yours  it had big round eyes that looked all cold and dead and its cheeks were sunken in deep and i could see its yellow teeth behind thin tightdrawn lipslike a man who had been dead a long while sir he added turning toward bradley  yes james had not spoken since the apparition had passed over them and now it was scarce speech which he utteredrather a series of articulate gasps  yesdeadalongwhile  itmeans something itcomefor someone  for oneof us  oneof us is gointo die im goin to die he ended in a wail  come  come snapped bradley  wont do  wont do at all  get to work all of you  waste of time  cant waste time  his authoritative tones brought them all up standing and presently each was occupied with his own duties but each worked in silence and there was no singing and no bantering such as had marked the making of previous camps  not until they had eaten and to each had been issued the little ration of smoking tobacco allowed after each evening meal did any sign of a relaxation of taut nerves appear  it was brady who showed the first signs of returning good spirits  he commenced humming its a long way to tipperary and presently to voice the words but he was well into his third song before anyone joined him and even then there seemed a dismal note in even the gayest of tunes  a huge fire blazed in the opening of their rocky shelter that the prowling carnivora might be kept at bay and always one man stood on guard watchfully alert against a sudden rush by some maddened beast of the jungle  beyond the fire yellowgreen spots of flame appeared moved restlessly about disappeared and reappeared accompanied by a hideous chorus of screams and growls and roars as the hungry meateaters hunting through the night were attracted by the light or the scent of possible prey  but to such sights and sounds as these the five men had become callous they sang or talked as unconcernedly as they might have done in the barroom of some publichouse at home  sinclair was standing guard  the others were listening to bradys description of traffic congestion at the rush street bridge during the rush hour at night  the fire crackled cheerily  the owners of the yellowgreen eyes raised their frightful chorus to the heavens conditions seemed again to have returned to normal  and then as though the hand of death had reached out and touched them all the five men tensed into sudden rigidity  above the nocturnal diapason of the teeming jungle sounded a dismal flapping of wings and over head through the thick night a shadowy form passed across the diffused light of the flaring campfire sinclair raised his rifle and fired  an eerie wail floated down from above and the apparition whatever it might have been was swallowed by the darkness  for several seconds the listening men heard the sound of those dismally flapping wings lessening in the distance until they could no longer be heard  bradley was the first to speak  shouldnt have fired sinclair he said cant waste ammunition  but there was no note of censure in his tone  it was as though he understood the nervous reaction that had compelled the others act  i couldnt help it sir said sinclair  lord it would take an iron man to keep from shootin at that awful thing  do you believe in ghosts sir  no replied bradley  no such things  i dont know about that said brady  there was a woman murdered over on the prairie near brightonher throat was cut from ear to ear and  shut up snapped bradley  my grandaddy used to live down coppington wy said tippet  they were a hold ruined castle on a ill near by hand at midnight they used to see pale blue lights through the windows an ear  will you close your hatch demanded bradley  you fools will have yourselves scared to death in a minute  now go to sleep  but there was little sleep in camp that night until utter exhaustion overtook the harassed men toward morning nor was there any return of the weird creature that had set the nerves of each of them on edge  the following forenoon the party reached the base of the barrier cliffs and for two days marched northward in an effort to discover a break in the frowning abutment that raised its rocky face almost perpendicularly above them yet nowhere was there the slightest indication that the cliffs were scalable  disheartened bradley determined to turn back toward the fort as he already had exceeded the time decided upon by bowen tyler and himself for the expedition  the cliffs for many miles had been trending in a northeasterly direction indicating to bradley that they were approaching the northern extremity of the island  according to the best of his calculations they had made sufficient easting during the past two days to have brought them to a point almost directly north of fort dinosaur and as nothing could be gained by retracing their steps along the base of the cliffs he decided to strike due south through the unexplored country between them and the fort  that night september 9 1916 they made camp a short distance from the cliffs beside one of the numerous cool springs that are to be found within caspak oftentimes close beside the still more numerous warm and hot springs which feed the many pools  after supper the men lay smoking and chatting among themselves  tippet was on guard  fewer night prowlers threatened them and the men were commenting upon the fact that the farther north they had traveled the smaller the number of all species of animals became though it was still present in what would have seemed appalling plenitude in any other part of the world the diminution in reptilian life was the most noticeable change in the fauna of northern caspak  here however were forms they had not met elsewhere several of which were of gigantic proportions  according to their custom all with the exception of the man on guard sought sleep early nor once disposed upon the ground for slumber were they long in finding it  it seemed to bradley that he had scarcely closed his eyes when he was brought to his feet wide awake by a piercing scream which was punctuated by the sharp report of a rifle from the direction of the fire where tippet stood guard  as he ran toward the man bradley heard above him the same uncanny wail that had set every nerve on edge several nights before and the dismal flapping of huge wings  he did not need to look up at the whiteshrouded figure winging slowly away into the night to know that their grim visitor had returned  the muscles of his arm reacting to the sight and sound of the menacing form carried his hand to the butt of his pistol but after he had drawn the weapon he immediately returned it to its holster with a shrug  what for he muttered  cant waste ammunition  then he walked quickly to where tippet lay sprawled upon his face  by this time james brady and sinclair were at his heels each with his rifle in readiness  is he dead sir whispered james as bradley kneeled beside the prostrate form  bradley turned tippet over on his back and pressed an ear close to the others heart  in a moment he raised his head  fainted he announced  get water  hurry  then he loosened tippets shirt at the throat and when the water was brought threw a cupful in the mans face  slowly tippet regained consciousness and sat up  at first he looked curiously into the faces of the men about him then an expression of terror overspread his features  he shot a startled glance up into the black void above and then burying his face in his arms began to sob like a child  whats wrong man demanded bradley  buck up  cant play crybaby waste of energy  what happened  wot appened sir wailed tippet  oh gord sir   hit came back hit came for me sir  right hit did sir strite hat me sir hand with long wite ands it clawed for me  oh gord  hit almost caught me sir  him has good as dead him a marked man thats wot hi ham hit was agoin for to carry me horf sir  stuff and nonsense snapped bradley  did you get a good look at it  tippet said that he dida much better look than he wanted  the thing had almost clutched him and he had looked straight into its eyesdead heyes in a dead face he had described them  wot was it after bein do you think inquired brady  hit was death moaned tippet shuddering and again a pall of gloom fell upon the little party  the following day tippet walked as one in a trance  he never spoke except in reply to a direct question which more often than not had to be repeated before it could attract his attention  he insisted that he was already a dead man for if the thing didnt come for him during the day he would never live through another night of agonized apprehension waiting for the frightful end that he was positive was in store for him  ill see to that he said and they all knew that tippet meant to take his own life before darkness set in  bradley tried to reason with him in his short crisp way but soon saw the futility of it nor could he take the mans weapons from him without subjecting him to almost certain death from any of the numberless dangers that beset their way  the entire party was moody and glum  there was none of the bantering that had marked their intercourse before even in the face of blighting hardships and hideous danger  this was a new menace that threatened them something that they couldnt explain and so naturally it aroused within them superstitious fear which tippets attitude only tended to augment  to add further to their gloom their way led through a dense forest where on account of the underbrush it was difficult to make even a mile an hour  constant watchfulness was required to avoid the many snakes of various degrees of repulsiveness and enormity that infested the wood and the only ray of hope they had to cling to was that the forest would like the majority of caspakian forests prove to be of no considerable extent  bradley was in the lead when he came suddenly upon a grotesque creature of titanic proportions  crouching among the trees which here commenced to thin out slightly bradley saw what appeared to be an enormous dragon devouring the carcass of a mammoth  from frightful jaws to the tip of its long tail it was fully forty feet in length its body was covered with plates of thick skin which bore a striking resemblance to armorplate  the creature saw bradley almost at the same instant that he saw it and reared up on its enormous hind legs until its head towered a full twentyfive feet above the ground  from the cavernous jaws issued a hissing sound of a volume equal to the escaping steam from the safetyvalves of half a dozen locomotives and then the creature came for the man  scatter shouted bradley to those behind him and all but tippet heeded the warning  the man stood as though dazed and when bradley saw the others danger he too stopped and wheeling about sent a bullet into the massive body forcing its way through the trees toward him the shot struck the creature in the belly where there was no protecting armor eliciting a new note which rose in a shrill whistle and ended in a wail  it was then that tippet appeared to come out of his trance for with a cry of terror he turned and fled to the left  bradley seeing that he had as good an opportunity as the others to escape now turned his attention to extricating himself and as the woods seemed dense on the right he ran in that direction hoping that the closeset boles would prevent pursuit on the part of the great reptile  the dragon paid no further attention to him however for tippets sudden break for liberty had attracted its attention and after tippet it went bowling over small trees uprooting underbrush and leaving a wake behind it like that of a small tornado  bradley the moment he had discovered the thing was pursuing tippet had followed it  he was afraid to fire for fear of hitting the man and so it was that he came upon them at the very moment that the monster lunged its great weight forward upon the doomed man  the sharp threetoed talons of the forelimbs seized poor tippet and bradley saw the unfortunate fellow lifted high above the ground as the creature again reared up on its hind legs immediately transferring tippets body to its gaping jaws which closed with a sickening crunching sound as tippets bones cracked beneath the great teeth  bradley half raised his rifle to fire again and then lowered it with a shake of his head  tippet was beyond succorwhy waste a bullet that caspak could never replace  if he could now escape the further notice of the monster it would be a wiser act than to throw his life away in futile revenge  he saw that the reptile was not looking in his direction and so he slipped noiselessly behind the bole of a large tree and thence quietly faded away in the direction he believed the others to have taken  at what he considered a safe distance he halted and looked back  half hidden by the intervening trees he still could see the huge head and the massive jaws from which protrude the limp legs of the dead man  then as though struck by the hammer of thor the creature collapsed and crumpled to the ground  bradleys single bullet penetrating the body through the soft skin of the belly had slain the titan  a few minutes later bradley found the others of the party  the four returned cautiously to the spot where the creature lay and after convincing themselves that it was quite dead came close to it  it was an arduous and gruesome job extricating tippets mangled remains from the powerful jaws the men working for the most part silently  it was the work of the banshee all right muttered brady  it warned poor tippet it did  hit killed him thats wot hit did hand hitll kill some more of us said james his lower lip trembling  if it was a ghost interjected sinclair and i dont say as it was but if it was why it could take on any form it wanted to  it might have turned itself into this thing which aint no natural thing at all just to get poor tippet  if it had of been a lion or something else humanlike it wouldnt look so strange but this here thing aint humanlike  there aint no such thing an never was  bullets dont kill ghosts said bradley so this couldnt have been a ghost  furthermore there are no such things  ive been trying to place this creature  just succeeded  its a tyrannosaurus  saw picture of skeleton in magazine  theres one in new york natural history museum  seems to me it said it was found in place called hell creek somewhere in western north america  supposed to have lived about six million years ago  hell creeks in montana said sinclair  i used to punch cows in wyoming an ive heard of hell creek  do you spose that there things six million years old  his tone was skeptical  no replied bradley but it would indicate that the island of caprona has stood almost without change for more than six million years  the conversation and bradleys assurance that the creature was not of supernatural origin helped to raise a trifle the spirits of the men and then came another diversion in the form of ravenous meateaters attracted to the spot by the uncanny sense of smell which had apprised them of the presence of flesh killed and ready for the eating  it was a constant battle while they dug a grave and consigned all that was mortal of john tippet to his last lonely restingplace  nor would they leave then but remained to fashion a rude headstone from a crumbling outcropping of sandstone and to gather a mass of the gorgeous flowers growing in such great profusion around them and heap the newmade grave with bright blooms  upon the headstone sinclair scratched in rude characters the words    here lies john tippet        englishman   killed by tyrannosaurus     10 sept ad 1916          rip  and bradley repeated a short prayer before they left their comrade forever  for three days the party marched due south through forests and meadowland and great parklike areas where countless herbivorous animals grazeddeer and antelope and bos and the little ecca the smallest species of caspakian horse about the size of a rabbit  there were other horses too but all were small the largest being not above eight hands in height  preying continually upon the herbivora were the meateaters large and smallwolves hyaenadons panthers lions tigers and bear as well as several large and ferocious species of reptilian life  on september twelfth the party scaled a line of sandstone cliffs which crossed their route toward the south but they crossed them only after an encounter with the tribe that inhabited the numerous caves which pitted the face of the escarpment  that night they camped upon a rocky plateau which was sparsely wooded with jarrah and here once again they were visited by the weird nocturnal apparition that had already filled them with a nameless terror  as on the night of september ninth the first warning came from the sentinel standing guard over his sleeping companions  a terrorstricken cry punctuated by the crack of a rifle brought bradley sinclair and brady to their feet in time to see james with clubbed rifle battling with a whiterobed figure that hovered on widespread wings on a level with the englishmans head  as they ran shouting forward it was obvious to them that the weird and terrible apparition was attempting to seize james but when it saw the others coming to his rescue it desisted flapping rapidly upward and away its long ragged wings giving forth the peculiarly dismal notes which always characterized the sound of its flying  bradley fired at the vanishing menacer of their peace and safety but whether he scored a hit or not none could tell though following the shot there was wafted back to them the same piercing wail that had on other occasions frozen their marrow  then they turned toward james who lay face downward upon the ground trembling as with ague  for a time he could not even speak but at last regained sufficient composure to tell them how the thing must have swooped silently upon him from above and behind as the first premonition of danger he had received was when the long clawlike fingers had clutched him beneath either arm  in the melee his rifle had been discharged and he had broken away at the same instant and turned to defend himself with the butt  the rest they had seen  from that instant james was an absolutely broken man  he maintained with shaking lips that his doom was sealed that the thing had marked him for its own and that he was as good as dead nor could any amount of argument or raillery convince him to the contrary  he had seen tippet marked and claimed and now he had been marked  nor were his constant reiterations of this belief without effect upon the rest of the party  even bradley felt depressed though for the sake of the others he managed to hide it beneath a show of confidence he was far from feeling  and on the following day william james was killed by a sabertooth tigerseptember 13 1916  beneath a jarrah tree on the stony plateau on the northern edge of the stolu country in the land that time forgot he lies in a lonely grave marked by a rough headstone  southward from his grave marched three grim and silent men  to the best of bradleys reckoning they were some twentyfive miles north of fort dinosaur and that they might reach the fort on the following day they plodded on until darkness overtook them  with comparative safety fifteen miles away they made camp at last but there was no singing now and no joking  in the bottom of his heart each prayed that they might come safely through just this night for they knew that during the morrow they would make the final stretch yet the nerves of each were taut with strained anticipation of what gruesome thing might flap down upon them from the black sky marking another for its own  who would be the next  as was their custom they took turns at guard each man doing two hours and then arousing the next  brady had gone on from eight to ten followed by sinclair from ten to twelve then bradley had been awakened  brady would stand the last guard from two to four as they had determined to start the moment that it became light enough to insure comparative safety upon the trail  the snapping of a twig aroused brady out of a dead sleep and as he opened his eyes he saw that it was broad daylight and that at twenty paces from him stood a huge lion  as the man sprang to his feet his rifle ready in his hand sinclair awoke and took in the scene in a single swift glance  the fire was out and bradley was nowhere in sight  for a long moment the lion and the men eyed one another  the latter had no mind to fire if the beast minded its own affairsthey were only too glad to let it go its way if it would but the lion was of a different mind  suddenly the long tail snapped stiffly erect and as though it had been attached to two trigger fingers the two rifles spoke in unison for both men knew this signal only too wellthe immediate forerunner of a deadly charge  as the brutes head had been raised his spine had not been visible and so they did what they had learned by long experience was best to do  each covered a front leg and as the tail snapped aloft fired  with a hideous roar the mighty flesheater lurched forward to the ground with both front legs broken  it was an easy accomplishment in the instant before the beast chargedafter it would have been wellnigh an impossible feat  brady stepped close in and finished him with a shot in the base of the brain lest his terrific roarings should attract his mate or others of their kind  then the two men turned and looked at one another  where is lieutenant bradley asked sinclair  they walked to the fire  only a few smoking embers remained  a few feet away lay bradleys rifle there was no evidence of a struggle  the two men circled about the camp twice and on the last lap brady stooped and picked up an object which had lain about ten yards beyond the fireit was bradleys cap again the two looked questioningly at one another and then simultaneously both pairs of eyes swung upward and searched the sky a moment later brady was examining the ground about the spot where bradleys cap had lain  it was one of those little barren sandy stretches that they had found only upon this stony plateau  bradys own footsteps showed as plainly as black ink upon white paper but his was the only foot that had marred the smooth windswept surfacethere was no sign that bradley had crossed the spot upon the surface of the ground and yet his cap lay well toward the center of it  breakfastless and with shaken nerves the two survivors plunged madly into the long days march  both were strong courageous resourceful men but each had reached the limit of human nerve endurance and each felt that he would rather die than spend another night in the hideous open of that frightful land  vivid in the mind of each was a picture of bradleys end for though neither had witnessed the tragedy both could imagine almost precisely what had occurred  they did not discuss itthey did not even mention ityet all day long the thing was uppermost in the mind of each and mingled with it a similar picture with himself as victim should they fail to make fort dinosaur before dark  and so they plunged forward at reckless speed their clothes their hands their faces torn by the retarding underbrush that reached forth to hinder them  again and again they fell but be it to their credit that the one always waited and helped the other and that into the mind of neither entered the thought or the temptation to desert his companionthey would reach the fort together if both survived or neither would reach it  they encountered the usual number of savage beasts and reptiles but they met them with a courageous recklessness born of desperation and by virtue of the very madness of the chances they took they came through unscathed and with the minimum of delay  shortly after noon they reached the end of the plateau  before them was a drop of two hundred feet to the valley beneath  to the left in the distance they could see the waters of the great inland sea that covers a considerable portion of the area of the crater island of caprona and at a little lesser distance to the south of the cliffs they saw a thin spiral of smoke arising above the treetops  the landscape was familiareach recognized it immediately and knew that that smoky column marked the spot where dinosaur had stood  was the fort still there or did the smoke arise from the smoldering embers of the building they had helped to fashion for the housing of their party  who could say  thirty precious minutes that seemed as many hours to the impatient men were consumed in locating a precarious way from the summit to the base of the cliffs that bounded the plateau upon the south and then once again they struck off upon level ground toward their goal  the closer they approached the fort the greater became their apprehension that all would not be well  they pictured the barracks deserted or the small company massacred and the buildings in ashes  it was almost in a frenzy of fear that they broke through the final fringe of jungle and stood at last upon the verge of the open meadow a halfmile from fort dinosaur  lord ejaculated sinclair  they are still there  and he fell to his knees sobbing  brady trembled like a leaf as he crossed himself and gave silent thanks for there before them stood the sturdy ramparts of dinosaur and from inside the inclosure rose a thin spiral of smoke that marked the location of the cookhouse  all was well then and their comrades were preparing the evening meal  across the clearing they raced as though they had not already covered in a single day a trackless primeval country that might easily have required two days by fresh and untired men  within hailing distance they set up such a loud shouting that presently heads appeared above the top of the parapet and soon answering shouts were rising from within fort dinosaur  a moment later three men issued from the inclosure and came forward to meet the survivors and listen to the hurried story of the eleven eventful days since they had set out upon their expedition to the barrier cliffs  they heard of the deaths of tippet and james and of the disappearance of lieutenant bradley and a new terror settled upon dinosaur  olson the irish engineer with whitely and wilson constituted the remnants of dinosaurs defenders and to brady and sinclair they narrated the salient events that had transpired since bradley and his party had marched away on september 4th  they told them of the infamous act of baron friedrich von schoenvorts and his german crew who had stolen the u33 breaking their parole and steaming away toward the subterranean opening through the barrier cliffs that carried the waters of the inland sea into the open pacific beyond and of the cowardly shelling of the fort  they told of the disappearance of miss la rue in the night of september 11th and of the departure of bowen tyler in search of her accompanied only by his airedale nobs  thus of the original party of eleven allies and nine germans that had constituted the company of the u33 when she left english waters after her capture by the crew of the english tug there were but five now to be accounted for at fort dinosaur  benson tippet james and one of the germans were known to be dead  it was assumed that bradley tyler and the girl had already succumbed to some of the savage denizens of caspak while the fate of the germans was equally unknown though it might readily be believed that they had made good their escape  they had had ample time to provision the ship and the refining of the crude oil they had discovered north of the fort could have insured them an ample supply to carry them back to germany    chapter 2  when bradley went on guard at midnight september 14th his thoughts were largely occupied with rejoicing that the night was almost spent without serious mishap and that the morrow would doubtless see them all safely returned to fort dinosaur  the hopefulness of his mood was tinged with sorrow by recollection of the two members of his party who lay back there in the savage wilderness and for whom there would never again be a homecoming  no premonition of impending ill cast gloom over his anticipations for the coming day for bradley was a man who while taking every precaution against possible danger permitted no gloomy forebodings to weigh down his spirit  when danger threatened he was prepared but he was not forever courting disaster and so it was that when about one oclock in the morning of the fifteenth he heard the dismal flapping of giant wings overhead he was neither surprised nor frightened but idly prepared for an attack he had known might reasonably be expected  the sound seemed to come from the south and presently low above the trees in that direction the man made out a dim shadowy form circling slowly about  bradley was a brave man yet so keen was the feeling of revulsion engendered by the sight and sound of that grim uncanny shape that he distinctly felt the gooseflesh rise over the surface of his body and it was with difficulty that he refrained from following an instinctive urge to fire upon the nocturnal intruder  better far better would it have been had he given in to the insistent demand of his subconscious mentor but his almost fanatical obsession to save ammunition proved now his undoing for while his attention was riveted upon the thing circling before him and while his ears were filled with the beating of its wings there swooped silently out of the black night behind him another weird and ghostly shape  with its huge wings partly closed for the dive and its white robe fluttering in its wake the apparition swooped down upon the englishman  so great was the force of the impact when the thing struck bradley between the shoulders that the man was half stunned  his rifle flew from his grasp he felt clawlike talons of great strength seize him beneath his arms and sweep him off his feet and then the thing rose swiftly with him so swiftly that his cap was blown from his head by the rush of air as he was borne rapidly upward into the inky sky and the cry of warning to his companions was forced back into his lungs  the creature wheeled immediately toward the east and was at once joined by its fellow who circled them once and then fell in behind them bradley now realized the strategy that the pair had used to capture him and at once concluded that he was in the power of reasoning beings closely related to the human race if not actually of it  past experience suggested that the great wings were a part of some ingenious mechanical device for the limitations of the human mind which is always loath to accept aught beyond its own little experience would not permit him to entertain the idea that the creatures might be naturally winged and at the same time of human origin  from his position bradley could not see the wings of his captor nor in the darkness had he been able to examine those of the second creature closely when it circled before him  he listened for the puff of a motor or some other telltale sound that would prove the correctness of his theory  however he was rewarded with nothing more than the constant flapflap  presently far below and ahead he saw the waters of the inland sea and a moment later he was borne over them  then his captor did that which proved beyond doubt to bradley that he was in the hands of human beings who had devised an almost perfect scheme of duplicating mechanically the wings of a birdthe thing spoke to its companion and in a language that bradley partially understood since he recognized words that he had learned from the savage races of caspak  from this he judged that they were human and being human he knew that they could have no natural wingsfor who had ever seen a human being so adorned  therefore their wings must be mechanical  thus bradley reasonedthus most of us reason not by what might be possible but by what has fallen within the range of our experience  what he heard them say was to the effect that having covered half the distance the burden would now be transferred from one to the other bradley wondered how the exchange was to be accomplished  he knew that those giant wings would not permit the creatures to approach one another closely enough to effect the transfer in this manner but he was soon to discover that they had other means of doing it  he felt the thing that carried him rise to a greater altitude and below he glimpsed momentarily the second whiterobed figure then the creature above sounded a low call it was answered from below and instantly bradley felt the clutching talons release him gasping for breath he hurtled downward through space  for a terrifying instant pregnant with horror bradley fell then something swooped for him from behind another pair of talons clutched him beneath the arms his downward rush was checked within another hundred feet and close to the surface of the sea he was again borne upward  as a hawk dives for a songbird on the wing so this great human bird dived for bradley  it was a harrowing experience but soon over and once again the captive was being carried swiftly toward the east and what fate he could not even guess  it was immediately following his transfer in midair that bradley made out the shadowy form of a large island far ahead and not long after he realized that this must be the intended destination of his captors nor was he mistaken  three quarters of an hour from the time of his seizure his captors dropped gently to earth in the strangest city that human eye had ever rested upon  just a brief glimpse of his immediate surroundings vouchsafed bradley before he was whisked into the interior of one of the buildings but in that momentary glance he saw strange piles of stone and wood and mud fashioned into buildings of all conceivable sizes and shapes sometimes piled high on top of one another sometimes standing alone in an open courtway but usually crowded and jammed together so that there were no streets or alleys between them other than a few which ended almost as soon as they began the principal doorways appeared to be in the roofs and it was through one of these that bradley was inducted into the dark interior of a lowceiled room  here he was pushed roughly into a corner where he tripped over a thick mat and there his captors left him  he heard them moving about in the darkness for a moment and several times he saw their large luminous eyes glowing in the dark  finally these disappeared and silence reigned broken only by the breathing of the creature which indicated to the englishman that they were sleeping somewhere in the same apartment  it was now evident that the mat upon the floor was intended for sleeping purposes and that the rough shove that had sent him to it had been a rude invitation to repose  after taking stock of himself and finding that he still had his pistol and ammunition some matches a little tobacco a canteen full of water and a razor bradley made himself comfortable upon the mat and was soon asleep knowing that an attempted escape in the darkness without knowledge of his surroundings would be predoomed to failure  when he awoke it was broad daylight and the sight that met his eyes made him rub them again and again to assure himself that they were really open and that he was not dreaming  a broad shaft of morning light poured through the open doorway in the ceiling of the room which was about thirty feet square or roughly square being irregular in shape one side curving outward another being indented by what might have been the corner of another building jutting into it another alcoved by three sides of an octagon while the fourth was serpentine in contour  two windows let in more daylight while two doors evidently gave ingress to other rooms  the walls were partially ceiled with thin strips of wood nicely fitted and finished partially plastered and the rest covered with a fine woven cloth  figures of reptiles and beasts were painted without regard to any uniform scheme here and there upon the walls  a striking feature of the decorations consisted of several engaged columns set into the walls at no regular intervals the capitals of each supporting a human skull the cranium of which touched the ceiling as though the latter was supported by these grim reminders either of departed relatives or of some hideous tribal ritebradley could not but wonder which  yet it was none of these things that filled him with greatest wonderno it was the figures of the two creatures that had captured him and brought him hither  at one end of the room a stout pole about two inches in diameter ran horizontally from wall to wall some six or seven feet from the floor its ends securely set in two of the columns hanging by their knees from this perch their heads downward and their bodies wrapped in their huge wings slept the creatures of the night beforelike two great horrid bats they hung asleep  as bradley gazed upon them in wideeyed astonishment he saw plainly that all his intelligence all his acquired knowledge through years of observation and experience were set at naught by the simple evidence of the fact that stood out glaringly before his eyesthe creatures wings were not mechanical devices but as natural appendages growing from their shoulderblades as were their arms and legs  he saw too that except for their wings the pair bore a strong resemblance to human beings though fashioned in a most grotesque mold  as he sat gazing at them one of the two awoke separated his wings to release his arms that had been folded across his breast placed his hands upon the floor dropped his feet and stood erect  for a moment he stretched his great wings slowly solemnly blinking his large round eyes  then his gaze fell upon bradley  the thin lips drew back tightly against yellow teeth in a grimace that was nothing but hideous it could not have been termed a smile and what emotion it registered the englishman was at a loss to guess  no expression whatever altered the steady gaze of those large round eyes there was no color upon the pasty sunken cheeks  a deaths head grimaced as though a man long dead raised his parchmentcovered skull from an old grave  the creature stood about the height of an average man but appeared much taller from the fact that the joints of his long wings rose fully a foot above his hairless head  the bare arms were long and sinewy ending in strong bony hands with clawlike fingersalmost talonlike in their suggestiveness  the white robe was separated in front revealing skinny legs and the further fact that the thing wore but the single garment which was of fine woven cloth  from crown to sole the portions of the body exposed were entirely hairless and as he noted this bradley also noted for the first time the cause of much of the seeming expressionlessness of the creatures countenanceit had neither eyebrows or lashes  the ears were small and rested flat against the skull which was noticeably round though the face was quite flat  the creature had small feet beautifully arched and plump but so out of keeping with every other physical attribute it possessed as to appear ridiculous  after eyeing bradley for a moment the thing approached him  where from it asked  england replied bradley as briefly  where is england and what pursued the questioner  it is a country far from here answered the englishman  are your people corsvajo or cosatalu  i do not understand you said bradley and now suppose you answer a few questions  who are you  what country is this  why did you bring me here  again the sepulchral grimace  we are wieroosluata is our father caspak is ours  this our country is called oooh  we brought you here for literally him who speaks for luata to gaze upon and question  he would know from whence you came and why but principally if you be cosatalu  and if i am not coswhatever you call the bloomin beastwhat of it  the wieroo raised his wings in a very human shrug and waved his bony claws toward the human skulls supporting the ceiling  his gesture was eloquent but he embellished it by remarking and possibly if you are  im hungry snapped bradley  the wieroo motioned him to one of the doors which he threw open permitting bradley to pass out onto another roof on a level lower than that upon which they had landed earlier in the morning  by daylight the city appeared even more remarkable than in the moonlight though less weird and unreal  the houses of all shapes and sizes were piled about as a child might pile blocks of various forms and colors  he saw now that there were what might be called streets or alleys but they ran in baffling turns and twists nor ever reached a destination always ending in a dead wall where some wieroo had built a house across them  upon each house was a slender column supporting a human skull sometimes the columns were at one corner of the roof sometimes at another or again they rose from the center or near the center and the columns were of varying heights from that of a man to those which rose twenty feet above their roofs  the skulls were as a rule paintedblue or white or in combinations of both colors  the most effective were painted blue with the teeth white and the eyesockets rimmed with white  there were other skullsthousands of themtens hundreds of thousands  they rimmed the eaves of every house they were set in the plaster of the outer walls and at no great distance from where bradley stood rose a round tower built entirely of human skulls  and the city extended in every direction as far as the englishman could see  all about him wieroos were moving across the roofs or winging through the air  the sad sound of their flapping wings rose and fell like a solemn dirge  most of them were appareled all in white like his captors but others had markings of red or blue or yellow slashed across the front of their robes  his guide pointed toward a doorway in an alley below them  go there and eat he commanded and then come back  you cannot escape  if any question you say that you belong to foshbalsoj  there is the way  and this time he pointed to the top of a ladder which protruded above the eaves of the roof nearby  then he turned and reentered the house  bradley looked about him  no he could not escapethat seemed evident  the city appeared interminable and beyond the city if not a savage wilderness filled with wild beasts there was the broad inland sea infested with horrid monsters  no wonder his captor felt safe in turning him loose in ooohhe wondered if that was the name of the country or the city and if there were other cities like this upon the island  slowly he descended the ladder to the seemingly deserted alley which was paved with what appeared to be large round cobblestones  he looked again at the smooth worn pavement and a rueful grin crossed his featuresthe alley was paved with skulls  the city of human skulls mused bradley  they must have been collectin em since adam he thought and then he crossed and entered the building through the doorway that had been pointed out to him  inside he found a large room in which were many wieroos seated before pedestals the tops of which were hollowed out so that they resembled the ordinary bird drinking and bathingfonts so commonly seen on suburban lawns  a seat protruded from each of the four sides of the pedestalsjust a flat board with a support running from its outer end diagonally to the base of the pedestal  as bradley entered some of the wieroos espied him and a dismal wail arose  whether it was a greeting or a threat bradley did not know suddenly from a dark alcove another wieroo rushed out toward him  who are you he cried  what do you want  foshbalsoj sent me here to eat replied bradley  do you belong to foshbalsoj asked the other  that appears to be what he thinks answered the englishman  are you cosatalu demanded the wieroo  give me something to eat or ill be all of that replied bradley  the wieroo looked puzzled  sit here jaallu he snapped and bradley sat down unconscious of the fact that he had been insulted by being called a hyenaman an appellation of contempt in caspak  the wieroo had seated him at a pedestal by himself and as he sat waiting for what was next to transpire he looked about him at the wieroo in his immediate vicinity  he saw that in each font was a quantity of food and that each wieroo was armed with a wooden skewer sharpened at one end with which they carried solid portions of food to their mouths  at the other end of the skewer was fastened a small clamshell  this was used to scoop up the smaller and softer portions of the repast into which all four of the occupants of each table dipped impartially  the wieroo leaned far over their food scooping it up rapidly and with much noise and so great was their haste that a part of each mouthful always fell back into the common dish and when they choked by reason of the rapidity with which they attempted to bolt their food they often lost it all  bradley was glad that he had a pedestal all to himself  soon the keeper of the place returned with a wooden bowl filled with food  this he dumped into bradleys trough as he already thought of it  the englishman was glad that he could not see into the dark alcove or know what were all the ingredients that constituted the mess before him for he was very hungry  after the first mouthful he cared even less to investigate the antecedents of the dish for he found it peculiarly palatable  it seemed to consist of a combination of meat fruits vegetables small fish and other undistinguishable articles of food all seasoned to produce a gastronomic effect that was at once baffling and delicious  when he had finished his trough was empty and then he commenced to wonder who was to settle for his meal  as he waited for the proprietor to return he fell to examining the dish from which he had eaten and the pedestal upon which it rested  the font was of stone worn smooth by longcontinued use the four outer edges hollowed and polished by the contact of the countless wieroo bodies that had leaned against them for how long a period of time bradley could not even guess  everything about the place carried the impression of hoary age  the carved pedestals were black with use the wooden seats were worn hollow the floor of stone slabs was polished by the contact of possibly millions of naked feet and worn away in the aisles between the pedestals so that the latter rested upon little mounds of stone several inches above the general level of the floor  finally seeing that no one came to collect bradley arose and started for the doorway  he had covered half the distance when he heard the voice of mine host calling to him  come back jaallu screamed the wieroo and bradley did as he was bid  as he approached the creature which stood now behind a large flattopped pedestal beside the alcove he saw lying upon the smooth surface something that almost elicited a gasp of astonishment from hima simple common thing it was or would have been almost anywhere in the world but caspaka square bit of paper  and on it in a fine hand written compactly were many strange hieroglyphics  these remarkable creatures then had a written as well as a spoken language and besides the art of weaving cloth possessed that of papermaking  could it be that such grotesque beings represented the high culture of the human race within the boundaries of caspak  had natural selection produced during the countless ages of caspakian life a winged monstrosity that represented the earthly pinnacle of mans evolution  bradley had noted something of the obvious indications of a gradual evolution from ape to spearman as exemplified by the several overlapping races of alalus clubmen and hatchetmen that formed the connecting links between the two extremes with which he had come in contact  he had heard of the krolus and the galusreputed to be still higher in the plane of evolutionand now he had indisputable evidence of a race possessing refinements of civilization eons in advance of the spearmen  the conjectures awakened by even a momentary consideration of the possibilities involved became at once as wildly bizarre as the insane imagings of a drug addict  as these thoughts flashed through his mind the wieroo held out a pen of bone fixed to a wooden holder and at the same time made a sign that bradley was to write upon the paper  it was difficult to judge from the expressionless features of the wieroo what was passing in the creatures mind but bradley could not but feel that the thing cast a supercilious glance upon him as much as to say of course you do not know how to write you poor low creature but you can make your mark  bradley seized the pen and in a clear bold hand wrote  john bradley england  the wieroo showed evidences of consternation as it seized the piece of paper and examined the writing with every mark of incredulity and surprise  of course it could make nothing of the strange characters but it evidently accepted them as proof that bradley possessed knowledge of a written language of his own for following the englishmans entry it made a few characters of its own  you will come here again just before lua hides his face behind the great cliff announced the creature unless before that you are summoned by him who speaks for luata in which case you will not have to eat any more  reassuring cuss thought bradley as he turned and left the building  outside were several wieroos that had been eating at the pedestals within  they immediately surrounded him asking all sorts of questions plucking at his garments his ammunitionbelt and his pistol  their demeanor was entirely different from what it had been within the eatingplace and bradley was to learn that a house of food was sanctuary for him since the stern laws of the wieroos forbade altercations within such walls  now they were rough and threatening as with wings half spread they hovered about him in menacing attitudes barring his way to the ladder leading to the roof from whence he had descended but the englishman was not one to brook interference for long  he attempted at first to push his way past them and then when one seized his arm and jerked him roughly back bradley swung upon the creature and with a heavy blow to the jaw felled it  instantly pandemonium reigned  loud wails arose great wings opened and closed with a loud beating noise and many clawlike hands reached forth to clutch him  bradley struck to right and left  he dared not use his pistol for fear that once they discovered its power he would be overcome by weight of numbers and relieved of possession of what he considered his trump card to be reserved until the last moment that it might be used to aid in his escape for already the englishman was planning though almost hopelessly such an attempt  a few blows convinced bradley that the wieroos were arrant cowards and that they bore no weapons for after two or three had fallen beneath his fists the others formed a circle about him but at a safe distance and contented themselves with threatening and blustering while those whom he had felled lay upon the pavement without trying to arise the while they moaned and wailed in lugubrious chorus  again bradley strode toward the ladder and this time the circle parted before him but no sooner had he ascended a few rungs than he was seized by one foot and an effort made to drag him down  with a quick backward glance the englishman clinging firmly to the ladder with both hands drew up his free foot and with all the strength of a powerful leg planted a heavy shoe squarely in the flat face of the wieroo that held him  shrieking horribly the creature clapped both hands to its face and sank to the ground while bradley clambered quickly the remaining distance to the roof though no sooner did he reach the top of the ladder than a great flapping of wings beneath him warned him that the wieroos were rising after him  a moment later they swarmed about his head as he ran for the apartment in which he had spent the early hours of the morning after his arrival  it was but a short distance from the top of the ladder to the doorway and bradley had almost reached his goal when the door flew open and foshbalsoj stepped out  immediately the pursuing wieroos demanded punishment of the jaallu who had so grievously maltreated them foshbalsoj listened to their complaints and then with a sudden sweep of his right hand seized bradley by the scruff of the neck and hurled him sprawling through the doorway upon the floor of the chamber  so sudden was the assault and so surprising the strength of the wieroo that the englishman was taken completely off his guard  when he arose the door was closed and foshbalsoj was standing over him his hideous face contorted into an expression of rage and hatred  hyena snake lizard he screamed  you would dare lay your low vile profaning hands upon even the lowliest of the wieroosthe sacred chosen of luata  bradley was mad and so he spoke in a very low calm voice while a halfsmile played across his lips but his cold gray eyes were unsmiling  what you did to me just now he said i am going to kill you for that and even as he spoke he launched himself at the throat of foshbalsoj  the other wieroo that had been asleep when bradley left the chamber had departed and the two were alone  foshbalsoj displayed little of the cowardice of those that had attacked bradley in the alleyway but that may have been because he had so slight opportunity for bradley had him by the throat before he could utter a cry and with his right hand struck him heavily and repeatedly upon his face and over his heartugly smashing shortarm jabs of the sort that take the fight out of a man in quick time  but foshbalsoj was of no mind to die passively  he clawed and struck at bradley while with his great wings he attempted to shield himself from the merciless rain of blows at the same time searching for a hold upon his antagonists throat  presently he succeeded in tripping the englishman and together the two fell heavily to the floor bradley underneath and at the same instant the wieroo fastened his long talons about the others windpipe  foshbalsoj was possessed of enormous strength and he was fighting for his life  the englishman soon realized that the battle was going against him  already his lungs were pounding painfully for air as he reached for his pistol  it was with difficulty that he drew it from its holster and even then with death staring him in the face he thought of his precious ammunition  cant waste it he thought and slipping his fingers to the barrel he raised the weapon and struck foshbalsoj a terrific blow between the eyes  instantly the clawlike fingers released their hold and the creature sank limply to the floor beside bradley who lay for several minutes gasping painfully in an effort to regain his breath  when he was able he rose and leaned close over the wieroo lying silent and motionless his wings dropping limply and his great round eyes staring blankly toward the ceiling  a brief examination convinced bradley that the thing was dead and with the conviction came an overwhelming sense of the dangers which must now confront him but how was he to escape  his first thought was to find some means for concealing the evidence of his deed and then to make a bold effort to escape  stepping to the second door he pushed it gently open and peered in upon what seemed to be a store room  in it was a litter of cloth such as the wieroos robes were fashioned from a number of chests painted blue and white with white hieroglyphics painted in bold strokes upon the blue and blue hieroglyphics upon the white  in one corner was a pile of human skulls reaching almost to the ceiling and in another a stack of dried wieroo wings  the chamber was as irregularly shaped as the other and had but a single window and a second door at the further end but was without the exit through the roof and most important of all there was no creature of any sort in it  as quickly as possible bradley dragged the dead wieroo through the doorway and closed the door then he looked about for a place to conceal the corpse  one of the chests was large enough to hold the body if the knees were bent well up and with this idea in view bradley approached the chest to open it  the lid was made in two pieces each being hinged at an opposite end of the chest and joining nicely where they met in the center of the chest making a snug wellfitting joint there was no lock  bradley raised one half the cover and looked in with a smothered by jove he bent closer to examine the contentsthe chest was about half filled with an assortment of golden trinkets there were what appeared to be bracelets anklets and brooches of virgin gold  realizing that there was no room in the chest for the body of the wieroo bradley turned to seek another means of concealing the evidence of his crime  there was a space between the chests and the wall and into this he forced the corpse piling the discarded robes upon it until it was entirely hidden from sight but now how was he to make good his escape in the bright glare of that early spring day  he walked to the door at the far end of the apartment and cautiously opened it an inch  before him and about two feet away was the blank wall of another building  bradley opened the door a little farther and looked in both directions  there was no one in sight to the left over a considerable expanse of rooftop and to the right another building shut off his line of vision at about twenty feet  slipping out he turned to the right and in a few steps found a narrow passageway between two buildings  turning into this he passed about half its length when he saw a wieroo appear at the opposite end and halt  the creature was not looking down the passageway but at any moment it might turn its eyes toward him when he would be immediately discovered  to bradleys left was a triangular niche in the wall of one of the houses and into this he dodged thus concealing himself from the sight of the wieroo  beside him was a door painted a vivid yellow and constructed after the same fashion as the other wieroo doors he had seen being made up of countless narrow strips of wood from four to six inches in length laid on in patches of about the same width the strips in adjacent patches never running in the same direction  the result bore some resemblance to a crazy patchwork quilt which was heightened when as in one of the doors he had seen contiguous patches were painted different colors  the strips appeared to have been bound together and to the underlying framework of the door with gut or fiber and also glued after which a thick coating of paint had been applied one edge of the door was formed of a straight round pole about two inches in diameter that protruded at top and bottom the projections setting in round holes in both lintel and sill forming the axis upon which the door swung  an eccentric disk upon the inside face of the door engaged a slot in the frame when it was desired to secure the door against intruders  as bradley stood flattened against the wall waiting for the wieroo to move on he heard the creatures wings brushing against the sides of the buildings as it made its way down the narrow passage in his direction  as the yellow door offered the only means of escape without detection the englishman decided to risk whatever might lie beyond it and so boldly pushing it in he crossed the threshold and entered a small apartment  as he did so he heard a muffled ejaculation of surprise and turning his eyes in the direction from whence the sound had come he beheld a wideeyed girl standing flattened against the opposite wall an expression of incredulity upon her face  at a glance he saw that she was of no race of humans that he had come in contact with since his arrival upon capronathere was no trace about her form or features of any relationship to those low orders of men nor was she appareled as theyor rather she did not entirely lack apparel as did most of them  a soft hide fell from her left shoulder to just below her left hip on one side and almost to her right knee on the other a loose girdle was about her waist and golden ornaments such as he had seen in the blueandwhite chest encircled her arms and legs while a golden fillet with a triangular diadem bound her heavy hair above her brows  her skin was white as from long confinement within doors but it was clear and fine  her figure but partially concealed by the soft deerskin was all curves of symmetry and youthful grace while her features might easily have been the envy of the most feted of continental beauties  if the girl was surprised by the sudden appearance of bradley the latter was absolutely astounded to discover so wondrous a creature among the hideous inhabitants of the city of human skulls  for a moment the two looked at one another in unconcealed consternation and then bradley spoke using to the best of his poor ability the common tongue of caspak  who are you he asked and from where do you come  do not tell me that you are a wieroo  no she replied i am no wieroo  and she shuddered slightly as she pronounced the word  i am a galu but who and what are you  i am sure that you are no galu from your garments but you are like the galus in other respects  i know that you are not of this frightful city for i have been here for almost ten moons and never have i seen a male galu brought hither before nor are there such as you and i other than prisoners in the land of oooh and these are all females are you a prisoner then  he told her briefly who and what he was though he doubted if she understood and from her he learned that she had been a prisoner there for many months but for what purpose he did not then learn as in the midst of their conversation the yellow door swung open and a wieroo with a robe slashed with yellow entered  at sight of bradley the creature became furious  whence came this reptile it demanded of the girl  how long has it been here with you  it came through the doorway just ahead of you bradley answered for the girl  the wieroo looked relieved  it is well for the girl that this is so it said for now only you will have to die and stepping to the door the creature raised its voice in one of those uncanny depressing wails  the englishman looked toward the girl  shall i kill it he asked half drawing his pistol  what is best to doi do not wish to endanger you  the wieroo backed toward the door  defiler it screamed  you dare to threaten one of the sacred chosen of luata  do not kill him cried the girl for then there could be no hope for you  that you are here alive shows that they may not intend to kill you at all and so there is a chance for you if you do not anger them but touch him in violence and your bleached skull will top the loftiest pedestal of oooh  and what of you asked bradley  i am already doomed replied the girl i am cosatalo  cosatalo cosatalu  what did these phrases mean that they were so oft repeated by the denizens of oooh  lu and lo bradley knew to mean man and woman ata was employed variously to indicate life eggs young reproduction and kindred subject cos was a negative but in combination they were meaningless to the european  do you mean they will kill you asked bradley  i but wish that they would replied the girl  my fate is to be worse than deathin just a few nights more with the coming of the new moon  poor shesnake snapped the wieroo  you are to become sacred above all other shes  he who speaks for luata has chosen you for himself today you go to his temple the wieroo used a phrase meaning literally high placewhere you will receive the sacred commands  the girl shuddered and cast a sorrowful glance toward bradley  ah she sighed if i could but see my beloved country once again  the man stepped suddenly close to her side before the wieroo could interpose and in a low voice asked her if there was no way by which he might encompass her escape  she shook her head sorrowfully  even if we escaped the city she replied there is the big water between the island of oooh and the galu shore  and what is beyond the city if we could leave it pursued bradley  i  may only guess from what i have heard since i was brought here she answered but by reports and chance remarks i take it to be a beautiful land in which there are but few wild beasts and no men for only the wieroos live upon this island and they dwell always in cities of which there are three this being the largest  the others are at the far end of the island which is about three marches from end to end and at its widest point about one march  from his own experience and from what the natives on the mainland had told him bradley knew that ten miles was a good days march in caspak owing to the fact that at most points it was a trackless wilderness and at all times travelers were beset by hideous beasts and reptiles that greatly impeded rapid progress  the two had spoken rapidly but were now interrupted by the advent through the opening in the roof of several wieroos who had come in answer to the alarm it of the yellow slashing had uttered  this jaallu  cried the offended one has threatened me  take its hatchet from it and make it fast where it can do no harm until he who speaks for luata has said what shall be done with it  it is one of those strange creatures that foshbalsoj discovered first above the bandlu country and followed back toward the beginning  he who speaks for luata sent foshbalsoj to fetch him one of the creatures and here it is  it is hoped that it may be from another world and hold the secret of the cosatalus  the wieroos approached boldly to take bradleys hatchet from him their leader having indicated the pistol hanging in its holster at the englishmans hip but the first one went reeling backward against his fellows from the blow to the chin which bradley followed up with a rush and the intention to clean up the room in record time but he had reckoned without the opening in the roof  two were down and a great wailing and moaning was arising when reinforcements appeared from above  bradley did not see them but the girl did and though she cried out a warning it came too late for him to avoid a large wieroo who dived headforemost for him striking him between the shoulders and bearing him to the floor  instantly a dozen more were piling on top of him  his pistol was wrenched from its holster and he was securely pinioned down by the weight of numbers  at a word from the wieroo of the yellow slashing who evidently was a person of authority one left and presently returned with fiber ropes with which bradley was tightly bound  now bear him to the blue place of seven skulls directed the chief wieroo and one take the word of all that has passed to him who speaks for luata  each of the creatures raised a hand the back against its face as though in salute  one seized bradley and carried him through the yellow doorway to the roof from whence it rose upon its widespread wings and flapped off across the rooftops of oooh with its heavy burden clutched in its long talons  below him bradley could see the city stretching away to a distance on every hand  it was not as large as he had imagined though he judged that it was at least three miles square  the houses were piled in indescribable heaps sometimes to a height of a hundred feet  the streets and alleys were short and crooked and there were many areas where buildings had been wedged in so closely that no light could possibly reach the lowest tiers the entire surface of the ground being packed solidly with them  the colors were varied and startling the architecture amazing  many roofs were cup or saucershaped with a small hole in the center of each as though they had been constructed to catch rainwater and conduct it to a reservoir beneath but nearly all the others had the large opening in the top that bradley had seen used by these flying men in lieu of doorways  at all levels were the myriad poles surmounted by grinning skulls but the two most prominent features of the city were the round tower of human skulls that bradley had noted earlier in the day and another and much larger edifice near the center of the city as they approached it bradley saw that it was a huge building rising a hundred feet in height from the ground and that it stood alone in the center of what might have been called a plaza in some other part of the world  its various parts however were set together with the same strange irregularity that marked the architecture of the city as a whole and it was capped by an enormous saucershaped roof which projected far beyond the eaves having the appearance of a colossal chinese coolie hat inverted  the wieroo bearing bradley passed over one corner of the open space about the large building revealing to the englishman grass and trees and running water beneath  they passed the building and about five hundred yards beyond the creature alighted on the roof of a square blue building surmounted by seven poles bearing seven skulls  this then thought bradley is the blue place of seven skulls  over the opening in the roof was a grated covering and this the wieroo removed  the thing then tied a piece of fiber rope to one of bradleys ankles and rolled him over the edge of the opening  all was dark below and for an instant the englishman came as near to experiencing real terror as he had ever come in his life before  as he rolled off into the black abyss he felt the rope tighten about his ankle and an instant later he was stopped with a sudden jerk to swing pendulumlike head downward  then the creature lowered away until bradleys head came in sudden and painful contact with the floor below after which the wieroo let loose of the rope entirely and the englishmans body crashed to the wooden planking  he felt the free end of the rope dropped upon him and heard the grating being slid into place above him    chapter 3  halfstunned bradley lay for a minute as he had fallen and then slowly and painfully wriggled into a less uncomfortable position  he could see nothing of his surroundings in the gloom about him until after a few minutes his eyes became accustomed to the dark interior when he rolled them from side to side in survey of his prison  he discovered himself to be in a bare room which was windowless nor could he see any other opening than that through which he had been lowered  in one corner was a huddled mass that might have been almost anything from a bundle of rags to a dead body  almost immediately after he had taken his bearings bradley commenced working with his bonds  he was a man of powerful physique and as from the first he had been imbued with a belief that the fiber ropes were too weak to hold him he worked on with a firm conviction that sooner or later they would part to his strainings  after a matter of five minutes he was positive that the strands about his wrists were beginning to give but he was compelled to rest then from exhaustion  as he lay his eyes rested upon the bundle in the corner and presently he could have sworn that the thing moved  with eyes straining through the gloom the man lay watching the grim and sinister thing in the corner  perhaps his overwrought nerves were playing a sorry joke upon him  he thought of this and also that his condition of utter helplessness might still further have stimulated his imagination  he closed his eyes and sought to relax his muscles and his nerves but when he looked again he knew that he had not been mistakenthe thing had moved now it lay in a slightly altered form and farther from the wall  it was nearer him  with renewed strength bradley strained at his bonds his fascinated gaze still glued upon the shapeless bundle  no longer was there any doubt that it movedhe saw it rise in the center several inches and then creep closer to him  it sank and arose againa headless hideous monstrous thing of menace  its very silence rendered it the more terrible  bradley was a brave man ordinarily his nerves were of steel but to be at the mercy of some unknown and nameless horror to be unable to defend himselfit was these things that almost unstrung him for at best he was only human  to stand in the open even with the odds all against him to be able to use his fists to put up some sort of defense to inflict punishment upon his adversarythen he could face death with a smile  it was not death that he feared nowit was that horror of the unknown that is part of the fiber of every son of woman  closer and closer came the shapeless mass  bradley lay motionless and listened  what was that he heard  breathing  he could not be mistakenand then from out of the bundle of rags issued a hollow groan  bradley felt his hair rise upon his head  he struggled with the slowly parting strands that held him  the thing beside him rose up higher than before and the englishman could have sworn that he saw a single eye peering at him from among the tumbled cloth  for a moment the bundle remained motionlessonly the sound of breathing issued from it then there broke from it a maniacal laugh  cold sweat stood upon bradleys brow as he tugged for liberation  he saw the rags rise higher and higher above him until at last they tumbled upon the floor from the body of a naked mana thin a bony a hideous caricature of man that mouthed and mummed and wabbling upon its weak and shaking legs crumpled to the floor again still laughinglaughing horribly  it crawled toward bradley  food  food it screamed  there is a way out there is a way out  dragging itself to his side the creature slumped upon the englishmans breast  food it shrilled as with its bony fingers and its teeth it sought the mans bare throat  food  there is a way out  bradley felt teeth upon his jugular  he turned and twisted shaking himself free for an instant but once more with hideous persistence the thing fastened itself upon him  the weak jaws were unable to send the dull teeth through the victims flesh but bradley felt it pawing pawing pawing like a monstrous rat seeking his lifes blood  the skinny arms now embraced his neck holding the teeth to his throat against all his efforts to dislodge the thing  weak as it was it had strength enough for this in its mad efforts to eat  mumbling as it worked it repeated again and again food  food  there is a way out until bradley thought those two expressions alone would drive him mad  and all but mad he was as with a final effort backed by almost maniacal strength he tore his wrists from the confining bonds and grasping the repulsive thing upon his breast hurled it halfway across the room panting like a spent hound bradley worked at the thongs about his ankles while the maniac lay quivering and mumbling where it had fallen presently the englishman leaped to his feetfreer than he had ever before felt in all his life though he was still hopelessly a prisoner in the blue place of seven skulls  with his back against the wall for support so weak the reaction left him bradley stood watching the creature upon the floor  he saw it move and slowly raise itself to its hands and knees where it swayed to and fro as its eyes roved about in search of him and when at last they found him there broke from the drawn lips the mumbled words  food food  there is a way out the pitiful supplication in the tones touched the englishmans heart  he knew that this could be no wieroo but possibly once a man like himself who had been cast into this pit of solitary confinement with this hideous result that might in time be his fate also  and then too there was the suggestion of hope held out by the constant reiteration of the phrase there is a way out was there a way out  what did this poor thing know  who are you and how long have you been here bradley suddenly demanded  for a moment the man upon the floor made no response then mumblingly came the words  food  food  stop commanded the englishmanthe injunction might have been barked from the muzzle of a pistol  it brought the man to a sitting posture his hands off the ground  he stopped swaying to and fro and appeared to be startled into an attempt to master his faculties of concentration and thought  bradley repeated his questions sharply  i am antak the galu replied the man  luata alone knows how long i have been heremaybe ten moons maybe ten moons three timesit was the caspakian equivalent of thirty  i was young and strong when they brought me here  now i am old and very weak  i am cosataluthat is why they have not killed me  if i tell them the secret of becoming cosatalu they will take me out but how can i tell them that which luata alone knows  what is cosatalu demanded bradley  food  food  there is a way out mumbled the galu  bradley strode across the floor seized the man by his shoulders and shook him  tell me he cried what is cosatalu  food whimpered antak  bradley bethought himself  his haversack had not been taken from him in it besides his razor and knife were odds and ends of equipment and a small quantity of dried meat  he tossed a small strip of the latter to the starving galu  antak seized upon it and devoured it ravenously it instilled new life in the man  what is cosatalu insisted bradley again  antak tried to explain  his narrative was often broken by lapses of concentration during which he reverted to his plaintive mumbling for food and recurrence to the statement that there was a way out but by firmness and patience the englishman drew out piecemeal a more or less lucid exposition of the remarkable scheme of evolution that rules in caspak  in it he found explanations of the hitherto inexplicable  he discovered why he had seen no babes or children among the caspakian tribes with which he had come in contact why each more northerly tribe evinced a higher state of development than those south of them why each tribe included individuals ranging in physical and mental characteristics from the highest of the next lower race to the lowest of the next higher and why the women of each tribe immersed themselves morning for an hour or more in the warm pools near which the habitations of their people always were located and too he discovered why those pools were almost immune from the attacks of carnivorous animals and reptiles  he learned that all but those who were cosatalu came up corsvajo or from the beginning  the egg from which they first developed into tadpole form was deposited with millions of others in one of the warm pools and with it a poisonous serum that the carnivora instinctively shunned  down the warm stream from the pool floated the countless billions of eggs and tadpoles developing as they drifted slowly toward the sea  some became tadpoles in the pool some in the sluggish stream and some not until they reached the great inland sea  in the next stage they became fishes or reptiles antak was not positive which and in this form always developing they swam far to the south where amid the rank and teeming jungles some of them evolved into amphibians  always there were those whose development stopped at the first stage others whose development ceased when they became reptiles while by far the greater proportion formed the food supply of the ravenous creatures of the deep  few indeed were those that eventually developed into baboons and then apes which was considered by caspakians the real beginning of evolution  from the egg then the individual developed slowly into a higher form just as the frogs egg develops through various stages from a fish with gills to a frog with lungs  with that thought in mind bradley discovered that it was not difficult to believe in the possibility of such a schemethere was nothing new in it  from the ape the individual if it survived slowly developed into the lowest order of manthe aluand then by degrees to bolu stolu bandlu krolu and finally galu  and in each stage countless millions of other eggs were deposited in the warm pools of the various races and floated down to the great sea to go through a similar process of evolution outside the womb as develops our own young within but in caspak the scheme is much more inclusive for it combines not only individual development but the evolution of species and genera  if an egg survives it goes through all the stages of development that man has passed through during the unthinkable eons since life first moved upon the earths face  the final stagethat which the galus have almost attained and for which all hopeis cosatalu which literally means noeggman or one who is born directly as are the young of the outer world of mammals  some of the galus produce cosatalu and cosatalo both the weiroos only cosataluin other words all wieroos are born male and so they prey upon the galus for their women and sometimes capture and torture the galu men who are cosatalu in an endeavor to learn the secret which they believe will give them unlimited power over all other denizens of caspak  no wieroos come up from the beginningall are born of the wieroo fathers and galu mothers who are cosatalo and there are very few of the latter owing to the long and precarious stages of development seven generations of the same ancestor must come up from the beginning before a cosatalu child may be born and when one considers the frightful dangers that surround the vital spark from the moment it leaves the warm pool where it has been deposited to float down to the sea amid the voracious creatures that swarm the surface and the deeps and the almost equally unthinkable trials of its effort to survive after it once becomes a land animal and starts northward through the horrors of the caspakian jungles and forests it is plainly a wonder that even a single babe has ever been born to a galu woman  seven cycles it requires before the seventh galu can complete the seventh dangerinfested circle since its first galu ancestor achieved the state of galu  for ages before the ancestors of this first galu may have developed from a bandlu or bolu egg without ever once completing the whole circlethat is from a galu egg back to a fully developed galu  bradleys head was whirling before he even commenced to grasp the complexities of caspakian evolution but as the truth slowly filtered into his understandingas gradually it became possible for him to visualize the scheme it appeared simpler  in fact it seemed even less difficult of comprehension than that with which he was familiar  for several minutes after antak ceased speaking his voice having trailed off weakly into silence neither spoke again  then the galu recommenced his food  food  there is a way out bradley tossed him another bit of dried meat waiting patiently until he had eaten it this time more slowly  what do you mean by saying there is a way out he asked  he who died here just after i came told me replied antak  he said there was a way out that he had discovered it but was too weak to use his knowledge  he was trying to tell me how to find it when he died  oh luata if he had lived but a moment more  they do not feed you here asked bradley  no they give me water once a daythat is all  but how have you lived then  the lizards and the rats replied antak the lizards are not so bad but the rats are foul to taste  however i must eat them or they would eat me and they are better than nothing but of late they do not come so often and i have not had a lizard for a long time  i shall eat though he mumbled  i shall eat now for you cannot remain awake forever  he laughed a cackling dry laugh  when you sleep antak will eat  it was horrible  bradley shuddered  for a long time each sat in silence  the englishman could guess why the other made no soundhe awaited the moment that sleep should overcome his victim  in the long silence there was born upon bradleys ears a faint monotonous sound as of running water  he listened intently  it seemed to come from far beneath the floor  what is that noise he asked  that sounds like water running through a narrow channel  it is the river replied antak  why do you not go to sleep  it passes directly beneath the blue place of seven skulls  it runs through the temple grounds beneath the temple and under the city when we die they will cut off our heads and throw our bodies into the river  at the mouth of the river await many large reptiles  thus do they feed  the wieroos do likewise with their own dead keeping only the skulls and the wings  come let us sleep  do the reptiles come up the river into the city asked bradley  the water is too coldthey never leave the warm water of the great pool replied antak  let us search for the way out suggested bradley  antak shook his head  i have searched for it all these moons he said  if i could not find it how would you  bradley made no reply but commenced a diligent examination of the walls and floor of the room pressing over each square foot and tapping with his knuckles  about six feet from the floor he discovered a sleepingperch near one end of the apartment  he asked antak about it but the galu said that no weiroo had occupied the place since he had been incarcerated there  again and again bradley went over the floor and walls as high up as he could reach  finally he swung himself to the perch that he might examine at least one end of the room all the way to the ceiling  in the center of the wall close to the top an area about three feet square gave forth a hollow sound when he rapped upon it  bradley felt over every square inch of that area with the tips of his fingers  near the top he found a small round hole a trifle larger in diameter than his forefinger which he immediately stuck into it  the panel if such it was seemed about an inch thick and beyond it his finger encountered nothing  bradley crooked his finger upon the opposite side of the panel and pulled toward him steadily but with considerable force  suddenly the panel flew inward nearly precipitating the man to the floor  it was hinged at the bottom and when lowered the outer edge rested upon the perch making a little platform parallel with the floor of the room  beyond the opening was an utterly dark void  the englishman leaned through it and reached his arm as far as possible into the blackness but touched nothing  then he fumbled in his haversack for a match a few of which remained to him  when he struck it antak gave a cry of terror  bradley held the light far into the opening before him and in its flickering rays saw the top of a ladder descending into a black abyss below  how far down it extended he could not guess but that he should soon know definitely he was positive  you have found it  you have found the way out screamed antak oh luata  and now i am too weak to go  take me with you  take me with you  shut up admonished bradley  you will have the whole flock of birds around our heads in a minute and neither of us will escape  be quiet and ill go ahead  if i find a way out ill come back and help you if youll promise not to try to eat me up again  i promise cried antak  oh luata  how could you blame me  i am half crazed of hunger and long confinement and the horror of the lizards and the rats and the constant waiting for death  i know said bradley simply  im sorry for you old top  keep a stiff upper lip  and he slipped through the opening found the ladder with his feet closed the panel behind him and started downward into the darkness  below him rose more and more distinctly the sound of running water the air felt damp and cool  he could see nothing of his surroundings and felt nothing but the smooth worn sides and rungs of the ladder down which he felt his way cautiously lest a broken rung or a misstep should hurl him downward  as he descended thus slowly the ladder seemed interminable and the pit bottomless yet he realized when at last he reached the bottom that he could not have descended more than fifty feet  the bottom of the ladder rested on a narrow ledge paved with what felt like large round stones but what he knew from experience to be human skulls  he could not but marvel as to where so many countless thousands of the things had come from until he paused to consider that the infancy of caspak dated doubtlessly back into remote ages far beyond what the outer world considered the beginning of earthly time  for all these eons the wieroos might have been collecting human skulls from their enemies and their own deadenough to have built an entire city of them  feeling his way along the narrow ledge bradley came presently to a blank wall that stretched out over the water swirling beneath him as far as he could reach  stooping he groped about with one hand reaching down toward the surface of the water and discovered that the bottom of the wall arched above the stream  how much space there was between the water and the arch he could not tell nor how deep the former  there was only one way in which he might learn these things and that was to lower himself into the stream  for only an instant he hesitated weighing his chances  behind him lay almost certainly the horrid fate of antak before him nothing worse than a comparatively painless death by drowning  holding his haversack above his head with one hand he lowered his feet slowly over the edge of the narrow platform  almost immediately he felt the swirling of cold water about his ankles and then with a silent prayer he let himself drop gently into the stream  great was bradleys relief when he found the water no more than waist deep and beneath his feet a firm gravel bottom  feeling his way cautiously he moved downward with the current which was not so strong as he had imagined from the noise of the running water  beneath the first arch he made his way following the winding curvatures of the righthand wall  after a few yards of progress his hand came suddenly in contact with a slimy thing clinging to the walla thing that hissed and scuttled out of reach  what it was the man could not know but almost instantly there was a splash in the water just ahead of him and then another  on he went passing beneath other arches at varying distances and always in utter darkness  unseen denizens of this great sewer disturbed by the intruder splashed into the water ahead of him and wriggled away  time and again his hand touched them and never for an instant could he be sure that at the next step some gruesome thing might not attack him  he had strapped his haversack about his neck well above the surface of the water and in his left hand he carried his knife  other precautions there were none to take  the monotony of the blind trail was increased by the fact that from the moment he had started from the foot of the ladder he had counted his every step  he had promised to return for antak if it proved humanly possible to do so and he knew that in the blackness of the tunnel he could locate the foot of the ladder in no other way  he had taken two hundred and sixtynine stepsafterward he knew that he should never forget that numberwhen something bumped gently against him from behind  instantly he wheeled about and with knife ready to defend himself stretched forth his right hand to push away the object that now had lodged against his body  his fingers feeling through the darkness came in contact with something cold and clammythey passed to and fro over the thing until bradley knew that it was the face of a dead man floating upon the surface of the stream with an oath he pushed his gruesome companion out into midstream to float on down toward the great pool and the awaiting scavengers of the deep  at his four hundred and thirteenth step another corpse bumped against himhow many had passed him without touching he could not guess but suddenly he experienced the sensation of being surrounded by dead faces floating along with him all set in hideous grimaces their dead eyes glaring at this profaning alien who dared intrude upon the waters of this river of the deada horrid escort pregnant with dire forebodings and with menace  though he advanced very slowly he tried always to take steps of about the same length so that he knew that though considerable time had elapsed yet he had really advanced no more than four hundred yards when ahead he saw a lessening of the pitchdarkness and at the next turn of the stream his surroundings became vaguely discernible  above him was an arched roof and on either hand walls pierced at intervals by apertures covered with wooden doors  just ahead of him in the roof of the aqueduct was a round black hole about thirty inches in diameter his eyes still rested upon the opening when there shot downward from it to the water below the naked body of a human being which almost immediately rose to the surface again and floated off down the stream in the dim light bradley saw that it was a dead wieroo from which the wings and head had been removed  a moment later another headless body floated past recalling what antak had told him of the skullcollecting customs of the wieroo  bradley wondered how it happened that the first corpse he had encountered in the stream had not been similarly mutilated  the farther he advanced now the lighter it became  the number of corpses was much smaller than he had imagined only two more passing him before at six hundred steps or about five hundred yards from the point he had taken to the stream he came to the end of the tunnel and looked out upon sunlit water running between grassy banks  one of the last corpses to pass him was still clothed in the white robe of a wieroo bloodstained over the headless neck that it concealed  drawing closer to the opening leading into the bright daylight bradley surveyed what lay beyond  a short distance before him a large building stood in the center of several acres of grass and treecovered ground spanning the stream which disappeared through an opening in its foundation wall  from the large saucershaped roof and the vivid colorings of the various heterogeneous parts of the structure he recognized it as the temple past which he had been borne to the blue place of seven skulls  to and fro flew wieroos going to and from the temple  others passed on foot across the open grounds assisting themselves with their great wings so that they barely skimmed the earth  to leave the mouth of the tunnel would have been to court instant discovery and capture but by what other avenue he might escape bradley could not guess unless he retraced his steps up the stream and sought egress from the other end of the city  the thought of traversing that dark and horrorridden tunnel for perhaps miles he could not entertainthere must be some other way  perhaps after dark he could steal through the temple grounds and continue on downstream until he had come beyond the city and so he stood and waited until his limbs became almost paralyzed with cold and he knew that he must find some other plan for escape  a halfformed decision to risk an attempt to swim under water to the temple was crystallizing in spite of the fact that any chance wieroo flying above the stream might easily see him when again a floating object bumped against him from behind and lodged across his back turning quickly he saw that the thing was what he had immediately guessed it to bea headless and wingless wieroo corpse  with a grunt of disgust he was about to push it from him when the white garment enshrouding it suggested a bold plan to his resourceful brain grasping the corpse by an arm he tore the garment from it and then let the body float downward toward the temple  with great care he draped the robe about him the bloody blotch that had covered the severed neck he arranged about his own head  his haversack he rolled as tightly as possible and stuffed beneath his coat over his breast  then he fell gently to the surface of the stream and lying upon his back floated downward with the current and out into the open sunlight  through the weave of the cloth he could distinguish large objects  he saw a wieroo flap dismally above him he saw the banks of the stream float slowly past he heard a sudden wail upon the righthand shore and his heart stood still lest his ruse had been discovered but never by a move of a muscle did he betray that aught but a cold lump of clay floated there upon the bosom of the water and soon though it seemed an eternity to him the direct sunlight was blotted out and he knew that he had entered beneath the temple  quickly he felt for bottom with his feet and as quickly stood erect snatching the bloody clammy cloth from his face  on both sides were blank walls and before him the river turned a sharp corner and disappeared  feeling his way cautiously forward he approached the turn and looked around the corner  to his left was a low platform about a foot above the level of the stream and onto this he lost no time in climbing for he was soaked from head to foot cold and almost exhausted  as he lay resting on the skullpaved shelf he saw in the center of the vault above the river another of those sinister round holes through which he momentarily expected to see a headless corpse shoot downward in its last plunge to a watery grave  a few feet along the platform a closed door broke the blankness of the wall  as he lay looking at it and wondering what lay behind his mind filled with fragments of many wild schemes of escape it opened and a white robed wieroo stepped out upon the platform  the creature carried a large wooden basin filled with rubbish  its eyes were not upon bradley who drew himself to a squatting position and crouched as far back in the corner of the niche in which the platform was set as he could force himself  the wieroo stepped to the edge of the platform and dumped the rubbish into the stream  if it turned away from him as it started to retrace its steps to the doorway there was a small chance that it might not see him but if it turned toward him there was none at all  bradley held his breath  the wieroo paused a moment gazing down into the water then it straightened up and turned toward the englishman  bradley did not move  the wieroo stopped and stared intently at him  it approached him questioningly  still bradley remained as though carved of stone the creature was directly in front of him  it stopped  there was no chance on earth that it would not discover what he was  with the quickness of a cat bradley sprang to his feet and with all his great strength backed by his heavy weight struck the wieroo upon the point of the chin  without a sound the thing crumpled to the platform while bradley acting almost instinctively to the urge of the first law of nature rolled the inanimate body over the edge into the river  then he looked at the open doorway crossed the platform and peered within the apartment beyond  what he saw was a large room dimly lighted and about the side rows of wooden vessels stacked one upon another  there was no wieroo in sight so the englishman entered  at the far end of the room was another door and as he crossed toward it he glanced into some of the vessels which he found were filled with dried fruits vegetables and fish  without more ado he stuffed his pockets and his haversack full thinking of the poor creature awaiting his return in the gloom of the place of seven skulls  when night came he would return and fetch antak this far at least but in the meantime it was his intention to reconnoiter in the hope that he might discover some easier way out of the city than that offered by the chill black channel of the ghastly river of corpses  beyond the farther door stretched a long passageway from which closed doorways led into other parts of the cellars of the temple  a few yards from the storeroom a ladder rose from the corridor through an aperture in the ceiling  bradley paused at the foot of it debating the wisdom of further investigation against a return to the river but strong within him was the spirit of exploration that has scattered his race to the four corners of the earth  what new mysteries lay hidden in the chambers above  the urge to know was strong upon him though his better judgment warned him that the safer course lay in retreat  for a moment he stood thus running his fingers through his hair then he cast discretion to the winds and began the ascent  in conformity with such wieroo architecture as he had already observed the well through which the ladder rose continually canted at an angle from the perpendicular  at more or less regular stages it was pierced by apertures closed by doors none of which he could open until he had climbed fully fifty feet from the river level  here he discovered a door already ajar opening into a large circular chamber the walls and floors of which were covered with the skins of wild beasts and with rugs of many colors but what interested him most was the occupants of the rooma wieroo and a girl of human proportions  she was standing with her back against a column which rose from the center of the apartment from floor to ceilinga hollow column about forty inches in diameter in which he could see an opening some thirty inches across the girls side was toward bradley and her face averted for she was watching the wieroo who was now advancing slowly toward her talking as he came  bradley could distinctly hear the words of the creature who was urging the girl to accompany him to another wieroo city  come with me he said and you shall have your life remain here and he who speaks for luata will claim you for his own and when he is done with you your skull will bleach at the top of a tall staff while your body feeds the reptiles at the mouth of the river of death  even though you bring into the world a female wieroo your fate will be the same if you do not escape him while with me you shall have life and food and none shall harm you  he was quite close to the girl when she replied by striking him in the face with all her strength  until i am slain she cried i shall fight against you all  from the throat of the wieroo issued that dismal wail that bradley had heard so often in the pastit was like a scream of pain smothered to a groanand then the thing leaped upon the girl its face working in hideous grimaces as it clawed and beat at her to force her to the floor  the englishman was upon the point of entering to defend her when a door at the opposite side of the chamber opened to admit a huge wieroo clothed entirely in red  at sight of the two struggling upon the floor the newcomer raised his voice in a shriek of rage  instantly the wieroo who was attacking the girl leaped to his feet and faced the other  i heard screamed he who had just entered the room  i heard and when he who speaks for luata shall have heard he paused and made a suggestive movement of a finger across his throat  he shall not hear returned the first wieroo as with a powerful motion of his great wings he launched himself upon the redrobed figure  the latter dodged the first charge drew a wickedlooking curved blade from beneath its red robe spread its wings and dived for its antagonist  beating their wings wailing and groaning the two hideous things sparred for position  the whiterobed one being unarmed sought to grasp the other by the wrist of its knifehand and by the throat while the latter hopped around on its dainty white feet seeking an opening for a mortal blow  once it struck and missed and then the other rushed in and clinched at the same time securing both the holds it sought  immediately the two commenced beating at each others heads with the joints of their wings kicking with their soft puny feet and biting each at the others face  in the meantime the girl moved about the room keeping out of the way of the duelists and as she did so bradley caught a glimpse of her full face and immediately recognized her as the girl of the place of the yellow door  he did not dare intervene now until one of the wieroo had overcome the other lest the two should turn upon him at once when the chances were fair that he would be defeated in so unequal a battle as the curved blade of the red wieroo would render it and so he waited watching the whiterobed figure slowly choking the life from him of the red robe  the protruding tongue and the popping eyes proclaimed that the end was near and a moment later the red robe sank to the floor of the room the curved blade slipping from nerveless fingers  for an instant longer the victor clung to the throat of his defeated antagonist and then he rose dragging the body after him and approached the central column  here he raised the body and thrust it into the aperture where bradley saw it drop suddenly from sight instantly there flashed into his memory the circular openings in the roof of the river vault and the corpses he had seen drop from them to the water beneath  as the body disappeared the wieroo turned and cast about the room for the girl  for a moment he stood eying her  you saw he muttered and if you tell them he who speaks for luata will have my wings severed while still i live and my head will be severed and i shall be cast into the river of death for thus it happens even to the highest who slay one of the red robe  you saw and you must die he ended with a scream as he rushed upon the girl  bradley waited no longer  leaping into the room he ran for the wieroo who had already seized the girl and as he ran he stooped and picked up the curved blade  the creatures back was toward him as with his left hand he seized it by the neck  like a flash the great wings beat backward as the creature turned and bradley was swept from his feet though he still retained his hold upon the blade  instantly the wieroo was upon him  bradley lay slightly raised upon his left elbow his right arm free and as the thing came close he cut at the hideous face with all the strength that lay within him  the blade struck at the junction of the neck and torso and with such force as to completely decapitate the wieroo the hideous head dropping to the floor and the body falling forward upon the englishman  pushing it from him he rose to his feet and faced the wideeyed girl  luata she exclaimed  how came you here  bradley shrugged  here i am he said but the thing now is to get out of hereboth of us  the girl shook her head  it cannot be she stated sadly  that is what i thought when they dropped me into the blue place of seven skulls replied bradley  cant be done  i did ithere youre mussing up the floor something awful you  this last to the dead wieroo as he stooped and dragged the corpse to the central shaft where he raised it to the aperture and let it slip into the tube  then he picked up the head and tossed it after the body  dont be so glum he admonished the former as he carried it toward the well smile  but how can he smile questioned the girl a halfpuzzled halffrightened look upon her face  he is dead  thats so admitted bradley and i suppose he does feel a bit cut up about it  the girl shook her head and edged away from the mantoward the door  come said the englishman  weve got to get out of here  if you dont know a better way than the river its the river then  the girl still eyed him askance  but how could he smile when he was dead  bradley laughed aloud  i thought we english were supposed to have the least sense of humor of any people in the world he cried but now ive found one human being who hasnt any  of course you dont know half im saying but dont worry little girl im not going to hurt you and if i can get you out of here ill do it  even if she did not understand all he said she at least read something in his smiling countenancesomething which reassured her  i do not fear you she said though i do not understand all that you say even though you speak my own tongue and use words that i know  but as for escapingshe sighedalas how can it be done  i escaped from the blue place of seven skulls bradley reminded her come  and he turned toward the shaft and the ladder that he had ascended from the river  we cannot waste time here  the girl followed him but at the doorway both drew back for from below came the sound of some one ascending  bradley tiptoed to the door and peered cautiously into the well then he stepped back beside the girl  there are half a dozen of them coming up but possibly they will pass this room  no she said they will pass directly through this roomthey are on their way to him who speaks for luata  we may be able to hide in the next roomthere are skins there beneath which we may crawl  they will not stop in that room but they may stop in this one for a short timethe other room is blue  whats that go to do with it demanded the englishman  they fear blue she replied  in every room where murder has been done you will find bluea certain amount for each murder  when the room is all blue they shun it  this room has much blue but evidently they kill mostly in the next room which is now all blue  but there is blue on the outside of every house i have seen said bradley  yes assented the girl and there are blue rooms in each of those houseswhen all the rooms are blue then the whole outside of the house will be blue as is the blue place of seven skulls  there are many such here  and the skulls with blue upon them inquired bradley  did they belong to murderers  they were murderedsome of them those with only a small amount of blue were murderersknown murderers  all wieroos are murderers  when they have committed a certain number of murders without being caught at it they confess to him who speaks for luata and are advanced after which they wear robes with a slash of some colori think yellow comes first  when they reach a point where the entire robe is of yellow they discard it for a white robe with a red slash and when one wins a complete red robe he carries such a long curved knife as you have in your hand after that comes the blue slash on a white robe and then i suppose an all blue robe  i have never seen such a one  as they talked in low tones they had moved from the room of the death shaft into an all blue room adjoining where they sat down together in a corner with their backs against a wall and drew a pile of hides over themselves  a moment later they heard a number of wieroos enter the chamber  they were talking together as they crossed the floor or the two could not have heard them  halfway across the chamber they halted as the door toward which they were advancing opened and a dozen others of their kind entered the apartment  bradley could guess all this by the increased volume of sound and the dismal greetings but the sudden silence that almost immediately ensued he could not fathom for he could not know that from beneath one of the hides that covered him protruded one of his heavy army shoes or that some eighteen large wieroos with robes either solid red or slashed with red or blue were standing gazing at it  nor could he hear their stealthy approach  the first intimation he had that he had been discovered was when his foot was suddenly seized and he was yanked violently from beneath the hides to find himself surrounded by menacing blades  they would have slain him on the spot had not one clothed all in red held them back saying that he who speaks for luata desired to see this strange creature  as they led bradley away he caught an opportunity to glance back toward the hides to see what had become of the girl and to his gratification he discovered that she still lay concealed beneath the hides  he wondered if she would have the nerve to attempt the river trip alone and regretted that now he could not accompany her  he felt rather all in himself more so than he had at any time since he had been captured by the wieroo for there appeared not the slightest cause for hope in his present predicament  he had dropped the curved blade beneath the hides when he had been jerked so violently from their fancied security  it was almost in a spirit of resigned hopelessness that he quietly accompanied his captors through various chambers and corridors toward the heart of the temple    chapter 4  the farther the group progressed the more barbaric and the more sumptuous became the decorations  hides of leopard and tiger predominated apparently because of their more beautiful markings and decorative skulls became more and more numerous  many of the latter were mounted in precious metals and set with colored stones and priceless gems while thick upon the hides that covered the walls were golden ornaments similar to those worn by the girl and those which had filled the chests he had examined in the storeroom of foshbalsoj leading the englishman to the conviction that all such were spoils of war or theft since each piece seemed made for personal adornment while in so far as he had seen no wieroo wore ornaments of any sort  and also as they advanced the more numerous became the wieroos moving hither and thither within the temple  many now were the solid red robes and those that were slashed with bluea veritable hive of murderers  at last the party halted in a room in which were many wieroos who gathered about bradley questioning his captors and examining him and his apparel  one of the party accompanying the englishman spoke to a wieroo that stood beside a door leading from the room  tell him who speaks for luata he said that foshbalsoj we could not find but that in returning we found this creature within the temple hiding  it must be the same that foshbalsoj captured in the stolu country during the last darkness  doubtless he who speaks for luata would wish to see and question this strange thing  the creature addressed turned and slipped through the doorway closing the door after it but first depositing its curved blade upon the floor without  its post was immediately taken by another and bradley now saw that at least twenty such guards loitered in the immediate vicinity the doorkeeper was gone but for a moment and when he returned he signified that bradleys party was to enter the next chamber but first each of the wieroos removed his curved weapon and laid it upon the floor  the door was swung open and the party now reduced to bradley and five wieroos was ushered across the threshold into a large irregularly shaped room in which a single giant wieroo whose robe was solid blue sat upon a raised dais  the creatures face was white with the whiteness of a corpse its dead eyes entirely expressionless its cruel thin lips tightdrawn against yellow teeth in a perpetual grimace  upon either side of it lay an enormous curved sword similar to those with which some of the other wieroos had been armed but larger and heavier  constantly its clawlike fingers played with one or the other of these weapons  the walls of the chamber as well as the floor were entirely hidden by skins and woven fabrics  blue predominated in all the colorations fastened against the hides were many pairs of wieroo wings mounted so that they resembled long black shields  upon the ceiling were painted in blue characters a bewildering series of hieroglyphics and upon pedestals set against the walls or standing out well within the room were many human skulls  as the wieroos approached the figure upon the dais they leaned far forward raising their wings above their heads and stretching their necks as though offering them to the sharp swords of the grim and hideous creature  o thou who speakest for luata exclaimed one of the party  we bring you the strange creature that foshbalsoj captured and brought thither at thy command  so this then was the godlike figure that spoke for divinity  this archmurderer was the caspakian representative of god on earth  his blue robe announced him the one and the seeming humility of his minions the other  for a long minute he glared at bradley  then he began to question himfrom whence he came and how the name and description of his native country and a hundred other queries  are you cosatalu the creature asked  bradley replied that he was and that all his kind were as well as every living thing in his part of the world  can you tell me the secret asked the creature  bradley hesitated and then thinking to gain time replied in the affirmative  what is it demanded the wieroo leaning far forward and exhibiting every evidence of excited interest  bradley leaned forward and whispered  it is for your ears alone i will not divulge it to others and then only on condition that you carry me and the girl i saw in the place of the yellow door near to that of foshbalsoj back to her own country  the thing rose in wrath holding one of its swords above its head  who are you to make terms for him who speaks for luata it shrilled tell me the secret or die where you stand  and if i die now the secret goes with me bradley reminded him never again will you get the opportunity to question another of my kind who knows the secret  anything to gain time to get the rest of the wieroos from the room that he might plan some scheme for escape and put it into effect  the creature turned upon the leader of the party that had brought bradley  is the thing with weapons it asked  no was the response  then go but tell the guard to remain close by commanded the high one  the wieroos salaamed and withdrew closing the door behind them  he who speaks for luata grasped a sword nervously in his right hand  at his left side lay the second weapon  it was evident that he lived in constant dread of being assassinated  the fact that he permitted none with weapons within his presence and that he always kept two swords at his side pointed to this  bradley was racking his brain to find some suggestion of a plan whereby he might turn the situation to his own account  his eyes wandered past the weird figure before him they played about the walls of the apartment as though hoping to draw inspiration from the dead skulls and the hides and the wings and then they came back to the face of the wieroo god now working in anger  quick screamed the thing  the secret  will you give me and the girl our freedom insisted bradley  for an instant the thing hesitated and then it grumbled yes at the same instant bradley saw two hides upon the wall directly back of the dais separate and a face appear in the opening  no change of expression upon the englishmans countenance betrayed that he had seen aught to surprise him though surprised he was for the face in the aperture was that of the girl he had but just left hidden beneath the hides in another chamber  a white and shapely arm now pushed past the face into the room and in the hand tightly clutched was the curved blade smeared with blood that bradley had dropped beneath the hides at the moment he had been discovered and drawn from his concealment  listen then said bradley in a low voice to the wieroo  you shall know the secret of cosatalu as well as do i but none other may hear it  lean closei will whisper it into your ear  he moved forward and stepped upon the dais  the creature raised its sword ready to strike at the first indication of treachery and bradley stooped beneath the blade and put his ear close to the gruesome face as he did so he rested his weight upon his hands one upon either side of the wieroos body his right hand upon the hilt of the spare sword lying at the left of him who speaks for luata  this then is the secret of both life and death he whispered and at the same instant he grasped the wieroo by the right wrist and with his own right hand swung the extra blade in a sudden vicious blow against the creatures neck before the thing could give even a single cry of alarm then without waiting an instant bradley leaped past the dead god and vanished behind the hides that had hidden the girl  wideeyed and panting the girl seized his arm  oh what have you done she cried  he who speaks for luata will be avenged by luata now indeed must you die  there is no escape for even though we reached my own country luata can find you out  bosh exclaimed bradley and then  but you were going to knife him yourself  then i alone should have died she replied  bradley scratched his head  neither of us is going to die he said at least not at the hands of any god  if we dont get out of here though well die right enough  can you find your way back to the room where i first came upon you in the temple  i know the way replied the girl but i doubt if we can go back without being seen  i came hither because i only met wieroos who knew that i am supposed now to be in the temple but you could go elsewhere without being discovered  bradleys ingenuity had come up against a stone wall  there seemed no possibility of escape  he looked about him  they were in a small room where lay a litter of rubbishtorn bits of cloth old hides pieces of fiber rope  in the center of the room was a cylindrical shaft with an opening in its face  bradley knew it for what it was  here the archfiend dragged his victims and cast their bodies into the river of death far below  the floor about the opening in the shaft and the sides of the shaft were clotted thick with a dried dark brown substance that the englishman knew had once been blood  the place had the appearance of having been a veritable shambles  an odor of decaying flesh permeated the air  the englishman crossed to the shaft and peered into the opening  all below was dark as pitch but at the bottom he knew was the river suddenly an inspiration and a bold scheme leaped to his mind  turning quickly he hunted about the room until he found what he soughta quantity of the rope that lay strewn here and there  with rapid fingers he unsnarled the different lengths the girl helping him and then he tied the ends together until he had three ropes about seventyfive feet in length  he fastened these together at each end and without a word secured one of the ends about the girls body beneath her arms  dont be frightened he said at length as he led her toward the opening in the shaft  im going to lower you to the river and then im coming down after you  when you are safe below give two quick jerks upon the rope  if there is danger there and you want me to draw you up into the shaft jerk once  dont be afraidit is the only way  i am not afraid replied the girl rather haughtily bradley thought and herself climbed through the aperture and hung by her hands waiting for bradley to lower her  as rapidly as was consistent with safety the man paid out the rope when it was about half out he heard loud cries and wails suddenly arise within the room they had just quitted  the slaying of their god had been discovered by the wieroos  a search for the slayer would begin at once  lord  would the girl never reach the river  at last just as he was positive that searchers were already entering the room behind him there came two quick tugs at the rope  instantly bradley made the rest of the strands fast about the shaft slipped into the black tube and began a hurried descent toward the river  an instant later he stood waist deep in water beside the girl  impulsively she reached toward him and grasped his arm  a strange thrill ran through him at the contact but he only cut the rope from about her body and lifted her to the little shelf at the rivers side  how can we leave here she asked  by the river he replied but first i must go back to the blue place of seven skulls and get the poor devil i left there  ill have to wait until after dark though as i cannot pass through the open stretch of river in the temple gardens by day  there is another way said the girl  i have never seen it but often i have heard them speak of ita corridor that runs beside the river from one end of the city to the other  through the gardens it is below ground  if we could find an entrance to it we could leave here at once  it is not safe here for they will search every inch of the temple and the grounds  come said bradley  well have a look for it anyway and so saying he approached one of the doors that opened onto the skullpaved shelf  they found the corridor easily for it paralleled the river separated from it only by a single wall  it took them beneath the gardens and the city always through inky darkness  after they had reached the other side of the gardens bradley counted his steps until he had retraced as many as he had taken coming down the stream but though they had to grope their way along it was a much more rapid trip than the former  when he thought he was about opposite the point at which he had descended from the blue place of seven skulls he sought and found a doorway leading out onto the river and then still in the blackest darkness he lowered himself into the stream and felt up and down upon the opposite side for the little shelf and the ladder  ten yards from where he had emerged he found them while the girl waited upon the opposite side  to ascend to the secret panel was the work of but a minute  here he paused and listened lest a wieroo might be visiting the prison in search of him or the other inmate but no sound came from the gloomy interior  bradley could not but muse upon the joy of the man on the opposite side when he should drop down to him with food and a new hope for escape  then he opened the panel and looked into the room  the faint light from the grating above revealed the pile of rags in one corner but the man lay beneath them he made no response to bradleys low greeting  the englishman lowered himself to the floor of the room and approached the rags  stooping he lifted a corner of them  yes there was the man asleep  bradley shook himthere was no response  he stooped lower and in the dim light examined antak then he stood up with a sigh  a rat leaped from beneath the coverings and scurried away  poor devil muttered bradley  he crossed the room to swing himself to the perch preparatory to quitting the blue place of seven skulls forever  beneath the perch he paused  ill not give them the satisfaction he growled  let them believe that he escaped  returning to the pile of rags he gathered the man into his arms  it was difficult work raising him to the high perch and dragging him through the small opening and thus down the ladder but presently it was done and bradley had lowered the body into the river and cast it off  goodbye old top he whispered  a moment later he had rejoined the girl and hand in hand they were following the dark corridor upstream toward the farther end of the city  she told him that the wieroos seldom frequented these lower passages as the air here was too chill for them but occasionally they came and as they could see quite as well by night as by day they would be sure to discover bradley and the girl  if they come close enough she said we can see their eyes shining in the darkthey resemble dull splotches of light  they glow but do not blaze like the eyes of the tiger or the lion  the man could not but note the very evident horror with which she mentioned the creatures  to him they were uncanny but she had been used to them for a year almost and probably all her life she had either seen or heard of them constantly  why do you fear them so he asked  it seems more than any ordinary fear of the harm they can do you  she tried to explain but the nearest he could gather was that she looked upon the wieroo almost as supernatural beings  there is a legend current among my people that once the wieroo were unlike us only in that they possessed rudimentary wings  they lived in villages in the galu country and while the two peoples often warred they held no hatred for one another  in those days each race came up from the beginning and there was great rivalry as to which was the higher in the scale of evolution  the wieroo developed the first cosatalu but they were always malenever could they reproduce woman  slowly they commenced to develop certain attributes of the mind which they considered placed them upon a still higher level and which gave them many advantages over us seeing which they thought only of mental developmenttheir minds became like stars and the rivers moving always in the same manner never varying  they called this tasad which means doing everything the right way or in other words the wieroo way  if foe or friend right or wrong stood in the way of tasad then it must be crushed  soon the galus and the lesser races of men came to hate and fear them it was then that the wieroos decided to carry tasad into every part of the world  they were very warlike and very numerous although they had long since adopted the policy of slaying all those among them whose wings did not show advanced development  it took ages for all this to happenvery slowly came the different changes but at last the wieroos had wings they could use  but by reason of always making war upon their neighbors they were hated by every creature of caspak for no one wanted their tasad and so they used their wings to fly to this island when the other races turned against them and threatened to kill them all  so cruel had they become and so bloodthirsty that they no longer had hearts that beat with love or sympathy but their very cruelty and wickedness kept them from conquering the other races since they were also cruel and wicked to one another so that no wieroo trusted another  always were they slaying those above them that they might rise in power and possessions until at last came the more powerful than the others with a tasad all his own  he gathered about him a few of the most terrible wieroos and among them they made laws which took from all but these few wieroos every weapon they possessed  now their tasad has reached a high plane among them  they make many wonderful things that we cannot make  they think great thoughts no doubt and still dream of greatness to come but their thoughts and their acts are regulated by ages of customthey are all alikeand they are most unhappy  as the girl talked the two moved steadily along the dark passageway beside the river  they had advanced a considerable distance when there sounded faintly from far ahead the muffled roar of falling water which increased in volume as they moved forward until at last it filled the corridor with a deafening sound  then the corridor ended in a blank wall but in a niche to the right was a ladder leading aloft and to the left was a door opening onto the river  bradley tried the latter first and as he opened it felt a heavy spray against his face the little shelf outside the doorway was wet and slippery the roaring of the water tremendous  there could be but one explanationthey had reached a waterfall in the river and if the corridor actually terminated here their escape was effectually cut off since it was quite evidently impossible to follow the bed of the river and ascend the falls  as the ladder was the only alternative the two turned toward it and the man first began the ascent which was through a well similar to that which had led him to the upper floors of the temple  as he climbed bradley felt for openings in the sides of the shaft but he discovered none below fifty feet  the first he came to was ajar letting a faint light into the well  as he paused the girl climbed to his side and together they looked through the crack into a lowceiled chamber in which were several galu women and an equal number of hideous little replicas of the fullgrown wieroos with which bradley was not quite familiar  he could feel the body of the girl pressed close to his tremble as her eyes rested upon the inmates of the room and involuntarily his arm encircled her shoulders as though to protect her from some danger which he sensed without recognizing  poor things she whispered  this is their horrible fateto be imprisoned here beneath the surface of the city with their hideous offspring whom they hate as they hate their fathers  a wieroo keeps his children thus hidden until they are fullgrown lest they be murdered by their fellows  the lower rooms of the city are filled with many such as these  several feet above was a second door beyond which they found a small room stored with food in wooden vessels  a grated window in one wall opened above an alley and through it they could see that they were just below the roof of the building  darkness was coming and at bradleys suggestion they decided to remain hidden here until after dark and then to ascend to the roof and reconnoiter  shortly after they had settled themselves they heard something descending the ladder from above  they hoped that it would continue on down the well and fairly held their breath as the sound approached the door to the storeroom  their hearts sank as they heard the door open and from between cracks in the vessels behind which they hid saw a yellowslashed wieroo enter the room  each recognized him immediately the girl indicating the fact of her own recognition by a sudden pressure of her fingers on bradleys arm  it was the wieroo of the yellow slashing whose abode was the place of the yellow door in which bradley had first seen the girl  the creature carried a wooden bowl which it filled with dried food from several of the vessels then it turned and quit the room  bradley could see through the partially open doorway that it descended the ladder  the girl told him that it was taking the food to the women and the young below and that while it might return immediately the chances were that it would remain for some time  we are just below the place of the yellow door she said  it is far from the edge of the city so far that we may not hope to escape if we ascend to the roofs here  i think replied the man that of all the places in oooh this will be the easiest to escape from  anyway i want to return to the place of the yellow door and get my pistol if it is there  it is still there replied the girl  i saw it placed in a chest where he keeps the things he takes from his prisoners and victims  good exclaimed bradley  now come quickly  and the two crossed the room to the well and ascended the ladder a short distance to its top where they found another door that opened into a vacant roomthe same in which bradley had first met the girl  to find the pistol was a matter of but a moments search on the part of bradleys companion and then at the englishmans signal she followed him to the yellow door  it was quite dark without as the two entered the narrow passage between two buildings  a few steps brought them undiscovered to the doorway of the storeroom where lay the body of foshbalsoj  in the distance toward the temple they could hear sounds as of a great gathering of wieroosthe peculiar uncanny wailing rising above the dismal flapping of countless wings  they have heard of the killing of him who speaks for luata whispered the girl  soon they will spread in all directions searching for us  and will they find us  as surely as lua gives light by day she replied and when they find us they will tear us to pieces for only the wieroos may murderonly they may practice tasad  but they will not kill you said bradley  you did not slay him  it will make no difference she insisted  if they find us together they will slay us both  then they wont find us together announced bradley decisively  you stay right hereyou wont be any worse off than before i cameand ill get as far as i can and account for as many of the beggars as possible before they get me  goodbye  youre a mighty decent little girl  i wish that i might have helped you  no she cried  do not leave me  i would rather die  i had hoped and hoped to find some way to return to my own country  i wanted to go back to antak who must be very lonely without me but i know that it can never be  it is difficult to kill hope though mine is nearly dead  do not leave me  antak bradley repeated  you loved a man called antak  yes replied the girl  antak was away hunting when the wieroo caught me  how he must have grieved for me  he also was cosatalu twelve moons older than i and all our lives we have been together  bradley remained silent  so she loved antak  he hadnt the heart to tell her that antak had died or how  at the door of foshbalsojs storeroom they halted to listen  no sound came from within and gently bradley pushed open the door  all was inky darkness as they entered but presently their eyes became accustomed to the gloom that was partially relieved by the soft starlight without  the englishman searched and found those things for which he had cometwo robes two pairs of dead wings and several lengths of fiber rope  one pair of the wings he adjusted to the girls shoulders by means of the rope  then he draped the robe about her carrying the cowl over her head  he heard her gasp of astonishment when she realized the ingenuity and boldness of his plan then he directed her to adjust the other pair of wings and the robe upon him  working with strong deft fingers she soon had the work completed and the two stepped out upon the roof to all intent and purpose genuine wieroos  besides his pistol bradley carried the sword of the slain wieroo prophet while the girl was armed with the small blade of the red wieroo  side by side they walked slowly across the roofs toward the north edge of the city  wieroos flapped above them and several times they passed others walking or sitting upon the roofs  from the temple still rose the sounds of commotion now pierced by occasional shrill screams  the murderers are abroad whispered the girl  thus will another become the tongue of luata  it is well for us since it keeps them too busy to give the time for searching for us  they think that we cannot escape the city and they know that we cannot leave the islandand so do i  bradley shook his head  if there is any way we will find it he said  there is no way replied the girl  bradley made no response and in silence they continued until the outer edge of roofs was visible before them  we are almost there he whispered  the girl felt for his fingers and pressed them  he could feel hers trembling as he returned the pressure nor did he relinquish her hand and thus they came to the edge of the last roof  here they halted and looked about them  to be seen attempting to descend to the ground below would be to betray the fact that they were not wieroos  bradley wished that their wings were attached to their bodies by sinew and muscle rather than by ropes of fiber  a wieroo was flapping far overhead  two more stood near a door a few yards distant standing between these and one of the outer pedestals that supported one of the numerous skulls bradley made one end of a piece of rope fast about the pedestal and dropped the other end to the ground outside the city  then they waited  it was an hour before the coast was entirely clear and then a moment came when no wieroo was in sight  now whispered bradley and the girl grasped the rope and slid over the edge of the roof into the darkness below  a moment later bradley felt two quick pulls upon the rope and immediately followed to the girls side  across a narrow clearing they made their way and into a wood beyond all night they walked following the river upward toward its source and at dawn they took shelter in a thicket beside the stream  at no time did they hear the cry of a carnivore and though many startled animals fled as they approached they were not once menaced by a wild beast  when bradley expressed surprise at the absence of the fiercest beasts that are so numerous upon the mainland of caprona the girl explained the reason that is contained in one of their ancient legends  when the wieroos first developed wings upon which they could fly they found this island devoid of any life other than a few reptiles that live either upon land or in the water and these only close to the coast  requiring meat for food the wieroos carried to the island such animals as they wished for that purpose  they still occasionally bring them and this with the natural increase keeps them provided with flesh  as it will us suggested bradley  the first day they remained in hiding eating only the dried food that bradley had brought with him from the temple storeroom and the next night they set out again up the river continuing steadily on until almost dawn when they came to low hills where the river wound through a gorgeit was little more than rivulet now the water clear and cold and filled with fish similar to brook trout though much larger  not wishing to leave the stream the two waded along its bed to a spot where the gorge widened between perpendicular bluffs to a wooded acre of level land  here they stopped for here also the stream ended  they had reached its sourcemany cold springs bubbling up from the center of a little natural amphitheater in the hills and forming a clear and beautiful pool overshadowed by trees upon one side and bounded by a little clearing upon the other  with the coming of the sun they saw they had stumbled upon a place where they might remain hidden from the wieroos for a long time and also one that they could defend against these winged creatures since the trees would shield them from an attack from above and also hamper the movements of the creatures should they attempt to follow them into the wood  for three days they rested here before trying to explore the neighboring country  on the fourth bradley stated that he was going to scale the bluffs and learn what lay beyond  he told the girl that she should remain in hiding but she refused to be left saying that whatever fate was to be his she intended to share it so that he was at last forced to permit her to come with him  through woods at the summit of the bluff they made their way toward the north and had gone but a short distance when the wood ended and before them they saw the waters of the inland sea and dimly in the distance the coveted shore  the beach lay some two hundred yards from the foot of the hill on which they stood nor was there a tree nor any other form of shelter between them and the water as far up and down the coast as they could see among other plans bradley had thought of constructing a covered raft upon which they might drift to the mainland but as such a contrivance would necessarily be of considerable weight it must be built in the water of the sea since they could not hope to move it even a short distance overland  if this wood was only at the edge of the water he sighed  but it is not the girl reminded him and then  let us make the best of it  we have escaped from death for a time at least  we have food and good water and peace and each other  what more could we have upon the mainland  but i thought you wanted to get back to your own country he exclaimed  she cast her eyes upon the ground and half turned away  i do she said yet i am happy here  i could be little happier there  bradley stood in silent thought  we have food and good water and peace and each other he repeated to himself  he turned then and looked at the girl and it was as though in the days that they had been together this was the first time that he had really seen her  the circumstances that had thrown them together the dangers through which they had passed all the weird and horrible surroundings that had formed the background of his knowledge of her had had their effectshe had been but the companion of an adventure her selfreliance her endurance her loyalty had been only what one man might expect of another and he saw that he had unconsciously assumed an attitude toward her that he might have assumed toward a man  yet there had been a differencehe recalled now the strange sensation of elation that had thrilled him upon the occasions when the girl had pressed his hand in hers and the depression that had followed her announcement of her love for antak  he took a step toward her  a fierce yearning to seize her and crush her in his arms swept over him and then there flashed upon the screen of recollection the picture of a stately hall set amidst broad gardens and ancient trees and of a proud old man with beetling browsan old man who held his head very highand bradley shook his head and turned away again  they went back then to their little acre and the days came and went and the man fashioned spear and bow and arrows and hunted with them that they might have meat and he made hooks of fishbone and caught fishes with wondrous flies of his own invention and the girl gathered fruits and cooked the flesh and the fish and made beds of branches and soft grasses  she cured the hides of the animals he killed and made them soft by much pounding  she made sandals for herself and for the man and fashioned a hide after the manner of those worn by the warriors of her tribe and made the man wear it for his own garments were in rags  she was always the samesweet and kind and helpfulbut always there was about her manner and her expression just a trace of wistfulness and often she sat and looked at the man when he did not know it her brows puckered in thought as though she were trying to fathom and to understand him  in the face of the cliff bradley scooped a cave from the rotted granite of which the hill was composed making a shelter for them against the rains  he brought wood for their cookfire which they used only in the middle of the daya time when there was little likelihood of wieroos being in the air so far from their cityand then he learned to bank it with earth in such a way that the embers held until the following noon without giving off smoke  always he was planning on reaching the mainland and never a day passed that he did not go to the top of the hill and look out across the sea toward the dark distant line that meant for him comparative freedom and possibly reunion with his comrades  the girl always went with him standing at his side and watching the stern expression on his face with just a tinge of sadness on her own  you are not happy she said once  i should be over there with my men he replied  i do not know what may have happened to them  i  want you to be happy she said quite simply but i should be very lonely if you went away and left me here  he put his hand on her shoulder  i would not do that little girl he said gently  if you cannot go with me i shall not go  if either of us must go alone it will be you  her face lighted to a wondrous smile  then we shall not be separated she said for i shall never leave you as long as we both live  he looked down into her face for a moment and then  who was antak he asked  my brother she replied  why  and then even less than before could he tell her  it was then that he did something he had never done beforehe put his arms about her and stooping kissed her forehead  until you find antak he said i will be your brother  she drew away  i already have a brother she said and i do not want another    chapter 5  days became weeks and weeks became months and the months followed one another in a lazy procession of hot humid days and warm humid nights the fugitives saw never a wieroo by day though often at night they heard the melancholy flapping of giant wings far above them  each day was much like its predecessor  bradley splashed about for a few minutes in the cold pool early each morning and after a time the girl tried it and liked it  toward the center it was deep enough for swimming and so he taught her to swimshe was probably the first human being in all caspaks long ages who had done this thing  and then while she prepared breakfast the man shavedthis he never neglected  at first it was a source of wonderment to the girl for the galu men are beardless  when they needed meat he hunted otherwise he busied himself in improving their shelter making new and better weapons perfecting his knowledge of the girls language and teaching her to speak and to write englishanything that would keep them both occupied  he still sought new plans for escape but with everlessening enthusiasm since each new scheme presented some insurmountable obstacle  and then one day as a bolt out of a clear sky came that which blasted the peace and security of their sanctuary forever  bradley was just emerging from the water after his morning plunge when from overhead came the sound of flapping wings  glancing quickly up the man saw a whiterobed wieroo circling slowly above him  that he had been discovered he could not doubt since the creature even dropped to a lower altitude as though to assure itself that what it saw was a man then it rose rapidly and winged away toward the city  for two days bradley and the girl lived in a constant state of apprehension awaiting the moment when the hunters would come for them but nothing happened until just after dawn of the third day when the flapping of wings apprised them of the approach of wieroos  together they went to the edge of the wood and looked up to see five redrobed creatures dropping slowly in everlessening spirals toward their little amphitheater  with no attempt at concealment they came sure of their ability to overwhelm these two fugitives and with the fullest measure of selfconfidence they landed in the clearing but a few yards from the man and the girl  following a plan already discussed bradley and the girl retreated slowly into the woods  the wieroos advanced calling upon them to give themselves up but the quarry made no reply  farther and farther into the little wood bradley led the hunters permitting them to approach ever closer then he circled back again toward the clearing evidently to the great delight of the wieroos who now followed more leisurely awaiting the moment when they should be beyond the trees and able to use their wings  they had opened into semicircular formation now with the evident intention of cutting the two off from returning into the wood  each wieroo advanced with his curved blade ready in his hand each hideous face blank and expressionless  it was then that bradley opened fire with his pistolthree shots aimed with careful deliberation for it had been long since he had used the weapon and he could not afford to chance wasting ammunition on misses  at each shot a wieroo dropped and then the remaining two sought escape by flight screaming and wailing after the manner of their kind  when a wieroo runs his wings spread almost without any volition upon his part since from time immemorial he has always used them to balance himself and accelerate his running speed so that in the open they appear to skim the surface of the ground when in the act of running  but here in the woods among the closeset boles the spreading of their wings proved their undoingit hindered and stopped them and threw them to the ground and then bradley was upon them threatening them with instant death if they did not surrenderpromising them their freedom if they did his bidding  as you have seen he cried i can kill you when i wish and at a distance  you cannot escape me  your only hope of life lies in obedience  quick or i kill  the wieroos stopped and faced him  what do you want of us asked one  throw aside your weapons bradley commanded  after a moments hesitation they obeyed  now approach  a great planthe only planhad suddenly come to him like an inspiration  the wieroos came closer and halted at his command  bradley turned to the girl  there is rope in the shelter he said  fetch it  she did as he bid and then he directed her to fasten one end of a fiftyfoot length to the ankle of one of the wieroos and the opposite end to the second  the creatures gave evidence of great fear but they dared not attempt to prevent the act  now go out into the clearing said bradley and remember that i am walking close behind and that i will shoot the nearer one should either attempt to escapethat will hold the other until i can kill him as well  in the open he halted them  the girl will get upon the back of the one in front announced the englishman  i will mount the other  she carries a sharp blade and i carry this weapon that you know kills easily at a distance  if you disobey in the slightest the instructions that i am about to give you you shall both die  that we must die with you will not deter us  if you obey i promise to set you free without harming you  you will carry us due west depositing us upon the shore of the mainlandthat is all  it is the price of your lives  do you agree  sullenly the wieroos acquiesced  bradley examined the knots that held the rope to their ankles and feeling them secure directed the girl to mount the back of the leading wieroo himself upon the other  then he gave the signal for the two to rise together  with loud flapping of the powerful wings the creatures took to the air circling once before they topped the trees upon the hill and then taking a course due west out over the waters of the sea  nowhere about them could bradley see signs of other wieroos nor of those other menaces which he had feared might bring disaster to his plans for escapethe huge winged reptilia that are so numerous above the southern areas of caspak and which are often seen though in lesser numbers farther north  nearer and nearer loomed the mainlanda broad parklike expanse stretching inland to the foot of a low plateau spread out before them the little dots in the foreground became grazing herds of deer and antelope and bos a huge woolly rhinoceros wallowed in a mudhole to the right and beyond a mighty mammoth culled the tender shoots from a tall tree  the roars and screams and growls of giant carnivora came faintly to their ears  ah this was caspak  with all of its dangers and its primal savagery it brought a fullness to the throat of the englishman as to one who sees and hears the familiar sights and sounds of home after a long absence  then the wieroos dropped swiftly downward to the flowerstarred turf that grew almost to the waters edge the fugitives slipped from their backs and bradley told the redrobed creatures they were free to go  when he had cut the ropes from their ankles they rose with that uncanny wailing upon their lips that always brought a shudder to the englishman and upon dismal wings they flapped away toward frightful oooh  when the creatures had gone the girl turned toward bradley  why did you have them bring us here she asked  now we are far from my country  we may never live to reach it as we are among enemies who while not so horrible will kill us just as surely as would the wieroos should they capture us and we have before us many marches through lands filled with savage beasts  there were two reasons replied bradley  you told me that there are two wieroo cities at the eastern end of the island  to have passed near either of them might have been to have brought about our heads hundreds of the creatures from whom we could not possibly have escaped again my friends must be near this spotit cannot be over two marches to the fort of which i have told you  it is my duty to return to them if they still live we shall find a way to return you to your people  and you asked the girl  i escaped from oooh replied bradley  i have accomplished the impossible once and so i shall accomplish it againi shall escape from caspak  he was not looking at her face as he answered her and so he did not see the shadow of sorrow that crossed her countenance  when he raised his eyes again she was smiling  what you wish i wish said the girl  southward along the coast they made their way following the beach where the walking was best but always keeping close enough to trees to insure sanctuary from the beasts and reptiles that so often menaced them  it was late in the afternoon when the girl suddenly seized bradleys arm and pointed straight ahead along the shore  what is that she whispered  what strange reptile is it  bradley looked in the direction her slim forefinger indicated  he rubbed his eyes and looked again and then he seized her wrist and drew her quickly behind a clump of bushes  what is it she asked  it is the most frightful reptile that the waters of the world have ever known he replied  it is a german uboat  an expression of amazement and understanding lighted her features  it is the thing of which you told me she exclaimed the thing that swims under the water and carries men in its belly  it is replied bradley  then why do you hide from it asked the girl  you said that now it belonged to your friends  many months have passed since i knew what was going on among my friends he replied  i cannot know what has befallen them  they should have been gone from here in this vessel long since and so i cannot understand why it is still here  i am going to investigate first before i show myself  when i left there were more germans on the u33 than there were men of my own party at the fort and i have had sufficient experience of germans to know that they will bear watchingif they have not been properly watched since i left  making their way through a fringe of wood that grew a few yards inland the two crept unseen toward the uboat which lay moored to the shore at a point which bradley now recognized as being near the oilpool north of dinosaur  as close as possible to the vessel they halted crouching low among the dense vegetation and watched the boat for signs of human life about it  the hatches were closedno one could be seen or heard for five minutes bradley watched and then he determined to board the submarine and investigate  he had risen to carry his decision into effect when there suddenly broke upon his ear uttered in loud and menacing tones a volley of german oaths and expletives among which he heard englische schweinhunde repeated several times  the voice did not come from the direction of the uboat but from inland  creeping forward bradley reached a spot where through the creepers hanging from the trees he could see a party of men coming down toward the shore  he saw baron friedrich von schoenvorts and six of his menall armedwhile marching in a little knot among them were olson brady sinclair wilson and whitely  bradley knew nothing of the disappearance of bowen tyler and miss la rue nor of the perfidy of the germans in shelling the fort and attempting to escape in the u33 but he was in no way surprised at what he saw before him  the little party came slowly onward the prisoners staggering beneath heavy cans of oil while schwartz one of the german noncommissioned officers cursed and beat them with a stick of wood impartially  von schoenvorts walked in the rear of the column encouraging schwartz and laughing at the discomfiture of the britishers  dietz heinz and klatz also seemed to enjoy the entertainment immensely but two of the menplesser and hindlemarched with eyes straight to the front and with scowling faces  bradley felt his blood boil at sight of the cowardly indignities being heaped upon his men and in the brief span of time occupied by the column to come abreast of where he lay hidden he made his plans foolhardy though he knew them  then he drew the girl close to him stay here he whispered  i am going out to fight those beasts but i shall be killed  do not let them see you  do not let them take you alive  they are more cruel more cowardly more bestial than the wieroos  the girl pressed close to him her face very white  go if that is right she whispered but if you die i shall die for i cannot live without you  he looked sharply into her eyes  oh he ejaculated what an idiot i have been  nor could i live without you little girl  and he drew her very close and kissed her lips  goodbye he disengaged himself from her arms and looked again in time to see that the rear of the column had just passed him  then he rose and leaped quickly and silently from the jungle  suddenly von schoenvorts felt an arm thrown about his neck and his pistol jerked from its holster  he gave a cry of fright and warning and his men turned to see a halfnaked white man holding their leader securely from behind and aiming a pistol at them over his shoulder  drop those guns came in short sharp syllables and perfect german from the lips of the newcomer  drop them or ill put a bullet through the back of von schoenvorts head  the germans hesitated for a moment looking first toward von schoenvorts and then to schwartz who was evidently second in command for orders  its the english pig bradley shouted the latter and hes alonego and get him  go yourself growled plesser  hindle moved close to the side of plesser and whispered something to him  the latter nodded  suddenly von schoenvorts wheeled about and seized bradleys pistol arm with both hands now he shouted  come and take him quick  schwartz and three others leaped forward but plesser and hindle held back looking questioningly toward the english prisoners  then plesser spoke  now is your chance englander he called in low tones seize hindle and me and take our guns from uswe will not fight hard  olson and brady were not long in acting upon the suggestion  they had seen enough of the brutal treatment von schoenvorts accorded his men and the especially venomous attentions he had taken great enjoyment in according plesser and hindle to understand that these two might be sincere in a desire for revenge  in another moment the two germans were unarmed and olson and brady were running to the support of bradley but already it seemed too late  von schoenvorts had managed to drag the englishman around so that his back was toward schwartz and the other advancing germans  schwartz was almost upon bradley with gun clubbed and ready to smash down upon the englishmans skull  brady and olson were charging the germans in the rear with wilson whitely and sinclair supporting them with bare fists  it seemed that bradley was doomed when apparently out of space an arrow whizzed striking schwartz in the side passing halfway through his body to crumple him to earth  with a shriek the man fell and at the same time olson and brady saw the slim figure of a young girl standing at the edge of the jungle coolly fitting another arrow to her bow  bradley had now succeeded in wrestling his arm free from von schoenvorts grip and in dropping the latter with a blow from the butt of his pistol  the rest of the english and germans were engaged in a handtohand encounter  plesser and hindle standing aside from the melee and urging their comrades to surrender and join with the english against the tyranny of von schoenvorts  heinz and klatz possibly influenced by their exhortation were putting up but a halfhearted resistance but dietz a huge bearded bullnecked prussian yelling like a maniac sought to exterminate the englische schweinhunde with his bayonet fearing to fire his piece lest he kill some of his comrades  it was olson who engaged him and though unused to the long german rifle and bayonet he met the bullrush of the hun with the cold cruel precision and science of english bayonetfighting  there was no feinting no retiring and no parrying that was not also an attack bayonetfighting today is not a pretty thing to seeit is not an artistic fencingmatch in which men give and takeit is slaughter inevitable and quickly over  dietz lunged once madly at olsons throat  a short point with just a twist of the bayonet to the left sent the sharp blade over the englishmans left shoulder  instantly he stepped close in dropped his rifle through his hands and grasped it with both hands close below the muzzle and with a short sharp jab sent his blade up beneath dietzs chin to the brain  so quickly was the thing done and so quick the withdrawal that olson had wheeled to take on another adversary before the germans corpse had toppled to the ground  but there were no more adversaries to take on  heinz and klatz had thrown down their rifles and with hands above their heads were crying kamerad  kamerad at the tops of their voices  von schoenvorts still lay where he had fallen  plesser and hindle were explaining to bradley that they were glad of the outcome of the fight as they could no longer endure the brutality of the uboat commander  the remainder of the men were looking at the girl who now advanced slowly her bow ready when bradley turned toward her and held out his hand  cotan he said unstring your bowthese are my friends and yours  and to the englishmen  this is cotan  you who saw her save me from schwartz know a part of what i owe her  the rough men gathered about the girl and when she spoke to them in broken english with a smile upon her lips enhancing the charm of her irresistible accent each and every one of them promptly fell in love with her and constituted himself henceforth her guardian and her slave  a moment later the attention of each was called to plesser by a volley of invective  they turned in time to see the man running toward von schoenvorts who was just rising from the ground  plesser carried a rifle with bayonet fixed that he had snatched from the side of dietzs corpse  von schoenvorts face was livid with fear his jaws working as though he would call for help but no sound came from his blue lips  you struck me shrieked plesser  once twice three times you struck me pig  you murdered schwerkeyou drove him insane by your cruelty until he took his own life  you are only one of your kindthey are all like you from the kaiser down  i wish that you were the kaiser  thus would i do  and he lunged his bayonet through von schoenvorts chest  then he let his rifle fall with the dying man and wheeled toward bradley  here i am he said  do with me as you like  all my life i have been kicked and cuffed by such as that and yet always have i gone out when they commanded singing to give up my life if need be to keep them in power  only lately have i come to know what a fool i have been  but now i am no longer a fool and besides i am avenged and schwerke is avenged so you can kill me if you wish here i am  if i was after bein the king said olson id pin the vc on your noble chist but bein only an irishman with a swede name for which god forgive me the bist i can do is shake your hand  you will not be punished said bradley  there are four of you leftif you four want to come along and work with us we will take you but you will come as prisoners  it suits me said plesser  now that the captainlieutenant is dead you need not fear us  all our lives we have known nothing but to obey his class  if i had not killed him i suppose i would be fool enough to obey him again but he is dead  now we will obey youwe must obey some one  and you  bradley turned to the other survivors of the original crew of the u33  each promised obedience  the two dead germans were buried in a single grave and then the party boarded the submarine and stowed away the oil  here bradley told the men what had befallen him since the night of september 14th when he had disappeared so mysteriously from the camp upon the plateau  now he learned for the first time that bowen j tyler jr and miss la rue had been missing even longer than he and that no faintest trace of them had been discovered  olson told him of how the germans had returned and waited in ambush for them outside the fort capturing them that they might be used to assist in the work of refining the oil and later in manning the u33 and plesser told briefly of the experiences of the german crew under von schoenvorts since they had escaped from caspak months beforeof how they lost their bearings after having been shelled by ships they had attempted to sneak farther north and how at last with provisions gone and fuel almost exhausted they had sought and at last found more by accident than design the mysterious island they had once been so glad to leave behind  now announced bradley well plan for the future  the boat has fuel provisions and water for a month i believe you said plesser there are ten of us to man it  we have a last sad duty herewe must search for miss la rue and mr tyler  i say a sad duty because we know that we shall not find them but it is none the less our duty to comb the shoreline firing signal shells at intervals that we at least may leave at last with full knowledge that we have done all that men might do to locate them  none dissented from this conviction nor was there a voice raised in protest against the plan to at least make assurance doubly sure before quitting caspak forever  and so they started cruising slowly up the coast and firing an occasional shot from the gun  often the vessel was brought to a stop and always there were anxious eyes scanning the shore for an answering signal  late in the afternoon they caught sight of a number of bandlu warriors but when the vessel approached the shore and the natives realized that human beings stood upon the back of the strange monster of the sea they fled in terror before bradley could come within hailing distance  that night they dropped anchor at the mouth of a sluggish stream whose warm waters swarmed with millions of tiny tadpolelike organismsminute human spawn starting on their precarious journey from some inland pool toward the beginninga journey which one in millions perhaps might survive to complete  already almost at the inception of life they were being greeted by thousands of voracious mouths as fish and reptiles of many kinds fought to devour them the while other and larger creatures pursued the devourers to be in turn preyed upon by some other of the countless forms that inhabit the deeps of capronas frightful sea  the second day was practically a repetition of the first  they moved very slowly with frequent stops and once they landed in the krolu country to hunt  here they were attacked by the bowandarrow men whom they could not persuade to palaver with them  so belligerent were the natives that it became necessary to fire into them in order to escape their persistent and ferocious attentions  what chance asked bradley as they were returning to the boat with their game could tyler and miss la rue have had among such as these  but they continued on their fruitless quest and the third day after cruising along the shore of a deep inlet they passed a line of lofty cliffs that formed the southern shore of the inlet and rounded a sharp promontory about noon  cotan and bradley were on deck alone and as the new shoreline appeared beyond the point the girl gave an exclamation of joy and seized the mans hand in hers  oh look she cried  the galu country  the galu country  it is my country that i never thought to see again  you are glad to come again cotan asked bradley  oh so glad she cried  and you will come with me to my people  we may live here among them and you will be a great warrioroh when jor dies you may even be chief for there is none so mighty as my warrior you will come  bradley shook his head  i cannot little cotan he answered  my country needs me and i must go back  maybe someday i shall return you will not forget me cotan  she looked at him in wideeyed wonder  you are going away from me she asked in a very small voice  you are going away from cotan  bradley looked down upon the little bowed head  he felt the soft cheek against his bare arm and he felt something else there toohot drops of moisture that ran down to his very fingertips and splashed but each one wrung from a womans heart  he bent low and raised the tearstained face to his own  no cotan he said i am not going away from youfor you are going with me  you are going back to my own country to be my wife  tell me that you will cotan  and he bent still lower yet from his height and kissed her lips  nor did he need more than the wonderful new light in her eyes to tell him that she would go to the end of the world with him if he would but take her  and then the guncrew came up from below again to fire a signal shot and the two were brought down from the high heaven of their new happiness to the scarred and weatherbeaten deck of the u33  an hour later the vessel was running close in by a shore of wondrous beauty beside a parklike meadow that stretched back a mile inland to the foot of a plateau when whitely called attention to a score of figures clambering downward from the elevation to the lowland below the engines were reversed and the boat brought to a stop while all hands gathered on deck to watch the little party coming toward them across the meadow  they are galus cried cotan they are my own people  let me speak to them lest they think we come to fight them  put me ashore my man and i will go meet them  the nose of the uboat was run close in to the steep bank but when cotan would have run forward alone bradley seized her hand and held her back  i will go with you cotan he said and together they advanced to meet the oncoming party  there were about twenty warriors moving forward in a thin line as our infantry advance as skirmishers  bradley could not but notice the marked difference between this formation and the moblike methods of the lower tribes he had come in contact with and he commented upon it to cotan  galu warriors always advance into battle thus she said  the lesser people remain in a huddled group where they can scarce use their weapons the while they present so big a mark to us that our spears and arrows cannot miss them but when they hurl theirs at our warriors if they miss the first man there is no chance that they will kill some one behind him  stand still now she cautioned and fold your arms  they will not harm us then  bradley did as he was bid and the two stood with arms folded as the line of warriors approached  when they had come within some fifty yards they halted and one spoke  who are you and from whence do you come he asked and then cotan gave a little glad cry and sprang forward with outstretched arms  oh tan she exclaimed  do you not know your little cotan  the warrior stared incredulous for a moment and then he too ran forward and when they met took the girl in his arms  it was then that bradley experienced to the full a sensation that was new to hima sudden hatred for the strange warrior before him and a desire to kill without knowing why he would kill  he moved quickly to the girls side and grasped her wrist  who is this man he demanded in cold tones  cotan turned a surprised face toward the englishman and then of a sudden broke forth into a merry peal of laughter  this is my father bradlee she cried  and who is bradlee demanded the warrior  he is my man replied cotan simply  by what right insisted tan  and then she told him briefly of all that she had passed through since the wieroos had stolen her and of how bradley had rescued her and sought to rescue antak her brother  you are satisfied with him asked tan  yes replied the girl proudly  it was then that bradleys attention was attracted to the edge of the plateau by a movement there and looking closely he saw a horse bearing two figures sliding down the steep declivity  once at the bottom the animal came charging across the meadowland at a rapid run  it was a magnificent animala great bay stallion with a whiteblazed face and white forelegs to the knees its barrel encircled by a broad surcingle of white and as it came to a sudden stop beside tan the englishman saw that it bore a man and a girla tall man and a girl as beautiful as cotan  when the girl espied the latter she slid from the horse and ran toward her fairly screaming for joy  the man dismounted and stood beside tan  like bradley he was garbed after the fashion of the surrounding warriors but there was a subtle difference between him and his companion  possibly he detected a similar difference in bradley for his first question was from what country and though he spoke in galu bradley thought he detected an accent  england replied bradley  a broad smile lighted the newcomers face as he held out his hand  i am tom billings of santa monica california he said  i know all about you and im mighty glad to find you alive  how did you get here asked bradley  i thought ours was the only party of men from the outer world ever to enter caprona  it was until we came in search of bowen j tyler jr replied billings  we  found him and sent him home with his bride but i was kept a prisoner here  bradleys face darkenedthen they were not among friends after all there are ten of us down there on a german sub with smallarms and a gun he said quickly in english  it will be no trick to get away from these people  you dont know my jailer replied billings or youd not be so sure wait ill introduce you  and then turning to the girl who had accompanied him he called her by name  ajor he said permit me to introduce lieutenant bradley lieutenant mrs billingsmy jailer  the englishman laughed as he shook hands with the girl  you are not as good a soldier as i he said to billings  instead of being taken prisoner myself i have taken onemrs bradley this is mr billings  ajor quick to understand turned toward cotan  you are going back with him to his country she asked  cotan admitted it  you dare asked ajor  but your father will not permit itjor my father high chief of the galus will not permit it for like me you are cosatalo  oh cotan if we but could  how i would love to see all the strange and wonderful things of which my tom tells me  bradley bent and whispered in her ear  say the word and you may both go with us  billings heard and speaking in english asked ajor if she would go  yes she answered if you wish it but you know my tom that if jor captures us both you and cotans man will pay the penalty with your livesnot even his love for me nor his admiration for you can save you  bradley noticed that she spoke in englishbroken english like cotans but equally appealing  we can easily get you aboard the ship he said on some pretext or other and then we can steam away  they can neither harm nor detain us nor will we have to fire a shot at them  and so it was done bradley and cotan taking ajor and billings aboard to show them the vessel which almost immediately raised anchor and moved slowly out into the sea  i hate to do it said billings  they have been fine to me  jor and tan are splendid men and they will think me an ingrate but i cant waste my life here when there is so much to be done in the outer world  as they steamed down the inland sea past the island of oooh the stories of their adventures were retold and bradley learned that bowen tyler and his bride had left the galu country but a fortnight before and that there was every reason to believe that the toreador might still be lying in the pacific not far off the subterranean mouth of the river which emitted capronas heated waters into the ocean  late in the second day after running through swarms of hideous reptiles they submerged at the point where the river entered beneath the cliffs and shortly after rose to the sunlit surface of the pacific but nowhere as far as they could see was sign of another craft  down the coast they steamed toward the beach where billings had made his crossing in the hydroaeroplane and just at dusk the lookout announced a light dead ahead  it proved to be aboard the toreador and a halfhour later there was such a reunion on the deck of the trig little yacht as no one there had ever dreamed might be possible  of the allies there were only tippet and james to be mourned and no one mourned any of the germans dead nor benson the traitor whose ugly story was first told in bowen tylers manuscript  tyler and the rescue party had but just reached the yacht that afternoon  they had heard faintly the signal shots fired by the u33 but had been unable to locate their direction and so had assumed that they had come from the guns of the toreador  it was a happy party that sailed north toward sunny southern california the old u33 trailing in the wake of the toreador and flying with the latter the glorious stars and stripes beneath which she had been born in the shipyard at santa monica  three newly married couples their bonds now duly solemnized by the master of the ship joyed in the peace and security of the untracked waters of the south pacific and the unique honeymoon which had it not been for stern duty ahead they could have wished protracted till the end of time  and so they came one day to dock at the shipyard which bowen tyler now controlled and here the u33 still lies while those who passed so many eventful days within and because of her have gone their various ways
