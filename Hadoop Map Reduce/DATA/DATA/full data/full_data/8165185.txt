8165185	the early poems  of  alfred lord tennyson    edited with a critical introduction commentaries and notes  together with the various readings  a transcript of the poems temporarily and finally suppressed  and a bibliography    by  john churton collins     preface  a critical edition of tennysons poems has long been an acknowledged want he has taken his place among the english classics and as a classic he is and will be studied seriously and minutely by many thousands of his countrymen both in the present generation as well as in future ages as in the works of his more illustrious brethren so in his trifles will become subjects of curious interest and assume an importance of which we have no conception now here he will engage the attention of the antiquary there of the social historian long after his politics his ethics his theology have ceased to be immediately influential they will be of immense historical significance a consummate artist and a consummate master of our language the process by which he achieved results so memorable can never fail to be of interest and of absorbing interest to critical students  i must i fear claim the indulgence due to one who attempts for the first time a critical edition of a text so perplexingly voluminous in variants as tennysons i can only say that i have spared neither time nor labour to be accurate and exhaustive i have myself collated or have had collated for me every edition recorded in the british museum catalogue and where that has been deficient i have had recourse to other public libraries and to the libraries of private friends i am not conscious that i have left any variant unrecorded but i should not like to assert that this is the case tennyson was so restlessly indefatigable in his corrections that there may lurk in editions of the poems which i have not seen other variants and it is also possible that in spite of my vigilance some may have escaped me even in the editions which have been collated and some may have been made at a date earlier than the date recorded but i trust this has not been the case  of the bibliography i can say no more than that i have done my utmost to make it complete and that it is very much fuller than any which has hitherto appeared that it is exhaustive i dare not promise  with regard to the notes and commentaries i have spared no pains to explain everything which seemed to need explanation there are i think only two points which i have not been able to clear up namely the name of the friend to whom the palace of art was addressed and the name of the friend to whom the verses after reading a life and letters were addressed i have consulted every one who would be likely to throw light on the subject including the poets surviving sister many of his friends and the present lord tennyson but without success so the names if they were not those of some imaginary person appear to be irrecoverable the prize poem timbuctoo as well as the poems which were temporarily or finally suppressed in the volumes published in 1830 and 1832 have been printed in the appendix those which were subsequently incorporated in his works in large type those which he never reprinted in small  the text here adopted is that of 1857 but messrs macmillan to whom i beg to express my hearty thanks have most generously allowed me to record all the variants which are still protected by copyright i have to thank them too for assistance in the bibliography i have also to thank mr j t wise for his kindness in lending me the privately printed volume containing the morte darthur dora etc      introduction  i  the development of tennysons genius methods aims and capacity of achievement in poetry can be studied with singular precision and fulness in the history of the poems included in the present volume in 1842 he published the two volumes which gave him by almost general consent the first place among the poets of his time for though wordsworth was alive wordsworths best work had long been done these two volumes contained poems which had appeared before some in 1830 and some in 1832 and some which were then given to the world for the first time so that they represent work belonging to three eras in the poets life poems written before he had completed his twentysecond year and belonging for the most part to his boyhood poems written in his early manhood and poems written between his thirtyfirst and thirtyfourth year  the poems published in 1830 had the following titlepage    poems chiefly lyrical by alfred tennyson   london

selections made from the two former volumes several new poems  poems by alfred tennyson in two volumes london edward moxon mdcccxlii  the first volume is divided into two parts  1 selections from the poems published in 1830 claribel to the sonnet to j m k inclusive  2 selections from the poems of 1832 the lady of shalott to the goose inclusive  the second volume contains poems then with two exceptions first published   introduction    the epic   morte darthur   the gardeners daughter   dora   audley court   walking to the mail   st simeon stylites   conclusion to the may queen   the talking oak   lady clara vere de vere   love and duty   ulysses   locksley hall   godiva   the two voices   the day dream   prologue   the sleeping palace   the sleeping beauty   the arrival   the revival   the departure   moral   lenvoi   epilogue   amphion   st agnes   sir galahad   edward gray   will waterproofs lyrical monologue made at the cock   lady clare   the lord of burleigh   sir launcelot and queen guinevere   a farewell   the beggar maid   the vision of sin   the skipping rope   move eastward happy earth   break break break   the poets song   only two of these poems had been published before namely st agnes which was printed in the keepsake for 1837 and the sleeping beauty in the day dream which was adopted with some alterations from the 1830 poem and only one of these poems was afterwards suppressed the skipping rope which was however allowed to stand till 1851 in 1843 appeared the second edition of these poems which is merely a reprint with a few unimportant alterations and which was followed in 1845 and in 1846 by a third and fourth edition equally unimportant in their variants but in the fourth the golden year was added in the next edition the fifth 1848 the deserted house was included from the poems of 1830 in the sixth edition 1850 was included another poem to after reading a life and letters reprinted with some alterations from the examiner of 24th march 1849  the seventh edition 1851 contained important additions first the dedication to the queen then edwin morris the fragment of the eagle and the stanzas come not when i am dead first printed in the keepsake for 1851 under the title of stanzas in this edition the absurd trifle the skipping rope was excised and finally cancelled in the eighth edition 1853 the seafairies though greatly altered was included from the poems of 1830 and the poem to e l on his travels in greece was added this edition the eighth may be regarded as the final one nothing afterwards of much importance was added or subtracted and comparatively few alterations were made in the text from that date to the last collected edition in 1898  all the editions up to and including that of 1898 have been carefully collated so that the student of tennyson can follow step by step the process by which he arrived at that perfection of expression which is perhaps his most striking characteristic as a poet and it was indeed a trophy of labour of the application of patient touches of unwearied art whoever will turn say to the palace of art to none to the dream of fair women or even to the seafairies and to the lady of shalott will see what labour was expended on their composition nothing indeed can be more interesting than to note the touches the substitution of which measured the whole distance between mediocrity and excellence take for example the magical alteration in the couplet in the dream of fair women     one drew a sharp knife thro my tender throat   slowlyand nothing more   into     the bright death quiverd at the victims throat   touchd and i knew no more   or in the same poem     what nights we had in egypt   i could hit his humours while i crossd him   o the life i led him and the dalliance and the wit   into    we drank the libyan sun to sleep and lit   lamps which outburnd canopus   o my life in egypt   o the dalliance and the wit   the flattery and the strife   or in mariana in the south    she movd her lips she prayd alone   she praying disarrayd and warm   from slumber deep her wavy form   in the dark lustrous mirror shone  into    complaining mother give me grace   to help me of my weary load   and on the liquid mirror glowd   the clear perfection of her face   how happy is this slight alteration in the verses to j s which corrects one of the falsest notes ever struck by a poet   a tear dropt on my tablets as i wrote    a tear dropt on the letters as i wrote  or where in locksley hall a splendidly graphic touch of description is gained by the alteration of droops the trailer from the crag into swings the trailer  so again in love and duty    should my shadow cross thy thoughts   too sadly for their peace so put it back   for calmer hours in memorys darkest hold  where by altering so put it back into remand it thou a somewhat ludicrous image is at all events softened  what great care tennyson took with his phraseology is curiously illustrated in the may queen in the 1842 edition robin was the name of the may queens lover in 1843 it was altered to robert and in 1845 and subsequent editions back to robin  compare again the old stanza in the millers daughter    how dear to me in youth my love   was everything about the mill   the black and silent pool above   the pool beneath it never still   with what was afterwards substituted     i loved the brimming wave that swam   through quiet meadows round the mill   the sleepy pool above the dam   the pool beneath it never still   another most felicitous emendation is to be found in the poet where the edition of 1830 reads     and in the bordure of her robe was writ   wisdom a name to shake   hoar anarchies as with a thunderfit   this in 1842 appears as     and in her raiments hem was tracd in flame   wisdom a name to shake   all evil dreams of powera sacred name   again in the lotos eaters     three thundercloven thrones of oldest snow   stood sunsetflushed   is changed into    three silent pinnacles of aged snow   so in will waterproof the cumbrous     like hezekiahs backward runs the shadow of my days   was afterwards simplified into     against its fountain upward runs   the current of my days   not less felicitous have been the additions made from time to time thus in audley court the concluding lines ran     the harbour buoy   with one green sparkle ever and anon   dipt by itself   but what vividness is there in the subsequent insertion of     sole star of phosphorescence in the calm   between the first line and the second  so again in the morte darthur how greatly are imagery and rhythm improved by the insertion of     across the ridge and paced beside the mere   between     then went sir bedivere the second time   and     counting the dewy pebbles fixd in thought   there is an alteration in none which is very interesting till 1884 this was allowed to stand     the lizard with his shadow on the stone   rests like a shadow and the cicala sleeps   no one could have known better than tennyson that the cicala is loudest in the torrid calm of the noonday as theocritus virgil byron and innumerable other poets have noticed at last he altered it but at the heavy price of a cumbrous pleonasm into and the winds are dead  he allowed many years to elapse before he corrected another error in natural historybut at last the alteration came in the poets song in the line     the swallow stopt as he hunted the bee   the fly which the swallow does hunt was substituted for what it does not hunt and that for very obvious reasons but whoever would see what tennysons poetry has owed to elaborate revision and scrupulous care would do well to compare the first edition of mariana in the south the seafairies oenone the lady of shalott the palace of art and a dream of fair women with the poems as they are presented in 1853 poets do not always improve their verses by revision as all students of wordsworths text could abundantly illustrate but it may be doubted whether in these poems at least tennyson ever made a single alteration which was not for the better fitzgerald indeed contended that in some cases particularly in the millers daughter tennyson would have done well to let the first reading stand but few critics would agree with him in the instances he gives we may perhaps regret the sacrifice of such a stanza as this  each coltsfoot down the grassy bent whose round leaves hold the gathered shower each quaintly folded cuckoo pint and silverpaly cuckoo flower     ii  tennysons genius was slow in maturing the poems contributed by him to the volume of 1827 poems by two brothers are not without some slight promise but are very far from indicating extraordinary powers a great advance is discernible in timbuctoo but that matthew arnold should have discovered in it the germ of tennysons future powers is probably to be attributed to the youth of the critic tennyson was in his twentysecond year when the poems chiefly lyrical appeared and what strikes us in these poems is certainly not what arthur hallam saw in them much rather what coleridge and wilson discerned in them they are the poems of a fragile and somewhat morbid young man in whose temper we seem to see a touch of hamlet a touch of romeo and more healthily a touch of mercutio their most promising characteristic is the versatility displayed thus we find mariana side by side with the supposed confessions the ode to memory with greekoi rheontes the ballad of oriana with the dying swan recollections of the arabian nights with the poet their worst fault is affectation perhaps the utmost that can be said for them is that they display a fine but somewhat thin vein of original genius after deducing what they owe to coleridge to keats and to other poets this is seen in the magical touches of description in the exquisite felicity of expression and rhythm which frequently mark them in the pathos and power of such a poem as oriana in the pathos and charm of such poems as mariana and a dirge in the rich and almost gorgeous fancy displayed in the recollections  the poems of 1833 are much more ambitious and strike deeper notes here comes in for the first time that greekspondaiotaes that high seriousness which is one of tennysons chief characteristicswe see it in the palace of art in none and in the verses to j s but in intrinsic merit the poems were no advance on their predecessors for the execution was not equal to the design the best such as none a dream of fair women the palace of art the lady of shalotti am speaking of course of these poems in their first formwere full of extraordinary blemishes the volume was degraded by pieces which were very unworthy of him such as o darling room and the verses to christopher north and affectations of the worst kind deformed many nay perhaps the majority of the poems but the capital defect lay in the workmanship the diction is often languid and slipshod sometimes quaintly affected and we can never go far without encountering lines stanzas whole poems which cry aloud for the file the power and charm of tennysons poetry even at its ripest depend very largely often mainly on expression and the couplet which he envied browning    the little more and how much it is   the little less and what worlds away  is strangely applicable to his own art on a single word on a subtle collocation on a slight touch depend often his finest effects the little less reduces him to mediocrity the little more and he is with the masters to no poetry would the application of goethes test be as a rule more fatalthat the real poetic quality in poetry is that which remains when it has been translated literally into prose  whoever will compare the poems of 1832 with the same poems as they appeared in 1842 will see that the difference is not so much a difference in degree but almost a difference in kind in the collection of 1832 there were three gems the sisters the lines to j s and the may queen almost all the others which are of any value were in the edition of 1842 carefully revised and in some cases practically rewritten if tennysons career had closed in 1833 he would hardly have won a prominent place among the minor poets of the present century the nine years which intervened between the publication of his second volume and the volumes of 1842 were the making of him and transformed a mere dilettante into a master much has been said about the brutality of lockharts review in the quarterly in some respects it was stupid in some respects it was unjust but of one thing there can be no doubtit had a most salutary effect it held up the mirror to weaknesses and deficiencies which if tennyson did not care to acknowledge to others he must certainly have acknowledged to himself it roused him and put him on his mettle it was a wholesome antidote to the enervating flattery of coteries and apostles who were certainly talking a great deal of nonsense about him as arthur hallams essay in the englishman shows during the next nine years he published nothing with the exception of two unimportant contributions to certain minor periodicals1 but he was educating himself saturating himself with all that is best in the poetry of ancient greece and rome of modern italy of germany and of his own country studying theology metaphysics natural history geology astronomy and travels observing nature with the eye of a poet a painter and a naturalist nor was he a recluse he threw himself heartily into the life of his time following with the keenest interest all the great political and social movements the progress and effects of the reform bill the troubles in ireland the troubles with the colonies the struggles between the protectionists and the free traders municipal reform the advance of the democracy chartism the popular education question he travelled on the continent he travelled in wales and scotland he visited most parts of england not as an idle tourist but as a student with notebook in hand and he had been submitted also to the discipline which is of all disciplines the most necessary to the poet and without which as goethe says he knows not the heavenly powers he had ate his bread in sorrow the death of his father in 1831 had already brought him face to face as he has himself expressed it with the most solemn of all mysteries in 1833 he had an awful shock in the sudden death of his friend arthur hallam an overwhelming sorrow which blotted out all joy from his life and made him long for death he had other minor troubles which contributed greatly to depress himthe breaking up of the old home at somersby his own poverty and uncertain prospects his being compelled in consequence to break off all intercourse with miss emily selwood it is possible that love and duty may have reference to this sorrow it is certain that the two voices is autobiographical  such was his education between 1832 and 1842 and such the influences which were moulding him while he was slowly evolving in memoriam and the poems first published in the latter year to the revision of the old poems he brought tastes and instincts cultivated by the critical study of all that was best in the poetry of the world and more particularly by a familiarity singularly intimate and affectionate with the masterpieces of the ancient classics he brought also the skill of a practised workman for his diligence in production was literally that of sir joshua reynolds in the sister artnulla dies sine lineâ into the composition of the new poems all this entered he was no longer a trifler and a hedonist as spedding has said his former poems betrayed an overindulgence in the luxuries of the senses a profusion of splendours harmonies perfumes gorgeous apparel luscious meals and drinks and creature comforts which rather pall upon the sense and make the glories of the outward world to obscure a little the world within like his own lady of shalott he had communed too much with shadows but the serious poet now speaks he appeals less to the ear and the eye and more to the heart the sensuous is subordinated to the spiritual and the moral he deals immediately with the dearest concerns of man and of society he has ceased to trifle the the greek spondaiotaes the high seriousness of the true poet occasional before now pervades and enters essentially into his work it is interesting to note how many of these poems have direct didactic purpose how solemn is the message delivered in such poems as the palace of art and the vision of sin how noble the teaching in love and duty in oenone in godiva in ulysses to how many must such a poem as the two voices have brought solace and light how full of salutary lessons are the political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and love thou thy land and how noble is their expression and even where the poems are less directly didactic it is such refreshment as busy life needs to converse with them so pure so wholesome so graciously human is their tone so tranquilly beautiful is their world who could lay down the millers daughter dora the golden year the gardeners daughter the talking oak audley court the day dream without something of the feeling which goethe felt when he first laid down the vicar of wakefield in the best lyrics in these volumes such as break break and move eastward happy earth the most fastidious of critics must recognise flawless gems in the two volumes of 1842 tennyson carried to perfection all that was best in his earlier poems and displayed powers of which he may have given some indication in his cruder efforts but which must certainly have exceeded the expectation of the most sanguine of his rational admirers these volumes justly gave him the first place among the poets of his time and that supremacy he maintainedin the opinion of mosttill the day of his death it would be absurd to contend that tennysons subsequent publications added nothing to the fame which will be secured to him by these poems but this at least is certain that taken with in memorium they represent the crown and flower of his achievement what is best in them he never excelled and perhaps never equalled we should be the poorer and much the poorer for the loss of anything which he produced subsequently it is true but would we exchange half a dozen of the best of these poems or a score of the best sections of in memoriam for all that he produced between 1850 and his death  footnote 1 in the keepsake st agnes eve in the tribute stanzas oh that twere possible between 1831 and 1832 he had contributed to the gem three no more anacreontics and a fragment in the englishmans magazine a sonnet in the yorkshire literary annual lines there are three things that fill my heart with sighs in friendships offering lines me my own fate    iii  the poems of 1842 naturally divide themselves into seven groups  1 studies in fancy    claribel   lilian   isabel   madeline   a spirit haunts   recollections of the arabian nights   adeline   the dying swan   a dream of fair women

political group    you ask me   of old sat freedom   love thou thy land   the goose   in surveying these poems two things must strike every onetheir very wide range and their very fragmentary character there is scarcely any side of life on which they do not touch scarcely any phase of passion and emotion to which they do not give exquisite expression take the love poems compare fatima with isabel the millers daughter with locksley hall the gardeners daughter with madeline or mariana with cleopatra in the dream of fair women when did love find purer and nobler expression than in love and duty when has sorrow found utterance more perfect than in the verses to j s  or the passion for the past than in break break break or revenge and jealousy than in the sisters in the two voices the palace of art and the vision of sin we are in another sphere they are appeals to the soul of man on subjects of momentous concern to him and each is a masterpiece what is proper to philosophy and what is proper to poetry have never perhaps been so happily blended they have all the sensuous charm of keats but the prose of hume could not have presented the truths which they are designed to convey with more lucidity and precision in that superb fragment the morte darthur we have many of the noblest attributes of epic poetry none is the perfection of the classical idyll the gardeners daughter and the idylls that follow it of the romantic sir galahad and st agnes are in the vein of keats and coleridge but keats and coleridge have produced nothing more exquisite and nothing so ethereal the lotos eaters is perhaps the most purely delicious poem ever written the ne plus ultra of sensuous loveliness and yet the poet who gave us that has given us also the political poems poems as trenchant and austerely dignified in style as they are pregnant with practical wisdom there is the same versatility displayed in the trifles  but all is fragmentary no thread strings these jewels they form a collection of gems unset and unarranged without any system or any definite scope they have nothing of that unity in diversity which is so perceptible in the lyrics and minor poems of goethe and wordsworth capricious as the gyrations of a seagull seem the poets moods and movements we have now the reveries of a lovesick maiden now the picture of a soul wrestling with despair and death here a study from rural life or a study in character there a sermon on politics or a descent into the depths of psychological truth or a sketch from nature but nothing could be more concentrated than the power employed to shape each fragment into form what pope says of the aeneid may be applied with very literal truth to these poems     finishd the whole and laboured every part   with patient touches of unwearied art   in the poems of 1842 we have the secret of tennysons eminence as a poet as well as the secret of his limitations he appears to have been constitutionally deficient in what the greeks called architektoniké combination and disposition on a large scale the measure of his power as a constructive artist is given us in the poem in which the english idylls may be said to culminate namely enoch arden in memoriam and the idylls of the king have a sort of spiritual unity but they are a series of fragments tacked rather than fused together it is the same with maud and it is the same with the princess his poems have always a tendency to resolve themselves into a series of cameos it is only the short poems which have organic unity a gift of felicitous and musical expression which is absolutely marvellous an instinctive sympathy with what is best and most elevated in the sphere of ordinary life of ordinary thought and sentiment of ordinary activity with consummate representative power a most rare faculty of seizing and fixing in very perfect form what is commonly so inexpressible because so impalpable and evanescent in emotion and expression a power of catching and rendering the charm of nature with a fidelity and vividness which resemble magic and lastly unrivalled skill in choosing repolishing and remounting the gems which are our common inheritance from the past these are the gifts which will secure permanence for his work as long as the english language lasts  in his power of crystallising commonplaces he stands next to pope in subtle felicity of expression beside virgil and when he says of virgil that we find in his diction all the grace of all the muses often flowering in one lonely word he says what is literally true of his own work as a master of style his place is in the first rank among english classical poets but his style is the perfection of art his diction like the diction of milton and gray resembles mosaic work with a touch here and a touch there now from memory now from unconscious assimilation inlaying here an epithet and there a phrase adding subtracting heightening modifying substituting one metaphor for another developing what is latent in the suggestive imagery of a predecessor laying under contribution the most intimate familiarity with what is best in the literature of the ancient and modern world the unwearied artist toils patiently on till his precious mosaic work is without a flaw all the resources of rhetoric are employed to give distinction to his style and every figure in rhetoric finds expression in his diction hypallage as in     the pillard dusk of sounding sycamores  audley court   paronomasia as in     the seawind sang shrill chill with flakes of foam  morte darthur   oxymoron as    behold them unbeheld unheard hear all  none   hyperbaton as in    the dewimpearled winds of dawn  ode to memory   metonymy as in    the bright death quiverd at the victims throat  dream of fair women   or in    for some three careless moans the summer pilot of an empty heart  gardeners daughter   no poet since milton has employed what is known as onomatopoeia with so much effect not to go farther than the poems of 1842 we have in the morte darthur    so all day long the noise of battle rolled   among the mountains by the winter sea  or    dry clashed his harness in the icy caves   and barren chasms and all to left and right   the bare black cliff clangd round him as he basd   his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang   sharpsmitten with the dint of armed heels  or the exquisite    i heard the water lapping on the crag   and the long ripple washing in the reeds  so in the dying swan    and the wavy swell of the soughing reeds  see too the whole of oriana and the description of the dance at the beginning of the vision of sin  assonance alliteration the revival or adoption of obsolete and provincial words the transplantation of phrases and idioms from the greek and latin languages the employment of common words in uncommon senses all are pressed into the service of adding distinction to his diction his diction blends the two extremes of simplicity and artificiality but with such fine tact that this strange combination has seldom the effect of incongruity longinus has remarked that as the fainter lustre of the stars is put out of sight by the allencompassing rays of the sun so when sublimity sheds its light round the sophistries of rhetoric they become invisible1 what longinus says of sublimity is equally true of sincerity and truthfulness in combination with exquisitely harmonious expression we have an illustration in grays elegy nothing could be more artificial than the style but what poem in the world appeals more directly to the heart and to the eye it is one thing to call art to the assistance of art it is quite another thing to call art to the assistance of nature and this is what both gray and tennyson do and this is why their artificiality so far from shocking us passes in music out of sight but this cannot be said of tennyson without reserve at times his strained endeavours to give distinction to his style by putting common things in an uncommon way led him into intolerable affectation thus we have the knightly growth that fringed his lips for a moustache azure pillars of the hearth for ascending smoke ambrosial orbs for apples frayed magnificence for a shabby dress the secular abyss to come for future ages the sinless years that breathed beneath the syrian blue for the life of christ up went the hushd amaze of hand and eye for a gesture of surprise and the like one of the worst instances is in in memoriam where what is appropriate to the simple sentiment finds as it should do corresponding simplicity of expression in the first couplet to collapse into the falsetto of strained artificiality in the second     to rest beneath the clover sod   that takes the sunshine and the rains   or where the kneeling hamlet drains   the chalice of the grapes of god   an illustration of the same thing almost as offensive is in enoch arden where in an otherwise studiously simple diction enochs wares as a fisherman become    enochs ocean spoil   in oceansmelling osier   but these peculiarities are less common in the earlier poems than in the later it was a vicious habit which grew on him  but if exception may sometimes be taken to his diction no exception can be taken to his rhythm no english poet since milton tennysons only superior in this respect had a finer ear or a more consummate mastery over all the resources of rhythmical expression what colours are to a painter rhythm is in description to the poet and few have rivalled none have excelled tennyson in this take the following     and ghastly thro the drizzling rain   on the bald street strikes the blank day  in memoriam  see particularly in memoriam cvii the lines beginning fiercely flies to darken on the rolling brine the description of the island in enoch arden but specification is needless it applies to all his descriptive poetry it is marvellous that he can produce such effects by such simple means a mere enumeration of particulars will often do it as here     no gray old grange or lonely fold   or low morass and whispering reed   or simple style from mead to mead   or sheep walk up the windy wold  in memoriam c  or here     the meal sacks on the whitened floor   the dark round of the dripping wheel   the very air about the door made misty with the floating meal  the millers daughter   his blank verse is best described by negatives it has not the endless variety the elasticity and freedom of shakespeares it has not the massiveness and majesty of miltons it has not the austere grandeur of wordsworths at its best it has not the wavy swell the linked sweetness long drawn out of shelleys but its distinguishing feature is if we may use the expression its importunate beauty what coleridge said of claudians style may be applied to it every line nay every word stops looks full in your face and asks and begs for praise his earlier blank verse is less elaborate and seemingly more spontaneous and easy than his later 2 but it is in his lyric verse that his rhythm is seen in its greatest perfection no english lyrics have more magic or more haunting beauty more of that which charms at once and charms for ever  in his description of nature he is incomparable take the following from the dying swan     some blue peaks in the distance rose   and white against the coldwhite sky   shone out their crowning snows   one willow over the

morningstar  a dream of fair women   but if in the world of nature nothing escaped his sensitive and sympathetic observationand indeed it might be said of him as truly as of shelleys alastor     every sight   and sound from the vast earth and ambient air   sent to his heart its choicest impulses   he had studied the world of books with not less sympathy and attention in the sense of a profound and extensive acquaintance with all that is best in ancient and modern poetry and in an extraordinarily wide knowledge of general literature of philosophy and theology of geography and travel and of various branches of natural science he is one of the most erudite of english poets with the poetry of the greek and latin classics he was like milton and gray thoroughly saturated its influence penetrates his work now in indirect reminiscence now in direct imitation now inspiring now modifying now moulding he tells us in the daisy how when at como the rich virgilian rustic measure of lari maxume haunted him all day and in a later fragment how as he rowed from desenzano to sirmio catullus was with him and they and their brethren from homer to theocritus from lucretius to claudian always were with him i have illustrated so fully in the notes and elsewhere 1 the influence of the greek and roman classics on the poems of 1842 that it is not necessary to go into detail here but a few examples of the various ways in which they affected tennysons work generally may be given sometimes he transfers a happy epithet or expression in literal translation as in     on either shining shoulder laid a hand   which is homers epithet for the shoulder     greek ana phaidimps omps  od xi 128      it was the red cock shouting to the light   exactly the     greek heos eboaesen alektor until the cock shouted  batrachomyomachia 192      and all in passion utterd a dry shriek   which is the sicca vox of the roman poets so in the lotos eaters     his voice was thin as voices from the grave   which is theocritus voice of hylas from his watery grave     greek araia d iketo phona    thin came the voice   so in the princess sect i     and cookd his spleen   which is a phrase from the greek as in homer il iv 513    greek epi naeusi cholon thumalgea pessei    at the ships he cooks his heartgrieving spleen   again in the princess sect iv    laughd with alien lips   which is homers od 6970    greek did aedae gnathmoisi gelpson allotrioisi   so in edwin morris    all perfect finished to the finger nail  which is a phrase transferred from latin through the greek cf horace sat i v 32    ad unguem factus homo    a man fashioned to the finger nail   the brute earth in memoriam cxxvii which is horaces    bruta tellus  odes i xxxiv 9   so again    a bevy of roses applecheekd   in the island which is theocritus greek maloparaeos the line in the morte darthur    this way and that dividing the swift mind   is an almost literal translation of virgils aen iv 285    atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc   and this way and that he divides his swift mind   another way in which they affect him is where without direct imitation they colour passages and poems as in oenone the lotos eaters tithonus tiresias the death of oenone demeter and persephone the passage beginning from the woods in the gardeners daughter which is a parody of theocritus id vii 139 seq while the cyclops invocation to galatea in theocritus id xi 2979 was plainly the model for the idyll come down o maid in the seventh section of the princess just as the tournament in the same poem recalls closely the epic of homer and virgil tennyson had a wonderful way of transfusing as it were the essence of some beautiful passage in a greek or roman poet into english a striking illustration of this would be the influence of reminiscences of virgils fourth aeneid on the idyll of elaine and guinevere compare for instance the following he is describing the lovewasted elaine as she sits brooding in the lonely evening with the shadow of the wishedfor death falling on her    but when they left her to herself again   death like a friends voice from a distant field   approaching through the darkness calld the owls   wailing had power upon her and she mixd   her fancies with the sallowrifted glooms   of evening and the moanings of the wind   how exactly does this recall in a manner to be felt rather than exactly defined a passage equally exquisite and equally pathetic in virgils picture of dido where with the shadow of her death also falling upon her she seems to hear the phantom voice of her dead husband and mixes her fancies with the glooms of night and the owls funereal wail    hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis   visa viri nox quum terras obscura teneret   solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo   sæpe queri et longas in fletum ducere voces  aen iv 460    from it she thought she clearly heard a voice even the accents of   her husband calling her when night was wrapping the earth with   darkness and on the roof the lonely owl in funereal strains kept oft   complaining drawing out into a wail its protracted notes  similar passages though not so striking would be the picture of pindars elysium in tiresias the sentiment pervading the lotos eaters transferred so faithfully from the greek poets the scenery in none so crowded with details from homer theocritus and callimachus sometimes we find similes suggested by the classical poets but enriched by touches from original observation as here in the princess    as one that climbs a peak to gaze   oer land and main and sees a great black cloud   drag inward from the deeps a wall of night   blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore      and quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn expunge the world   which was plainly suggested by homer iv 275    greek hos d hot apo skopiaes eide nephos aipolos anaer   erchomenon kata ponton hupo zephuroio ioaes tps de t aneuthen eonti   melanteron aeute pissa phainet ion kata ponton agei de te lailapa   pollaen    as when a goatherd from some hillpeak sees a cloud coming across   the deep with the blast of the west wind behind it and to him being   as he is afar it seems blacker even as pitch as it goes along the   deep bringing with it a great whirlwind   so again the fine simile in elaine beginning    bare as a wild wave in the wide north sea   is at least modelled on the simile in iliad xv 3814 with reminiscences of the same similes in iliad xv 624 and iliad iv 4256 the simile in the first section of the princess    as when a field of corn   bows all its ears before the roaring east   reminds us of homers    greek hos d ote kinaesae zephyros bathulaeïon elthon labros   epaigixon epi t aemuei astachuessin    as when the west wind tosses a deep cornfield rushing down with   furious blast and it bows with all its ears   nothing could be more happy than such an adaptation as the following    ever faild to draw   the quiet night into her blood   from virgil aen iv 530    neque unquam solvitur in somnos oculisve aut pectore noctem   accipit    and she never relaxes into sleep or receives the night in eyes or   bosom   or than the following in enid from theocritus    arms on which the standing muscle sloped   as slopes a wild brook oer a little stone   running too vehemently to break upon it    greek en de mues stereoisi brachiosin akron hyp omon estasan   aeute petroi oloitrochoi ous te kylindon cheimarrhous potamos   megalais periexese dinais  idyll xxii 48 seq    and the muscles on his brawny arms close under the shoulder stood out   like boulders which the wintry torrent has rolled and worn smooth with   the mighty eddies  but there was another use to which tennyson applied his accurate and intimate acquaintance with the classics it lay in developing what was suggested by them in unfolding so to speak what was furled in their imagery nothing is more striking in ancient classical poetry than its pregnant condensation it often expresses in an epithet what might be expanded into a detailed picture or calls up in a single phrase a whole scene or a whole position where in merlin and vivian tennyson described    the blind wave feeling round his long sea hall   in silence   he was merely unfolding to its full homers greek kuma kophondumb wave just as the best of all comments on horaces expression vultus nimium lubricus aspici odes i xix 8 is given us in tennysons picture of the oread in lucretius     how the sun delights   to glance and shift about her slippery sides  or take again this passage in the agamemnon 4045 describing menelaus pining in his desolate palace for the lost helen    greek pothoi d uperpontias phasma doxei domon anassein    and in his yearning love for her who is over the sea a phantom will   seem to reign over his palace   what are the lines in guinevere but an expansion of what is latent but unfolded in the pregnant suggestiveness of the greek poet    and in thy bowers of camelot or of usk   thy shadow still would glide from room to room   and i should evermore be vexd with thee   in hanging robe or vacant ornament   or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair   with a reminiscence also perhaps of constances speech in king john iii iv  it need hardly be said that these particular passages and possibly some of the others may be mere coincidences but they illustrate what numberless other passages which could be cited prove that tennysons careful and meditative study of the greek and roman poets enabled him to enrich his work by these felicitous adaptations  he used those poets as his master virgil used his greek predecessors and what the elder seneca said of ovid who had appropriated a line from virgil might exactly be applied to tennyson fecisse quod in multis aliis versibus virgilius fecerat non surripiendi causâ sed palam imitandi hoc animo ut vellet agnosci4  he had plainly studied with equal attention the chief italian poets especially dante petrarch ariosto and tasso on a passage in dante he founded his ulysses and imitations of that master are frequent throughout his poems in memoriam both in its general scheme as well as in numberless particular passages closely recalls petrarch and ariosto and tasso have each influenced his work in the poetry of his own country nothing seems to have escaped him either in the masters or the minor poets5 to apply the term plagiarism to tennysons use of his predecessors would be as absurd as to resolve some noble fabric into its stones and bricks and confounding the one with the other to taunt the architect with appropriating an honour which belongs to the quarry and the potter tennysons method was exactly the method of two of the greatest poets in the world virgil and milton of the poet who stands second to virgil in roman poetry horace of one of the most illustrious of our own minor poets gray  an artist more fastidious than tennyson never existed as scrupulous a purist in language as cicero chesterfield and macaulay in prose as virgil milton and leopardi in verse his care extended to the nicest minutiae of wordforms thus ancle is always spelt with a c when it stands alone with a k when used in compounds thus he spelt idylls with one l in the short poems with two ls in the epic poems thus the employment of through or thro of bad or bade and the retention or suppression of e in past participles are always carefully studied he took immense pains to avoid the clash of s with s and to secure the predominance of open vowels when rhythm rendered them appropriate like the greek painter with his partridge he thought nothing of sacrificing good things if in any way they interfered with unity and symmetry and thus his son tells us many stanzas in themselves of exquisite beauty have been lost to us   footnote 1 de sublimitate xvii  footnote 2 tennysons blank verse in the idylls of the king excepting in the morte darthur and in the grander passages is obviously modelled in rhythm on that of shakespeares earlier style seen to perfection in king john compare the following lines with the rhythm say of elaine or guinevere    but now will canker sorrow eat my bud   and chase the native beauty from his cheek   and he will look as hollow as a ghost   as dim and meagre as an agues fit   and so hell die and rising so again   when i shall meet him in the court of heaven   i shall not know him therefore never never   must i behold my pretty arthur more  king john iii iv  footnote 3 illustrations of tennyson  footnote 4 seneca third suasoria  footnote 5 for fuller illustrations of all this and for the influence of the ancient classics on tennyson i may perhaps venture to refer the reader to my illustrations of tennyson and may i here take the opportunity of pointing out that nothing could have been farther from my intention in that book than what has so often been most unfairly attributed to it namely an attempt to show that a charge of plagiarism might be justly urged against tennyson no honest critic who had even cursorily inspected the book could so utterly misrepresent its purpose       iv   tennysons place is not among the lords of the visionary eye among seers among prophets but not the least part of the debt which his countrymen owe to him is his dedication of his art to the noblest purposes at a time when poetry was beginning to degenerate into what it has now almost universally becomea mere sensepampering siren and when critics were telling us as they are still telling us that we are to understand by it all literary production which attains the power of giving pleasure by its form as distinct from its matter he remained true to the creed of his great predecessors lart pour art he would say quoting georges sand est un vain mot lart pour le vrai lart pour le beau et le bon voila la religion que je cherche when he succeeded to the laureateship he was proud to remember that the wreath which had descended to him was    greener from the brows   of him that utterd nothing base  and he was a loyal disciple of that poet whose aim had been in his own words to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think to feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous 1 wordsworth had said that he wished to be regarded as a teacher or as nothing but unhappily he did not always distinguish between the way in which a poet and a philosopher should teach he forgot that the didactic element in a poem should be to employ a homely illustration what garlic should be in a salad scarce suspected animate the whole that the poet teaches not as the moralist and the preacher teach but as nature and life teach us he taught us when he wrote the fountain and the highland reaper the leachgatherer and michael he merely wearied us when he sermonised in the excursion and in the prelude tennyson never makes this mistake he is seldom directly didactic would he inculcate subjugation to the law of dutyhe gives us the funeral ode on wellington the charge of the light brigade and love and duty would he inculcate resignation to the will of god and the moral efficacy of conventional christianityhe gives us enoch arden would he picture the endless struggle between the sensual and the spiritual and the relation of ideals to lifehe gives us the idylls of the king would he point to what atheism may leadhe gives us lucretius poems which are masterpieces of sensuous art such as mere aesthetes like rosetti and his school must contemplate with admiring despair he makes vehicles of the most serious moral and spiritual teaching the vision of sin is worth a hundred sermons on the disastrous effects of unbridled profligacy in the palace of art we have the quintessence of the book of ecclesiastes and much more besides even in the lotos eaters we have the mirror held up to hedonism on the education of the affections and on the purity of domestic life must depend very largely not merely the happiness of individuals but the wellbeing of society and how wide a space is filled by poems in tennysons works bearing influentially on these subjects is obvious and they admit us into a pleasaunce with which it is good to be familiar so pure and wholesome is their atmosphere so tranquilly beautiful the world in which the characters move and the little dramas unfold themselves they preach nothing but deep into every heart must sink their silent lessons upon the sacredness of home life writes his son he would maintain that the stability and greatness of a nation largely depend and one of the secrets of his power over mankind was his true joy in the family duties and affections what sermons have we in the millers daughter in dora in the gardeners daughter and in love and duty the princess was a direct contribution to a social question of momentous importance to our time maud had an immediate political purpose while in in memoriam he became the interpreter and teacher of his generation in a still higher sense  since shakespeare no english poet has been so essentially patriotic or appealed so directly to the political conscience of the nation in his noble eulogies of the english constitution and of the virtue and wisdom of its architects in his spiritstirring pictures of the heroic actions of our forefathers and contemporaries both by land and sea in his passionate denunciations of all that he believed would detract from englands greatness and be prejudicial to her real interests in his hearty sympathy with every movement and with every measure which he believed would contribute to her honour and her power in all this he stands alone among modern poets but if he loved england as shakespeare loved her he had other lessons than shakespeares to teach her the responsibilities imposed on the england of our timeand no poet knew this betterare very different from those imposed on the england of elizabeth an empire vaster and more populous than that of the cæsars has since then been added to our dominion millions indeed who are of the same blood as ourselves and who speak our language have by the folly of common ancestors become aliens but how immense are the realms peopled by the colonies which are still loyal to us and by the three hundred millions who in india own us as their rulers of this vast empire england is now the capital and centre that she should fulfil completely and honourably the duties to which destiny has called her will be the prayer of every patriot that he should by his own efforts contribute all in his power to further such fulfilment must be his earnest desire it would be no exaggeration to say that tennyson contributed more than any man who has ever lived to what may be called the higher political education of the englishspeaking races of imperial federation he was at once the apostle and the pioneer in poetry which appealed as probably no other poetry has appealed to every class wherever our language is spoken he dwelt fondly on all that constitutes the greatness and glory of england on her grandeur in the past on the magnificent promise of the part she will play in the future if her sons are true to her there should be no distinction for she recognises no distinction between her children at home and her children in her colonies she is the common mother of a common race one flag one sceptre the same proud ancestry the same splendid inheritance how strange england cannot see he once wrote that her true policy lies in a close union with her colonies    sharers of our glorious past   shall we not thro good and ill   cleave to one another still   britains myriad voices call   sons be welded all and all   into one imperial whole   one with britain heart and soul   one life one flag one fleet one throne  thus did the poetry of tennyson draw closer and thus will it continue to draw closer those sentimental tiesties in burkes phrase light as air but strong as links of iron which bind the colonies to the mother country and in so doing if he did not actually initiate he furthered as no other single man has furthered the most important movement of our time nor has any man of genius in the present centurynot dickens not ruskinbeen moved by a purer spirit of philanthropy or done more to show how little the qualities and actions which dignify humanity depend or need depend on the accidents of fortune he brought poetry into touch with the discoveries of science and with the speculations of theology and metaphysics and though in treating such subjects his power is not perhaps equal to his charm the debt which his countrymen owe him even intellectually is incalculable   footnote 1 see

clear and sleek       the poet  first printed in 1830  in this poem we have the first grand note struck by tennyson the first poem exhibiting the greek spoudaiotaes of the true poet     the poet in a golden clime was born   with golden stars above   dowerd with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn1   the love of love    he saw thro 2 life and death thro 2 good and ill   he saw thro 2 his own soul   the marvel of the everlasting will   an open scroll    before him lay with echoing feet he threaded   the secretest walks of fame   the viewless arrows of his thoughts were headed   and wingd with flame    like indian reeds blown from his silver tongue   and of so fierce a flight   from calpe unto caucasus they sung   filling with light    and vagrant melodies the winds which bore   them earthward till they lit   then like the arrowseeds of the field flower   the fruitful wit    cleaving took root and springing forth anew   whereer they fell behold   like to the mother plant in semblance grew   a flower all gold    and bravely furnishd all abroad to fling   the winged shafts of truth   to throng with stately blooms the breathing spring   of hope and youth    so many minds did gird their orbs with beams   tho 3 one did fling the fire   heaven flowd upon the soul in many dreams   of high desire    thus truth was multiplied on truth the world   like one 4 great garden showd   and thro the wreaths of floating dark upcurld   rare sunrise flowd    and freedom reard in that august sunrise   her beautiful bold brow   when rites and forms before his burning eyes   melted

learn from fitzgeralds noteof the exact year he was not certain life of tennyson i 147 the evolution of the poem is an interesting study how greatly it was altered in the second edition of 1842 will be evident from the collation which follows the text of 1842 became the permanent text and in this no subsequent material alterations were made the poem is more purely fanciful than tennyson perhaps was willing to own certainly his explanation of the allegory as he gave it to canon ainger is not very intelligible the newborn love for something for some one in the wide world from which she has been so long excluded takes her out of the region of shadows into that of realities poes commentary is most to the point why do some persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel such phantasy

there is one which tells but very briefly the story of elaines love and death qui conta come la damigella di scalot mori per amore di lancealotto di lac and as in this novel camelot is placed near the

sun came dazzling thro the leaves   and flamed upon the brazen greaves   of bold sir lancelot   a redcross knight for ever kneeld   to a lady in his shield   that sparkled on the yellow field   beside remote shalott    the gemmy bridle glitterd free   like to some branch of stars we see   hung in the golden galaxy 10   the bridle bells rang merrily   as he rode down to 11 camelot   and from his blazond baldric slung   a mighty silver bugle hung   and as he rode his armour rung   beside remote shalott    all in the blue unclouded weather   thickjewelld shone the saddleleather   the helmet and the helmetfeather   burnd like one burning flame together   as he rode down to camelot 12   as often thro the purple night   below the starry clusters bright   some bearded meteor trailing light   moves over still shalott 13    his broad clear brow in sunlight glowd   on burnishd hooves his warhorse trode   from underneath his helmet flowd   his coalblack curls as on he rode   as he rode down to camelot 14   from the bank and from the river   he flashed into the crystal mirror   tirra lirra by the river 15   sang sir lancelot    she left the web she left the loom   she made three paces

over towerd camelot   down she came and found a boat   beneath a willow left afloat   and round about the prow she wrote   the lady of shalott 17    and down the rivers dim expanse   like some bold seër in a trance   seeing all his own mischance   with a glassy countenance   did she look to camelot   and at the closing of the day   she loosed the chain and down she lay   the broad stream bore her far away   the lady of shalott    lying robed in snowy white   that loosely flew to left and right   the leaves upon her falling light   thro the noises of the night   she floated down to camelot   and as the boathead wound along   the willowy hills and fields among   they heard her singing her last song   the lady of shalott 18    heard a carol mournful holy   chanted loudly chanted lowly   till her blood was frozen slowly   and her eyes were darkend wholly 19   turnd to towerd camelot   for ere she reachd upon the tide   the first house by the waterside   singing in her song she died

1831 see arthur hallams letter life i 2845 appendix and lord tennyson tells us that it came to my father as he was travelling between narbonne and perpignan how vividly the characteristic features of southern france are depicted must be obvious to every one who is familiar with them it is interesting to compare it with the companion poem the central position is the same in both desolate loneliness and the mood is the same but the setting is far more picturesque and is therefore more dwelt upon the poem was very greatly altered when republished in 1842 that text being practically the final one there being no important variants afterwards  in the edition of 1833 the poem opened with the following stanza which was afterwards excised and the stanza of the present text substituted     behind the barren hill upsprung   with pointed rocks against the light   the crag sharpshadowed overhung   each glaring creek and inlet bright   far far one light blue ridge was seen   looming like baseless

brow and bosom slowly down 1   thro rosy taper fingers drew   her streaming curls of deepest brown   to left and right 2 and made appear   stilllighted in a secret shrine   her melancholy eyes divine 3   the home of woe without a tear   and ave mary was her moan 4   madonna sad is night and morn   and ah she sang to be all alone   to live forgotten and love forlorn    till all the crimson changed

would sing nor lamb would bleat   nor any cloud would cross the vault   but day increased from heat to heat   on stony drought and steaming salt   till now at noon she slept again   and seemd kneedeep in mountain grass   and heard her native breezes pass   and runlets babbling down the glen   she breathed in sleep a lower moan   and murmuring as at night and morn   she thought my spirit is here alone   walks forgotten and is forlorn 7    dreaming she knew it was a dream   she felt he was and was not there 8   she woke the babble of the stream   fell and without the steady glare   shrank one sick willow 9 sere and small   the riverbed was dustywhite   and all the furnace of the light   struck up against the blinding wall 10   she whisperd with a stifled moan   more inward than at night or morn   sweet mother let me not here alone   live forgotten and die forlorn 11    12 and rising from her bosom drew   old letters breathing of her worth   for love they said must needs be true   to what is loveliest upon earth   an image seemd to pass the door   to look at her with slight and say   but now thy beauty flows away   so be alone for evermore   o cruel heart she changed her tone   and cruel love whose end is scorn   is this the end to be left alone   to live forgotten and die forlorn    but sometimes in the falling day   an image seemd to pass the door   to look into her eyes and say   but thou shalt be alone no more   and flaming downward over all   from heat to heat the day decreased   and slowly rounded to the east   the one black shadow from the wall   the day to night she made her moan   the day to night the night to morn   and day and night i am left alone   to live forgotten and love forlorn    at eve a dry cicala sung   there came a sound as of the sea   backward the latticeblind she flung   and leand upon the balcony   there all in spaces rosybright   large hesper glitterd on her tears   and deepening thro the silent spheres   heaven over heaven rose

footnote 14 it is curious that a poet so scrupulous as tennyson should have retained to the last the italics     the millers daughter   first published in 1833 it was greatly altered when republished in 1842 and in some respects so fitzgerald thought not for the better no alterations of much importance were made in it after 1842 the characters as well as the scenery were it seems purely imaginary tennyson said that if he thought of any mill it was that of trumpington near cambridge which bears a general resemblance to the picture here given  in the first edition the poem opened with the following stanza which the quarterly ridiculed and which was afterwards excised its omission is surely not to be regretted whatever fitzgerald may have thought    i met in all the close green ways   while walking with my line and rod   the wealthy millers mealy face   like the moon in an ivytod   he looked so jolly and so good   while fishing in the milldamwater   i laughed to see him as he stood   and dreamt not of the millers daughter                                           i see the wealthy miller yet   his double chin his portly size   and who that knew him could forget   the busy wrinkles round his eyes   the slow wise smile that round about   his dusty forehead drily curld   seemd halfwithin and halfwithout   and full of dealings with the world    in yonder chair i see him sit   three fingers round the old silver cup   i see his gray eyes twinkle yet   at his own jestgray eyes lit up   with summer lightnings of a soul   so full of summer warmth so glad   so healthy

across the walnuts and the wine4    to be the long and listless boy   lateleft an orphan of the squire   where this old mansion mounted high   looks down upon the village spire 5   for even here 6 where i and you   have lived and loved alone so long   each morn my sleep was broken thro   by some wild skylarks matin song    and oft i heard the tender dove   in firry woodlands making moan 7   but ere i saw your eyes my love   i had no motion of my own   for scarce my life with fancy playd   before i dreamd that pleasant dream   still hither thither idly swayd   like those long mosses 8 in the stream    or from the bridge i leand to hear   the milldam rushing down with noise   and see the minnows everywhere   in crystal eddies glance and poise   the tall flagflowers when 9 they sprung   below the range of steppingstones   or those three chestnuts near that hung   in masses thick with milky cones 10    but alice what an hour was that   when after roving in the woods   twas april then i came and sat   below the chestnuts when their buds   were glistening to the breezy blue   and on the slope an absent fool   i cast me down nor thought of you   but angled in the higher pool 11    a lovesong i had somewhere read   an echo from a measured strain   beat time to nothing in my head   from some odd corner of the brain   it haunted me the morning long   with weary sameness in the rhymes   the phantom of a silent song   that went and came a thousand times    then leapt a trout in lazy mood   i watchd the little circles die   they past into the level flood   and there a vision caught my eye   the reflex of a beauteous form   a glowing arm a gleaming neck   as when a sunbeam wavers warm   within the dark and dimpled beck 12    for you remember you had set   that morning on the casements edge 13   a long green box of mignonette   and you were leaning from the ledge   and when i raised my eyes above   they met with two so full and bright   such eyes i swear to you my love   that these have never lost their light 14    i loved and love dispelld the fear   that i should die an early death   for love possessd the atmosphere   and filled the breast with purer breath   my mother thought what ails the boy   for i was alterd and began   to move about the house with joy   and with the certain step of man    i loved the brimming wave that swam   thro quiet meadows round the mill   the sleepy pool above the dam   the pool beneath it never still   the mealsacks on the whitend floor   the dark round of the dripping wheel   the very air about the door   made misty with the floating meal    and oft in ramblings on the wold   when april nights begin to blow   and aprils crescent glimmerd cold   i saw the village lights below   i knew your taper far away   and full at heart of trembling hope   from off the wold i came and lay   upon the freshlyflowerd slope 15    the deep brook groand beneath the mill   and by that lamp i thought she sits   the white chalkquarry 16 from the hill   gleamd to the flying moon by fits   o that i were beside her now   o will she answer if i call   o would she give me vow for vow   sweet alice if i told her all 17    sometimes i saw you sit and spin   and in the pauses of the wind   sometimes i heard you sing within   sometimes your shadow crossd the blind   at last you rose and moved the light   and the long shadow of the chair   flitted across into the night   and all the casement darkend there    but when at last i dared to speak   the lanes you know were white with may   your ripe lips moved not but your cheek   flushd like the coming of the day 18   and so it washalfsly halfshy 19   you would and would not little one   although i pleaded tenderly   and you and i were all alone    and slowly was my mother brought   to yield consent to my desire   she wishd me happy but she thought   i might have lookd a little higher   and i was youngtoo young to wed   yet must i love her for your sake   go fetch your alice here she said   her eyelid quiverd as she spake    and down i went to fetch my bride   but alice you were ill at ease   this dress and that by turns you tried   too fearful that you should not please   i loved you better for your fears   i knew you could not look but well   and dews that would have falln in tears   i kissd away before they fell 20    i watchd the little flutterings   the doubt my mother would not see   she spoke at large of many things   and at the last she spoke of me   and turning lookd upon your face   as near this door you sat apart   and rose and with a silent grace   approaching pressd you heart to heart 21    ah wellbut sing the foolish song   i gave you alice on the day 22   when arm in arm we went along   a pensive pair and you were gay   with bridal flowersthat i may seem   as in the nights of old to lie   beside the millwheel in the stream   while those full chestnuts whisper by 23    it is the millers daughter   and she is grown so dear so dear   that i would be the jewel   that trembles at 24 her ear   for hid in ringlets day and night   id touch her neck so warm and white    and i would be the girdle   about her dainty dainty waist   and her heart would beat against me   in sorrow and in rest   and i should know if it beat right   id clasp it round so close and tight 25    and i would be the necklace   and all day long to fall and rise 26   upon her balmy bosom   with her laughter or her sighs   and i would lie so light so light 27   i scarce should be 28 unclaspd at night    a trifle sweet which true love spells   true love interpretsright alone   his light upon the letter dwells   for all the spirit is his own 29   so if i waste words now in truth   you must blame love his early rage   had force to make me rhyme in youth   and makes me talk too much in age 30    and now those vivid hours are gone   like mine own life to me thou art   where past and present wound in one   do make a garland for the heart   so sing 31 that other song i made   half angerd with my happy lot   the day when in the chestnut shade   i found the blue forgetmenot 32    love that hath us in the net 33   can he pass and we forget   many suns arise and set   many a chance the years beget   love the gift is love the debt   even so   love is hurt with jar and fret   love is made a vague regret   eyes with idle tears are wet   idle habit

with thine   untouchd with any shade of years   may those kind eyes for ever dwell   they have not shed a many tears   dear eyes since first i knew them well    yet tears they shed they had their part   of sorrow for when time was ripe   the still affection of the heart   became an outward breathing type   that into stillness past again   and left a want unknown before   although the loss that brought us pain   that loss but made us love the more    with farther lookings on the kiss   the woven arms seem but to be   weak symbols of the settled bliss   the comfort i have found in thee   but that god bless thee dearwho wrought   two spirits to one equal mind   with blessings beyond hope or thought   with blessings which no words can find    arise and let us wander forth   to yon old mill across the wolds   for look the sunset south and north 35   winds all the vale in rosy folds   and fires your narrow casement glass   touching the sullen pool below   on the chalkhill the bearded

fathers mansion mounted high   looked down upon the village spire   i was a long and listless boy   and son and heir unto the squire   footnote 6 1833 in these dear walls  footnote 7  1833    i often heard the cooing dove   in firry woodlands mourn alone   footnote 8  1833  the long mosses  footnote 9 18421851  where  footnote 10  this stanza was added in 1842 taking the place of the following which was excised    sometimes i whistled in the wind   sometimes i angled thought and deed   torpid as swallows left behind   that winter neath the floating weed   at will to wander every way   from brook to brook my sole delight   as lithe eels over meadows gray   oft shift their glimmering pool by night  in 1833 this stanza ran thus    i loved from off the bridge to hear   the rushing sound the water made   and see the fish that everywhere   in the backcurrent glanced and played   low down the tall flagflower that sprung   beside the noisy steppingstones   and the massed chestnut boughs that hung   thickstudded over with white cones   footnote 11 in 1833 the following took the place of the above stanza which was added in 1842    how dear to me in youth my love   was everything about the mill   the black and silent pool above   the pool beneath that neer stood still   the meal sacks on the whitened floor   the dark round of the dripping wheel   the very air about the door   made misty with the floating meal  thus in 1833    remember you that pleasant day   when after roving in the woods   twas april then i came and lay   beneath those gummy chestnut bud   that glistened in the april blue   upon the slope so smooth and cool   i lay and never thought of you   but angled in the deep mill pool   footnote 12 thus in 1833    a waterrat from off the bank   plunged in the stream with idle care   downlooking thro the sedges rank   i saw your troubled image there   upon the dark and dimpled beck   it wandered like a floating light   a full fair form a warm white neck   and two white armshow rosy white   footnote 13 1872 casementedge  footnote 14 thus in 1833    if you remember you had set   upon the narrow casementedge   a long green box of mignonette   and you were leaning from the ledge   i raised my eyes at once above   they met two eyes so blue and bright   such eyes i swear to you my love   that they have never lost their light  after this stanza the following was inserted in 1833 but excised in 1842    that slope beneath the chestnut tall   is wooed with choicest breaths of air   methinks that i could tell you all   the cowslips and the kingcups there   each coltsfoot down the grassy bent   whose round leaves hold the gathered shower   each quaintlyfolded cuckoo pint   and silverpaly cuckoo flower   footnote 15 thus in 1833    in rambling on the eastern wold   when thro the showery april nights   their hueless crescent glimmered cold   from all the other village lights   i knew your taper far away   my heart was full of trembling hope   down from the wold i came and lay   upon the dewyswarded slope   footnote 16 mr cuming walters in his interesting volume in tennyson land p 75 notices that the white chalk quarry at thetford can be seen from stockworth mill which seems to show that if tennyson did take the mill from trumpington he must also have had his mind on thetford mill tennyson seems to have taken delight in baffling those who wished to localise his scenes he went out of his way to say that the topographical studies of messrs church and napier were the only ones which could he relied upon but mr cuming walters book is far more satisfactory than their thin studies  footnote 17 thus in 1833    the white chalk quarry from the hill   upon the broken ripple gleamed   i murmured lowly sitting still   while round my feet the eddy streamed   oh that i were the wreath she wreathes   the mirror where her sight she feeds   the song she sings the air she breathes   the letters of the books she reads   footnote 18 1833    i

remember you the clear moonlight   that whitened all the eastern ridge   when oer the water dancing white   i stepped upon the old millbridge   i heard you whisper from above   a lutetoned whisper i am here   i murmured speak again my love   the stream is loud i cannot hear     i heard as i have seemed to hear   when all the underair was still   the low voice of the glad new year   call to the freshlyflowered hill   i heard as i have often heard   the nightingale in leavy woods   call to its mate when nothing stirred   to left or right but falling floods   footnote 22 1842 i gave you on the joyful day  footnote 23 in 1833 the following stanza took the place of the one here substituted in 1842    come alice sing to me the song   i made you on our marriage day   when arm in arm we went along   halftearfully and you were gay   with brooch and ring for i shall seem   the while you sing that song to hear   the millwheel turning in the stream   and the green chestnut whisper near  in 1833 the song began thus the present stanza taking its place in 1842    i wish i were her earring   ambushed in auburn ringlets sleek   so might my shadow tremble   over her downy cheek   hid in her hair all day and night   touching her neck so warm and white   footnote 24 1872 in  footnote 25 1833    i wish i were the girdle   buckled about her dainty waist   that her heart might beat against me   in sorrow and in rest   i should know well if it beat right   id clasp it round so close and tight  this stanza bears so close a resemblance to a stanza in joshua sylvesters woodmans bear see sylvesters works ed 1641 p 616 that a correspondent asked tennyson whether sylvester had suggested it tennyson replied that he had never seen sylvesters lines life of tennyson iii 51 the lines are

pulses thrilling thro his frame   do inly tremble starry bright   footnote 30 thus in 1833    how i waste languageyet in truth   you must blame love whose early rage   made me a rhymster in my youth   and overgarrulous in age   footnote 31 1833 sing me  footnote 32 1833    when in the breezy limewoodshade   i found the blue forgetmenot   footnote 33 in 1833 the following song took the place of the

evidently inspired by sapphos great ode cf also fragment i of ibycus in the intensity of the passion it stands alone among tennysons poems     o love love love o withering might   o sun that from 1

 sweet gales as from deep gardens blow   before him striking on my brow   in my dry brain my spirit soon   downdeepening from swoon to swoon   faints like a dazzled morning moon    the wind sounds like a silver wire   and from beyond the noon a fire   is pourd upon the hills and nigher   the skies stoop down in their desire   and isled in sudden seas of light   my heart pierced thro with fierce delight   bursts into blossom in his sight    my whole soul waiting silently   all naked in a sultry sky   droops blinded with his shining eye   i will possess him or will die   i will grow round him

upward by the kisses     none  first published in 1833 on being republished in 1842 this poem was practically rewritten the alterations and additions so transforming the poem as to make it almost a new work i have therefore printed a complete transcript of the edition of 1833 which the reader can compare the final text is with the exception of one alteration which will be noticed precisely that of 1842 so there is no trouble with variants none is the first of tennysons fine classical studies the poem is modelled partly on the alexandrian idyll such an idyll for instance as the second idyll of theocritus or the megara or europa of moschus and partly perhaps on the narratives in the metamorphoses of ovid to which the opening bears a typical resemblance it is possible that the poem may have been suggested by beatties judgment of paris which tells the same story and tells it on the same lines on which it is told here though it is not placed in the mouth of none beatties poem opens with an elaborate description of ida and of troy in the distance paris the husband of none is one afternoon confronted with the three goddesses who are as in tennysons idyll elaborately delineated as symbolising what they here symbolise each makes her speech and each offers what she has to offer worldly dominion wisdom sensual pleasure there is of course no comparison in point of merit between the two poems beatties being in truth perfectly commonplace in its symbolic aspect the poem may be compared with the temptations to which christ is submitted in paradise regained see books iii and iv

fine sentiment is of course a commonplace among ancient philosophers but it may be interesting to put beside it a passage from cicero de finibus ii 14 45    honestum id intelligimus quod tale est ut

alteration of an for and in the third line of each stanza and through and through for thro and thro in line 29 and wrapt for wrapped in line 34 it is curious that in 1842 the original bad was altered to bade but all subsequent editions keep to the original it has been said that this poem was founded on the old scotch ballad the twa sisters see for that ballad sharpes ballad book no x p 30 but there is no resemblance at all between the ballad and this poem beyond the fact that in each there are two sisters who are both loved by a certain squire the elder in jealousy pushing the younger into

sir franklin lushington tells me that he thinks it was an imaginary person the dedication explains the allegory intended the poem appears to have been suggested as we learn from tennysons life vol i p 150 by a remark of trench to tennyson when they were undergraduates at trinity we cannot live in art it was the embodiment tennyson added of his belief that the godlike life is with man and for man cf his own lines in love and duty    for a man is not as god   but then most godlike being most a man  it is a companion poem to the vision of sin in that poem is traced the effect of indulgence in the grosser pleasures of sense in this the effect of the indulgence in the more refined pleasures of sense     i send you here a sort of allegory   for you will understand it of a soul 1   a sinful soul possessd of many gifts   a spacious garden full of flowering weeds   a glorious devil large in heart and brain   that did love beauty only beauty seen   in all varieties of mould and mind   and knowledge for its beauty or if good   good only for its beauty seeing not   that beauty good and knowledge are three sisters   that doat upon each other friends to man   living together under the same roof   and never can be sunderd without tears   and he that shuts love out in turn shall be   shut out from love and on her threshold lie   howling in outer darkness not for this   was common clay taen from the common earth   moulded by god and temperd with the tears   of angels to the perfect shape of man   footnote 1 1833  i send you friend a sort of allegory you are an artist and will understand its many lesser meanings of a soul       the palace of art  first published in 1833 but altered so extensively on its republication in 1842 as to be practically rewritten the alterations in it after 1842 were not numerous consisting chiefly in the deletion of two stanzas after line 192 and the insertion of the three stanzas which follow in the present text together with other minor verbal corrections all of which have been noted no alterations were made in the text after 1853 the allegory tennyson explains in the dedicatory verses but the framework of the poem was evidently suggested by ecclesiastes ii 117 the position of the hero is precisely that of solomon both began by assuming that man is selfsufficing and the world sufficient the verdict of the one in consequence being vanity of vanities all is vanity of the other what the poet here records an admirable commentary on the poem is afforded by matthew arnolds picture of the romans before christ taught the secret of the only real happiness possible to man see obermann once more the teaching of the poem has been admirably explained by spedding it represents allegorically the condition of a mind which in the love of beauty and the triumphant consciousness of knowledge and intellectual supremacy in the intense enjoyment of its own power and glory has lost sight of its relation to man and god see tennysons

am   and in the fields all round i hear the bleating of the lamb   how sadly i remember rose the morning of the year   to die before the snowdrop came and now the violets here    o sweet is the new violet that comes beneath the skies   and sweeter is the young lambs voice to me that cannot rise   and sweet is all the land about and all the flowers that blow   and sweeter far is death than life to me that long to go    it seemd so hard at first mother to leave the blessed sun   and now it seems as hard to stay and yet his will be done   but still i think it cant be long before i find release   and that good man the clergyman has told me words of peace 1    o blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair   and blessings on his whole life long until he meet me there   o blessings on his kindly heart and on his silver head   a thousand times i blest him as he knelt beside my bed    he taught me all the mercy for he showd 2 me all the sin   now tho my lamp was lighted late theres one will let me in   nor would i now be well mother again if that could be   for my desire is but to pass to him that died for me    i did not hear the dog howl mother or the deathwatch beat   there came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet   but sit beside my bed mother and put your hand in mine   and effie on the other side and i will tell the sign    all in the wild marchmorning i heard the angels call   it was when the moon was setting and the dark was over all   the trees began to whisper and the wind began to roll   and in the wild marchmorning i heard them call my soul    for lying broad awake i thought of you and effie dear   i saw you sitting in the house and i no longer here   with all my strength i prayd for both and so i felt resignd   and up the valley came a swell of music on the wind    i thought that it was fancy and i listend in my bed   and then did something speak to mei know not what was said   for great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind   and up the valley came again the music on the wind    but you were sleeping and i said its not for them its mine   and if it comes 3 three times i thought i take it for a sign   and once again it came and close beside the windowbars   then seemd to go right up to heaven and die among the stars    so now i think my time is near i trust it is i know   the blessed music went that way my soul will have to go   and for myself indeed i care not if i go today   but effie you must comfort her when i am past away    and say to robin 4 a kind word and tell him not to fret   theres many worthier than i would make him happy yet   if i had livedi cannot telli might have been his wife   but all these things have ceased to be with my desire of life    o look the sun begins to rise the heavens are in a glow   he shines upon a hundred fields and all of them i know   and there i move no longer now and there his light may shine   wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine    o sweet and strange it seems to me that ere this day is done   the voice that now is speaking may be beyond the sun   for ever and for ever with those just souls and true   and what is life that we should moan why make we such ado    for ever and for ever all in a blessed home   and there to wait a little while till you and effie come   to lie within the light of god as i lie upon your breast   and the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest    footnote 1 1842    but still it cant be long mother before i find release   and that good man the clergyman he preaches words of peace  present

robin restored       the lotoseaters  first published in 1833 but when republished in 1842 the alterations in the way of excision alteration and addition were very extensive the text of 1842 is practically the final text this charming poem is founded on odyssey ix 82 seq    on the tenth day we set foot on the land of the lotoseaters who eat   a flowery food so we stepped ashore and drew water when we had   tasted meat and drink i sent forth certain of my company to go and   make search what manner of men they were who here live upon the earth   by bread then straightway they went and mixed with the men of the   lotoseaters and so it was that the lotoseaters devised not death   for our fellows but gave them of the lotos to taste now whosoever of   them did eat the honeysweet fruit of the lotos had no more wish to   bring tidings nor to come back but there he chose to abide with the   lotoseating men ever feeding on the lotos and forgetful of his   homeward way therefore i led them back to the ships weeping and sore   against their will  lest haply any should eat of the lotos and be   forgetful of returning    lang and butchers translation  but in the details of his poem tennyson has laid many other poets under contribution notably moschus idyll v bion idyll v spenser faerie queen ii vi description of the idle lake and thomsons castle of indolence     courage he said and pointed toward the land   this mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon   in the afternoon they came unto a land   in which it seemed always afternoon   all round the coast the languid air did swoon   breathing like one that hath a weary dream   fullfaced above the valley stood the moon 1   and like a downward smoke the slender stream   along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem    a land of streams some like a downward smoke   slowdropping veils of thinnest lawn did go   and some thro wavering lights and shadows broke   rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below   they saw the gleaming river seaward flow 2   from the inner land far off three mountaintops   three silent pinnacles of aged snow 3   stood sunsetflushd and dewd with showery drops   upclomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse    the charmed sunset lingerd low adown   in the red west thro mountain clefts the dale   was seen far inland and the yellow down   borderd with palm and many a winding vale   and meadow set with slender galingale   a land where all things always seemd the same   and round about the keel with faces pale   dark faces pale against that rosy flame   the mildeyed melancholy lotoseaters came    branches they bore of that enchanted stem   laden with flower and fruit whereof they gave   to each but whoso did receive of them   and taste to him the gushing of the wave   far far away did seem to mourn and rave   on alien shores and if his fellow spake   his voice was thin as voices from the grave   and deepasleep he seemd yet all awake   and music in his ears his beating heart did make    they sat them down upon the yellow sand   between the sun and moon upon the shore   and sweet it was to dream of fatherland   of child and wife and slave but evermore   most weary seemd the sea weary the oar   weary the wandering fields of barren foam   then some one said we will return no more   and all at once they sang our island home   is far beyond the wave we will no longer roam   footnote 1 1883 above the valley burned the golden moon  footnote 2 1883 rivers seaward flow  footnote 3 1833 three thundercloven thrones of oldest snow      choric song    1      there is sweet music here that softer falls     than petals from blown roses on the grass     or nightdews on still waters between walls     of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass     music that gentlier on the spirit lies     than tird eyelids upon tird eyes     music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies     here are cool mosses deep     and thro the moss the ivies creep     and in the stream the longleaved flowers weep     and from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep     2      why are we weighd upon with heaviness     and utterly consumed with sharp distress     while all things else have rest from weariness     all things have rest why should we toil alone     we only toil who are the first of things     and make perpetual moan     still from one sorrow to another thrown     nor ever fold our wings     and cease from wanderings     nor steep our brows in slumbers holy balm     nor harken what the inner spirit sings     there is no joy but calm     why should we only toil the roof and crown of things     3      lo in the middle of the wood     the folded leaf is wood from out the bud     with winds upon the branch and there     grows green and broad and takes no care     sunsteepd at noon and in the moon     nightly dewfed and turning yellow     falls and floats adown the air     lo sweetend with the summer light     the fulljuiced apple waxing overmellow

our lips are dumb     let us alone     what is it that will last     all things are taken from us and become     portions and parcels of the dreadful past     let us alone     what pleasure can we have     to war with evil is there any peace     in ever climbing up the climbing wave 2     all things have rest and ripen toward the grave 3     in silence ripen fall and cease     give us long rest or death dark death or dreamful ease     5      how sweet it were hearing the downward stream     with halfshut eyes ever to seem     falling asleep in a halfdream     to dream and dream like yonder amber light     which will not leave the myrrhbush on the height     to hear each others whisperd speech     eating the lotos day by day     to watch the crisping ripples on the beach     and tender curving lines of creamy spray     to lend our hearts and spirits wholly     to the influence of mildminded melancholy     to muse and brood and live again in memory     with those 4 old faces of our infancy     heapd over with a mound of grass     two handfuls of white dust shut in an urn of brass     6      dear is the memory of our wedded lives     and dear the last embraces of our wives

excellent commentary on tennysons picture of those gods and what they see cf too the song of the parcae in goethes iphigenie auf tauris iv 5       a dream of fair women  first published in 1833 but very extensively altered on its republication in 1842 it had been written by june 1832 and appears to have been originally entitled legend of fair women see speddings letter dated 21st june 1832 life i 116 in nearly every edition between 1833 and 1853 it was revised and perhaps no poem proves more strikingly the scrupulous care which tennyson took to improve what he thought susceptible of improvement the work which inspired it chaucers legend of good women was written about 1384 thus preluding by nearly two hundred years the spacious times of great elizabeth there is no resemblance between the poems beyond the fact that both are visions and both have as their heroines illustrious women who have been unfortunate cleopatra is the only one common to the two poems tennysons is an exquisite work of artthe transition from the anarchy of dreams to the dreamland landscape and to the sharply denned figuresthe skill with which the heroines what could be more perfect that cleopatra and jephthas daughter are chosen and contrastedthe wonderful way in which the iphigenia of euripides and lucretius and the cleopatra of shakespeare are realised are alike admirable the poem opened in 1833 with the following strangely irrelevant verses excised in 1842 which as fitzgerald observed make a perfect poem by themselves without affecting the dream       as when a man that sails in a balloon     downlooking sees the solid shining ground     stream from beneath him in the broad blue noon     tilth hamlet mead and mound      and takes his flags and waves them to the mob     that shout below all faces turned to where     glows rubylike the far up crimson globe     filled with a finer air      so lifted high the poet at his will     lets the great world flit from him seeing all     higher thro secret splendours mounting still     selfpoised nor fears to fall      hearing apart the echoes of his fame   while i spoke thus the seedsman memory   sowed my deepfurrowed thought with many a name   whose glory will not die    i read before my eyelids dropt their shade   the legend of good women long ago   sung by the morning star 1 of song who made   his music heard below    dan chaucer the first warbler whose sweet breath   preluded those melodious bursts that fill   the spacious times of great elizabeth   with sounds that echo still    and for a while the knowledge of his art   held me above the subject as strong gales   hold swollen clouds from raining tho my heart   brimful of those wild tales    charged both mine eyes with tears   in every land i saw wherever light illumineth   beauty and anguish walking hand in hand   the downward slope to death 2    those farrenowned brides of ancient song   peopled the hollow dark like burning stars   and i heard sounds of insult shame and wrong   and trumpets blown for wars    and clattering flints batterd with clanging hoofs   and i saw crowds in columnd sanctuaries   and forms that passd 3 at windows and on roofs   of marble palaces    corpses across the threshold heroes tall   dislodging pinnacle and parapet   upon the tortoise creeping to the wall 4   lances in ambush set    and high shrinedoors burst thro with heated blasts   that run before the fluttering tongues of fire   white surf windscatterd over sails and masts   and ever climbing higher    squadrons and squares of men in brazen plates   scaffolds still sheets of water divers woes   ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates   and hushd seraglios    so shape chased shape as swift as when to land   bluster the winds and tides the selfsame way   crisp foamflakes scud along the level sand   torn from the fringe of spray    i started once or seemd to start in pain   resolved on noble things and strove to speak   as when a great thought strikes along the brain   and flushes all the cheek    and once my arm was lifted to hew down   a cavalier from off his saddlebow   that bore a lady from a leaguerd town   and then i know not how    all those sharp fancies by downlapsing thought   streamd onward lost their edges and did creep   rolld on each other rounded smoothd and brought   into the gulfs of sleep    at last methought that i had wanderd far   in an old wood freshwashd in coolest dew   the maiden splendours of the morning star   shook in the steadfast 5 blue    enormous elmtreeboles did stoop and lean   upon the dusky brushwood underneath   their broad curved branches fledged with clearest green   new from its silken sheath    the dim red morn had died her journey done   and with dead lips smiled at the twilight plain   halffalln across the threshold of the sun   never to rise again    there was no motion in the dumb dead air   not any song of bird or sound of rill   gross darkness of the inner sepulchre   is not so deadly still    as that wide forest   growths of jasmine turnd   their humid arms festooning tree to tree 6   and at the root thro lush green grasses burnd   the red anemone    i knew the flowers i knew the leaves i knew   the tearful glimmer of the languid dawn   on those long rank dark woodwalks drenchd in dew   leading from lawn to lawn    the smell of violets hidden in the green   pourd back into my empty soul and frame   the times when i remember to have been   joyful and free from blame    and from within me a clear undertone   thrilld thro mine ears in that unblissful clime   pass freely thro the wood is all thine own   until the end of time    at length i saw a lady 7 within call   stiller than chiselld marble standing there   a daughter of the gods divinely tall 8   and most divinely fair    her loveliness with shame and with surprise   froze my swift speech she turning on my face   the starlike sorrows of immortal eyes   spoke slowly in her place    i had great beauty ask thou not my name   no one can be more wise than destiny   many drew swords and died   whereer i came i brought calamity    no marvel sovereign lady 9 in fair field   myself for such a face had boldly died 10   i answerd free and turning i appeald   to one 11 that stood beside    but she with sick and scornful looks averse   to her full height her stately stature draws   my youth she said was blasted with a curse   this woman was the cause    i was cut off from hope in that sad place 12   which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears 13   my father held his hand upon his face   i blinded with my tears    still strove to speak my voice was thick with sighs   as in a dream dimly i could descry   the stern blackbearded kings with wolfish eyes   waiting to see me die    the high masts flickerd as they lay afloat   the crowds the temples waverd and the shore   the bright death quiverd at the victims throat   touchd and i knew no more 14    whereto the other with a downward brow   i would the white cold heavyplunging foam 15   whirld by the wind had rolld me deep below   then when i left my home    her slow full words sank thro the silence drear   as thunderdrops fall on a sleeping sea   sudden i heard a voice that cried come here   that i may look on thee    i turning saw throned on a flowery rise   one sitting on a crimson scarf unrolld   a queen with swarthy cheeks 16 and bold black eyes   browbound with burning gold    she flashing forth a haughty smile began   i governd men by change and so i swayd   all moods tis long since i have seen a man   once like the moon i made    the evershifting currents of the blood   according to my humour ebb and flow   i have no men to govern in this wood   that makes my only woe    nayyet it chafes me that i could not bend   one will nor tame and tutor with mine eye   that dull coldblooded caesar prythee friend   where is mark antony 17    the man my lover with whom i rode sublime   on fortunes neck we sat as god by god   the nilus would have risen before his time   and flooded at our nod 18    we drank the libyan 19 sun to sleep and lit   lamps which outburnd canopus o my life in

contented there to die    and there he died and when i heard my name   sighd forth with life i would not brook my fear 22   of the other with a worm i balkd his fame   what else was left look here    with that she tore her robe apart and half   the polishd argent of her breast to sight   laid bare thereto she pointed with a laugh   showing the aspicks bite    i died a queen the roman soldier found 23   me lying dead my crown about my brows   a name for everlying robed and crownd   worthy a roman spouse    her warbling voice a lyre of widest range   struck 24 by all passion did fall down and glance   from tone to tone and glided thro all change   of liveliest utterance    when she made pause i knew not for delight   because with sudden motion from the ground   she raised her piercing orbs and filld with light   the interval of sound    still with their fires love tipt his keenest darts   as once they drew into two burning rings   all beams of love melting the mighty hearts   of captains and of kings    slowly my sense undazzled then i heard   a noise of some one coming thro the lawn   and singing clearer than the crested bird   that claps his wings at dawn    the torrent brooks of hallowd israel   from craggy hollows pouring late and soon   sound all night long in falling thro the dell   farheard beneath the moon    the balmy moon of blessed israel   floods all the deepblue gloom with beams divine   all night the splinterd crags that wall the dell   with spires of silver shine    as one that museth where broad sunshine laves   the lawn by some cathedral thro the door   hearing the holy organ rolling waves   of sound on roof and floor    within and anthem sung is charmd and tied   to where he standsso stood i when that flow   of music left the lips of her that died   to save her fathers vow    the daughter of the warrior gileadite 25   a maiden pure as when she went along   from mizpehs towerd gate with welcome light   with timbrel and with song    my words leapt forth heaven heads the count of crimes   with that wild oath she renderd answer high   not so nor once alone a thousand times   i would be born and die    single i grew like some green plant whose root   creeps to the garden waterpipes beneath   feeding the flower but ere my flower to fruit   changed i was ripe for death    my god my land my fatherthese did move   me from my bliss of life that nature gave   lowerd softly with a threefold cord of love   down to a silent grave    and i went mourning no fair hebrew boy   shall smile away my maiden blame among   the hebrew mothersemptied of all joy   leaving the dance and song    leaving the olivegardens far below   leaving the promise of my bridal bower   the valleys of grapeloaded vines that glow   beneath the battled tower    the light white cloud swam over us anon   we heard the lion roaring from his den 26   we saw the large white stars rise one by one   or from the darkend glen    saw god divide the night with flying flame   and thunder on the everlasting hills   i heard him for he spake and grief became   a solemn scorn of ills    when the next moon was rolld into the sky   strength came to me that equalld my desire   how beautiful a thing it was to die   for god and for my sire    it comforts me in this one thought to dwell   that i subdued me to my fathers will   because the kiss he gave me ere i fell   sweetens the spirit still    moreover it is written that my race   hewd ammon hip and thigh from aroer 27   on arnon unto minneth here her face   glowd as i lookd at her    she lockd her lips she left me where

hope and trust   to whom the egyptian o you tamely died   you should have clung to fulvias waist and thrust   the dagger thro her side    with that sharp sound the white dawns creeping beams   stoln to my brain dissolved the mystery   of folded sleep the captain of my dreams   ruled in the eastern sky    morn broadend on the borders of the dark   ere i saw her who claspd in her last trance   her murderd fathers head or joan of arc 28   a light of ancient france    or her who knew that love can vanquish death   who kneeling with one arm about her king   drew forth the poison with her balmy breath 29   sweet as new buds in spring    no memory labours longer from the deep   goldmines of thought to lift the hidden ore   that glimpses moving up than i from sleep   to gather and tell oer    each little sound and sight with what dull pain   compassd how eagerly i sought to strike   into that wondrous track of dreams again   but no two dreams are like    as when a soul laments which hath

woe    tis strange that those we lean on most   those in whose laps our limbs are nursed   fall into shadow soonest lost   those we love first are taken first    god gives us love something to love   he lends us but when love is grown   to ripeness that on which it throve   falls off and love is left alone    this is the curse of time alas   in grief i am not all unlearnd   once thro mine own

tell you not to weep    and tho mine own eyes fill with dew   drawn from the spirit thro the brain 5   i will not even preach to you   weep weeping dulls the inward pain    let grief be her own

another poem which though included among those belonging to 1833 was not published till 1842 it is an interesting illustration like the next poem but one of tennysons political opinions he was he said of the same politics as shakespeare bacon and every sane man he was either ignorant of the politics of shakespeare and bacon or did himself great injustice by the remark it would have been more true to sayfor all his works illustrate itthat he was of the same politics as burke he is here and in all his poems a liberalconservative in the proper sense of the term at the time this trio of poems was written england was passing through the throes which preceded accompanied and followed the reform bill and the lessons which tennyson preaches in them were particularly appropriate he belonged to the liberal party rather in relation to social and religious than to political questions thus he ardently supported the antislavery convention and advocated the measure for abolishing subscription to the thirtynine articles but he was as a politician on the side of canning peel and the duke of wellington regarding as they did the newborn democracy with mingled feelings of apprehension and perplexity

 the goose  this was first published in 1842 no alteration has since been made in it  this poem which was written at the time of the reform bill agitation is a political allegory showing how illusory were the supposed advantages held out by the radicals to the poor and labouring classes the old woman typifies these classes the stranger the radicals the goose the radical programme free trade and the like the eggs such advantages as the proposed radical measures might for a time seem to confer the cluttering goose the storm and whirlwind the heavy price which would have to be paid for them in the social anarchy resulting from triumphant radicalism the allegory may be narrowed to the free trade question     i knew an old wife lean and poor   her rags scarce held together   there strode a stranger to the door   and it was windy weather    he held a goose upon his arm   he utterd rhyme and reason   here take the goose and keep you warm   it is a stormy season    she caught the white goose by the leg   a goosetwas no great matter   the goose let fall a golden egg   with cackle and with clatter    she dropt the goose and caught the pelf   and ran to tell her neighbours   and blessd herself and cursed herself   and rested from her labours    and feeding high and living soft   grew plump and ablebodied   until the grave churchwarden doffd   the parson smirkd and nodded    so sitting served by man and maid   she felt her heart grow prouder   but ah the more the white goose laid   it clackd and cackled louder    it clutterd here it chuckled there   it stirrd the old wifes mettle   she shifted in her elbowchair   and hurld the pan and kettle    a quinsy choke thy cursed note   then waxd her anger stronger   go take the goose and wring her throat   i will not bear it longer    then yelpd the cur and yawld the cat   ran gaffer stumbled gammer   the goose flew this way and flew that   and filld the house with clamour    as head and heels upon the floor   they flounderd all together   there strode a stranger to the door   and it was windy weather    he took the goose upon his arm   he utterd words of scorning   so keep you cold or keep you warm   it is a stormy morning    the wild wind rang from park and plain   and round the attics rumbled   till all the tables danced again   and half the chimneys tumbled    the glass blew in the fire blew out   the blast was hard and harder   her cap blew off her gown blew up   and a whirlwind cleard the larder    and while on all sides breaking loose   her household fled the danger   quoth she the devil take the goose   and god forget the stranger      the epic  first published in 1842 tho for though in line 44 has been the only alteration made since 1850  this prologue was written like the epilogue after the epic had been composed being added fitzgerald says to anticipate or excuse the faint homeric echoes to give a reason for telling an oldworld tale the poet mouthing out his hollow oes and aes is we are told a good description of tennysons tone and manner of reading     at francis allens on the christmaseve   the game of forfeits donethe girls all kissd   beneath the sacred bush and past away   the parson holmes the poet everard hall   the host and i sat round the wassailbowl   then halfway ebbd and there we held a talk   how all the old honour had from christmas gone   or gone or dwindled down to some odd games   in some odd nooks like this till i tired out   with cutting eights that day upon the pond   where three times slipping from the outer edge   i bumpd the ice into three several stars   fell in a doze and halfawake i heard   the parson taking wide and wider sweeps   now harping on the churchcommissioners 1   now hawking at geology and schism   until i woke and found him settled down   upon the general decay of faith   right thro the world at home was little left   and none abroad there was no anchor none   to hold by francis laughing clapt his hand   on everards shoulder with i hold by him   and i quoth everard by the wassailbowl   why yes i said we knew your gift that way   at college but another which you had   i mean of verse for so we held it then   what came of that  you know said frank he burnt   his epic his king arthur some twelve books 2   and then to me demanding why oh sir   he thought that nothing new was said or else   something so said twas nothingthat a truth   looks freshest in the fashion of the day   god knows he has a mint of reasons ask   it pleased me well enough nay nay said hall   why take the style of those heroic times   for nature brings not back the mastodon   nor we those times and why should any man   remodel models these twelve books of mine 3   were faint homeric echoes nothingworth   mere chaff and draff much better burnt   but i said francis pickd the eleventh from this hearth   and have it keep a thing its use will come   i hoard it as a sugarplum for holmes   he laughd and i though sleepy like a horse   that hears the cornbin open prickd my ears   for i rememberd everards college fame   when we were freshmen then at my request   he brought it and the poet little urged   but with some prelude of disparagement   read mouthing out his hollow oes and aes   deepchested music and to this result   footnote 1 a burning topic with the clergy in and about 1833  footnote 2  1842 to 1844 you know said frank he flung his epic of king arthur in the fire the present reading 1850  footnote 3 1842 1843    remodel models rather than the life   and these twelve books of mine to speak the truth  present reading 1845     morte darthur  this is tennysons first study from malorys morte darthur we learn from fitzgerald that it was written as early as the spring of 1835 for in that year tennyson read it to fitzgerald and spedding out of a ms in a little red book and again we learn that he repeated some lines of it at the end of may 1835 one calm day on windermere adding not bad that fitz is it life i 184 it is here represented as the eleventh book of an epic the rest of which had been destroyed though tennyson afterwards incorporated it adding introductory lines with what was virtually to prove an epic in twelve books the idylls of the king the substance of the poem is drawn from the third fourth and fifth chapters of the twentyfirst book of malorys romance which is followed very closely it is called an homeric echo but the diction bears a much closer resemblance to that of virgil than to that of homer though the rhythm is perhaps more homeric than virgilian it is tennysons masterpiece in the grand style and is indeed as near perfection as any work of this kind could be in spite of its singular mixture of simplicity purely homeric and artificiality at times ultravirgilian the incongruity never shocks so noble and impressive is the general effect the text of 1842 was never subsequently altered except in the spelling of mere and though in lines 37 77 147 155 162 272 and in the insertion in 1853 of the line      across the ridge and pacd beside the mere      so all day long the noise of battle rolld   among the mountains by the winter sea   until king arthurs table man by man   had falln in lyonness about their lord   king arthur then because his wound was deep   the bold sir bedivere uplifted him   sir bedivere the last of all his knights   and bore him to a chapel nigh the field 1   a broken chancel with a broken cross   that stood on a dark strait of barren land   on one side lay the ocean and on one   lay a great water and the moon was full   then spake king arthur to sir bedivere   the sequel of today unsolders all   the goodliest fellowship of famous knights   whereof this world holds record such a sleep   they sleepthe men i loved i think that we   shall never more at any future time   delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds   walking about the gardens and the halls   of camelot as in the days that were   i perish by this people which i made   tho merlin sware that i should come again   to rule once morebut let what will be be   i am so deeply smitten thro the helm   that without help i cannot last till morn   thou therefore take my brand 2 excalibur   which was my pride for thou rememberest how   in those old days one summer noon an arm   rose up from out the bosom of the lake   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   holding the swordand how i rowd across   and took it and have worn it like a king   and wheresoever i am sung or told   in aftertime this also shall be known   but now delay not take excalibur   and fling him far into the middle mere   watch what thou seëst and lightly bring me word   to him replied the bold sir bedivere   it is not meet sir king to leave thee thus   aidless alone and smitten thro the helm   a little thing may harm a wounded man   yet i thy hest will all perform at full   watch what i see and lightly bring thee word   so saying from the ruind shrine he stept   and in the moon athwart the place of tombs   where lay the mighty bones of ancient men   old knights and over them the seawind sang   shrill chill with flakes of foam he stepping down   by zigzag paths and juts of pointed rock   came on the shining levels of the lake   there drew he forth the brand excalibur   and oer him drawing it the winter moon   brightening the skirts of a long cloud ran forth   and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt   for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks 3   myriads of topazlights and jacinthwork   of subtlest jewellery he gazed so long   that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood   this way and that dividing the swift mind 4   in act to throw but at the last it seemd   better to leave excalibur conceald   there in the manyknotted waterflags   that whistled stiff and dry about the marge   so strode he back slow to the wounded king   then spake king arthur to sir bedivere   hast thou performd my mission which i gave   what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard   and answer made the bold sir bedivere   i heard the ripple washing in the reeds 5   and the wild water lapping on the crag   to whom replied king arthur faint and pale   thou hast betrayd thy nature and thy name   not rendering true answer as beseemd   thy fëalty nor like a noble knight   for surer sign had followd either hand   or voice or else a motion of the mere   this is a shameful thing for men to lie   yet now i charge thee quickly go again 6   as thou art lief and dear and do the thing   i bade thee watch and lightly bring me word   then went sir bedivere the second time   across the ridge and paced beside the mere 7   counting the dewy pebbles fixd in thought   but when he saw the wonder of the hilt   how curiously and strangely chased he smote   his palms together and he cried aloud   and if indeed i cast the brand away   surely a precious thing one worthy note   should thus be lost for ever from the earth   which might have pleased the eyes of many men   what good should follow this if this were done   what harm undone deep harm to disobey   seeing obedience is the bond of rule   were it well to obey then if a king demand   an act unprofitable against himself   the king is sick and knows not what he does   what record or what relic of my lord   should be to aftertime but empty breath   and rumours of a doubt but were this kept   stored in some treasurehouse of mighty kings   some one might show it at a joust of arms   saying king arthurs sword excalibur   wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake   nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps   upon the hidden bases of the hills   so might some old man speak in the aftertime   to all the people winning reverence   but now much honour and much fame were lost   so spake he clouded with his own conceit   and hid excalibur the second time   and so strode back slow to the wounded king   then spoke king arthur breathing heavily   what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard   and answer made the bold sir bedivere   i heard the water lapping on the crag   and the long ripple washing in the reeds   to whom replied king arthur much in wrath   ah miserable and unkind untrue 8   unknightly traitorhearted woe is me   authority forgets a dying king 9   laid widowd of the power in his eye   that bowd the will i see thee what thou art   for thou the latestleft of all my knights   in whom should meet the offices of all   thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt   either from lust of gold or like a girl   valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes   yet for a man may fail in duty twice   and the third time may prosper get thee hence   but if thou spare to fling excalibur   i will arise and slay thee with my hands   then quickly rose sir bedivere and ran 10   and leaping down the ridges lightly plunged   among the bulrushbeds and clutchd the sword   and strongly wheeld and threw it the great brand   made lightnings in the splendour of the moon   and flashing round and round and whirld in an arch   shot like a streamer of the northern morn   seen where the moving isles of winter shock   by night with noises of the northern sea   so flashd and fell the brand excalibur   but ere he dipt the surface rose an arm   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   and caught him by the hilt and brandishd him   three times and drew him under in the mere   and lightly went the other to the king   then spoke king arthur drawing thicker breath   now see i by thine eyes that this is done   speak out what is it thou hast heard or seen   and answer made the bold sir bedivere   sir king i closed mine eyelids lest the gems   should blind my purpose for i never saw   nor shall see here or elsewhere till i die   not tho i live three lives of mortal men   so great a miracle as yonder hilt   then with both hands i flung him wheeling him   but when i lookd again behold an arm   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   that caught him by the hilt and brandishd him   three times and drew him under in the mere   and answer made king arthur breathing hard   my end draws nightis time that i were gone   make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight   and bear me to the margin yet i fear 11   my wound hath taken cold and i shall die   so saying from the pavement he hath rose   slowly with pain reclining on his arm   and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes   as in a picture him sir bedivere   remorsefully regarded thro his tears   and would have spoken but he found not words   then took with care and kneeling on one knee   oer both his shoulders drew the languid hands   and rising bore him thro the place of tombs   but as he walkd king arthur panted hard   like one that feels a nightmare on his bed   when all the house is mute so sighd the king   muttering and murmuring at his ear   quick quick i fear it is too late and i shall die    but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge   clothed with his breath and looking as he walkd   larger than human on the frozen hills   he heard the deep behind him and a cry   before his own thought drove him like a goad   dry clashd his harness in the icy caves   and barren chasms and all to left and right   the bare black cliff clangd round him as he based   his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang   sharpsmitten with the dint of armed heels   and on a sudden lo the level lake   and the long glories of the winter moon   then saw they how there hove a dusky barge 12   dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern   beneath them and descending they were ware   that all the decks were dense with stately forms   blackstoled blackhooded like a dreamby these   three queens with crowns of goldand from them rose   a cry that shiverd to the tingling stars   and as it were one voice an agony   of lamentation like a wind that shrills   all night in a waste land where no one comes   or hath come since the making of the world   then murmurd arthur place me in the barge   and to the barge they came there those three queens   put forth their hands and took the king and wept   but she that rose the tallest of them all   and fairest laid his head upon her lap   and loosed the shatterd casque and chafed his hands   and calld him by his name complaining loud   and dropping bitter tears against his brow   striped with dark blood for all his face was white   and colourless and like the witherd moon   smote by the fresh beam of the springing east   and all his greaves and cuisses dashd with drops   of onset and the light and lustrous curls   that made his forehead like a rising sun   high from the däisthronewere parchd with dust   or clotted into points and hanging loose   mixd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips   so like a shatterd column lay the king   not like that arthur who with lance in rest   from spur to plume a star of tournament   shot thro the lists at camelot and charged   before the eyes of ladies and of kings   then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere 13   ah my lord arthur whither shall i go   where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes   for now i see the true old times are dead   when every morning brought a noble chance   and every chance brought out a noble knight   such times have been not since the light that led   the holy elders with the gift of myrrh   but now the whole round table is dissolved   which was an image of the mighty world   and i the last go forth companionless   and the days darken round me and the years   among new men strange faces other minds   and slowly answerd arthur from the barge   the old order changeth yielding place to new   and god fulfils himself in many ways 14   lest one good custom should corrupt the world   comfort thyself what comfort is in me   i have lived my life and that which i have done   may he within himself make pure but thou   if thou shouldst never see my face again   pray for my soul more things are wrought by prayer   than this world dreams of wherefore let thy voice   rise like a fountain for me night and day   for what are men better than sheep or goats   that nourish a blind life within the brain   if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer   both for themselves and those who call them friend   for so the whole round earth is every way   bound by gold chains 15 about the feet of god   but now farewell i am going a long way   with these thou seëstif indeed i go   for all my mind is clouded with a doubt   to the islandvalley of avilion   where falls not hail or rain 16 or any snow   nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies   deepmeadowd happy fair with orchardlawns   and bowery hollows crownd with summer sea 17   where i will heal me of my grievous wound   so said he and the barge with oar and sail   moved from the brink like some fullbreasted swan   that fluting a wild carol ere her death   ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood   with swarthy webs long stood sir bedivere   revolving many memories till the hull   lookd one black dot against the verge of dawn   and on the mere the wailing died away    here ended hall and our last light that long   had winkd and threatend darkness flared and fell   at which the parson sent to sleep with sound   and waked with silence grunted good but we   sat rapt it was the tone with which he read   perhaps some modern touches here and there   redeemd it from the charge of nothingness   or else we loved the man and prized his work   i know not but we sitting as i said   the cock crew loud as at that time of year   the lusty bird takes every hour for dawn   then francis muttering like a man illused   there nowthats nothing drew a little back   and drove his heel into the smoulderd log   that sent a blast of sparkles up the flue   and so to bed where yet in sleep i seemd   to sail with arthur under looming shores   point after point till on to dawn when dreams   begin to feel the truth and stir of day   to me methought who waited with a crowd   there came a bark that blowing forward bore   king arthur like a modern gentleman   of stateliest port and all the people cried   arthur is come again he cannot die   then those that stood upon the hills behind   repeatedcome again and thrice as fair   and further inland voices echoed   come with all good things and war shall be no more   at this a hundred bells began to peal   that with the sound i woke and heard indeed   the clear churchbells ring in the christmas morn   footnote 1 cf morte darthur xxxi iv they led him betwixt them to a little chapel from the not far seaside  footnote 2 cf id v    therefore said arthur take thou my good sword excalibur and go   with it to yonder waterside and when thou comest there i charge thee   throw my sword on that water and come again and tell me what thou   there seest    my lord said bedivere your commandment shall be done and lightly   will i bring thee word again    so sir bedivere departed and by the way he beheld that noble sword   that the pommel and the haft were all of precious stones and then he   said to himself if i throw this rich sword in the water thereof   shall never come to good but harm and loss and then sir bedivere hid   excalibur under a tree   footnote 3

footnote 6 romance id v    that is untruly said of thee said the king therefore go thou   lightly again and do my command as thou to me art lief and dear spare   not but throw in    then sir bedivere

to the water and done his commandment   footnote 7 this line was not inserted till 1853  footnote 8 romance id v    ah traitor untrue said king arthur now thou hast betrayed me   twice who would have

thee if ever i may see thee i shall slay thee with   mine own hands   footnote 9 there is a curious illustration of this in an anecdote told of queen elizabeth cecil intimated that she must go to bed

went to the waterside and then he bound the girdle about the   hilt and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might   and then came an arm and a hand above the water and met it and caught   it and so shook it thrice and brandished it and then vanished away   the hand with the sword in the water   footnote 11 romance id v    alas said the king help me hence for i dread me i have tarried   over long    then sir bedivere took the king upon his back and so went with him to   that water   footnote 12 romance id v    and when they were at the waterside even fast by the bank hoved a   little barge and many fair ladies in it and among them all was a   queen and all they had black hoods and all they wept and shrieked when   they saw king arthur now put me into the barge said the king and   so they did softly and there received him three queens with great   mourning and so they set him down and in one of their laps king   arthur laid his head and then that queen said ah dear brother why   have ye tarried so long from me   footnote 13 romance id v    then sir bedivere cried ah my lord arthur what shall become of me   now ye go from me and leave me here alone among mine enemies    comfort thyself said the king and do as well as thou mayest for   in me is no trust to trust in for i will unto the vale of avilion to   heal me of my grievous wound and if thou never hear

first of that delightful series of poems dealing with scenes and characters from ordinary english life and named appropriately english idylls the originator of this species of poetry in england was southey in his english eclogues written before 1799 in the preface to these eclogues which are in blank verse southey says the following eclogues i believe bear no resemblance to any poems in our language this species of composition has become popular in germany and i was induced to attempt it by an account of the german idylls given me in conversation southeys eclogues are eight in number the old mansion house the grandmothers tale hannah the sailors mother the witch the ruined cottage the last of the family and the aldermans funeral southey was followed by wordsworth in the brothers and michael southey has nothing of the charm grace and classical finish of his disciple but how nearly tennyson follows him as copy and model may be seen by anyone who compares tennysons studies with the ruined cottage but tennysons real master was theocritus whose influence pervades these poems not so much directly in definite imitation as indirectly in colour and tone  the gardeners daughter was written as early as 1835 as it was read to fitzgerald in that year life of tennyson i 182 tennyson originally intended to insert a prologue to be entitled the antechamber which contained an elaborate picture of himself but he afterwards suppressed it it is given in the life i 2334 this poem stands alone among the idylls in being somewhat overloaded with ornament the text of 1842 remained unaltered through all the subsequent editions except in line 235 after 1851 the form tho is substituted for though     this morning is the morning of the day   when i and eustace from the city went   to see the gardeners daughter i and he   brothers in art a friendship so complete   portiond in halves between us that we grew   the fable of the city where we dwelt   my eustace might have sat for hercules   so muscular he spread so broad of breast   he by some law that holds in love and draws   the greater to the lesser long desired   a certain miracle of symmetry   a miniature of loveliness all grace   summd up and closed in littlejuliet she 1   so light of foot so light of spiritoh she   to me myself for some three careless moons   the summer pilot of an empty heart   unto the shores of nothing know you not   such touches are but embassies of love   to tamper with the feelings ere he found   empire for life but eustace painted her   and said to me she sitting with us then   when will you paint like this and i replied   my words were half in earnest half in jest   tis not your work but loves love unperceived   a more ideal artist he than all   came drew your pencil from you made those eyes   darker than darkest pansies and that hair   more black than ashbuds in the front of march   and juliet answerd laughing go and see   the gardeners daughter trust me after that   you scarce can fail to match his masterpiece    and up we rose and on the spur we went   not wholly in the busy world nor quite   beyond it blooms the garden that i love   news from the humming city comes to it   in sound of funeral or of marriage bells   and sitting muffled in dark leaves you hear   the windy clanging of the minster clock   although between it and the garden lies   a league of grass washd by a slow broad stream   that stirrd with languid pulses of the oar   waves all its lazy lilies and creeps on   bargeladen to three arches of a bridge   crownd with the minstertowers                                    the fields between   are dewyfresh browsed by deepudderd kine   and all about the large lime feathers low   the lime a summer home of murmurous wings 2   in that still place she hoarded in herself   grew seldom seen not less among us lived   her fame from lip to lip who had not heard   of rose the gardeners daughter where was he   so blunt in memory so old at heart   at such a distance from his youth in grief   that having seen forgot the common mouth   so gross to express delight in praise of her   grew oratory such a lord is love   and beauty such a mistress of the world   and if i said that fancy led by love   would play with flying forms and images   yet this is also true that long before   i lookd upon her when i heard her name   my heart was like a prophet to my heart   and told me i should love a crowd of hopes   that sought to sow themselves like winged seeds   born out of everything i heard and saw   flutterd about my senses and my soul   and vague desires like fitful blasts of balm   to one that travels quickly made the air   of life delicious and all kinds of thought   that verged upon them sweeter than the dream   dreamd by a happy man when the dark east   unseen is brightening to his bridal morn   and sure this orbit of the memory folds   for ever in itself the day we went   to see her all the land in flowery squares   beneath a broad and equalblowing wind   smelt of the coming summer as one large cloud 3   drew downward but all else of heaven was pure   up to the sun and may from verge to verge   and may with me from head to heel and now   as tho twere yesterday as tho it were   the hour just flown that morn with all its sound   for those old mays had thrice the life of these   rings in mine ears the steer forgot to graze   and where the hedgerow cuts the pathway stood   leaning his horns into the neighbour field   and lowing to his fellows from the woods   came voices of the wellcontented doves   the lark could scarce get out his notes for joy   but shook his song together as he neard   his happy home the ground to left and right   the cuckoo told his name to all the hills   the mellow ouzel fluted in the elm   the redcap 4 whistled 5 and the nightingale   sang loud as tho he were the bird of day   and eustace turnd and smiling said to me   hear how the bushes echo by my life   these birds have joyful thoughts think you they sing   like poets from the vanity of song   or have they any sense of why they sing   and would they praise the heavens for what they have   and i made answer were there nothing else   for which to praise the heavens but only love   that only love were cause enough for praise   lightly he laughd as one that read my thought   and on we went but ere an hour had passd   we reachd a meadow slanting to the north   down which a wellworn pathway courted us   to one green wicket in a privet hedge   this yielding gave into a grassy walk   thro crowded lilacambush trimly pruned   and one warm gust fullfed with perfume blew   beyond us as we enterd in the cool   the garden stretches southward in the midst   a cedar spread his darkgreen layers of shade   the gardenglasses shone and momently   the twinkling laurel scatterd silver lights   eustace i said this wonder keeps the house   he nodded but a moment afterwards   he cried look look before he ceased i turnd   and ere a star can wink beheld her there   for up the porch there grew an eastern rose   that flowering high the last nights gale had caught   and blown across the walk one arm aloft   gownd in pure white that fitted to the shape   holding the bush to fix it back she stood   a single stream of all her soft brown hair   pourd on one side the shadow of the flowers   stole all the golden gloss and wavering   lovingly lower trembled on her waist   ah happy shadeand still went wavering down   but ere it touchd a foot that might have danced   the greensward into greener circles dipt   and mixd with shadows of the common ground   but the full day dwelt on her brows and sunnd   her violet eyes and all her hebebloom   and doubled his own warmth against her lips   and on the bounteous wave of such a breast   as never pencil drew half light half shade   she stood a sight to make an old man young   so rapt we neard the house but she a rose   in roses mingled with her fragrant toil   nor heard us come nor from her tendance turnd   into the world without till close at hand   and almost ere i knew mine own intent   this murmur broke the stillness of that air   which brooded round about her ah one rose   one rose but one by those fair fingers culld   were worth a hundred kisses pressd on lips   less exquisite than thine she lookd but all   suffused with blushesneither selfpossessd   nor startled but betwixt this mood and that   divided in a graceful quietpaused   and dropt the branch she held and turning wound   her looser hair in braid and stirrd her lips   for some sweet answer tho no answer came   nor yet refused the rose but granted it   and moved away and left me statuelike   in act to render thanks i that whole day   saw her no more altho i lingerd there   till every daisy slept and loves white star   beamd thro the thickend cedar in the dusk   so home we went and all the livelong way   with solemn gibe did eustace banter me   now said he will you climb the top of art   you cannot fail but work in hues to dim   the titianic flora will you match   my juliet you not youthe master   love a more ideal artist he than all    so home i went but could not sleep for joy   reading her perfect features in the gloom   kissing the rose she gave me oer and oer   and shaping faithful record of the glance   that graced the givingsuch a noise of life   swarmd in the golden present such a voice   calld to me from the years to come and such   a length of bright horizon rimmd the dark   and all that night i heard the watchmen peal   the sliding season all that night i heard   the heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours   the drowsy hours dispensers of all good   oer the mute city stole with folded wings   distilling odours on me as they went   to greet their fairer sisters of the east    love at first sight firstborn and heir to all   made this night thus henceforward squall nor storm   could keep me from that eden where she dwelt   light pretexts drew me sometimes a   dutch love for tulips then for roses moss or musk   to grace my cityrooms or fruits and cream   served in the weeping elm and more and more   a word could bring the colour to my cheek   a thought would fill my eyes with happy dew   love trebled life within me and with each   the year increased the daughters of the year   one after one thro that still garden passd   each garlanded with her peculiar flower   danced into light and died into the shade   and each in passing touchd with some new grace   or seemd to touch her so that day by day   like one that never can be wholly known 6   her beauty grew till autumn brought an hour   for eustace when i heard his deep i will   breathed like the covenant of a god to hold   from thence thro all the worlds but i rose up   full of his bliss and following her dark eyes   felt earth as air beneath me 7 till i reachd   the wicketgate and found her standing there   there sat we down upon a garden mound   two mutually enfolded love the third   between us in the circle of his arms   enwound us both and over many a range   of waning lime the gray cathedral towers   across a hazy glimmer of the west   reveald their shining windows from them clashd   the bells we listend with the time we playd   we spoke of other things we coursed about   the subject most at heart more near and near   like doves about a dovecote wheeling round   the central wish until we settled there 8   then in that time and place i spoke to her   requiring tho i knew it was mine own   yet for the pleasure that i took to hear   requiring at her hand the greatest gift   a womans heart the heart of her i loved   and in that time and place she answerd me   and in the compass of three little words   more musical than ever came in one   the silver fragments of a broken voice   made me most happy faltering 9 i am thine   shall i cease here is this enough to say   that my desire like all strongest hopes   by its own energy fulfilled itself   merged in completion would you learn at full   how passion rose thro circumstantial grades   beyond all grades developd and indeed   i had not staid so long to tell you all   but while i mused came memory with sad eyes   holding the folded annals of my youth   and while i mused love with knit brows went by   and with a flying finger swept my lips   and spake be wise not easily forgiven   are those who setting wide the doors that bar   the secret bridal chambers of the heart   let in the day here then my words have end   yet might i tell of meetings of farewells   of that which came between more sweet than each   in whispers like the whispers of the leaves   that tremble round a nightingalein sighs   which perfect joy perplexd for utterance   stole from her 10 sister sorrow might i not tell   of difference reconcilement pledges given   and vows where there was never need of vows   and kisses where the heart on one wild leap   hung tranced from all pulsation as above   the heavens between their fairy fleeces pale   sowd all their mystic gulfs with fleeting stars   or while the balmy glooming crescentlit   spread the light haze along the rivershores   and in the hollows or as once we met   unheedful tho beneath a whispering rain   night slid down one long stream of sighing wind   and in her bosom bore the baby sleep   but this whole hour your eyes have been intent   on that veild pictureveild for what it holds   may not be dwelt on by the common day   this prelude has prepared thee raise thy soul   make thine heart ready with thine eyes the time   is come to raise the veil

footnote 9 18421850 lisping  footnote 10 in privately printed volume 1842 his       dora  first published in 1842  this poem had been written as early as 1835 when it was read to fitzgerald and spedding life i 182 no alterations were made in the text after 1853 the story in this poem was taken even to the minutest details from a prosestory of miss mitfords namely the tale of dora creswell our village vol in 24253 the only alterations being in the names farmer cresswell dora creswell walter cresswell and mary hay becoming respectively allan dora william and mary morrison how carefully the poet has preserved the picturesque touches of the original may be seen by comparing the following two passages      and dora took the child and went her way     across the wheat and sat upon a mound     that was unsown where many poppies grew          she rose and took     the child once more and sat upon the mound     and made a little wreath of all the flowers     that grew about and tied it round his hat      a beautiful child lay on the ground at some distance whilst a     young girl resting from the labour of reaping was twisting a     rustic wreath of enamelled cornflowers brilliant poppies  round     its hat  the style is evidently modelled closely on that of the odyssey     with farmer allan at the farm abode   william and dora william was his son   and she his niece he often lookd at them   and often thought ill make them man and wife   now dora felt her uncles will in all   and yearnd towards william but the youth because   he had been always with her in the house   thought not of dora then there came a day   when allan calld his son and said   my son i married late but i would wish to see   my grandchild on my knees before i die   and i have set my heart upon a match   now therefore look to dora she is well   to look to thrifty too beyond her age   she is my brothers daughter he and i   had once hard words and parted and he died   in foreign lands but for his sake i bred   his daughter dora take her for your wife   for i have wishd this marriage night and day   for many years but william answerd short   i cannot marry dora by my life   i will not marry dora then the old man   was wroth and doubled up his hands and said   you will not boy you dare to answer thus   but in my time a fathers word was law   and so it shall be now for me look to it   consider william take a month to think   and let me have an answer to my wish   or by the lord that made me you shall pack   and never more darken my doors again   but william answerd madly bit his lips   and broke away 1 the more he lookd at her   the less he liked her and his ways were harsh   but dora bore them meekly then before   the month was out he left his fathers house   and hired himself to work within the fields   and half in love half spite he wood and wed   a labourers daughter mary morrison    then when the bells were ringing   allan calld his niece and said my girl i love you well   but if you speak with him that was my son   or change a word with her he calls his wife   my home is none of yours my will is law   and dora promised being meek she thought   it cannot be my uncles mind will change    and days went on and there was born a boy   to william then distresses came on him   and day by day he passd his fathers gate   heartbroken and his father helped him not   but dora stored what little she could save   and sent it them by stealth nor did they know   who sent it till at last a fever seized   on william and in harvest time he died    then dora went to mary mary sat   and lookd with tears upon her boy and thought   hard things of dora dora came and said   i have obeyd my uncle until now   and i have sinnd for it was all thro me   this evil came on william at the first   but mary for the sake of him thats gone   and for your sake the woman that he chose   and for this orphan i am come to you   you know there has not been for these five years   so full a harvest let me take the boy   and i will set him in my uncles eye   among the wheat that when his heart is glad   of the full harvest he may see the boy   and bless him for the sake of him thats gone   and dora took the child and went her way   across the wheat and sat upon a mound   that was unsown where many poppies grew   far off the farmer came into the field   and spied her not for none of all his men   dare tell him dora waited with the child   and dora would have risen and gone to him   but her heart faild her and the reapers reapd   and the sun fell and all the land was dark   but when the morrow came she rose and took   the child once more and sat upon the mound   and made a little wreath of all the flowers   that grew about and tied it round his hat   to make him pleasing in her uncles eye   then when the farmer passed into the field   he spied her and he left his men at work   and came and said where were you yesterday   whose child is that what are you doing here   so dora cast her eyes upon the ground   and answerd softly this is williams child   and did i not said allan did i not   forbid you dora dora said again   do with me as you will but take the child   and bless him for the sake of him thats gone   and allan said i see it is a trick   got up betwixt you and the woman there   i must be taught my duty and by you   you knew my word was law and yet you dared   to slight it wellfor i will take the boy   but go you hence and never see me more   so saying he took the boy that cried aloud   and struggled hard the wreath of flowers fell   at doras feet she bowd upon her hands   and the boys cry came to her from the field   more and more distant she bowd down her head   remembering the day when first she came   and all the things that had been she bowd down   and wept in secret and the reapers reapd   and the sun fell and all the land was dark   then dora went to marys house and stood   upon the threshold mary saw the boy   was not with dora she broke out in praise   to god that helpd her in her widowhood   and dora said my uncle took the boy   but mary let me live and work with you   he says that he will never see me more   then answerd mary this shall never be   that thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself   and now i think he shall not have the boy   for he will teach him hardness and to slight   his mother therefore thou and i will go   and i will have my boy and bring him home   and i will beg of him to take thee back   but if he will not take thee back again   then thou and i will live within one house   and work for williams child until he grows   of age to help us so the women kissd   each other and set out and reachd the farm   the door was off the latch they peepd and saw   the boy set up betwixt his grandsires knees   who thrust him in the hollows of his arm   and clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks   like one that loved him and the lad stretchd out   and babbled for the golden seal that hung   from allans watch and sparkled by the fire   then they came in but when the boy beheld   his mother he cried out to come to her   and allan set him down and mary said   o fatherif you let me call you so   i never came abegging for myself   or william or this child but now i come   for dora take her back she loves you well   o sir when william died he died at peace   with all men for i askd him and he said   he could not ever rue his marrying me   i have been a patient wife but sir he said   that he was wrong to cross his father thus   god bless him he said and may he never know   the troubles i have gone thro then he turnd   his face and passdunhappy that i am   but now sir let me have my boy for you   will make him hard and he will learn to slight   his fathers memory and take dora back   and let all this be as it was before   so mary said and dora hid her face   by mary there was silence in the room   and all at once the old man burst in sobs   i have been to blameto blame i have killd my son   i have killd himbut i loved himmy dear son   may god forgive mei have been to blame   kiss me my children  then they clung about   the old mans neck and kissd him many times   and all the man was broken with remorse   and all his love came back a hundredfold   and for three hours he sobbd oer williams child   thinking of william so those four abode   within one house together and as years   went forward mary took another mate   but dora lived unmarried till her death   footnote 1 in 1842 thus    look tot   consider take a month to think and give   an answer to my wish or by the lord   that made me you shall pack and nevermore   darken my doors again and william heard   and answered something madly bit his lips   and broke away  all editions previous to 1853 have    look tot        audley court  first published in 1842  only four alterations were made in the text after 1842 all of which are duly noted tennyson told his son that the poem was partially suggested by abbey park at torquay where it was written and that the last lines described the scene from the hill looking over the bay he saw he said a star of phosphorescence made by the buoy appearing and disappearing in the dark sea but it is curious that the line describing that was not inserted till long after the poem had been published the poem though a trifle is a triumph of felicitous description and expression whether we regard the pie or the moonlit bay     the bull the fleece are crammd and not a room   for love or money let us picnic there   at audley court i spoke while audley feast   hummd like a hive all round the narrow quay   to francis with a basket on his arm   to francis just alighted from the boat   and breathing of the sea with all my heart   said francis then we shoulderd thro 1 the swarm   and rounded by the stillness of the beach   to where the bay runs up its latest horn   we left the dying ebb that faintly lippd   the flat red granite so by many a sweep   of meadow smooth from aftermath we reachd   the griffinguarded gates and passd thro all   the pillard dusk 2 of sounding sycamores   and crossd the garden to the gardeners lodge   with all its casements bedded and its walls   and chimneys muffled in the leafy vine   there on a slope of orchard francis laid   a damask napkin wrought with horse and hound   brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home   and halfcutdown a pasty costlymade   where quail and pigeon lark and leveret lay   like fossils of the rock with golden yolks 3   imbedded and injellied last with these   a flask of cider from his fathers vats   prime which i knew and so we sat and eat   and talkd old matters over who was dead   who married who was like to be and how   the races went and who would rent the hall   then touchd upon the game how scarce it was   this season glancing thence discussd the farm   the fourfield system and the price of grain 4   and struck upon the cornlaws where we split   and came again together on the king   with heated faces till he laughd aloud   and while the blackbird on the pippin hung   to hear him clapt his hand in mine and sang   oh who would fight and march and countermarch   be shot for sixpence in a battlefield   and shovelld up into a 5 bloody trench   where no one knows but let me live my life   oh who would cast and balance at a desk   perchd like a crow upon a threeleggd stool   till all his juice is dried and all his joints   are full of chalk but let me live my life   whod serve the state for if i carved my name   upon the cliffs that guard my native land   i might as well have traced it in the sands   the sea wastes all but let me live my life   oh who would love i wooed a woman once   but she was sharper than an eastern wind   and all my heart turnd from her as a thorn   turns from the sea but let me live my life   he sang his song and i replied with mine   i found it in a volume all of songs   knockd down to me when old sir roberts pride   his booksthe more the pity so i said   came to the hammer here in marchand this   i set the words and added names i knew   sleep ellen aubrey sleep and dream of me   sleep ellen folded in thy

a rolling stone of here and everywhere 6   did what i would but ere the night we rose   and saunterd home beneath a moon that just   in crescent dimly raind about the leaf   twilights of airy silver

drop in the cup of gall          i once was near him when his bailiff brought          a chartist pike you should have seen him wince          as from a venomous thing he thought himself          a mark for all and shudderd lest a cry          should break his sleep by night and his nice eyes          should see the raw mechanics bloody thumbs          sweat on his blazond chairs but sir you

wallowing in sun and mud          by night we draggd her to the college tower          from her warm bed and up the corkscrew stair          with hand and rope we haled the groaning sow          and on the leads we kept her till she piggd          large range of prospect had the mother sow          and but for daily loss of one she loved          as one by one we took thembut for this          as never sow was higher in this world          might have been happy but what lot is pure          we took them all till she was left alone          upon her tower the niobe of swine          and so returnd unfarrowed to her sty  john  they found you out  james not they  john  wellafter allwhat know we of the secret of a man          his nerves were wrong what ails us who are sound          that

which has its variants mr alfred nutt tells me in almost every country in europe the lincolnshire version of it is given in miss peacocks ms collection of lincolnshire folklore of which she has most kindly sent me a copy and it runs thusthere is a house in east halton which is haunted by a hobthrush some years ago it is said a family who had lived in the house for more than a hundred years were much annoyed by it and determined to quit the dwelling they had placed their goods on a waggon and were just on the point of starting when a neighbour asked the farmer whether he was leaving on this the hobthrush put his head out of the splashchurn which was amongst the household stuff and said ay were flitting whereupon the farmer decided to give up the attempt to escape from it and remain where he was the same story is told of a cluricaune in crokers fairy legends and traditions in the south of ireland see the haunted cellar in p 81 of the edition of 1862 and as tennyson has elsewhere in guinevere borrowed a passage from the same story see illustrations of tennyson p 152 it is probable that that was the source of the story here though there the cluricaune uses the expression here we

poem first appeared in the seventh edition of the poems 1851 it was written at llanberis several alterations were made in the eighth edition of 1853 since then none with the exception of breath for breaths in line 66     o me my pleasant rambles by the lake   my sweet wild fresh threequarters of a year   my one oasis in the dust and drouth   of city life i was a sketcher then   see here my doing curves of mountain bridge   boat island ruins of a castle built   when men knew how to build upon a rock   with turrets lichengilded like a rock   and here newcomers in an ancient hold   newcomers from the mersey millionaires   here lived the hillsa tudorchimnied bulk   of mellow brickwork on an isle of bowers   o me my pleasant rambles by the lake   with edwin morris and with edward bull   the curate he was fatter than his cure    but edwin morris he that knew the names   longlearned names of agaric moss and fern 1   who forged a thousand theories of the rocks   who taught me how to skate to row to swim   who read me rhymes elaborately good   his owni calld him crichton for he seemd   allperfect finishd to the finger nail2   and once i askd him of his early life   and his first passion and he answerd me   and well his words became him was he not   a fullcelld honeycomb of eloquence   stored from all flowers poetlike he spoke    my love for nature is as old as i   but thirty moons one honeymoon to that   and three rich sennights more my love for her   my love for nature and my love for her   of different ages like twinsisters grew 3   twinsisters differently beautiful   to some full music rose and sank the sun   and some full music seemd to move and change   with all the varied changes of the dark   and either twilight and the day between   for daily hope fulfilld to rise again   revolving toward fulfilment made it sweet   to walk to sit to sleep to wake to breathe 4    or this or something like to this he spoke   then said the fatfaced curate edward bull   i take it god made the woman for the man   and for the good and increase of the world   a pretty face is well and this is well   to have a dame indoors that trims us up   and keeps us tight but these unreal ways   seem but the theme of writers and indeed   worn threadbare man is made of solid stuff   i say god made the woman for the man   and for the good and increase of the world    parson said i you pitch the pipe too low   but i have sudden touches and can run   my faith beyond my practice into his   tho if in dancing after letty hill   i do not hear the bells upon my cap   i scarce hear 5 other music yet say on   what should one give to light on such a dream   i askd him halfsardonically   give give all thou art he answerd and a light   of laughter dimpled in his swarthy cheek   i would have hid her needle in my heart   to save her little finger from a scratch   no deeper than the skin my ears could hear   her lightest breaths her least remark was worth   the experience of the wise i went and came   her voice fled always thro the summer land   i spoke her name alone thricehappy days   the flower of each those moments when we met   the crown of all we met to part no more    were not his words delicious i a beast   to take them as i did but something jarrd   whether he spoke too largely that there seemd   a touch of something false some selfconceit   or oversmoothness howsoeer it was   he scarcely hit my humour and i said    friend edwin do not think yourself alone   of all men happy shall not love to me   as in the latin song i learnt at school   sneeze out a full godblessyou right and left 6   but you can talk yours is a kindly vein   i have i thinkheaven knowsas much within   have or should have but for a thought or two   that like a purple beech 7 among the greens   looks out of place tis from no want in her   it is my shyness or my selfdistrust   or something of a wayward modern mind   dissecting passion time will set me right    so spoke i knowing not the things that were   then said the fatfaced curate edward bull   god made the woman for the use of man   and for the good and increase of the world   and i and edwin laughd and now we paused   about the windings of the marge to hear   the soft wind blowing over meadowy holms   and alders gardenisles 8 and now we left   the clerk behind us i and he and ran   by ripply shallows of the lisping lake

left the place etc     st simeon stylites  first published in 1842 reprinted in all the subsequent editions of the poems but with no alterations in the text except that in eighth line from the end my was substituted for mine in 1846 tennyson informed a friend that it was not from the acta sanctorum but from hones everyday book vol i pp 3536 that he got the material for this poem and a comparison with the narrative in hone and the poem seems to show that this was the case  it is not easy to identify the st simeon stylites of hones narrative and tennysons poem whether he is to be identified with st simeon the elder of whom there are three memoirs given in the acta sanctorum tom i 5th january 261286 or with st simeon stylites junior of whom there is an elaborate biography in greek by nicephorus printed with a latin translation and notes in the acta sanctorum tom v 24th may 298401 it seems clear that whoever compiled the account popularised by hone had read both and amalgamated them the main lines in the story of both saints are exactly the same both stood on columns both tortured themselves in the same ways both wrought miracles and both died at their posts of penance st simeon the elder was born at sisan in syria about ad 390 and was buried at antioch in ad 459 or 460 the simeon the younger was born at antioch a d 521 and died in ad 592 his life which is of singular interest is much more elaborately related  this poem is not simply a dramatic study it bears very directly on tennysons philosophy of life in these early poems he has given us four studies in the morbid anatomy of character the palace of art which illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and intellectual enjoyment of self the vision of sin which illustrates the effects of similar indulgence in the grosser pleasures of the senses the two voices which illustrates the mischief of despondent selfabsorption while the present poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an opposite extreme asceticism affected for the mere gratification of personal vanity     altho i be the basest of mankind   from scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin   unfit for earth unfit for heaven scarce meet   for troops of devils mad with blasphemy   i will not cease to grasp the hope i hold   of saintdom and to clamour morn and sob   battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer   have mercy lord and take away my sin   let this avail just dreadful mighty god   this not be all in vain that thrice ten years   thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs   in hungers and in thirsts fevers and cold   in coughs aches stitches ulcerous throes and cramps   a sign betwixt the meadow and the cloud   patient on this tall pillar i have borne   rain wind frost heat hail damp and sleet and snow   and i had hoped that ere this period closed   thou wouldst have caught me up into thy rest   denying not these weatherbeaten limbs   the meed of saints the white robe and the palm   o take the meaning lord i do not breathe   not whisper any murmur of complaint   pain heapd tenhundredfold to this were still   less burthen by tenhundredfold to bear   than were those leadlike tons of sin that crushd   my spirit flat before thee o lord lord   thou knowest i bore this better at the first   for i was strong and hale of body then   and tho my teeth which now are dropt away   would chatter with the cold and all my beard   was taggd with icy fringes in the moon   i drownd the whoopings of the owl with sound   of pious hymns and psalms and sometimes saw   an angel stand and watch me as i sang   now am i feeble grown my end draws nigh   i hope my end draws nigh half deaf i am   so that i scarce can hear the people hum   about the columns base and almost blind   and scarce can recognise the fields i know   and both my thighs are rotted with the dew   yet cease i not to clamour and to cry   while my stiff spine can hold my weary head   till all my limbs drop piecemeal from the stone   have mercy mercy take away my sin   o jesus if thou wilt not save my soul   who may be saved who is it may be saved   who may be made a saint if i fail here   show me the man hath suffered more than i   for did not all thy martyrs die one death   for either they were stoned or crucified   or burnd in fire or boild in oil or sawn   in twain beneath the ribs but i die here   today and whole years long a life of death   bear witness if i could have found a way   and heedfully i sifted all my thought   more slowlypainful to subdue this home   of sin my flesh which i despise and hate   i had not stinted practice o my god   for not alone this pillarpunishment 1   not this alone i bore but while i lived   in the white convent down the valley there   for many weeks about my loins i wore   the rope that haled the buckets from the well   twisted as tight as i could knot the noose   and spake not of it to a single soul   until the ulcer eating thro my skin   betrayd my secret penance so that all   my brethren marvelld greatly more than this   i bore whereof o god thou knowest all2   three winters that my soul might grow to thee   i lived up there on yonder mountain side   my right leg chaind into the crag i lay   pent in a roofless close of ragged stones   inswathed sometimes in wandering mist and twice   blackd with thy branding thunder and sometimes   sucking the damps for drink and eating not   except the spare chancegift of those that came   to touch my body and be heald and live   and they say then that i workd miracles   whereof my fame is loud amongst mankind   cured lameness palsies cancers thou o god   knowest alone whether this was or no   have mercy mercy cover all my sin    then that i might be more alone with thee 3   three years i lived upon a pillar high   six cubits and three years on one of twelve   and twice three years i crouchd on one that rose   twenty by measure last of all i grew   twice ten long weary weary years to this   that numbers forty cubits from the soil   i think that i have borne as much as this   or else i dreamand for so long a time   if i may measure time by yon slow light   and this high dial which my sorrow crowns   so mucheven so and yet i know not well   for that the evil ones comes here and say   fall down o simeon thou hast sufferd long   for ages and for ages then they prate   of penances i cannot have gone thro   perplexing me with lies and oft i fall   maybe for months in such blind lethargies   that heaven and earth and time are choked but yet   bethink thee lord while thou and all the saints   enjoy themselves in heaven and men on earth   house in the shade of comfortable roofs   sit with their wives by fires eat wholesome food   and wear warm clothes and even beasts have stalls   i tween the spring and downfall of the light   bow down one thousand and two hundred times   to christ the virgin mother and the saints   or in the night after a little sleep   i wake the chill stars sparkle i am wet   with drenching dews or stiff with crackling frost   i wear an undressd goatskin on my back   a grazing iron collar grinds my neck   and in my weak lean arms i lift the cross   and strive and wrestle with thee till i die   o mercy mercy wash away my sin   o lord thou knowest what a man i am   a sinful man conceived and born in sin   tis their own doing this is none of mine   lay it not to

the saint  footnote 7 tennyson has given a very poor substitute for the beautifully pathetic account given of the death of st simeon in acta i 168 and again in the ninth chapter of the second life ibid 273 but this is to be explained perhaps by the moral purpose of the poem        the talking oak  first published in 1842 and republished in all subsequent editions with only two slight alterations in line 113 a mere variant in spelling and in line 185 where in place of the present reading the editions between 1842 and 1848 read for ah the dryaddays were brief  tennyson told mr aubrey de vere that the poem was an experiment meant to test the degree in which it is in the power of poetry to humanise external nature tennyson might have remembered that ovid had made the same experiment nearly two thousand years ago while goethe had immediately anticipated him in his charming der junggesett und der mühlbach there was certainly no novelty in such an attempt the poem is in parts charmingly written but the oak is certainly garrulously given and comes perilously near to tediousness     once more the gate behind me falls   once more before my face   i see the moulderd abbeywalls   that stand within the chace    beyond the lodge the city lies   beneath its drift of smoke   and ah with what delighted eyes   i turn to yonder oak    for when my passion first began   ere that which in me burnd   the love that makes me thrice a man   could hope itself returnd    to yonder oak within the field   i spoke without restraint   and with a larger faith appeald   than papist unto saint    for oft i talkd with him apart   and told him of my choice   until he plagiarised a heart   and answerd with a voice    tho what he whisperd under heaven   none else could understand   i found him garrulously given   a babbler in the land    but since i heard him make reply   is many a weary hour   twere well to question him and try   if yet he keeps the power    hail

and turnd the cowls adrift    and i have seen some score of those   fresh faces that would thrive   when his manminded offset rose   to chase the deer at five    and all that from the town would stroll   till that wild wind made work   in which the gloomy brewers soul   went by me like a stork    the slight sheslips of loyal blood   and others passing praise   straitlaced but all too full in

discontent    she left the novel halfuncut   upon the rosewood shelf   she left the new piano shut   she could not please herself    then ran she gamesome as the colt   and livelier than a lark   she sent her voice thro all the holt   before her and the park    a light wind chased her on the wing   and in the chase grew wild   as close as might be would he cling   about the darling child    but light as any wind that blows   so fleetly did she stir   the flower she touchd on dipt and rose   and turnd to look at her    and here she came and round me playd   and sang to me the whole   of those three stanzas that you made   about my giant bole    and in a fit of frolic mirth   she strove to span my waist   alas i was so broad of girth   i could not be embraced    i wishd myself the fair young beech   that here beside me stands   that round me clasping each in each   she might have lockd her hands    yet seemd the pressure thrice as sweet   as woodbines fragile hold   or when i feel about my feet   the berried briony fold    o muffle round thy knees with fern   and shadow sumnerchace   long may thy topmost branch discern   the roofs of sumnerplace    but tell me did she read the name   i carved with many vows   when last with throbbing heart i came   to rest beneath thy boughs    o yes she wanderd round and round   these knotted knees of mine   and found and kissd the name she found   and sweetly murmurd thine    a teardrop trembled from its source   and down my surface crept   my sense of touch is something coarse   but i believe she wept    then flushd her cheek with rosy light   she glanced across the plain   but not a creature was in sight   she kissd me once again    her kisses were so close and kind   that trust me on my word   hard wood i am and wrinkled rind   but yet my sap was stirrd    and even into my inmost ring   a pleasure i discernd   like those blind motions of the spring   that show the year is turnd    thricehappy he that may caress   the

dust    for ah my friend the days were brief 5   whereof the poets talk   when that which breathes within the leaf   could slip its bark and walk    but could i as in times foregone   from spray and branch and stem   have suckd and gatherd into one   the life that spreads in them    she had not found me so remiss   but lightly issuing thro   i would have paid her kiss for kiss   with usury thereto    o flourish high with leafy towers   and overlook the lea   pursue thy loves among the bowers   but leave thou mine to me    o flourish hidden deep in fern   old oak i love thee well   a thousand thanks for what i learn   and what remains to tell    tis little more the day was warm   at last tired out with play   she sank her head upon her arm   and at my feet she lay    her eyelids droppd their silken eaves   i breathed upon her eyes   thro all the summer of my leaves   a welcome mixd with sighs    i took the swarming sound of life   the music from the town   the murmurs of the drum and fife   and lulld them in my own    sometimes i let a sunbeam slip   to light her shaded eye   a second flutterd round her lip   like a golden butterfly    a third would glimmer on her neck   to make the necklace shine   another slid a sunny fleck   from head to ancle fine    then close and dark my arms i spread   and shadowd all her rest   dropt dews upon her golden head   an acorn in her breast    but in a pet she started up   and pluckd it out and drew   my little oakling from the cup   and flung him in the dew    and yet it was a graceful gift   i felt a pang within   as when i see the woodman lift   his axe to slay my kin    i shook him down because he was   the finest on the tree   he lies beside thee on the grass   o kiss him once for me    o kiss him twice and thrice for me

edition of the poems 1846 no alterations were made in it after 1851 the poem had a message for the time at which it was written the country was in a very troubled state the contest between the protectionists and freetraders was at its acutest stage the maynooth endowment and the godless colleges had brought into prominence questions of the gravest moment in religion and education while the corn bill and the coercion bill had inflamed the passions of party politicians almost to madness tennyson his son tells us entered heartily into these questions believing that the remedies for these distempers lay in the spread of education a more catholic spirit in the press a partial adoption of free trade principles and union as far as possible among the different sections of christianity     well you shall have that song which leonard wrote   it was last summer on a tour in wales   old james was with me we that day had been   up snowdon and i wishd for leonard there   and found him in llanberis 1 then we crost   between the lakes and clamberd halfway up   the counterside and that same song of his   he told me for i banterd him and swore   they said he lived shut up within himself

forward to his brother sun   the dark earth follows wheeld in her ellipse   and human things returning on themselves   move onward leading up the golden year   ah tho the times when some new thought can bud   are but as poets seasons when they flower   yet seas that daily gain upon the shore 3   have ebb and flow conditioning their march   and slow and sure comes up the golden year   when wealth no more shall rest in mounded heaps   but smit with freer light shall slowly melt   in many streams to fatten lower lands   and light shall spread and man be liker man   thro all the season of the golden year   shall eagles not be eagles wrens be wrens   if all the world were falcons what of that   the wonder of the eagle were the less   but he not less the eagle happy days   roll onward

life perhaps more simply than anything in in memoriam it is not the ulysses of homer nor was it suggested by the odyssey the germ the spirit and the sentiment of the poem are from the twentysixth canto of dantes inferno where ulysses in the limbo of the deceivers speaks from the flame which swathes him i give a literal version of the passage    neither fondness for my son nor reverence for my aged sire nor the   due love which ought to have gladdened penelope could conquer in me   the ardour which i had to become experienced in the world and in human   vice and worth i put out into the deep open sea with but one ship and   with that small company which had not deserted me i and my   companions were old and tardy when we came to that narrow pass where   hercules assigned his landmarks o brothers i said who through a   hundred thousand dangers have reached the west deny not to this the   brief vigil of your senses that remain experience of the unpeopled   world beyond the

perseverance dear my lord   keeps honour bright to have done is to hang   quite out of fashion like a rusty nail   in monumental mockery   footnote 4 how admirably has tennyson touched off the character of the telemachus of the odyssey  footnote 5 the happy isles the fortunatæ insulæ of the romans and the    greek ai ton makaron naesoi  of the greeks have been identified by geographers as those islands in the atlantic off the west coast of africa some take them to mean the canary islands the madeira group and the azores while they may have included the cape de verde islands as well what seems certain is that these places with their soft delicious climate and lovely scenery gave the poets an idea of a happy abode for departed spirits and so the conception of the elysian fields the loci classici on these abodes are homer odyssey iv 563 seqq    greek alla s es elysion pedion kai peirata gaiaes athanatoi   pempsousin hothi xanthos rhadamanthus tae per rhaeistae biotae pelei

attempt to identify and localise the island of shakespeares tempest         locksley hall  first published in 1842 and no alterations were made in it subsequently to the edition of 1850 except that in the selections published in 1865 in the third stanza the reading was half in ruin for in the distance this poem as tennyson explained was not autobiographic but purely imaginary representing young life its good side its deficiences and its yearnings the poem he added was written in trochaics because the elder hallam told him that the english people liked that metre the hero is a sort of preliminary sketch of the hero in maud the position and character of each being very similar both are cynical and querulous and break out into tirades against their kind and society both have been disappointed in love and both find the same remedy for their afflictions by mixing themselves with action and becoming one with their kind  locksley hall was suggested as tennyson acknowledged by sir william jones translation of the old arabian moâllakât a collection from the works of premahommedan poets see sir william jones works quarto edition vol iv pp 24757 but only one of these poems namely the poem of amriolkais could have immediately influenced him in this the poet supposes himself attended on a journey by a company of friends and they pass near a place where his mistress had lately lived but from which her tribe had then removed he desires them to stop awhile that he may weep over the deserted remains of her tent they comply with his request but exhort him to show more strength of mind and urge two topics of consolation namely that he had before been equally unhappy and that he had enjoyed his full share of pleasures thus by the recollection of his past delights his imagination is kindled and his grief suspended but tennysons chief indebtedness is rather in the oriental colouring given to his poem chiefly in the sentiment and imagery thus in the couplet      many a night i saw the pleiads rising through the mellow shade     glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangld in a silver braid  we are reminded of it was the hour when the pleiads appeared in the firmament like the folds of a silken sash variously decked with gems     comrades leave me here a little while as yet tis early morn   leave me here and when you want me sound upon the bugle horn    tis the

oceanridges roaring into cataracts    many a night from yonder ivied casement ere i went to rest   did i look on great orion sloping slowly to the west    many a night i saw the pleiads rising thro the mellow shade   glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid    here about the beach i wanderd nourishing a youth sublime   with the fairy tales of science and the long result of time    when the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed   when i clung to all the present for the promise that it closed    when i dipt into the future far as human eye could see   saw the

livelier iris changes on the burnishd dove   in the spring a young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love    then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young   and her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung    and i said my cousin amy speak and speak the truth to me   trust me cousin all the current of my being sets to thee    on her pallid cheek and forehead

out of     sight    many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring   and her whisper throngd my pulses with the fulness of the spring    many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships   and our spirits rushd together at the touching of the lips 5    o my cousin shallowhearted o my amy mine no more   o the dreary dreary moorland o the barren barren shore    falser than

from coventry to london after his visit to warwickshire in that year the godiva pageant takes place in that town at the great fair on friday in trinity week earl leofric was the lord of coventry in the reign of edward the confessor and he and his wife godiva founded a magnificent benedictine monastery at coventry the first writer who mentions this legend is matthew of westminster who wrote in 1307 that is some 250 years after leofrics time and what authority he had for it is not known it is certainly not mentioned by the many preceding writers who have left accounts of leofric and godiva see goughs edition of camdens britannia vol ii p 346 and for a full account of the legend see w reader the history and description of coventry show fair with the history of leofric and godiva with

summers back   godiva wife to that grim earl who ruled   in coventry for when he laid a tax   upon his town and all the mothers brought   their children clamouring if we pay we starve   she sought her lord and found him where he strode   about the hall among his dogs alone   his beard a foot before him and his hair   a yard behind she told him of their tears   and prayd him if they pay this tax they starve   whereat he stared replying halfamazed   you would not let your little finger ache   for such as thesebut i would die said she   he laughd and swore by peter and by paul   then fillipd at the diamond in her ear   o ay ay ay you talkalas she said   but prove me what it is i would not do   and from a heart as rough as esaus hand   he answerd ride you naked thro the town   and i repeal it and nodding as in scorn   he parted with great strides among his dogs   so left alone the passions of her mind   as winds from all the compass shift and blow   made war upon each other for an hour   till pity won she sent a herald forth   and bad him cry with sound of trumpet all   the hard condition but that she would loose   the people therefore as they loved her well   from then till noon no foot should pace the street   no eye look down she passing but that all   should keep within door shut and window barrd   then fled she to her inmost bower and there   unclaspd the wedded eagles of her belt   the grim earls gift but ever at a breath   she lingerd looking like a summer moon   halfdipt in cloud anon she shook her head   and showerd the rippled ringlets to her knee   unclad herself in haste adown the stair   stole on and like a creeping sunbeam slid   from pillar unto pillar until she reachd   the gateway there she found her palfrey trapt   in purple blazond with armorial gold   then she rode forth clothed on with chastity   the deep air listend round her as she rode   and all the low wind hardly breathed for fear   the little widemouthd heads upon the spout   had cunning

suicide no alterations were made in the poem after 1842  it adds interest to this poem to know that it is autobiographical it was written soon after the death of arthur hallam when tennysons depression was deepest when i wrote the two voices i was so utterly miserable a burden to myself and to my family that i said is life worth anything it is the historyas spedding put itof the agitations the suggestions and countersuggestions of a mind sunk in hopeless despondency and meditating selfdestruction together with the manner of its recovery to a more healthy condition we have two singularly interesting parallels to it in preceding poetry the one is in the third book of lucretius 8301095 where the arguments for suicide are urged not merely by the poet himself but by arguments placed by him in the mouth of nature herself and urged with such cogency that they are said to have induced one of his editors and translators creech to put an end to his life the other is in spenser in the dialogue between despair and the red cross knight where despair puts the case for selfdestruction and the red cross knight rebuts the arguments faerie queene i ix st xxxviiiliv     a still

dead   the murmur of the fountainhead    which did accomplish their desire   bore and forbore and did not tire   like stephen an unquenched fire    he heeded not reviling tones   nor sold his heart to idle moans   tho cursed and scornd and bruised with stones    but looking upward full of grace   he prayd and from a happy place   gods glory smote him on the face    the sullen answer slid betwixt

pride    will he obey when one commands   or answer should one press his hands   he answers not nor understands    his palms are folded on his breast   there is no other thing expressd   but long disquiet merged in rest    his lips are very mild and meek   tho one should smite him on the cheek   and on the mouth he will not speak    his little daughter whose sweet face   he kissd taking his last embrace   becomes dishonour to her race    his sons grow up that bear his name   some grow to honour some to shame   but he is chill to praise or blame 6    he will not hear the north wind rave   nor moaning household shelter crave   from winter rains that beat his grave    high up the vapours fold and swim   about him broods the twilight dim   the place he knew forgetteth him    if all be

 touchd by his feet the daisy slept    the simple senses crownd his head 8   omega thou art lord they   said we find no motion in the dead    why if man rot in dreamless ease   should that plain fact as taught by these   not make him sure that he shall cease    who forged that other influence   that heat of inward evidence   by which he doubts against the sense    he owns the fatal gift of eyes 9   that read his spirit blindly wise   not simple as a thing that dies    here sits he shaping wings to fly   his heart forebodes a mystery   he names the name eternity    that type of perfect in his mind   in nature can he nowhere find   he sows himself in every wind    he seems to hear a heavenly friend   and thro thick veils to apprehend   a labour working to an end    the end and the beginning vex   his reason many things perplex   with motions checks and counterchecks    he knows a baseness in his blood   at such strange war with something good   he may not do the thing he would    heaven opens inward chasms yawn   vast images in glimmering dawn   half shown are broken and withdrawn    ah sure within him and without   could his dark wisdom find it out   there must be answer to his doubt    but thou canst answer not again   with thine own weapon art thou slain   or thou wilt answer but in vain    the doubt would rest i dare not solve   in the same circle we revolve   assurance only breeds resolve    as when a billow blown against   falls back the voice with which i fenced   a little ceased but recommenced    where wert thou when thy father playd   in his free field and pastime made   a merry boy in sun and shade    a merry boy they called him then   he sat upon the knees of men   in days that never come again    before the little ducts began   to feed thy bones with lime and ran   their course till thou wert also man    who took a wife who reard his race   whose wrinkles gatherd on his face   whose troubles number with his days    a life of nothings nothingworth   from that first nothing ere his birth   to that last nothing under earth    these words i said are like the rest   no certain clearness but at best   a vague suspicion of the breast    but if i grant thou mightst defend   the thesis which thy words intend   that to begin implies to end    yet how should i for certain hold 10   because my memory is so cold   that i first was in human mould    i cannot make this matter plain   but i would shoot howeer in vain   a random arrow from the brain    it may be that no life is found   which only to one engine bound   falls off but cycles always round    as old mythologies relate   some draught of lethe might await   the slipping thro from state to state    as here we find in trances men   forget the dream that happens then   until they fall in trance again    so might we if our state were such   as one before remember much   for those two likes might meet and touch 11    but if i lapsed from nobler place   some legend of a fallen race   alone might hint of my disgrace    some vague emotion of delight   in gazing up an alpine height   some yearning toward the lamps of night    or if thro lower lives i came   tho all experience past became   consolidate in mind and frame    i might forget my weaker lot   for is not our first year forgot   the haunts of memory echo not    and men whose reason long was blind   from cells of madness unconfined 12   oft lose whole years of darker mind    much more if first i floated free   as naked essence must i be   incompetent of memory    for memory dealing but with time   and he with matter could she climb   beyond her own material prime    moreover something is or seems   that touches me with mystic gleams   like glimpses of forgotten dreams    of something felt like something here   of something done i know not where   such as no language may declare    the still voice laughd i talk said he   not with thy dreams   suffice it thee thy pain is a reality    but thou said i hast missd thy mark   who soughtst to wreck my mortal ark   by making all the horizon dark    why not set forth if i should do   this rashness that which might ensue   with this old soul in organs new    whatever crazy sorrow saith   no life that breathes with human breath   has ever truly longd for death    tis life whereof our nerves are scant   oh life not death for which we pant   more life and fuller that i want    i ceased and sat as one forlorn   then said the voice in quiet scorn   behold it is the sabbath morn    and i arose and i released   the casement and the light increased   with freshness in the dawning east    like softend airs that blowing steal   when meres begin to uncongeal   the sweet church bells began to peal    on to gods house the people prest   passing the place where each must rest   each enterd like a welcome guest    one walkd between his wife and child   with measurd footfall firm and mild   and now and then he gravely smiled    the prudent partner of his blood   leand on him faithful gentle good 13   wearing the rose of womanhood    and in their double love secure   the little maiden walkd demure   pacing with downward eyelids pure    these three made unity so sweet   my frozen heart began to beat   remembering its ancient heat    i blest them and they wanderd on   i spoke but answer came there none   the dull and bitter voice was gone    a second voice was at mine ear   a little whisper silverclear   a murmur be of better cheer    as from some blissful neighbourhood   a notice faintly understood   i see the end and know the good    a little hint to solace woe   a hint a whisper breathing low   i may not speak of what i know    like an aeolian harp that wakes   no certain air but overtakes   far thought with music that it makes    such seemd the whisper at my side   what is it thou knowest sweet voice i cried   a hidden hope the voice replied    so heavenlytoned that in that hour   from out my sullen heart a power   broke like the rainbow from the shower    to feel altho no tongue can prove   that every cloud that spreads above   and veileth love itself is love    and forth into the fields i went   and natures living motion lent   the pulse of hope to discontent    i wonderd at the bounteous hours   the slow result of winter showers   you scarce could see the grass for flowers    i wonderd while i paced along   the woods were filld so full with song   there seemd no room for sense of wrong    so variously seemd all things wrought 14   i marvelld how the mind was brought   to anchor by one gloomy thought    and wherefore rather i made choice   to commune with that barren voice   than him that said rejoice rejoice   footnote 1 the insensibility of nature to mans death has been the eloquent theme of many poets

  lady clare  first published 1842 after 1851 no alterations were made  this poem was suggested by miss ferriers powerful novel the inheritance a comparison with the plot of miss ferriers novel will show with what tact and skill tennyson has adapted the tale to his ballad thomas st clair youngest son of the earl of rossville marries a miss sarah black a girl of humble and obscure birth he dies leaving a widow and as is supposed a daughter gertrude who claim the protection of lord rossville as the child is heiress presumptive to the earldom on lord rossvilles death she accordingly becomes countess of rossville she has two lovers both distant connections colonel delmour and edward lyndsay at last it is discovered that she was not the daughter of thomas st clair and her supposed mother but of one marion la motte and jacob leviston and that mrs st clair had adopted her when a baby and passed her off as her own child that she might succeed to the title meanwhile delmour by the death of his elder brother succeeds to the title and estates forfeited by the detected foundling but instead of acting as tennysons lord ronald does he repudiates her and marries a duchess but her other lover lyndsay is true to her and marries her delmour not long afterwards dies without issue and lyndsay succeeds to the title gertrude then becoming after all countess of rossville in details tennyson follows the novel sometimes very closely thus the single rose the poor dress the bitter exclamation about her being a beggar born are from the novel  the 1842 and all editions up to and including 1850

1842 no alteration made in it after 1851 except in the insertion of a couplet afterwards omitted  this remarkable poem may be regarded as a sort of companion poem to the palace of art the one traces the effect of callous indulgence in mere intellectual and aesthetic pleasures the other of profligate indulgence in the grosser forms of sensual enjoyment at first all is ecstasy and intoxication then comes satiety and all that satiety brings in its train cynicism pessimism the drying up of the very springs of life the body chilled jaded and ruined the cup of pleasure drained to the dregs the senses exhausted of their power to enjoy the spirit of its wish to aspire nothing left but loathing craving and rottenness see spedding in edinburgh review for april 1843 the poem concludes by leaving as an answer to the awful question can there be final salvation for the poor wretch a reply undecipherable by man and dawn breaking in angry splendour the best commentary on the poem would be byrons lyric theres not a joy the world can give like that it takes away and don juan biography and daily life are indeed full of comments on the truth of this fine allegory     1    i had a vision when the night was late   a youth came riding toward a palacegate   he rode a horse with wings that would have flown 1   but that his heavy rider kept him down   and from the palace came a child of sin   and took him by the curls and led him in   where sat a company with heated eyes   expecting when a fountain should arise   a sleepy light upon their brows and lips   as when the sun a crescent of eclipse   dreams over lake and lawn and isles and capes   suffused them sitting lying languid shapes   by heaps of gourds and skins of wine and piles of grapes     2    then methought i heard a mellow sound   gathering up from all the lower ground 2   narrowing in to where they sat assembled   low voluptuous music winding trembled   wovn in circles they that heard it sighd   panted hand in hand with faces pale   swung themselves and in low tones replied   till the fountain spouted showering wide   sleet of diamonddrift and pearly hail   then the music touchd the gates and died   rose again from where it seemd to fail   stormd in orbs of song a growing gale   till thronging in and in to where they waited   as twere a hundredthroated nightingale   the strong tempestuous treble throbbd and palpitated   ran into its giddiest whirl of sound   caught the sparkles and in circles   purple gauzes golden hazes liquid mazes   flung the torrent rainbow round   then they started from their places   moved with violence changed in hue   caught each other with wild grimaces   halfinvisible to the view   wheeling with precipitate paces   to the melody till they flew   hair and eyes and limbs and faces   twisted hard in fierce embraces   like to furies like to graces   dashd together in blinding dew   till killd with some luxurious agony   the nervedissolving melody   flutterd headlong from the sky     3    and then i lookd up toward a mountaintract   that girt the region with high cliff and lawn   i saw that every morning far withdrawn   beyond the darkness and the cataract   god made himself an awful rose of dawn 3   unheeded and detaching fold by fold   from those still heights and slowly drawing near   a vapour heavy hueless formless cold   came floating on for many a month and year   unheeded and i thought i would have spoken   and warnd that madman ere it grew too late   but as in dreams i could not mine was broken   when that cold vapour touchd the palacegate   and linkd again i

that of writing them  and on another occasion he said very happily    poetry is like shot silk with many glancing colours every reader   must find his own interpretation according to his ability and   according to his sympathy with the poet  poetry in its essential forms always suggests infinitely more than it expresses and at once inspires and kindles the intelligence which is to comprehend it if

afric from green europe when the sun   had falln below th atlantick and above   the silent heavens were blenchd with faery light   uncertain whether faery light or cloud   flowing southward and the

onset of capricious accident   men clung with yearning hope which would not die   as when in some great city where the walls   shake and the streets with ghastly faces throngd   do utter forth a subterranean voice   among the inner columns far retird   at midnight in the lone acropolis   before the awful genius of the place   kneels the pale priestess in deep faith the while   above her head the weak lamp dips and winks   unto the fearful summoning without   nathless she ever clasps the marble knees   bathes the cold hand with tears and gazeth on   those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith   her phantasy informs them where are ye   thrones of the western wave fair islands green   where are your moonlight halls your cedarn glooms   the blossoming abysses of your hills   your flowering capes and your goldsanded bays   blown round with happy airs of odorous winds   where are the infinite ways which seraphtrod   wound thro your great elysian solitudes   whose lowest depths were as with visible love   filld with divine effulgence circumfusd   flowing between the clear and polishd stems   and ever circling round their emerald cones   in coronals and glories such as gird   the unfading foreheads of the saints in heaven   for nothing visible they say had birth   in that blest ground but it was playd about   with its peculiar glory then i raisd   my voice and cried wide afric doth thy sun   lighten thy hills enfold a city as fair   as those which starrd the night o the elder world   or is the rumour of thy timbuctoo   a dream as frail as those of ancient time   a curve of whitening flashing ebbing light   a rustling of white wings the bright descent   of a young seraph and he stood beside me   there on the ridge and lookd into my face   with his unutterable shining orbs   so that with hasty motion i did veil   my vision with both hands and saw before me   such colourd spots as dance athwart the eyes   of those that gaze upon the noonday sun   girt with a zone of flashing gold beneath   his breast and compassd round about his brow   with triple arch of everchanging bows   and circled with the glory of living light   and alternation of all hues he stood    o child of man why muse you here alone   upon the mountain on the dreams of old   which filld the earth with passing loveliness   which flung strange music on the howling winds   and odours rapt from remote paradise   thy sense is cloggd with dull mortality   thy spirit fetterd with the bond of clay   open thine eye and see i lookd but not   upon his face for it was wonderful   with its exceeding brightness and the light   of the great angel mind which lookd from out   the starry glowing of his restless eyes   i felt my soul grow mighty and my spirit   with supernatural excitation bound   within me and my mental eye grew large   with such a vast circumference of thought   that in my vanity i seemd to stand   upon the outward verge and bound alone   of full beautitude each failing sense   as with a momentary flash of light   grew thrillingly distinct and keen i saw   the smallest grain that dappled the dark earth   the indistinctest atom in deep air   the moons white cities and the opal width   of her small glowing lakes her silver heights   unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud   and the unsounded undescended depth   of her black hollows the clear galaxy   shorn of its hoary lustre wonderful   distinct and vivid with sharp points of light   blaze within blaze an unimagind depth   and harmony of planetgirded suns   and moonencircled planets wheel in wheel   archd the wan sapphire nay the hum of men   or other things talking in unknown tongues   and notes of busy life in distant worlds   beat like a far wave on my anxious ear   a maze of piercing trackless thrilling thoughts   involving and embracing each with each   rapid as fire inextricably linkd   expanding momently with every sight   and sound which struck the palpitating sense   the issue of strong impulse hurried through   the rivn rapt brain as when in some large lake   from pressure of descendant crags which lapse   disjointed crumbling from their parent slope   at slender interval the level calm   is ridgd with restless and increasing spheres   which break upon each other each th effect   of separate impulse but more fleet and strong   than its precursor till the eye in vain   amid the wild unrest of swimming shade   dappled with hollow and alternate rise   of interpenetrated arc would scan   definite round                    i know not if i shape   these things with accurate similitude   from visible objects for but dimly now   less vivid than a halfforgotten dream   the memory of that mental excellence   comes oer me and it may be i entwine   the indecision of my present mind   with its past clearness yet it seems to me   as even then the torrent of quick thought   absorbed me from the nature of itself   with its own fleetness where is he that borne   adown the sloping of an arrowy stream   could link his shallop to the fleeting edge   and muse midway with philosophic calm   upon the wondrous laws which regulate   the fierceness of the bounding element   my thoughts which long had grovelld in the slime   of this dull world like dusky worms which house   beneath unshaken waters but at once   upon some earthawakening day of spring   do pass from gloom to glory and aloft   winnow the purple bearing on both sides   double display of starlit wings which burn   fanlike and fibred with intensest bloom   een so my thoughts ere while so low now felt   unutterable buoyancy and strength   to bear them upward through the trackless fields   of undefind existence far and free    then first within the south methought i saw   a wilderness of spires and chrystal pile   of rampart upon rampart dome on dome   illimitable range of battlement   on battlement and the imperial height   of canopy oercanopied                            behind   in diamond light upsprung the dazzling cones   of pyramids as far surpassing earths   as heaven than earth is fairer each aloft   upon his narrowd eminence bore globes   of wheeling suns or stars or semblances   of either showering circular abyss   of radiance but the glory of the place   stood out a pillard front of burnishd gold   interminably high if gold it were   or metal more ethereal and beneath   two doors of blinding brilliance where no gaze   might rest stood open and the eye could scan   through length of porch and lake and boundless hall   part of a throne of fiery flame where from   the snowy skirting of a garment hung   and glimpse of multitudes of multitudes   that ministerd around itif i saw   these things distinctly for my human brain   staggerd beneath the vision and thick night   came down upon my eyelids and i fell    with ministering hand he raisd me up   then with a mournful and ineffable smile   which but to look on for a moment filld   my eyes with irresistible sweet tears   in accents of majestic melody   like a swoln rivers gushings in still night   mingled with floating music thus he spake    there is no mightier spirit than i to sway   the heart of man and teach him to attain   by shadowing forth the unattainable   and step by step to scale that mighty stair   whose landingplace is wrapt about with clouds   of glory of heaven 1 with earliest light of
