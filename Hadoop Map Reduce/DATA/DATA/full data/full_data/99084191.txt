99084191	a hazard of new fortunes  by william dean howells    bibliographical  the following story was the first fruit of my new york life when i began to live it after my quarter of a century in cambridge and boston ending in 1889 and i used my own transition to the commercial metropolis in framing the experience which was wholly that of my supposititious literary adventurer he was a character whom with his wife i have employed in some six or eight other stories and whom i made as much the hero and heroine of their wedding journey as the slight fable would bear in venturing out of my adoptive new england where i had found myself at home with many imaginary friends i found it natural to ask the company of these familiar acquaintances but their company was not to be had at once for the asking when i began speaking of them as basil and isabel in the fashion of their wedding journey they would not respond with the effect of early middle age which i desired in them they remained wilfully not to say woodenly the young bridal pair of that romance without the promise of novel functioning it was not till i tried addressing them as march and mrs march that they stirred under my hand with fresh impulse and set about the work assigned them as people in something more than their second youth  the scene into which i had invited them to figure filled the largest canvas i had yet allowed myself and though a hazard of new fortunes was not the first story i had written with the printer at my heels it was the first which took its own time to prescribe its own dimensions i had the general design well in mind when i began to write it but as it advanced it compelled into its course incidents interests individualities which i had not known lay near and it specialized and amplified at points which i had not always meant to touch though i should not like to intimate anything mystical in the fact it became to my thinking the most vital of my fictions through my quickened interest in the life about me at a moment of great psychological import we had passed through a period of strong emotioning in the direction of the humaner economics if i may phrase it so the rich seemed not so much to despise the poor the poor did not so hopelessly repine the solution of the riddle of the painful earth through the dreams of henry george through the dreams of edward bellamy through the dreams of all the generous visionaries of the past seemed not impossibly far off that shedding of blood which is for the remission of sins had been symbolized by the bombs and scaffolds of chicago and the hearts of those who felt the wrongs bound up with our rights the slavery implicated in our liberty were thrilling with griefs and hopes hitherto strange to the average american breast opportunely for me there was a great streetcar strike in new york and the story began to find its way to issues nobler and larger than those of the loveaffairs common to fiction i was in my fiftysecond year when i took it up and in the prime such as it was of my powers the scene which i had chosen appealed prodigiously to me and the action passed as nearly without my conscious agency as i ever allow myself to think such things happen  the opening chapters were written in a fine old fashioned apartment house which had once been a family house and in an uppermost room of which i could look from my work across the trees of the little park in stuyvesant square to the towers of st georges church then later in the spring of 1889 the unfinished novel was carried to a country house on the belmont border of cambridge there i must have written very rapidly to have pressed it to conclusion before the summer ended it came indeed so easily from the pen that i had the misgiving which i always have of things which do not cost me great trouble  there is nothing in the book with which i amused myself more than the househunting of the marches when they were placing themselves in new york and if the contemporary reader should turn for instruction to the pages in which their experience is detailed i assure him that he may trust their fidelity and accuracy in the article of new york housing as it was early in the last decade of the last century i mean the housing of people of such moderate means as the marches in my zeal for truth i did not distinguish between reality and actuality in this or other mattersthat is one was as precious to me as the other but the types here portrayed are as true as ever they were though the world in which they were finding their habitat is wonderfully almost incredibly different yet it is not wholly different for a young literary pair now adventuring in new york might easily parallel the experience of the marches with their own if not for so little money many phases of new york housing are better but all are dearer other aspects of the material city have undergone a transformation much more wonderful i find that in my book its population is once modestly spoken of as two millions but now in twenty years it is twice as great and the grandeur as well as grandiosity of its forms is doubly apparent the transitional public that then moped about in mildly tinkling horsecars is now hurried back and forth in clanging trolleys in honking and whirring motors the elevated road which was the last word of speed is undermined by the subway shooting its swift shuttles through the subterranean woof of the citys haste from these feet let the witness infer our whole massive hercules a bulk that sprawls and stretches beyond the rivers through the tunnels piercing their beds and that towers into the skies with innumerable topsa hercules blent of briareus and cerberus but not so bad a monster as it seemed then to threaten becoming  certain hopes of truer and better conditions on which my heart was fixed twenty years ago are not less dear and they are by no means touched with despair though they have not yet found the fulfilment which i would then have prophesied for them events have not wholly played them false events have not halted though they have marched with a slowness that might affect a younger observer as marking time they who were then mindful of the poor have not forgotten them and what is better the poor have not often forgotten themselves in violences such as offered me the material of tragedy and pathos in my story in my quality of artist i could not regret these and i gratefully realize that they offered me the opportunity of a more strenuous action a more impressive catastrophe than i could have achieved without them they tended to give the whole fable dignity and doubtless made for its success as a book as a serial it had crept a sluggish course before a public apparently so unmindful of it that no rumor of its acceptance or rejection reached the writer during the half year of its publication but it rose in book form from that failure and stood upon its feet and went its way to greater favor than any book of his had yet enjoyed i hope that my recognition of the fact will not seem like boasting but that the reader will regard it as a special confidence from the author and will let it go no farther  kittery point maine july 1909     part first  a hazard of new fortunes i  now you think this thing over march and let me know the last of next week said fulkerson he got up from the chair which he had been sitting astride with his face to its back and tilting toward march on its hindlegs and came and rapped upon his table with his thin bamboo stick what you want to do is to get out of the insurance business anyway you acknowledge that yourself you never liked it and now it makes you sick in other words its killing you you aint an insurance man by nature youre a naturalborn literary man and youve been going against the grain now i offer you a chance to go with the grain i dont say youre going to make your everlasting fortune but ill give you a living salary and if the thing succeeds youll share in its success well all share in its success thats the beauty of it i tell you march this is the greatest idea that has been struck sincefulkerson stopped and searched his mind for a fit imagesince the creation of man  he put his leg up over the corner of marchs table and gave himself a sharp cut on the thigh and leaned forward to get the full effect of his words upon his listener  march had his hands clasped together behind his head and he took one of them down long enough to put his inkstand and mucilagebottle out of fulkersons way after many years experiment of a mustache and whiskers he now wore his grizzled beard full but cropped close it gave him a certain grimness corrected by the gentleness of his eyes  some people dont think much of the creation of man nowadays why stop at that why not say since the morning stars sang together  no sir no sir i dont want to claim too much and i draw the line at the creation of man im satisfied with that but if you want to ring the morning stars into the prospectus all right i wont go back on you  but i dont understand why youve set your mind on me march said i havent had any magazine experience you know that and i havent seriously attempted to do anything in literature since i was married i gave up smoking and the muse together i suppose i could still manage a cigar but i dont believe i could  muse worth a cent fulkerson took the thought out of his mouth and put it into his own words i know well i dont want you to i dont care if you never write a line for the thing though you neednt reject anything of yours if it happens to be good on that account and i dont want much experience in my editor rather not have it you told me didnt you that you used to do some newspaper work before you settled down  yes i thought my lines were permanently cast in those places once it was more an accident than anything else that i got into the insurance business i suppose i secretly hoped that if i made my living by something utterly different i could come more freshly to literature proper in my leisure  i see and you found the insurance business too many for you well anyway youve always had a hankering for the inkpots and the fact that you first gave me the idea of this thing shows that youve done more or less thinking about magazines  yesless  well all right now dont you be troubled i know what i want generally speaking and in this particular instance i want you i might get a man of more experience but i should probably get a man of more prejudice and selfconceit along with him and a man with a following of the literary hangerson that are sure to get round an editor sooner or later i want to start fair and ive found out in the syndicate business all the men that are worth having but they know me and they dont know you and thats where we shall have the pull on them they wont be able to work the thing dont you be anxious about the experience ive got experience enough of my own to run a dozen editors what i want is an editor who has taste and youve got it and conscience and youve got it and horse sense and youve got that and i like you because youre a western man and im another i do cotton to a western man when i find him off east here holding his own with the best of em and showing em that hes just as much civilized as they are we both know what it is to have our bright home in the setting sun heigh  i think we western men whove come east are apt to take ourselves a little too objectively and to feel ourselves rather more representative than we need march remarked  fulkerson was delighted youve hit it we do we are  and as for holding my own im not very proud of what ive done in that way its been very little to hold but i know what you mean fulkerson and ive felt the same thing myself it warmed me toward you when we first met i cant help suffusing a little to any man when i hear that he was born on the other side of the alleghanies its perfectly stupid i despise the same thing when i see it in boston people  fulkerson pulled first one of his blond whiskers and then the other and twisted the end of each into a point which he left to untwine itself he fixed march with his little eyes which had a curious innocence in their cunning and tapped the desk immediately in front of him what i like about you is that youre broad in your sympathies the first time i saw you that night on the quebec boat i said to myself theres a man i want to know theres a human being i was a little afraid of mrs march and the children but i felt at home with youthoroughly domesticatedbefore i passed a word with you and when you spoke first and opened up with a joke over that fellows tableful of light literature and indian moccasins and birchbark toy canoes and stereoscopic views i knew that we were brothersspiritual twins i recognized the western style of fun and i thought when you said you were from boston that it was some of the same but i see now that its being a cold fact as far as the last fifteen or twenty years count is just so much gain you know both sections and you can make this thing go from ocean to ocean  we might ring that into the prospectus too march suggested with a smile you might call the thing from sea to sea bytheway what are you going to call it  i havent decided yet thats one of the things i wanted to talk with you about i had thought of the syndicate but it sounds kind of dry and doesnt seem to cover the ground exactly i should like something that would express the cooperative character of the thing but i dont know as i can get it  might call it the mutual  theyd think it was an insurance paper no that wont do but mutual comes pretty near the idea if we could get something like that it would pique curiosity and then if we could get paragraphs afloat explaining that the contributors were to be paid according to the sales it would be a firstrate ad  he bent a wide anxious inquiring smile upon march who suggested lazily you might call it the roundrobin that would express the central idea of irresponsibility as i understand everybody is to share the profits and be exempt from the losses or if im wrong and the reverse is true you might call it the army of martyrs come that sounds attractive fulkerson or what do you think of the fifth wheel that would forestall the criticism that there are too many literary periodicals already or if you want to put forward the idea of complete independence you could call it the free lance or  or the hog on iceeither stand up or fall down you know fulkerson broke in coarsely but well leave the name of the magazine till we get the editor i see the poisons beginning to work in you march and if i had time id leave the result to time but i havent ive got to know inside of the next week to come down to business with you march i shant start this thing unless i can get you to take hold of it  he seemed to expect some acknowledgment and march said well thats very nice of you fulkerson  no sir no sir ive always liked you and wanted you ever since we met that first night i had this thing inchoately in my mind then when i was telling you about the newspaper syndicate businessbeautiful vision of a lot of literary fellows breaking loose from the bondage of publishers and playing it alone  you might call it the lone hand that would be attractive march interrupted the whole west would know what you meant  fulkerson was talking seriously and march was listening seriously but they both broke off and laughed fulkerson got down off the table and made some turns about the room it was growing late the october sun had left the top of the tall windows it was still clear day but it would soon be twilight they had been talking a long time fulkerson came and stood with his little feet wide apart and bent his little lean square face on march see here how much do you get out of this thing here anyway  the insurance business march hesitated a moment and then said with a certain effort of reserve at present about three thousand he looked up at fulkerson with a glance as if he had a mind to enlarge upon the fact and then dropped his eyes without saying more  whether fulkerson had not thought it so much or not he said well ill give you thirtyfive hundred come and your chances in the success  we wont count the chances in the success and i dont believe thirtyfive hundred would go any further in new york than three thousand in boston  but you dont live on three thousand here  no my wife has a little property  well she wont lose the income if you go to new york i suppose you pay ten or twelve hundred a year for your house here you can get plenty of flats in new york for the same money and i understand you can get all sorts of provisions for less than you pay nowthree or four cents on the pound come  this was by no means the first talk they had had about the matter every three or four months during the past two years the syndicate man had dropped in upon march to air the scheme and to get his impressions of it this had happened so often that it had come to be a sort of joke between them but now fulkerson clearly meant business and march had a struggle to maintain himself in a firm poise of refusal  i dare say it wouldntor it needntcost so very much more but i dont want to go to new york or my wife doesnt its the same thing  a good deal samer fulkerson admitted  march did not quite like his candor and he went on with dignity its very natural she shouldnt she has always lived in boston shes attached to the place now if you were going to start the fifth wheel in boston  fulkerson slowly and sadly shook his head but decidedly wouldnt do you might as well say st louis or cincinnati theres only one city that belongs to the whole country and thats new york  yes i know sighed march and boston belongs to the bostonians but they like you to make yourself at home while youre visiting  if youll agree to make phrases like that right along and get them into the roundrobin somehow ill say four thousand said fulkerson you think it over now march you talk it over with mrs march i know you will anyway and i might as well make a virtue of advising you to do it tell her i advised you to do it and you let me know before next saturday what youve decided  march shut down the rolling top of his desk in the corner of the room and walked fulkerson out before him it was so late that the last of the chorewomen who washed down the marble halls and stairs of the great building had wrung out her floorcloth and departed leaving spotless stone and a clean damp smell in the darkening corridors behind her  couldnt offer you such swell quarters in new york march fulkerson said as he went tacktacking down the steps with his small bootheels but ive got my eye on a little house round in west eleventh street that im going to fit up for my bachelors hall in the third story and adapt for the lone hand in the first and second if this thing goes through and i guess well be pretty comfortable its right on the sand stripno malaria of any kind  i dont know that im going to share its salubrity with you yet march sighed in an obvious travail which gave fulkerson hopes  oh yes you are he coaxed now you talk it over with your wife you give her a fair unprejudiced chance at the thing on its merits and im very much mistaken in mrs march if she doesnt tell you to go in and win were bound to win  they stood on the outside steps of the vast edifice beetling like a granite crag above them with the stone groups of an allegory of lifeinsurance foreshortened in the basrelief overhead march absently lifted his eyes to it it was suddenly strange after so many years familiarity and so was the wellknown street in its saturdayevening solitude he asked himself with prophetic homesickness if it were an omen of what was to be but he only said musingly a fortnightly you know that didnt work in england the fortnightly is published once a month now  it works in france fulkerson retorted the revue des deux mondes is still published twice a month i guess we can make it work in americawith illustrations  going to have illustrations  my dear boy what are you giving me do i look like the sort of lunatic who would start a thing in the twilight of the nineteenth century without illustrations come off  ah that complicates it i dont know anything about art marchs look of discouragement confessed the hold the scheme had taken upon him  i dont want you to fulkerson retorted dont you suppose i shall have an art man  and will theythe artistswork at a reduced rate too like the writers with the hopes of a share in the success  of course they will and if i want any particular man for a card ill pay him big money besides but i can get plenty of firstrate sketches on my own terms youll see theyll pour in  look here fulkerson said march youd better call this fortnightly of yours the madness o f the halfmoon or bedlam broke loose wouldnt be bad why do you throw away all your hard earnings on such a crazy venture dont do it the kindness which march had always felt in spite of his wifes first misgivings and reservations for the merry hopeful slangy energetic little creature trembled in his voice they had both formed a friendship for fulkerson during the week they were together in quebec when he was not working the newspapers there he went about with them over the familiar ground they were showing their children and was simply grateful for the chance as well as very entertaining about it all the children liked him too when they got the clew to his intention and found that he was not quite serious in many of the things he said they thought he was great fun they were always glad when their father brought him home on the occasion of fulkersons visits to boston and mrs march though of a charier hospitality welcomed fulkerson with a grateful sense of his admiration for her husband he had a way of treating march with deference as an older and abler man and of qualifying the freedom he used toward every one with an implication that march tolerated it voluntarily which she thought very sweet and even refined  ah now youre talking like a man and a brother said fulkerson why march old man do you suppose id come on here and try to talk you into this thing if i wasnt morally if i wasnt perfectly sure of success there isnt any if or and about it i know my ground every inch and i dont stand alone on it he added with a significance which did not escape march when youve made up your mind i can give you the proof but im not at liberty now to say anything more i tell you its going to be a triumphal march from the word go with coffee and lemonade for the procession along the whole line all youve got to do is to fall in he stretched out his hand to march you let me know as soon as you can  march deferred taking his hand till he could ask where are you going  parker house take the eleven for new york tonight  i thought i might walk your way march looked at his watch but i shouldnt have time goodbye  he now let fulkerson have his hand and they exchanged a cordial pressure fulkerson started away at a quick light pace half a block off he stopped turned round and seeing march still standing where he had left him he called back joyously ive got the name  what  every other week  it isnt bad  tata     ii  all the way up to the south end march mentally prolonged his talk with fulkerson and at his door in nankeen square he closed the parley with a plump refusal to go to new york on any terms his daughter bella was lying in wait for him in the hall and she threw her arms round his neck with the exuberance of her fourteen years and with something of the histrionic intention of her sex he pressed on with her clinging about him to the library and in the glow of his decision against fulkerson kissed his wife where she sat by the study lamp reading the transcript through her first pair of eyeglasses it was agreed in the family that she looked distinguished in them or at any rate cultivated she took them off to give him a glance of question and their son tom looked up from his book for a moment he was in his last year at the high school and was preparing for harvard  i didnt get away from the office till halfpast five march explained to his wifes glance and then i walked i suppose dinners waiting im sorry but i wont do it any more  at table he tried to be gay with bella who babbled at him with a voluble pertness which her brother had often advised her parents to check in her unless they wanted her to be universally despised  papa she shouted at last youre not listening as soon as possible his wife told the children they might be excused then she asked what is it basil  what is what he retorted with a specious brightness that did not avail  what is on your mind  how do you know theres anything  your kissing me so when you came in for one thing  dont i always kiss you when i come in  not now i suppose it isnt necessary any more cela va sans baiser  yes i guess its so we get along without the symbolism now he stopped but she knew that he had not finished  is it about your business have they done anything more  no im still in the dark i dont know whether they mean to supplant me or whether they ever did but i wasnt thinking about that fulkerson has been to see me again  fulkerson she brightened at the name and march smiled too why didnt you bring him to dinner  i wanted to talk with you then you do like him  what has that got to do with it basil  nothing nothing that is he was boring away about that scheme of his again hes got it into definite shape at last  what shape  march outlined it for her and his wife seized its main features with the intuitive sense of affairs which makes women such good businessmen when they will let it  it sounds perfectly crazy she said finally but it maynt be the only thing i didnt like about mr fulkerson was his always wanting to chance things but what have you got to do with it  what have i got to do with it march toyed with the delay the question gave him then he said with a sort of deprecatory laugh it seems that fulkerson has had his eye on me ever since we met that night on the quebec boat i opened up pretty freely to him as you do to a man you never expect to see again and when i found he was in that newspaper syndicate business i told him about my early literary ambitions  you cant say that i ever discouraged them basil his wife put in i should have been willing any time to give up everything for them  well he says that i first suggested this brilliant idea to him perhaps i did i dont remember when he told me about his supplying literature to newspapers for simultaneous publication he says i asked why not apply the principle of cooperation to a magazine and run it in the interest of the contributors and that set him to thinking and he thought out his plan of a periodical which should pay authors and artists a low price outright for their work and give them a chance of the profits in the way of a percentage after all it isnt so very different from the chances an author takes when he publishes a book and fulkerson thinks that the novelty of the thing would pique public curiosity if it didnt arouse public sympathy and the long and short of it is isabel that he wants me to help edit it  to edit it his wife caught her breath and she took a little time to realize the fact while she stared hard at her husband to make sure he was not joking  yes he says he owes it all to me that i invented the ideathe germthe microbe  his wife had now realized the fact at least in a degree that excluded trifling with it that is very honorable of mr fulkerson and if he owes it to you it was the least he could do having recognized her husbands claim to the honor done him she began to kindle with a sense of the honor itself and the value of the opportunity its a very high compliment to you basila very high compliment and you could give up this wretched insurance business that youve always hated so and thats making you so unhappy now that you think theyre going to take it from you give it up and take mr fulkersons offer its a perfect interposition coming just at this time why do it mercy she suddenly arrested herself he wouldnt expect you to get along on the possible profits her face expressed the awfulness of the notion  march smiled reassuringly and waited to give himself the pleasure of the sensation he meant to give her if ill make striking phrases for it and edit it too hell give me four thousand dollars  he leaned back in his chair and stuck his hands deep into his pockets and watched his wifes face luminous with the emotions that flashed through her minddoubt joy anxiety  basil you dont mean it why take it take it instantly oh what a thing to happen oh what luck but you deserve it if you first suggested it what an escape what a triumph over all those hateful insurance people oh basil im afraid hell change his mind you ought to have accepted on the spot you might have known i would approve and you could so easily have taken it back if i didnt telegraph him now run right out with the despatchor we can send tom  in these imperatives of mrs marchs there was always much of the conditional she meant that he should do what she said if it were entirely right and she never meant to be considered as having urged him  and suppose his enterprise went wrong her husband suggested  it wont go wrong hasnt he made a success of his syndicate  he says soyes  very well then it stands to reason that hell succeed in this too he wouldnt undertake it if he didnt know it would succeed he must have capital  it will take a great deal to get such a thing going and even if hes got an angel behind him  she caught at the wordan angel  its what the theatrical people call a financial backer he dropped a hint of something of that kind  of course hes got an angel said his wife promptly adopting the word and even if he hadnt still basil i should be willing to have you risk it the risk isnt so great is it we shouldnt be ruined if it failed altogether with our stocks we have two thousand a year anyway and we could pinch through on that till you got into some other business afterward especially if wed saved something out of your salary while it lasted basil i want you to try it i know it will give you a new lease of life to have a congenial occupation march laughed but his wife persisted im all for your trying it basil indeed i am if its an experiment you can give it up  it can give me up too  oh nonsense i guess theres not much fear of that now i want you to telegraph mr fulkerson so that hell find the despatch waiting for him when he gets to new york ill take the whole responsibility basil and ill risk all the consequences     iii  marchs face had sobered more and more as she followed one hopeful burst with another and now it expressed a positive pain but he forced a smile and said theres a little condition attached where did you suppose it was to be published  why in boston of course where else should it be published  she looked at him for the intention of his question so searchingly that he quite gave up the attempt to be gay about it no he said gravely its to be published in new york  she fell back in her chair in new york she leaned forward over the table toward him as if to make sure that she heard aright and said with all the keen reproach that he could have expected in new york basil oh how could you have let me go on  he had a sufficiently rueful face in owning i oughtnt to have done it but i got started wrong i couldnt help putting the best foot forward at firstor as long as the whole thing was in the air i didnt know that you would take so much to the general enterprise or else i should have mentioned the new york condition at once but of course that puts an end to it  oh of course she assented sadly we couldnt go to new york  no i know that he said and with this a perverse desire to tempt her to the impossibility awoke in him though he was really quite cold about the affair himself now fulkerson thought we could get a nice flat in new york for about what the interest and taxes came to here and provisions are cheaper but i should rather not experiment at my time of life if i could have been caught younger i might have been inured to new york but i dont believe i could stand it now  how i hate to have you talk that way basil you are young enough to try anythinganywhere but you know i dont like new york i dont approve of it its so big and so hideous of course i shouldnt mind that but ive always lived in boston and the children were born and have all their friendships and associations here she added with the helplessness that discredited her good sense and did her injustice i have just got them both into the friday afternoon class at papantis and you know how difficult that is  march could not fail to take advantage of an occasion like this well that alone ought to settle it under the circumstances it would be flying in the face of providence to leave boston the mere fact of a brilliant opening like that offered me on the microbe and the halcyon future which fulkerson promises if well come to new york is as dust in the balance against the advantages of the friday afternoon class  basil she appealed solemnly have i ever interfered with your career  i never had any for you to interfere with my dear  basil havent i always had faith in you and dont you suppose that if i thought it would really be for your advancement i would go to new york or anywhere with you  no my dear i dont he teased if it would be for my salvation yes perhaps but not short of that and i should have to prove by a cloud of witnesses that it would i dont blame you i wasnt born in boston but i understand how you feel and really my dear he added without irony i never seriously thought of asking you to go to new york i was dazzled by fulkersons offer ill own that but his choice of me as editor sapped my confidence in him  i dont like to hear you say that basil she entreated  well of course there were mitigating circumstances i could see that fulkerson meant to keep the whiphand himself and that was reassuring and besides if the reciprocity life should happen not to want my services any longer it wouldnt be quite like giving up a certainty though as a matter of business i let fulkerson get that impression i felt rather sneaking to do it but if the worst comes to the worst i can look about for something to do in boston and anyhow people dont starve on two thousand a year though its convenient to have five the fact is im too old to change so radically if you dont like my saying that then you are isabel and so are the children ive no right to take them from the home weve made and to change the whole course of their lives unless i can assure them of something and i cant assure them of anything boston is big enough for us and its certainly prettier than new york i always feel a little proud of hailing from boston my pleasure in the place mounts the farther i get away from it but i do appreciate it my dear ive no more desire to leave it than you have you may be sure that if you dont want to take the children out of the friday afternoon class i dont want to leave my library here and all the ways ive got set in well keep on very likely the company wont supplant me and if it does and watkins gets the place hell give me a subordinate position of some sort cheer up isabel i have put satan and his angel fulkerson behind me and its all right lets go in to the children  he came round the table to isabel where she sat in a growing distraction and lifted her by the waist from her chair  she sighed deeply shall we tell the children about it  no whats the use now  there wouldnt be any she assented when they entered the family room where the boy and girl sat on either side of the lamp working out the lessons for monday which they had left over from the day before she asked children how would you like to live in new york  bella made haste to get in her word first and give up the friday afternoon class she wailed  tom growled from his book without lifting his eyes i shouldnt want to go to columbia they havent got any dormitories and you have to board round anywhere are you going to new york he now deigned to look up at his father  no tom you and bella have decided me against it your perspective shows the affair in its true proportions i had an offer to go to new york but ive refused it     iv  marchs irony fell harmless from the childrens preoccupation with their own affairs but he knew that his wife felt it and this added to the bitterness which prompted it he blamed her for letting her provincial narrowness prevent his accepting fulkersons offer quite as much as if he had otherwise entirely wished to accept it his world like most worlds had been superficially a disappointment he was no richer than at the beginning though in marrying he had given up some tastes some preferences some aspirations in the hope of indulging them later with larger means and larger leisure his wife had not urged him to do it in fact her pride as she said was in his fitness for the life he had renounced but she had acquiesced and they had been very happy together that is to say they made up their quarrels or ignored them  they often accused each other of being selfish and indifferent but she knew that he would always sacrifice himself for her and the children and he on his part with many gibes and mockeries wholly trusted in her they had grown practically tolerant of each others disagreeable traits and the danger that really threatened them was that they should grow too well satisfied with themselves if not with each other they were not sentimental they were rather matteroffact in their motives but they had both a sort of humorous fondness for sentimentality they liked to play with the romantic from the safe vantageground of their real practicality and to divine the poetry of the commonplace their peculiar point of view separated them from most other people with whom their means of selfcomparison were not so good since their marriage as before then they had travelled and seen much of the world and they had formed tastes which they had not always been able to indulge but of which they felt that the possession reflected distinction on them it enabled them to look down upon those who were without such tastes but they were not illnatured and so they did not look down so much with contempt as with amusement in their unfashionable neighborhood they had the fame of being not exclusive precisely but very much wrapped up in themselves and their children  mrs march was reputed to be very cultivated and mr march even more so among the simpler folk around them their house had some good pictures which her aunt had brought home from europe in more affluent days and it abounded in books on which he spent more than he ought they had beautified it in every way and had unconsciously taken credit to them selves for it they felt with a glow almost of virtue how perfectly it fitted their lives and their childrens and they believed that somehow it expressed their charactersthat it was like them they went out very little she remained shut up in its refinement working the good of her own and he went to his business and hurried back to forget it and dream his dream of intellectual achievement in the flattering atmosphere of her sympathy he could not conceal from himself that his divided life was somewhat like charles lambs and there were times when as he had expressed to fulkerson he believed that its division was favorable to the freshness of his interest in literature it certainly kept it a high privilege a sacred refuge now and then he wrote something and got it printed after long delays and when they met on the st lawrence fulkerson had some of marchs verses in his pocketbook which he had cut out of astray newspaper and carried about for years because they pleased his fancy so much they formed an immediate bond of union between the men when their authorship was traced and owned and this gave a pretty color of romance to their acquaintance but for the most part march was satisfied to read he was proud of reading critically and he kept in the current of literary interests and controversies it all seemed to him and to his wife at secondhand very meritorious he could not help contrasting his life and its inner elegance with that of other men who had no such resources he thought that he was not arrogant about it because he did full justice to the good qualities of those other people he congratulated himself upon the democratic instincts which enabled him to do this and neither he nor his wife supposed that they were selfish persons on the contrary they were very sympathetic there was no good cause that they did not wish well they had a generous scorn of all kinds of narrowheartedness if it had ever come into their way to sacrifice themselves for others they thought they would have done so but they never asked why it had not come in their way they were very gentle and kind even when most elusive and they taught their children to loathe all manner of social cruelty march was of so watchful a conscience in some respects that he denied himself the pensive pleasure of lapsing into the melancholy of unfulfilled aspirations but he did not see that if he had abandoned them it had been for what he held dearer generally he felt as if he had turned from them with a high altruistic aim the practical expression of his life was that it was enough to provide well for his family to have cultivated tastes and to gratify them to the extent of his means to be rather distinguished even in the simplification of his desires he believed and his wife believed that if the time ever came when he really wished to make a sacrifice to the fulfilment of the aspirations so long postponed she would be ready to join with heart and hand  when he went to her room from his library where she left him the whole evening with the children he found her before the glass thoughtfully removing the first dismantling pin from her back hair  i cant help feeling she grieved into the mirror that its i who keep you from accepting that offer i know it is i could go west with you or into a new countryanywhere but new york terrifies me i dont like new york i never did it disheartens and distracts me i cant find myself in it i shouldnt know how to shop i know im foolish and narrow and provincial she went on but i could never have any inner quiet in new york i couldnt live in the spirit there i suppose people do it cant be that all these millions  oh not so bad as that march interposed laughing there arent quite two  i thought there were four or five well no matter you see what i am basil im terribly limited i couldnt make my sympathies go round two million people i should be wretched i suppose im standing in the way of your highest interest but i cant help it we took each other for better or worse and you must try to bear with me she broke off and began to cry  stop it shouted march i tell you i never cared anything for fulkersons scheme or entertained it seriously and i shouldnt if hed proposed to carry it out in boston this was not quite true but in the retrospect it seemed sufficiently so for the purposes of argument dont say another word about it the things over now and i dont want to think of it any more we couldnt change its nature if we talked all night but i want you to understand that it isnt your limitations that are in the way its mine i shouldnt have the courage to take such a place i dont think im fit for it and thats the long and short of it  oh you dont know how it hurts me to have you say that basil  the next morning as they sat together at breakfast without the children whom they let lie late on sunday mrs march said to her husband silent over his fishballs and baked beans we will go to new york ive decided it  well it takes two to decide that march retorted we are not going to new york  yes we are ive thought it out now listen  oh im willing to listen he consented airily  youve always wanted to get out of the insurance business and now with that fear of being turned out which you have you mustnt neglect this offer i suppose it has its risks but its a risk keeping on as we are and perhaps you will make a great success of it i do want you to try basil if i could once feel that you had fairly seen what you could do in literature i should die happy  not immediately after i hope he suggested taking the second cup of coffee she had been pouring out for him and boston  we neednt make a complete break we can keep this place for the present anyway we could let it for the winter and come back in the summer next year it would be change enough from new york  fulkerson and i hadnt got as far as to talk of a vacation  no matter the children and i could come and if you didnt like new york or the enterprise failed you could get into something in boston again and we have enough to live on till you did yes basil im going  i can see by the way your chin trembles that nothing could stop you you may go to new york if you wish isabel but i shall stay here  be serious basil im in earnest  serious if i were any more serious i should shed tears come my dear i know what you mean and if i had my heart set on this thingfulkerson always calls it this thing i would cheerfully accept any sacrifice you could make to it but id rather not offer you up on a shrine i dont feel any particular faith in im very comfortable where i am that is i know just where the pinch comes and if it comes harder why ive got used to bearing that kind of pinch im too old to change pinches  now that does decide me  it decides me too  i will take all the responsibility basil she pleaded  oh yes but youll hand it back to me as soon as youve carried your point with it theres nothing mean about you isabel where responsibility is concerned no if i do this thingfulkerson again i cant get away from this thing its ominousi must do it because i want to do it and not because you wish that you wanted me to do it i understand your position isabel and that youre really acting from a generous impulse but theres nothing so precarious at our time of life as a generous impulse when we were younger we could stand it we could give way to it and take the consequences but now we cant bear it we must act from cold reason even in the ardor of selfsacrifice  oh as if you did that his wife retorted  is that any cause why you shouldnt she could not say that it was and he went on triumphantly  no i wont take you away from the only safe place on the planet and plunge you into the most perilous and then have you say in your revulsion of feeling that you were all against it from the first and you gave way because you saw i had my heart set on it he supposed he was treating the matter humorously but in this sort of banter between husband and wife there is always much more than the joking march had seen some pretty feminine inconsistencies and trepidations which once charmed him in his wife hardening into traits of middleage which were very like those of less interesting older women the sight moved him with a kind of pathos but he felt the result hindering and vexatious  she now retorted that if he did not choose to take her at her word be need not but that whatever he did she should have nothing to reproach herself with and at least he could not say that she had trapped him into anything  what do you mean by trapping he demanded  i dont know what you call it she answered but when you get me to commit myself to a thing by leaving out the most essential point i call it trapping  i wonder you stop at trapping if you think i got you to favor fulkersons scheme and then sprung new york on you i dont suppose you do though but i guess we wont talk about it any more  he went out for a long walk and she went to her room they lunched silently together in the presence of their children who knew that they had been quarrelling but were easily indifferent to the fact as children get to be in such cases nature defends their youth and the unhappiness which they behold does not infect them in the evening after the boy and girl had gone to bed the father and mother resumed their talk he would have liked to take it up at the point from which it wandered into hostilities for he felt it lamentable that a matter which so seriously concerned them should be confused in the fumes of senseless anger and he was willing to make a tacit acknowledgment of his own error by recurring to the question but she would not be content with this and he had to concede explicitly to her weakness that she really meant it when she had asked him to accept fulkersons offer he said he knew that and he began soberly to talk over their prospects in the event of their going to new york  oh i see you are going she twitted  im going to stay he answered and let them turn me out of my agency here and in this bitterness their talk ended     v  his wife made no attempt to renew their talk before march went to his business in the morning and they parted in dry offence their experience was that these things always came right of themselves at last and they usually let them he knew that she had really tried to consent to a thing that was repugnant to her and in his heart he gave her more credit for the effort than he had allowed her openly she knew that she had made it with the reservation he accused her of and that he had a right to feel sore at what she could not help but he left her to brood over his ingratitude and she suffered him to go heavy and unfriended to meet the chances of the day he said to himself that if she had assented cordially to the conditions of fulkersons offer he would have had the courage to take all the other risks himself and would have had the satisfaction of resigning his place as it was he must wait till he was removed and he figured with bitter pleasure the pain she would feel when he came home some day and told her he had been supplanted after it was too late to close with fulkerson  he found a letter on his desk from the secretary dictated in typewriting which briefly informed him that mr hubbell the inspector of agencies would be in boston on wednesday and would call at his office during the forenoon the letter was not different in tone from many that he had formerly received but the visit announced was out of the usual order and march believed he read his fate in it during the eighteen years of his connection with itfirst as a subordinate in the boston office and finally as its general agent therehe had seen a good many changes in the reciprocity presidents vicepresidents actuaries and general agents had come and gone but there had always seemed to be a recognition of his efficiency or at least sufficiency and there had never been any manner of trouble no question of accounts no apparent dissatisfaction with his management until latterly when there had begun to come from headquarters some suggestions of enterprise in certain ways which gave him his first suspicions of his clerk watkinss willingness to succeed him they embodied some of watkinss ideas the things proposed seemed to march undignified and even vulgar he had never thought himself wanting in energy though probably he had left the business to take its own course in the old lines more than he realized things had always gone so smoothly that he had sometimes fancied a peculiar regard for him in the management which he had the weakness to attribute to an appreciation of what he occasionally did in literature though in saner moments he felt how impossible this was beyond a reference from mr hubbell to some piece of marchs which had happened to meet his eye no one in the management ever gave a sign of consciousness that their service was adorned by an obscure literary man and mr hubbell himself had the effect of regarding the excursions of marchs pen as a sort of joke and of winking at them as he might have winked if once in a way he had found him a little the gayer for dining  march wore through the day gloomily but he had it on his conscience not to show any resentment toward watkins whom he suspected of wishing to supplant him and even of working to do so through this selfdenial he reached a better mind concerning his wife he determined not to make her suffer needlessly if the worst came to the worst she would suffer enough at the best and till the worst came he would spare her and not say anything about the letter he had got  but when they met her first glance divined that something had happened and her first question frustrated his generous intention he had to tell her about the letter she would not allow that it had any significance but she wished him to make an end of his anxieties and forestall whatever it might portend by resigning his place at once she said she was quite ready to go to new york she had been thinking it all over and now she really wanted to go he answered soberly that he had thought it over too and he did not wish to leave boston where he had lived so long or try a new way of life if he could help it he insisted that he was quite selfish in this in their concessions their quarrel vanished they agreed that whatever happened would be for the best and the next day he went to his office fortified for any event  his destiny if tragical presented itself with an aspect which he might have found comic if it had been anothers destiny mr hubbell brought marchs removal softened in the guise of a promotion the management at new york it appeared had acted upon a suggestion of mr hubbells and now authorized him to offer march the editorship of the monthly paper published in the interest of the company his office would include the authorship of circulars and leaflets in behalf of lifeinsurance and would give play to the literary talent which mr hubbell had brought to the attention of the management his salary would be nearly as much as at present but the work would not take his whole time and in a place like new york he could get a great deal of outside writing which they would not object to his doing  mr hubbell seemed so sure of his acceptance of a place in every way congenial to a man of literary tastes that march was afterward sorry he dismissed the proposition with obvious irony and had needlessly hurt hubbells feelings but mrs march had no such regrets she was only afraid that he had not made his rejection contemptuous enough and now she said telegraph mr fulkerson and we will go at once  i suppose i could still get watkinss former place march suggested  never she retorted telegraph instantly  they were only afraid now that fulkerson might have changed his mind and they had a wretched day in which they heard nothing from him it ended with his answering marchs telegram in person they were so glad of his coming and so touched by his satisfaction with his bargain that they laid all the facts of the case before him he entered fully into marchs sense of the joke latent in mr hubbells proposition and he tried to make mrs march believe that he shared her resentment of the indignity offered her husband  march made a show of willingness to release him in view of the changed situation saying that he held him to nothing fulkerson laughed and asked him how soon he thought he could come on to new york he refused to reopen the question of marchs fitness with him he said they had gone into that thoroughly but he recurred to it with mrs march and confirmed her belief in his good sense on all points she had been from the first moment defiantly confident of her husbands ability but till she had talked the matter over with fulkerson she was secretly not sure of it or at least she was not sure that march was not right in distrusting himself when she clearly understood now what fulkerson intended she had no longer a doubt he explained how the enterprise differed from others and how he needed for its direction a man who combined general business experience and business ideas with a love for the thing and a natural aptness for it he did not want a young man and yet he wanted youthits freshness its zestsuch as march would feel in a thing he could put his whole heart into he would not run in ruts like an old fellow who had got hackneyed he would not have any hobbies he would not have any friends or any enemies besides he would have to meet people and march was a man that people took to she knew that herself he had a kind of charm the editorial management was going to be kept in the background as far as the public was concerned the public was to suppose that the thing ran itself fulkerson did not care for a great literary reputation in his editorhe implied that march had a very pretty little one at the same time the relations between the contributors and the management were to be much more intimate than usual fulkerson felt his personal disqualification for working the thing socially and he counted upon mr march for that that was to say he counted upon mrs march  she protested he must not count upon her but it by no means disabled fulkersons judgment in her view that march really seemed more than anything else a fancy of his he had been a fancy of hers and the sort of affectionate respect with which fulkerson spoke of him laid forever some doubt she had of the fineness of fulkersons manners and reconciled her to the graphic slanginess of his speech  the affair was now irretrievable but she gave her approval to it as superbly as if it were submitted in its inception only mr fulkerson must not suppose she should ever like new york she would not deceive him on that point she never should like it she did not conceal either that she did not like taking the children out of the friday afternoon class and she did not believe that tom would ever be reconciled to going to columbia she took courage from fulkersons suggestion that it was possible for tom to come to harvard even from new york and she heaped him with questions concerning the domiciliation of the family in that city he tried to know something about the matter and he succeeded in seeming interested in points necessarily indifferent to him     vi  in the uprooting and transplanting of their home that followed mrs march often trembled before distant problems and possible contingencies but she was never troubled by present difficulties she kept up with tireless energy and in the moments of dejection and misgiving which harassed her husband she remained dauntless and put heart into him when he had lost it altogether  she arranged to leave the children in the house with the servants while she went on with march to look up a dwelling of some sort in new york it made him sick to think of it and when it came to the point he would rather have given up the whole enterprise she had to nerve him to it to represent more than once that now they had no choice but to make this experiment every detail of parting was anguish to him he got consolation out of the notion of letting the house furnished for the winter that implied their return to it but it cost him pangs of the keenest misery to advertise it and when a tenant was actually found it was all he could do to give him the lease he tried his wifes love and patience as a man must to whom the future is easy in the mass but terrible as it translates itself piecemeal into the present he experienced remorse in the presence of inanimate things he was going to leave as if they had sensibly reproached him and an anticipative homesickness that seemed to stop his heart again and again his wife had to make him reflect that his depression was not prophetic she convinced him of what he already knew and persuaded him against his knowledge that he could be keeping an eye out for something to take hold of in boston if they could not stand new york she ended by telling him that it was too bad to make her comfort him in a trial that was really so much more a trial to her she had to support him in a last access of despair on their way to the albany depot the morning they started to new york but when the final details had been dealt with the tickets bought the trunks checked and the handbags hung up in their car and the future had massed itself again at a safe distance and was seven hours and two hundred miles away his spirits began to rise and hers to sink he would have been willing to celebrate the taste the domestic refinement of the ladies waitingroom in the depot where they had spent a quarter of an hour before the train started he said he did not believe there was another station in the world where mahogany rockingchairs were provided that the dullred warmth of the walls was as cozy as an evening lamp and that he always hoped to see a fire kindled on that vast hearth and under that aesthetic mantel but he supposed now he never should he said it was all very different from that tunnel the old albany depot where they had waited the morning they went to new york when they were starting on their wedding journey  the morning basil cried his wife we went at night and we were going to take the boat but it stormed so she gave him a glance of such reproach that he could not answer anything and now she asked him whether he supposed their cook and second girl would be contented with one of those dark holes where they put girls to sleep in new york flats and what she should do if margaret especially left her he ventured to suggest that margaret would probably like the city but if she left there were plenty of other girls to be had in new york she replied that there were none she could trust and that she knew margaret would not stay he asked her why she took her thenwhy she did not give her up at once and she answered that it would be inhuman to give her up just in the edge of the winter she had promised to keep her and margaret was pleased with the notion of going to new york where she had a cousin  then perhaps shell be pleased with the notion of staying he said  oh much you know about it she retorted and in view of the hypothetical difficulty and his want of sympathy she fell into a gloom from which she roused herself at last by declaring that if there was nothing else in the flat they took there should be a light kitchen and a bright sunny bedroom for margaret he expressed the belief that they could easily find such a flat as that and she denounced his fatal optimism which buoyed him up in the absence of an undertaking and let him drop into the depths of despair in its presence  he owned this defect of temperament but he said that it compensated the opposite in her character i suppose thats one of the chief uses of marriage people supplement one another and form a pretty fair sort of human being together the only drawback to the theory is that unmarried people seem each as complete and whole as a married pair  she refused to be amused she turned her face to the window and put her handkerchief up under her veil  it was not till the diningcar was attached to their train that they were both able to escape for an hour into the carefree mood of their earlier travels when they were so easily taken out of themselves the time had been when they could have found enough in the conjectural fortunes and characters of their fellowpassengers to occupy them this phase of their youth had lasted long and the world was still full of novelty and interest for them but it required all the charm of the diningcar now to lay the anxieties that beset them it was so potent for the moment however that they could take an objective view at their sitting cozily down there together as if they had only themselves in the world they wondered what the children were doing the children who possessed them so intensely when present and now by a fantastic operation of absence seemed almost nonexistents they tried to be homesick for them but failed they recognized with comfortable selfabhorrence that this was terrible but owned a fascination in being alone at the same time they could not imagine how people felt who never had any children they contrasted the luxury of dining that way with every advantage except a band of music and the old way of rushing out to snatch a fearful joy at the lunchcounters of the worcesier and springfield and new haven stations they had not gone often to new york since their wedding journey but they had gone often enough to have noted the change from the lunchcounter to the lunchbasket brought in the train from which you could subsist with more ease and dignity but seemed destined to a superabundance of pickles whatever you ordered  they thought well of themselves now that they could be both critical and tolerant of flavors not very sharply distinguished from one another in their dinner and they lingered over their coffee and watched the autumn landscape through the windows  not quite so loud a pattern of calico this year he said with patronizing forbearance toward the painted woodlands whirling by do you see how the foreground next the train rushes from us and the background keeps ahead of us while the middle distance seems stationary i dont think i ever noticed that effect before there ought to be something literary in it retreating past and advancing future and deceitfully permanent presentsomething like that  his wife brushed some crumbs from her lap before rising yes you mustnt waste any of these ideas now  oh no it would be money out of fulkersons pocket     vii  they went to a quiet hotel far downtown and took a small apartment which they thought they could easily afford for the day or two they need spend in looking up a furnished flat they were used to staying at this hotel when they came on for a little outing in new york after some rigid winter in boston at the time of the spring exhibitions they were remembered there from year to year the colored callboys who never seemed to get any older smiled upon them and the clerk called march by name even before he registered he asked if mrs march were with him and said then he supposed they would want their usual quarters and in a moment they were domesticated in a far interior that seemed to have been waiting for them in a clean quiet patient disoccupation ever since they left it two years before the little parlor with its gilt paper and ebonized furniture was the lightest of the rooms but it was not very light at noonday without the gas which the bellboy now flared up for them the uproar of the city came to it in a soothing murmur and they took possession of its peace and comfort with open celebration after all they agreed there was no place in the world so delightful as a hotel apartment like that the boasted charms of home were nothing to it and then the magic of its being always there ready for any one every one just as if it were for some one alone it was like the experience of an arabian nights hero come true for all the race  oh why cant we always stay here just we two mrs march sighed to her husband as he came out of his room rubbing his face red with the towel while she studied a new arrangement of her bonnet and handbag on the mantel  and ignore the past im willing ive no doubt that the children could get on perfectly well without us and could find some lot in the scheme of providence that would really be just as well for them  yes or could contrive somehow never to have existed i should insist upon that if they are dont you see that we couldnt wish them not to be  oh yes i see your point its simply incontrovertible  she laughed and said well at any rate if we cant find a flat to suit us we can all crowd into these three rooms somehow for the winter and then browse about for meals by the week we could get them much cheaper and we could save on the eating as they do in europe or on something else  something else probably said march but we wont take this apartment till the ideal furnished flat winks out altogether we shall not have any trouble we can easily find some one who is going south for the winter and will be glad to give up their flat to the right party at a nominal rent thats my notion thats what the evanses did one winter when they came on here in february all but the nominality of the rent  yes and we could pay a very good rent and still save something on letting our house you can settle yourselves in a hundred different ways in new york that is one merit of the place but if everything else fails we can come back to this i want you to take the refusal of it basil and well commence looking this very evening as soon as weve had dinner i cut a lot of things out of the herald as we came on see here  she took a long strip of paper out of her handbag with minute advertisements pinned transversely upon it and forming the effect of some glittering nondescript vertebrate  looks something like the seaserpent said march drying his hands on the towel while he glanced up and down the list but we shant have any trouble ive no doubt there are half a dozen things there that will do you havent gone uptown because we must be near the every other week office  no but i wish mr fulkerson hadnt called it that it always makes one think of jam yesterday and jam tomorrow but never jam today in through the lookingglass theyre all in this region  they were still at their table beside a low window where some sort of neverblooming shrub symmetrically balanced itself in a large pot with a leaf to the right and a leaf to the left and a spear up the middle when fulkerson came stepping squarefootedly over the thick diningroom carpet he wagged in the air a gay hand of salutation at sight of them and of repression when they offered to rise to meet him then with an apparent simultaneity of action he gave a hand to each pulled up a chair from the next table put his hat and stick on the floor beside it and seated himself  well youve burned your ships behind you sure enough he said beaming his satisfaction upon them from eyes and teeth  the ships are burned said march though im not sure we alone did it but here we are looking for shelter and a little anxious about the disposition of the natives  oh theyre an awful peaceable lot said fulkerson ive been round among the caciques a little and i think ive got two or three places that will just suit you mrs march how did you leave the children  oh how kind of you very well and very proud to be left in charge of the smoking wrecks  fulkerson naturally paid no attention to what she said being but secondarily interested in the children at the best here are some things right in this neighborhood within gunshot of the office and if you want you can go and look at them tonight the agents gave me houses where the people would be in  we will go and look at them instantly said mrs march or as soon as youve had coffee with us  never do fulkerson replied he gathered up his hat and stick just rushed in to say hello and got to run right away again i tell you march things are humming im after those fellows with a sharp stick all the while to keep them from loafing on my house and at the same time im just bubbling over with ideas about the lone handwish we could call it thatthat i want to talk up with you  well come to breakfast said mrs march cordially  no the ideas will keep till youve secured your lodge in this vast wilderness goodbye  youre as nice as you can be mr fulkerson she said to keep us in mind when you have so much to occupy you  i wouldnt have anything to occupy me if i hadnt kept you in mind mrs march said fulkerson going off upon as good a speech as he could apparently hope to make  why basil said mrs march when he was gone hes charming but now we mustnt lose an instant lets see where the places are she ran over the halfdozen agents permits capitalfirstratethe very thingevery one well i consider ourselves settled we can go back to the children tomorrow if we like though i rather think i should like to stay over another day and get a little rested for the final pulling up thats got to come but this simplifies everything enormously and mr fulkerson is as thoughtful and as sweet as he can be i know you will get on well with him he has such a good heart and his attitude toward you basil is beautiful alwaysso respectful or not that so much as appreciative yes appreciativethats the word i must always keep that in mind  its quite important to do so said march  yes she assented seriously and we must not forget just what kind of flat we are going to look for the sine qua nons are an elevator and steam heat not above the third floor to begin with then we must each have a room and you must have your study and i must have my parlor and the two girls must each have a room with the kitchen and dining room how many does that make  ten  i thought eight well no matter you can work in the parlor and run into your bedroom when anybody comes and i can sit in mine and the girls must put up with one if its large and sunny though ive always given them two at home and the kitchen must be sunny so they can sit in it and the rooms must all have outside light and the rent must not be over eight hundred for the winter we only get a thousand for our whole house and we must save something out of that so as to cover the expenses of moving now do you think you can remember all that  not the half of it said march but you can or if you forget a third of it i can come in with my partial half and more than make it up  she had brought her bonnet and sacque downstairs with her and was transferring them from the hatrack to her person while she talked the friendly doorboy let them into the street and the clear october evening air brightened her so that as she tucked her hand under her husbands arm and began to pull him along she said if we find something right awayand were just as likely to get the right flat soon as late its all a lotterywell go to the theatre somewhere  she had a moments panic about having left the agents permits on the table and after remembering that she had put them into her little shoppingbag where she kept her money each note crushed into a round wad and had heft it on the hatrack where it would certainly be stolen she found it on her wrist she did not think that very funny but after a first impulse to inculpate her husband she let him laugh while they stopped under a lamp and she held the permits half a yard away to read the numbers on them  where are your glasses isabel  on the mantel in our room of course  then you ought to have brought a pair of tongs  i wouldnt get off secondhand jokes basil she said and why here she cried whirling round to the door before which they had halted this is the very number well i do believe its a sign  one of those colored men who soften the trade of janitor in many of the smaller apartmenthouses in new york by the sweetness of their race let the marches in or rather welcomed them to the possession of the premises by the bow with which he acknowledged their permit it was a large old mansion cut up into five or six dwellings but it had kept some traits of its former dignity which pleased people of their sympathetic tastes the darkmahogany trim of sufficiently ugly design gave a rich gloom to the hallway which was wide and paved with marble the carpeted stairs curved aloft through a generous space  there is no elevator mrs march asked of the janitor  he answered no maam only two flights up so winningly that she said  oh in courteous apology and whispered to her husband as she followed lightly up well take it basil if its like the rest  if its like him you mean  i dont wonder they wanted to own them she hurriedly philosophized if i had such a creature nothing but death should part us and i should no more think of giving him his freedom  no we couldnt afford it returned her husband  the apartment which the janitor unlocked for them and lit up from those chandeliers and brackets of gilt brass in the form of vine bunches leaves and tendrils in which the early gasfitter realized most of his conceptions of beauty had rather more of the ugliness than the dignity of the hall but the rooms were large and they grouped themselves in a reminiscence of the time when they were part of a dwelling that had its charm its pathos its impressiveness where they were cut up into smaller spaces it had been done with the frankness with which a proud old family of fallen fortunes practises its economies the rough pinefloors showed a black border of tackheads where carpets had been lifted and put down for generations the white paint was yellow with age the apartment had light at the front and at the back and two or three rooms had glimpses of the day through small windows let into their corners another one seemed lifting an appealing eye to heaven through a glass circle in its ceiling the rest must darkle in perpetual twilight yet something pleased in it all and mrs march had gone far to adapt the different rooms to the members of her family when she suddenly thought and for her to think was to say why but theres no steam heat  no maam the janitor admitted but deres grates in most o de rooms and deres furnace heat in de halls  thats true she admitted and having placed her family in the apartments it was hard to get them out again could we manage she referred to her husband  why i shouldnt care for the steam heat ifwhat is the rent he broke off to ask the janitor  nine hundred sir  march concluded to his wife if it were furnished  why of course what could i have been thinking of were looking for a furnished flat she explained to the janitor and this was so pleasant and homelike that i never thought whether it was furnished or not  she smiled upon the janitor and he entered into the joke and chuckled so amiably at her flattering oversight on the way downstairs that she said as she pinched her husbands arm now if you dont give him a quarter ill never speak to you again basil  i would have given half a dollar willingly to get you beyond his glamour said march when they were safely on the pavement outside if it hadnt been for my strength of character youd have taken an unfurnished flat without heat and with no elevator at nine hundred a year when you had just sworn me to steam heat an elevator furniture and eight hundred  yes how could i have lost my head so completely she said with a lenient amusement in her aberration which she was not always able to feel in her husbands  the next time a colored janitor opens the door to us ill tell him the apartment doesnt suit at the threshold its the only way to manage you isabel  its true i am in love with the whole race i never saw one of them that didnt have perfectly angelic manners i think we shall all be black in heaventhat is blacksouled  that isnt the usual theory said march  well perhaps not she assented where are we going now oh yes to the xenophon  she pulled him gayly along again and after they had walked a block down and half a block over they stood before the apartmenthouse of that name which was cut on the gaslamps on either side of the heavily spiked aesthetichinged black door the titter of an electricbell brought a large fat buttons with a stage effect of being dressed to look small who said he would call the janitor and they waited in the dimly splendid coppercolored interior admiring the whorls and waves into which the wallpaint was combed till the janitor came in his goldbanded cap like a continental porker when they said they would like to see mrs grosvenor greens apartment he owned his inability to cope with the affair and said he must send for the superintendent he was either in the herodotus or the thucydides and would be there in a minute the buttons brought hima yankee of browbeating presence in plain clothesalmost before they had time to exchange a frightened whisper in recognition of the fact that there could be no doubt of the steam heat and elevator in this case half stifled in the one they mounted in the other eight stories while they tried to keep their selfrespect under the gaze of the superintendent which they felt was classing and assessing them with unfriendly accuracy they could not and they faltered abashed at the threshold of mrs grosvenor greens apartment while the superintendent lit the gas in the gangway that he called a private hall and in the drawingroom and the succession of chambers stretching rearward to the kitchen everything had been done by the architect to save space and everything to waste it by mrs grosvenor green she had conformed to a law for the necessity of turning round in each room and had foldingbeds in the chambers but there her subordination had ended and wherever you might have turned round she had put a gimcrack so that you would knock it over if you did turn the place was rather pretty and even imposing at first glance and it took several joint ballots for march and his wife to make sure that with the kitchen there were only six rooms at every door hung a portiere from large rings on a brass rod every shelf and dressingcase and mantel was littered with gimcracks and the corners of the tiny rooms were curtained off and behind these portieres swarmed more gimcracks the front of the upright piano had what march called a shortskirted portiere on it and the top was covered with vases with dragon candlesticks and with jap fans which also expanded themselves bat wise on the walls between the etchings and the water colors the floors were covered with filling and then rugs and then skins the easychairs all had tidies armenian and turkish and persian the lounges and sofas had embroidered cushions hidden under tidies  the radiator was concealed by a jap screen and over the top of this some arab scarfs were flung there was a superabundance of clocks china pugs guarded the hearth a brass sunflower smiled from the top of either andiron and a brass peacock spread its tail before them inside a high filigree fender on one side was a coalhod in repousse brass and on the other a wrought iron woodbasket some red japanese birdkites were stuck about in the necks of spelter vases a crimson jap umbrella hung opened beneath the chandelier and each globe had a shade of yellow silk  march when he had recovered his selfcommand a little in the presence of the agglomeration comforted himself by calling the bricabrac jamescracks as if this was their full name  the disrespect he was able to show the whole apartment by means of this joke strengthened him to say boldly to the superintendent that it was altogether too small then he asked carelessly what the rent was  two hundred and fifty  the marches gave a start and looked at each other  dont you think we could make it do she asked him and he could see that she had mentally saved five hundred dollars as the difference between the rent of their house and that of this flat it has some very pretty features and we could manage to squeeze in couldnt we  you wont find another furnished flat like it for no twofifty a month in the whole city the superintendent put in  they exchanged glances again and march said carelessly its too small  theres a vacant flat in the herodotus for eighteen hundred a year and one in the thucydides for fifteen the superintendent suggested clicking his keys together as they sank down in the elevator seven rooms and bath  thank you said march were looking for a furnished flat  they felt that the superintendent parted from them with repressed sarcasm  oh basil do you think we really made him think it was the smallness and not the dearness  no but we saved our selfrespect in the attempt and thats a great deal  of course i wouldnt have taken it anyway with only six rooms and so high up but what prices now we must be very circumspect about the next place  it was a janitress large fat with her arms wound up in her apron who received them there mrs march gave her a succinct but perfect statement of their needs she failed to grasp the nature of them or feigned to do so she shook her head and said that her son would show them the flat there was a radiator visible in the narrow hall and isabel tacitly compromised on steam heat without an elevator as the flat was only one flight up when the son appeared from below with a small kerosene handlamp it appeared that the flat was unfurnished but there was no stopping him till he had shown it in all its impossibility when they got safely away from it and into the street march said well have you had enough for tonight isabel shall we go to the theatre now  not on any account i want to see the whole list of flats that mr fulkerson thought would be the very thing for us she laughed but with a certain bitterness  youll be calling him my mr fulkerson next isabel  oh no  the fourth address was a furnished flat without a kitchen in a house with a general restaurant the fifth was a furnished house at the sixth a pathetic widow and her pretty daughter wanted to take a family to board and would give them a private table at a rate which the marches would have thought low in boston  mrs march came away tingling with compassion for their evident anxiety and this pity naturally soured into a sense of injury well i must say i have completely lost confidence in mr fulkersons judgment anything more utterly different from what i told him we wanted i couldnt imagine if he doesnt manage any better about his business than he has done about this it will be a perfect failure  well well lets hope hell be more circumspect about that her husband returned with ironical propitiation but i dont think its fulkersons fault altogether perhaps its the houseagents theyre a very illusory generation there seems to be something in the human habitation that corrupts the natures of those who deal in it to buy or sell it to hire or let it you go to an agent and tell him what kind of a house you want he has no such house and he sends you to look at something altogether different upon the wellascertained principle that if you cant get what you want you will take what you can get you dont suppose the party that took our house in boston was looking for any such house he was looking for a totally different kind of house in another part of the town  i dont believe that his wife broke in  well no matter but see what a scandalous rent you asked for it  we didnt get much more than half and besides the agent told me to ask fourteen hundred  oh im not blaming you isabel im only analyzing the houseagent and exonerating fulkerson  well i dont believe he told them just what we wanted and at any rate im done with agents tomorrow im going entirely by advertisements     viii  mrs march took the vertebrate with her to the vienna coffeehouse where they went to breakfast next morning she made march buy her the herald and the world and she added to its spiny convolutions from them she read the new advertisements aloud with ardor and with faith to believe that the apartments described in them were every one truthfully represented and that any one of them was richly responsive to their needs elegant light large single and outside flats were offered with all improvementsbath icebox etcfor twentyfive to thirty dollars a month the cheapness was amazing the wagram the esmeralda the jacinth advertised them for forty dollars and sixty dollars with steam heat and elevator rent free till november others attractive from their air of conscientious scruple announced firstclass flats good order reasonable rents the helena asked the reader if she had seen the cabinet finish hardwood floors and frescoed ceilings of its fiftydollar flats the asteroid affirmed that such apartments with six light rooms and bath porcelain washtubs electric bells and hallboy as it offered for seventyfive dollars were unapproached by competition there was a sameness in the jargon which tended to confusion mrs march got several flats on her list which promised neither steam heat nor elevators she forgot herself so far as to include two or three as remote from the downtown region of her choice as harlem but after she had rejected these the nondescript vertebrate was still voluminous enough to sustain her buoyant hopes  the waiter who remembered them from year to year had put them at a window giving a pretty good section of broadway and before they set out on their search they had a moment of reminiscence they recalled the broadway of five of ten of twenty years ago swelling and roaring with a tide of gayly painted omnibuses and of picturesque traffic that the horsecars have now banished from it the grind of their wheels and the clash of their harsh bells imperfectly fill the silence that the omnibuses have left and the eye misses the tumultuous perspective of former times  they went out and stood for a moment before grace church and looked down the stately thoroughfare and found it no longer impressive no longer characteristic it is still broadway in name but now it is like any other street you do not now take your life in your hand when you attempt to cross it the broadway policeman who supported the elbow of timorous beauty in the hollow of his cottongloved palm and guided its little fearful boots over the crossing while he arrested the billowy omnibuses on either side with an imperious glance is gone and all that certain processional barbaric gayety of the place is gone  palmyra baalbec timour of the desert said march voicing their common feeling of the change  they turned and went into the beautiful church and found themselves in time for the matin service rapt far from new york if not from earth in the dim richness of the painted light the hallowed music took them with solemn ecstasy the aerial aspiring gothic forms seemed to lift them heavenward they came out reluctant into the dazzle and bustle of the street with a feeling that they were too good for it which they confessed to each other with whimsical consciousness  but no matter how consecrated we feel now he said we mustnt forget that we went into the church for precisely the same reason that we went to the vienna cafe for breakfastto gratify an aesthetic sense to renew the faded pleasure of travel for a moment to get back into the europe of our youth it was a purely pagan impulse isabel and wed better own it  i dont know she returned i think we reduce ourselves to the bare bones too much i wish we didnt always recognize the facts as we do sometimes i should like to blink them i should like to think i was devouter than i am and younger and prettier  better not you couldnt keep it up honesty is the best policy even in such things  no i dont like it basil i should rather wait till the last day for some of my motives to come to the top i know theyre always mixed but do let me give them the benefit of a doubt sometimes  well well have it your own way my dear but i prefer not to lay up so many disagreeable surprises for myself at that time  she would not consent i know i am a good deal younger than i was i feel quite in the mood of that morning when we walked down broadway on our wedding journey dont you  oh yes but i know im not younger im only prettier  she laughed for pleasure in his joke and also for unconscious joy in the gay new york weather in which there was no arriere pensee of the east wind they had crossed broadway and were walking over to washington square in the region of which they now hoped to place themselves the primo tenore statue of garibaldi had already taken possession of the place in the name of latin progress and they met italian faces french faces spanish faces as they strolled over the asphalt walks under the thinning shadows of the autumnstricken sycamores they met the familiar picturesque raggedness of southern europe with the old kindly illusion that somehow it existed for their appreciation and that it found adequate compensation for poverty in this march thought he sufficiently expressed his tacit sympathy in sitting down on one of the iron benches with his wife and letting a little neapolitan put a superfluous shine on his boots while their desultory comment wandered with equal esteem to the oldfashioned american respectability which keeps the north side of the square in vast mansions of red brick and the international shabbiness which has invaded the southern border and broken it up into lodginghouses shops beergardens and studios  they noticed the sign of an apartment to let on the north side and as soon as the little bootblack could be bought off they went over to look at it the janitor met them at the door and examined them then he said as if still in doubt it has ten rooms and the rent is twentyeight hundred dollars  it wouldnt do then march replied and left him to divide the responsibility between the paucity of the rooms and the enormity of the rent as he best might but their selflove had received a wound and they questioned each other what it was in their appearance made him doubt their ability to pay so much  of course we dont look like newyorkers sighed mrs march and weve walked through the square that might be as if we had walked along the park street mall in the common before we came out on beacon do you suppose he could have seen you getting your boots blacked in that way  its useless to ask said march but i never can recover from this blow  oh pshaw you know you hate such things as badly as i do it was very impertinent of him  let us go back and ecraser linfame by paying him a years rent in advance and taking immediate possession nothing else can soothe my wounded feelings you were not having your boots blacked why shouldnt he have supposed you were a newyorker and i a country cousin  they always know dont you remember mrs williamss going to a fifth avenue milliner in a worth dress and the womans asking her instantly what hotel she should send her hat to  yes these things drive one to despair i dont wonder the bodies of so many genteel strangers are found in the waters around new york shall we try the south side my dear or had we better go back to our rooms and rest awhile  mrs march had out the vertebrate and was consulting one of its glittering ribs and glancing up from it at a house before which they stood yes its the number but do they call this being ready october first the little area in front of the basement was heaped with a mixture of mortar bricks laths and shavings from the interior the brownstone steps to the front door were similarly bestrewn the doorway showed the halfopen rough pine carpenters sketch of an unfinished house the sashless windows of every story showed the activity of workmen within the clatter of hammers and the hiss of saws came out to them from every opening  they may call it october first said march because its too late to contradict them but theyd better not call it december first in my presence ill let them say january first at a pinch  we will go in and look at it anyway said his wife and he admired how when she was once within she began provisionally to settle the family in each of the several floors with the female instinct for domiciliation which never failed her she had the help of the landlord who was present to urge forward the workmen apparently he lent a hopeful fancy to the solution of all her questions to get her from under his influence march had to represent that the place was damp from undried plastering and that if she stayed she would probably be down with that new york pneumonia which visiting bostonians are always dying of once safely on the pavement outside she realized that the apartment was not only unfinished but unfurnished and had neither steam heat nor elevator but i thought we had better look at everything she explained  yes but not take everything if i hadnt pulled you away from there by main force youd have not only died of new york pneumonia on the spot but youd have had us all settled there before we knew what we were about  well thats what i cant help basil its the only way i can realize whether it will do for us i have to dramatize the whole thing  she got a deal of pleasure as well as excitement out of this and he had to own that the process of setting up housekeeping in so many different places was not only entertaining but tended through association with their first beginnings in housekeeping to restore the image of their early married days and to make them young again  it went on all day and continued far into the night until it was too late to go to the theatre too late to do anything but tumble into bed and simultaneously fall asleep they groaned over their reiterated disappointments but they could not deny that the interest was unfailing and that they got a great deal of fun out of it all nothing could abate mrs marchs faith in her advertisements one of them sent her to a flat of ten rooms which promised to be the solution of all their difficulties it proved to be over a liverystable a liquor store and a milliners shop none of the first fashion another led them far into old greenwich village to an apartmenthouse which she refused to enter behind a small girl with a loaf of bread under one arm and a quart can of milk under the other  in their search they were obliged as march complained to the acquisition of useless information in a degree unequalled in their experience they came to excel in the sad knowledge of the line at which respectability distinguishes itself from shabbiness flattering advertisements took them to numbers of huge apartmenthouses chiefly distinguishable from tenementhouses by the absence of fireescapes on their facades till mrs march refused to stop at any door where there were more than six bellratchets and speakingtubes on either hand before the middle of the afternoon she decided against ratchets altogether and confined herself to knobs neatly set in the doortrim her husband was still sunk in the superstition that you can live anywhere you like in new york and he would have paused at some places where her quicker eye caught the fatal sign of modes in the groundfloor windows she found that there was an east and west line beyond which they could not go if they wished to keep their selfrespect and that within the region to which they had restricted themselves there was a choice of streets at first all the new york streets looked to them illpaved dirty and repulsive the general infamy imparted itself in their casual impression to streets in no wise guilty but they began to notice that some streets were quiet and clean and though never so quiet and clean as boston streets that they wore an air of encouraging reform and suggested a future of greater and greater domesticity whole blocks of these downtown crossstreets seemed to have been redeemed from decay and even in the midst of squalor a dwelling here and there had been seized painted a dull red as to its brickwork and a glossy black as to its woodwork and with a bright brass bellpull and doorknob and a large brass plate for its keyhole escutcheon had been endowed with an effect of purity and pride which removed its shabby neighborhood far from it some of these houses were quite small and imaginably within their means but as march said some body seemed always to be living there himself and the fact that none of them was to rent kept mrs march true to her ideal of a fiat nothing prevented its realization so much as its difference from the new york ideal of a flat which was inflexibly seven rooms and a bath one or two rooms might be at the front the rest crooked and cornered backward through in creasing and then decreasing darkness till they reached a light bedroom or kitchen at the rear it might be the one or the other but it was always the seventh room with the bath or if as sometimes happened it was the eighth it was so after having counted the bath as one in this case the janitor said you always counted the bath as one if the flats were advertised as having all light rooms he explained that any room with a window giving into the open air of a court or shaft was counted a light room  the marches tried to make out why it was that these flats were go much more repulsive than the apartments which everyone lived in abroad but they could only do so upon the supposition that in their european days they were too young too happy too full of the future to notice whether rooms were inside or outside light or dark big or little high or low now were imprisoned in the present he said and we have to make the worst of it  in their despair he had an inspiration which she declared worthy of him it was to take two small flats of four or five rooms and a bath and live in both they tried this in a great many places but they never could get two flats of the kind on the same floor where there was steam heat and an elevator at one place they almost did it they had resigned themselves to the humility of the neighborhood to the prevalence of modistes and liverystablemen they seem to consort much in new york to the garbage in the gutters and the litter of paper in the streets to the faltering slats in the surrounding windowshutters and the crumbled brownstone steps and sills when it turned out that one of the apartments had been taken between two visits they made then the only combination left open to them was of a groundfloor flat to the right and a thirdfloor flat to the left  still they kept this inspiration in reserve for use at the first opportunity in the mean time there were several flats which they thought they could almost make do notably one where they could get an extra servants room in the basement four flights down and another where they could get it in the roof five flights up at the first the janitor was respectful and enthusiastic at the second he had an effect of ironical pessimism when they trembled on the verge of taking his apartment he pointed out a spot in the kalsomining of the parlor ceiling and gratuitously said now such a thing as that he should not agree to put in shape unless they took the apartment for a term of years the apartment was unfurnished and they recurred to the fact that they wanted a furnished apartment and made their escape this saved them in several other extremities but short of extremity they could not keep their different requirements in mind and were always about to decide without regard to some one of them  they went to several places twice without intending once to that oldfashioned house with the pleasant colored janitor and wandered all over the apartment again with a haunting sense of familiarity and then recognized the janitor and laughed and to that house with the pathetic widow and the pretty daughter who wished to take them to board they stayed to excuse their blunder and easily came by the fact that the mother had taken the house that the girl might have a home while she was in new york studying art and they hoped to pay their way by taking boarders her daughter was at her class now the mother concluded and they encouraged her to believe that it could only be a few days till the rest of her scheme was realized  i dare say we could be perfectly comfortable there march suggested when they had got away now if we were truly humane we would modify our desires to meet their needs and end this sickening search wouldnt we  yes but were not truly humane his wife answered or at least not in that sense you know you hate boarding and if we went there i should have them on my sympathies the whole time  i see and then you would take it out of me  then i should take it out of you and if you are going to be so weak basil and let every little thing work upon you in that way youd better not come to new york youll see enough misery here  well dont take that superior tone with me as if i were a child that had its mind set on an undesirable toy isabel  ah dont you suppose its because you are such a child in some respects that i like you dear she demanded without relenting  but i dont find so much misery in new york i dont suppose theres any more suffering here to the population than there is in the country and theyre so gay about it all i think the outward aspect of the place and the hilarity of the sky and air must get into the peoples blood the weather is simply unapproachable and i dont care if it is the ugliest place in the world as you say i suppose it is it shrieks and yells with ugliness here and there but it never loses its spirits that widow is from the country when shes been a year in new york shell be as gayas gay as an l road he celebrated a satisfaction they both had in the l roads they kill the streets and avenues but at least they partially hide them and that is some comfort and they do triumph over their prostrate forms with a savage exultation that is intoxicating those bends in the l that you get in the corner of washington square or just below the cooper institutetheyre the gayest things in the world perfectly atrocious of course but incomparably picturesque and the whole city is so said march or else the l would never have got built here new york may be splendidly gay or squalidly gay but prince or pauper its gay always  yes gay is the word she admitted with a sigh but frantic i cant get used to it they forget death basil they forget death in new york  well i dont know that ive ever found much advantage in remembering it  dont say such a thing dearest  he could see that she had got to the end of her nervous strength for the present and he proposed that they should take the elevated road as far as it would carry them into the country and shake off their nightmare of flathunting for an hour or two but her conscience would not let her she convicted him of levity equal to that of the newyorkers in proposing such a thing and they dragged through the day she was too tired to care for dinner and in the night she had a dream from which she woke herself with a cry that roused him too it was something about the children at first whom they had talked of wistfully before falling asleep and then it was of a hideous thing with two square eyes and a series of sections growing darker and then lighter till the tail of the monstrous articulate was quite luminous again she shuddered at the vague description she was able to give but he asked did it offer to bite you  no that was the most frightful thing about it it had no mouth  march laughed why my dear it was nothing but a harmless new york flatseven rooms and a bath  i really believe it was she consented recognizing an architectural resemblance and she fell asleep again and woke renewed for the work before them     ix  their househunting no longer had novelty but it still had interest and they varied their day by taking a coupe by renouncing advertisements and by reverting to agents some of these induced them to consider the idea of furnished houses and mrs march learned tolerance for fulkerson by accepting permits to visit flats and houses which had none of the qualifications she desired in either and were as far beyond her means as they were out of the region to which she had geographically restricted herself they looked at threethousand and fourthousand dollar apartments and rejected them for one reason or another which had nothing to do with the rent the higher the rent was the more critical they were of the slippery inlaid floors and the arrangement of the richly decorated rooms they never knew whether they had deceived the janitor or not as they came in a coupe they hoped they had  they drove accidentally through one street that seemed gayer in the perspective than an l road the fireescapes with their light iron balconies and ladders of iron decorated the lofty house fronts the roadway and sidewalks and doorsteps swarmed with children womens heads seemed to show at every window in the basements over which flights of high stone steps led to the tenements were greengrocers shops abounding in cabbages and provision stores running chiefly to bacon and sausages and cobblers and tinners shops and the like in proportion to the small needs of a poor neighborhood ash barrels lined the sidewalks and garbage heaps filled the gutters teams of all trades stood idly about a peddler of cheap fruit urged his cart through the street and mixed his cry with the joyous screams and shouts of the children and the scolding and gossiping voices of the women the burly blue bulk of a policeman defined itself at the corner a drunkard zigzagged down the sidewalk toward him it was not the abode of the extremest poverty but of a poverty as hopeless as any in the world transmitting itself from generation to generation and establishing conditions of permanency to which human life adjusts itself as it does to those of some incurable disease like leprosy  the time had been when the marches would have taken a purely aesthetic view of the facts as they glimpsed them in this street of tenementhouses when they would have contented themselves with saying that it was as picturesque as a street in naples or florence and with wondering why nobody came to paint it they would have thought they were sufficiently serious about it in blaming the artists for their failure to appreciate it and going abroad for the picturesque when they had it here under their noses it was to the nose that the street made one of its strongest appeals and mrs march pulled up her window of the coupe why does he take us through such a disgusting street she demanded with an exasperation of which her husband divined the origin  this driver may be a philanthropist in disguise he answered with dreamy irony and may want us to think about the people who are not merely carried through this street in a coupe but have to spend their whole lives in it winter and summer with no hopes of driving out of it except in a hearse i must say they dont seem to mind it i havent seen a jollier crowd anywhere in new york they seem to have forgotten death a little more completely than any of their fellowcitizens isabel and i wonder what they think of us making this gorgeous progress through their midst i suppose they think were rich and hate usif they hate rich people they dont look as if they hated anybody should we be as patient as they are with their discomfort i dont believe theres steam heat or an elevator in the whole block seven rooms and a bath would be more than the largest and genteelest family would know what to do with they wouldnt know what to do with the bath anyway  his monologue seemed to interest his wife apart from the satirical point it had for themselves you ought to get mr fulkerson to let you work some of these new york sights up for every other week basil you could do them very nicely  yes ive thought of that but dont lets leave the personal ground doesnt it make you feel rather small and otherwise unworthy when you see the kind of street these fellowbeings of yours live in and then think how particular you are about locality and the number of bellpulls i dont see even ratchets and speakingtubes at these doors he craned his neck out of the window for a better look and the children of discomfort cheered him out of sheer good feeling and high spirits i didnt know i was so popular perhaps its a recognition of my humane sentiments  oh its very easy to have humane sentiments and to satirize ourselves for wanting eight rooms and a bath in a good neighborhood when we see how these wretched creatures live said his wife but if we shared all we have with them and then settled down among them what good would it do  not the least in the world it might help us for the moment but it wouldnt keep the wolf from their doors for a week and then they would go on just as before only they wouldnt be on such good terms with the wolf the only way for them is to keep up an unbroken intimacy with the wolf then they can manage him somehow i dont know how and im afraid i dont want to wouldnt you like to have this fellow drive us round among the halls of pride somewhere for a little while fifth avenue or madison uptown  no weve no time to waste ive got a place near third avenue on a nice cross street and i want him to take us there it proved that she had several addresses near together and it seemed best to dismiss their coupe and do the rest of their afternoons work on foot it came to nothing she was not humbled in the least by what she had seen in the tenementhouse street she yielded no point in her ideal of a flat and the flats persistently refused to lend themselves to it she lost all patience with them  oh i dont say the flats are in the right of it said her husband when she denounced their stupid inadequacy to the purposes of a christian home but im not so sure that we are either ive been thinking about that home business ever since my sensibilities were draggedin a coupethrough that tenementhouse street of course no child born and brought up in such a place as that could have any conception of home but thats because those poor people cant give character to their habitations they have to take what they can get but people like usthat is of our meansdo give character to the average flat its made to meet their tastes or their supposed tastes and so its made for social show not for family life at all think of a baby in a flat its a contradiction in terms the flat is the negation of motherhood the flat means society life that is the pretence of social life its made to give artificial people a society basis on a little moneytoo much money of course for what they get so the cost of the building is put into marble halls and idiotic decoration of all kinds i dont object to the conveniences but none of these flats has a livingroom they have drawingrooms to foster social pretence and they have diningrooms and bedrooms but they have no room where the family can all come together and feel the sweetness of being a family the bedrooms are blackholes mostly with a sinful waste of space in each if it were not for the marble halls and the decorations and the foolishly expensive finish the houses could be built round a court and the flats could be shaped something like a pompeiian house with small sleepingclosetsonly lit from the outsideand the rest of the floor thrown into two or three large cheerful halls where all the family life could go on and society could be transacted unpretentiously why those tenements are better and humaner than those flats there the whole family lives in the kitchen and has its consciousness of being but the flat abolishes the family consciousness its confinement without coziness its cluttered without being snug you couldnt keep a selfrespecting cat in a flat you couldnt go down cellar to get cider no the anglosaxon home as we know it in the anglosaxon house is simply impossible in the francoamerican flat not because its humble but because its false  well then said mrs march lets look at houses  he had been denouncing the flat in the abstract and he had not expected this concrete result but he said we will look at houses then     x  nothing mystifies a man more than a womans aberrations from some point at which he supposes her fixed as a star in these unfurnished houses without steam or elevator march followed his wife about with patient wonder she rather liked the worst of them best but she made him go down into the cellars and look at the furnaces she exacted from him a rigid inquest of the plumbing she followed him into one of the cellars by the fitful glare of successively lighted matches and they enjoyed a moment in which the anomaly of their presence there on that errand so remote from all the facts of their longestablished life in boston realized itself for them  think how easily we might have been murdered and nobody been any the wiser she said when they were comfortably outdoors again  yes or made way with ourselves in an access of emotional insanity supposed to have been induced by unavailing flathunting he suggested she fell in with the notion im beginning to feel crazy but i dont want you to lose your head basil and i dont want you to sentimentalize any of the things you see in new york i think you were disposed to do it in that street we drove through i dont believe theres any real sufferingnot real sufferingamong those people that is it would be suffering from our point of view but theyve been used to it all their lives and they dont feel their discomfort so much  of course i understand that and i dont propose to sentimentalize them i think when people get used to a bad state of things they had better stick to it in fact they dont usually like a better state so well and i shall keep that firmly in mind  she laughed with him and they walked along the l bestridden avenue exhilarated by their escape from murder and suicide in that cellar toward the nearest cross town track which they meant to take home to their hotel now tonight we will go to the theatre she said and get this whole house business out of our minds and be perfectly fresh for a new start in the morning suddenly she clutched his arm why did you see that man and she signed with her head toward a decently dressed person who walked beside them next the gutter stooping over as if to examine it and half halting at times  no what  why i saw him pick up a dirty bit of cracker from the pavement and cram it into his mouth and eat it down as if he were famished and look hes actually hunting for more in those garbage heaps  this was what the decentlooking man with the hard hands and broken nails of a workman was doinglike a hungry dog they kept up with him in the fascination of the sight to the next corner where he turned down the side street still searching the gutter  they walked on a few paces then march said i must go after him and left his wife standing  are you in wanthungry he asked the man  the man said he could not speak english monsieur  march asked his question in french  the man shrugged a pitiful desperate shrug mais monsieur  march put a coin in his hand and then suddenly the mans face twisted up he caught the hand of this almsgiver in both of his and clung to it monsieur monsieur he gasped and the tears rained down his face  his benefactor pulled himself away shocked and ashamed as one is by such a chance and got back to his wife and the man lapsed back into the mystery of misery out of which he had emerged  march felt it laid upon him to console his wife for what had happened of course we might live here for years and not see another case like that and of course there are twenty places where he could have gone for help if he had known where to find them  ah but its the possibility of his needing the help so badly as that she answered thats what i cant bear and i shall not come to a place where such things are possible and we may as well stop our househunting here at once  yes and what part of christendom will you live in such things are possible everywhere in our conditions  then we must change the conditions  oh no we must go to the theatre and forget them we can stop at brentanos for our tickets as we pass through union square  i am not going to the theatre basil i am going home to boston tonight you can stay and find a flat  he convinced her of the absurdity of her position and even of its selfishness but she said that her mind was quite made up irrespective of what had happened that she had been away from the children long enough that she ought to be at home to finish up the work of leaving it the word brought a sigh ah i dont know why we should see nothing but sad and ugly things now when we were young  younger he put in were still young  thats what we pretend but we know better but i was thinking how pretty and pleasant things used to be turning up all the time on our travels in the old days why when we were in new york here on our wedding journey the place didnt seem half so dirty as it does now and none of these dismal things happened  it was a good deal dirtier he answered and i fancy worse in every wayhungrier raggeder more wretchedly housed but that wasnt the period of life for us to notice it dont you remember when we started to niagara the last time how everybody seemed middleaged and commonplace and when we got there there were no evident brides nothing but elderly married people  at least they werent starving she rebelled  no you dont starve in parlorcars and firstclass hotels but if you step out of them you run your chance of seeing those who do if youre getting on pretty well in the forties if its the unhappy who see unhappiness think what misery must be revealed to people who pass their lives in the really squalid tenementhouse streetsi dont mean picturesque avenues like that we passed through  but we are not unhappy she protested bringing the talk back to the personal base again as women must to get any good out of talk were really no unhappier than we were when we were young  were more serious  well i hate it and i wish you wouldnt be so serious if thats what it brings us to  i will be trivial from this on said march shall we go to the hole in the ground tonight  i am going to boston  its much the same thing how do you like that for triviality its a little blasphemous ill allow  its very silly she said  at the hotel they found a letter from the agent who had sent them the permit to see mrs grosvenor greens apartment he wrote that she had heard they were pleased with her apartment and that she thought she could make the terms to suit she had taken her passage for europe and was very anxious to let the flat before she sailed she would call that evening at seven  mrs grosvenor green said mrs march which of the ten thousand flats is it basil  the gimcrackery he answered in the xenophon you know  well she may save herself the trouble i shall not see her or yesi must i couldnt go away without seeing what sort of creature could have planned that flyaway flat she must be a perfect  parachute march suggested  no anybody so light as that couldnt come down  well toy balloon  toy balloon will do for the present mrs march admitted but i feel that naught but herself can be her parallel for volatility  when mrs grosvenorgreens card came up they both descended to the hotel parlor which march said looked like the saloon of a moorish dayboat not that he knew of any such craft but the decorations were so saracenic and the architecture so hudson riverish they found there on the grand central divan a large lady whose vast smoothness placidity and plumpness set at defiance all their preconceptions of mrs grosvenor green so that mrs march distinctly paused with her card in her hand before venturing even tentatively to address her then she was astonished at the low calm voice in which mrs green acknowledged herself and slowly proceeded to apologize for calling it was not quite true that she had taken her passage for europe but she hoped soon to do so and she confessed that in the mean time she was anxious to let her flat she was a little worn out with the care of housekeepingmrs march breathed oh yes in the sigh with which ladies recognize one anothers martyrdomand mrs green had business abroad and she was going to pursue her art studies in paris she drew in mr ilcombs class now but the instruction was so much better in paris and as the superintendent seemed to think the price was the only objection she had ventured to call  then we didnt deceive him in the least thought mrs march while she answered sweetly no we were only afraid that it would be too small for our family we require a good many rooms she could not forego the opportunity of saying my husband is coming to new york to take charge of a literary periodical and he will have to have a room to write in which made mrs green bow to march and made march look sheepish but we did think the apartment very charming it was architecturally charming she protested to her conscience and we should have been so glad if we could have got into it she followed this with some account of their househunting amid soft murmurs of sympathy from mrs green who said that she had been through all that and that if she could have shown her apartment to them she felt sure that she could have explained it so that they would have seen its capabilities better mrs march assented to this and mrs green added that if they found nothing exactly suitable she would be glad to have them look at it again and then mrs march said that she was going back to boston herself but she was leaving mr march to continue the search and she had no doubt he would be only too glad to see the apartment by daylight but if you take it basil she warned him when they were alone i shall simply renounce you i wouldnt live in that junkshop if you gave it to me but who would have thought she was that kind of looking person though of course i might have known if i had stopped to think once its because the place doesnt express her at all that its so unlike her it couldnt be like anybody or anything that flies in the air or creeps upon the earth or swims in the waters under the earth i wonder where in the world shes from shes no newyorker even we can see that and shes not quite a country person either she seems like a person from some large town where shes been an aesthetic authority and she cant find good enough art instruction in new york and has to go to paris for it well its pathetic after all basil i cant help feeling sorry for a person who mistakes herself to that extent  i cant help feeling sorry for the husband of a person who mistakes herself to that extent what is mr grosvenor green going to do in paris while shes working her way into the salon  well you keep away from her apartment basil thats all ive got to say to you and yet i do like some things about her  i like everything about her but her apartment said march  i like her going to be out of the country said his wife we shouldnt be overlooked and the place was prettily shaped you cant deny it and there was an elevator and steam heat and the location is very convenient and there was a hallboy to bring up cards the halls and stairs were kept very clean and nice but it wouldnt do i could put you a folding bed in the room where you wrote and we could even have one in the parlor  behind a portiere i couldnt stand any more portieres  and we could squeeze the two girls into one room or perhaps only bring margaret and put out the whole of the wash basil she almost shrieked it isnt to be thought of  he retorted im not thinking of it my dear  fulkerson came in just before they started for mrs marchs train to find out what had become of them he said and to see whether they had got anything to live in yet  not a thing she said and im just going back to boston and leaving mr march here to do anything he pleases about it he has carte blanche  but freedom brings responsibility you know fulkerson and its the same as if id no choice im staying behind because im left not because i expect to do anything  is that so asked fulkerson well we must see what can be done i supposed you would be all settled by this time or i should have humped myself to find you something none of those places i gave you amounts to anything  as much as forty thousand others weve looked at said mrs march yes one of them does amount to something it comes so near being what we want that ive given mr march particular instructions not to go near it  she told him about mrs grosvenor green and her flats and at the end he said  well well we must look out for that ill keep an eye on him mrs march and see that he doesnt do anything rash and i wont leave him till hes found just the right thing it exists of course it must in a city of eighteen hundred thousand people and the only question is where to find it you leave him to me mrs march ill watch out for him  fulkerson showed some signs of going to the station when he found they were not driving but she bade him a peremptory goodbye at the hotel door  hes very nice basil and his way with you is perfectly charming its very sweet to see how really fond of you he is but i didnt want him stringing along with us up to fortysecond street and spoiling our last moments together  at third avenue they took the elevated for which she confessed an infatuation she declared it the most ideal way of getting about in the world and was not ashamed when he reminded her of how she used to say that nothing under the sun could induce her to travel on it she now said that the night transit was even more interesting than the day and that the fleeing intimacy you formed with people in second and third floor interiors while all the usual street life went on underneath had a domestic intensity mixed with a perfect repose that was the last effect of good society with all its security and exclusiveness he said it was better than the theatre of which it reminded him to see those people through their windows a family party of workfolk at a late tea some of the men in their shirtsleeves a woman sewing by a lamp a mother laying her child in its cradle a man with his head fallen on his hands upon a table a girl and her lover leaning over the windowsill together what suggestion what drama what infinite interest at the fortysecond street station they stopped a minute on the bridge that crosses the track to the branch road for the central depot and looked up and down the long stretch of the elevated to north and south the track that found and lost itself a thousand times in the flare and tremor of the innumerable lights the moony sheen of the electrics mixing with the reddish points and blots of gas far and near the architectural shapes of houses and churches and towers rescued by the obscurity from all that was ignoble in them and the coming and going of the trains marking the stations with vivider or fainter plumes of flameshot steamformed an incomparable perspective they often talked afterward of the superb spectacle which in a city full of painters nightly works its unrecorded miracles and they were just to the arachne roof spun in iron over the cross street on which they ran to the depot but for the present they were mostly inarticulate before it they had another moment of rich silence when they paused in the gallery that leads from the elevated station to the waitingrooms in the central depot and looked down upon the great night trains lying on the tracks dim under the rain of gaslights that starred without dispersing the vast darkness of the place what forces what fates slept in these bulks which would soon be hurling themselves north and south and west through the night now they waited there like fabled monsters of arab story ready for the magicians touch tractable reckless willlessorganized lifelessness full of a strange semblance of life  the marches admired the impressive sight with a thrill of patriotic pride in the fact that the whole world perhaps could not afford just the like then they hurried down to the ticketoffices and he got her a lower berth in the boston sleeper and went with her to the car they made the most of the fact that her berth was in the very middle of the car and she promised to write as soon as she reached home she promised also that having seen the limitations of new york in respect to flats she would not be hard on him if he took something not quite ideal only he must remember that it was not to be above twentieth street nor below washington square it must not be higher than the third floor it must have an elevator steam heat hailboys and a pleasant janitor these were essentials if he could not get them then they must do without but he must get them     xi  mrs march was one of those wives who exact a more rigid adherence to their ideals from their husbands than from themselves early in their married life she had taken charge of him in all matters which she considered practical she did not include the business of breadwinning in these that was an affair that might safely be left to his absentminded dreamy inefficiency and she did not interfere with him there but in such things as rehanging the pictures deciding on a summer boardingplace taking a seaside cottage repapering rooms choosing seats at the theatre seeing what the children ate when she was not at table shutting the cat out at night keeping run of calls and invitations and seeing if the furnace was dampered he had failed her so often that she felt she could not leave him the slightest discretion in regard to a flat her total distrust of his judgment in the matters cited and others like them consisted with the greatest admiration of his mind and respect for his character she often said that if he would only bring these to bear in such exigencies he would be simply perfect but she had long given up his ever doing so she subjected him therefore to an iron code but after proclaiming it she was apt to abandon him to the native lawlessness of his temperament she expected him in this event to do as he pleased and she resigned herself to it with considerable comfort in holding him accountable he learned to expect this and after suffering keenly from her disappointment with whatever he did he waited patiently till she forgot her grievance and began to extract what consolation lurks in the irreparable she would almost admit at moments that what he had done was a very good thing but she reserved the right to return in full force to her original condemnation of it and she accumulated each act of independent volition in witness and warning against him their mass oppressed but never deterred him he expected to do the wrong thing when left to his own devices and he did it without any apparent recollection of his former misdeeds and their consequences there was a good deal of comedy in it all and some tragedy  he now experienced a certain expansion such as husbands of his kind will imagine on going back to his hotel alone it was perhaps a revulsion from the pain of parting and he toyed with the idea of mrs grosvenor greens apartment which in its preposterous unsuitability had a strange attraction he felt that he could take it with less risk than anything else they had seen but he said he would look at all the other places in town first he really spent the greater part of the next day in hunting up the owner of an apartment that had neither steam heat nor an elevator but was otherwise perfect and trying to get him to take less than the agent asked by a curious psychical operation he was able in the transaction to work himself into quite a passionate desire for the apartment while he held the grosvenor green apartment in the background of his mind as something that he could return to as altogether more suitable he conducted some simultaneous negotiation for a furnished house which enhanced still more the desirability of the grosvenor green apartment toward evening he went off at a tangent far uptown so as to be able to tell his wife how utterly preposterous the best there would be as compared even with this ridiculous grosvenor green gimcrackery it is hard to report the processes of his sophistication perhaps this again may best be left to the marital imagination  he rang at the last of these uptown apartments as it was falling dusk and it was long before the janitor appeared then the man was very surly and said if he looked at the flat now he would say it was too dark like all the rest his reluctance irritated march in proportion to his insincerity in proposing to look at it at all he knew he did not mean to take it under any circumstances that he was going to use his inspection of it in dishonest justification of his disobedience to his wife but he put on an air of offended dignity if you dont wish to show the apartment he said i dont care to see it  the man groaned for he was heavy and no doubt dreaded the stairs he scratched a match on his thigh and led the way up march was sorry for him and he put his fingers on a quarter in his waistcoatpocket to give him at parting at the same time he had to trump up an objection to the flat this was easy for it was advertised as containing ten rooms and he found the number eked out with the bathroom and two large closets its light enough said march but i dont see how you make out ten rooms  theres ten rooms said the man deigning no proof  march took his fingers off the quarter and went downstairs and out of the door without another word it would be wrong it would be impossible to give the man anything after such insolence he reflected with shame that it was also cheaper to punish than forgive him  he returned to his hotel prepared for any desperate measure and convinced now that the grosvenor green apartment was not merely the only thing left for him but was on its own merits the best thing in new york  fulkerson was waiting for him in the readingroom and it gave march the curious thrill with which a man closes with temptation when he said look here why dont you take that womans flat in the xenophon shes been at the agents again and theyve been at me she likes your lookor mrs marchsand i guess you can have it at a pretty heavy discount from the original price im authorized to say you can have it for one seventyfive a month and i dont believe it would be safe for you to offer one fifty  march shook his head and dropped a mask of virtuous rejection over his corrupt acquiescence its too small for uswe couldnt squeeze into it  why look here fulkerson persisted how many rooms do you people want  ive got to have a place to work  of course and youve got to have it at the fifth wheel office  i hadnt thought of that march began i suppose i could do my work at the office as theres not much writing  why of course you cant do your work at home you just come round with me now and look at that again  no i cant do it  why  iive got to dine  all right said fulkerson dine with me i want to take you round to a little italian place that i know  one may trace the successive steps of marchs descent in this simple matter with the same edification that would attend the study of the selfdelusions and obfuscations of a man tempted to crime the process is probably not at all different and to the philosophical mind the kind of result is unimportant the process is everything  fulkerson led him down one block and half across another to the steps of a small dwellinghouse transformed like many others into a restaurant of the latin ideal with little or no structural change from the pattern of the lower middleclass new york home there were the corroded brownstone steps the mean little front door and the cramped entry with its narrow stairs by which ladies could go up to a diningroom appointed for them on the second floor the parlors on the first were set about with tables where men smoked cigarettes between the courses and a single waiter ran swiftly to and fro with plates and dishes and exchanged unintelligible outcries with a cook beyond a slide in the back parlor he rushed at the newcomers brushed the soiled tablecloth before them with a towel on his arm covered its worst stains with a napkin and brought them in their order the vermicelli soup the fried fish the cheesestrewn spaghetti the veal cutlets the tepid roast fowl and salad and the wizened pear and coffee which form the dinner at such places  ah this is nice said fulkerson after the laying of the charitable napkin and he began to recognize acquaintances some of whom he described to march as young literary men and artists with whom they should probably have to do others were simply frequenters of the place and were of all nationalities and religions apparentlyat least several were hebrews and cubans you get a pretty good slice of new york here he said all except the frosting on top that you wont find much at maronis though you will occasionally i dont mean the ladies ever of course the ladies present seemed harmless and reputablelooking people enough but certainly they were not of the first fashion and except in a few instances not americans its like cutting straight down through a fruitcake fulkerson went on or a mincepie when you dont know who made the pie you get a little of everything he ordered a small flask of chianti with the dinner and it came in its pretty wicker jacket march smiled upon it with tender reminiscence and fulkerson laughed lights you up a little i brought old dryfoos here one day and he thought it was sweetoil thats the kind of bottle they used to have it in at the country drugstores  yes i remember now but id totally forgotten it said march how far back that goes whos dryfoos  dryfoos fulkerson still smiling tore off a piece of the halfyard of french loaf which had been supplied them with two pale thin disks of butter and fed it into himself old dryfoos well of course i call him old but he aint so very about fifty or along there  no said march that isnt very oldor not so old as it used to be  well i suppose youve got to know about him anyway said fulkerson thoughtfully and ive been wondering just how i should tell you cant always make out exactly how much of a bostonian you really are ever been out in the naturalgas country  no said march ive had a good deal of curiosity about it but ive never been able to get away except in summer and then we always preferred to go over the old ground out to niagara and back through canada the route we took on our wedding journey the children like it as much as we do  yes yes said fulkerson well the naturalgas country is worth seeing i dont mean the pittsburg gasfields but out in northern ohio and indiana around moffittthats the place in the heart of the gas region that theyve been booming so yes you ought to see that country if you havent been west for a good many years you havent got any idea how old the country looks you remember how the fields used to be all full of stumps  i should think so  well you wont see any stumps now all that country out around moffitt is just as smooth as a checkerboard and looks as old as england you know how we used to burn the stumps out and then somebody invented a stumpextractor and we pulled them out with a yoke of oxen now they just touch em off with a little dynamite and theyve got a cellar dug and filled up with kindling ready for housekeeping whenever you want it only they havent got any use for kindling in that countryall gas i rode along on the cars through those level black fields at cornplanting time and every once in a while id come to a place with a piece of ragged old stovepipe stickin up out of the ground and blazing away like forty and a fellow ploughing all round it and not minding it any more than if it was spring violets horses didnt notice it either well theyve always known about the gas out there they say there are places in the woods where its been burning ever since the country was settled  but when you come in sight of moffittmy oh my well you come in smell of it about as soon that gas out there aint odorless like the pittsburg gas and so its perfectly safe but the smell isnt badabout as bad as the finest kind of benzine well the first thing that strikes you when you come to moffitt is the notion that there has been a good warm growing rain and the towns come up overnight thats in the suburbs the annexes and additions but it aint shabbyno shantyfarm business nice brick and frame houses some of em queen anne style and all of em looking as if they had come to stay and when you drive up from the depot you think everybodys moving everything seems to be piled into the street old houses made over and new ones going up everywhere you know the kind of street main street always used to be in our sectionhalf plankroad and turnpike and the rest mudhole and a lot of stores and doggeries strung along with false fronts a story higher than the back and here and there a decent building with the gable end to the public and a courthouse and jail and two taverns and three or four churches well theyre all there in moffitt yet but architecture has struck it hard and theyve got a lot of new buildings that neednt be ashamed of themselves anywhere the new courthouse is as big as st peters and the grand operahouse is in the highest style of the art you cant buy a lot on that street for much less than you can buy a lot in new yorkor you couldnt when the boom was on i saw the place just when the boom was in its prime i went out there to work the newspapers in the syndicate business and i got one of their men to write me a real bright snappy account of the gas and they just took me in their arms and showed me everything well it was wonderful and it was beautiful too to see a whole community stirred up like that wasjust like a big boy all hope and high spirits and no discount on the remotest future nothing but perpetual boom to the end of timei tell you it warmed your blood why there were some things about it that made you think what a nice kind of world this would be if people ever took hold together instead of each fellow fighting it out on his own hook and devil take the hindmost they made up their minds at moffitt that if they wanted their town to grow theyd got to keep their gas public property so they extended their corporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole gas region round there and then the city took possession of every well that was put down and held it for the common good anybody thats a mind to come to moffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas he wants free and for fifteen dollars a year you can have all the gas you want to heat and light your private house the people hold on to it for themselves and as i say its a grand sight to see a whole community hanging together and working for the good of all instead of splitting up into as many different cutthroats as there are ablebodied citizens see that fellow fulkerson broke off and indicated with a twirl of his head a short dark foreignlooking man going out of the door they say that fellows a socialist i think its a shame theyre allowed to come here if they dont like the way we manage our affairs let em stay at home fulkerson continued they do a lot of mischief shooting off their mouths round here i believe in free speech and all that but id like to see these fellows shut up in jail and left to jaw one another to death we dont want any of their poison  march did not notice the vanishing socialist he was watching with a teasing sense of familiarity a tall shabbily dressed elderly man who had just come in he had the aquiline profile uncommon among germans and yet march recognized him at once as german his long soft beard and mustache had once been fair and they kept some tone of their yellow in the gray to which they had turned his eyes were full and his lips and chin shaped the beard to the noble outline which shows in the beards the italian masters liked to paint for their last suppers his carriage was erect and soldierly and march presently saw that he had lost his left hand he took his place at a table where the overworked waiter found time to cut up his meat and put everything in easy reach of his right hand  well fulkerson resumed they took me round everywhere in moffitt and showed me their big wellslit em up for a private view and let me hear them purr with the soft accents of a massmeeting of locomotives why when they let one of these wells loose in a meadow that theyd piped it into temporarily it drove the flame away forty feet from the mouth of the pipe and blew it over half an acre of ground they say when they let one of their big wells burn away all winter before they had learned how to control it that well kept up a little summer all around it the grass stayed green and the flowers bloomed all through the winter i dont know whether its so or not but i can believe anything of natural gas my but it was beautiful when they turned on the full force of that well and shot a roman candle into the gasthats the way they light itand a plume of fire about twenty feet wide and seventyfive feet high all red and yellow and violet jumped into the sky and that big roar shook the ground under your feet you felt like saying  dont trouble yourself im perfectly convinced i believe in moffitt weeell drawled fulkerson with a long breath thats where i met old dryfoos  oh yesdryfoos said march he observed that the waiter had brought the old onehanded german a towering glass of beer  yes fulkerson laughed weve got round to dryfoos again i thought i could cut a long story short but i seem to be cutting a short story long if youre not in a hurry though  not in the least go on as long as you like  i met him there in the office of a realestate manspeculator of course everybody was in moffitt but a firstrate fellow and publicspirited as all getout and when dryfoos left he told me about him dryfoos was an old pennsylvania dutch farmer about three or four miles out of moffitt and hed lived there pretty much all his life father was one of the first settlers everybody knew he had the right stuff in him but he was slower than molasses in january like those pennsylvania dutch hed got together the largest and handsomest farm anywhere around there and he was making money on it just like he was in some business somewhere he was a very intelligent man he took the papers and kept himself posted but he was awfully oldfashioned in his ideas he hung on to the doctrines as well as the dollars of the dads it was a real thing with him well when the boom began to come he hated it awfully and he fought it he used to write communications to the weekly newspaper in moffitttheyve got three dailies there nowand throw cold water on the boom he couldnt catch on no way it made him sick to hear the clack that went on about the gas the whole while and that stirred up the neighborhood and got into his family whenever hed hear of a man that had been offered a big price for his land and was going to sell out and move into town hed go and labor with him and try to talk him out of it and tell him how long his fifteen or twenty thousand would last him to live on and shake the standard oil company before him and try to make him believe it wouldnt be five years before the standard owned the whole region  of course he couldnt do anything with them when a mans offered a big price for his farm he dont care whether its by a secret emissary from the standard oil or not hes going to sell and get the better of the other fellow if he can dryfoos couldnt keep the boom out of has own family even his wife was with him she thought whatever he said and did was just as right as if it had been thundered down from sinai but the young folks were sceptical especially the girls that had been away to school the boy that had been kept at home because he couldnt be spared from helping his father manage the farm was more like him but they contrived to stir the boy upwith the hot end of the boom too so when a fellow came along one day and offered old dryfoos a cool hundred thousand for his farm it was all up with dryfoos hed a liked to a kept the offer to himself and not done anything about it but his vanity wouldnt let him do that and when he let it out in his family the girls outvoted him they just made him sell  he wouldnt sell all he kept about eighty acres that was off in some piece by itself but the three hundred that had the old brick house on it and the big barnthat went and dryfoos bought him a place in moffitt and moved into town to live on the interest of his money just what he had scolded and ridiculed everybody else for doing well they say that at first he seemed like he would go crazy he hadnt anything to do he took a fancy to that landagent and he used to go and set in his office and ask him what he should do i haint got any horses i haint got any cows i haint got any pigs i haint got any chickens i haint got anything to do from sunup to sundown the fellow said the tears used to run down the old fellows cheeks and if he hadnt been so busy himself he believed he should a cried too but most o people thought old dryfoos was down in the mouth because he hadnt asked more for his farm when he wanted to buy it back and found they held it at a hundred and fifty thousand people couldnt believe he was just homesick and heartsick for the old place well perhaps he was sorry he hadnt asked more thats human nature too  after a while something happened that landagent used to tell dryfoos to get out to europe with his money and see life a little or go and live in washington where he could be somebody but dryfoos wouldnt and he kept listening to the talk there and all of a sudden he caught on he came into that fellows one day with a plan for cutting up the eighty acres hed kept into town lots and hed got it all plotted out sowell and had so many practical ideas about it that the fellow was astonished he went right in with him as far as dryfoos would let him and glad of the chance and they were working the thing for all it was worth when i struck moffitt old dryfoos wanted me to go out and see the dryfoos  hendry additionguess he thought maybe id write it up and he drove me out there himself well it was funny to see a town made streets driven through two rows of shadetrees hard and soft planted cellars dug and houses put upregular queen anne style too with stained glassall at once dryfoos apologized for the streets because they were handmade said they expected their streetmaking machine tuesday and then they intended to push things  fulkerson enjoyed the effect of his picture on march for a moment and then went on he was mighty intelligent too and he questioned me up about my business as sharp as i ever was questioned seemed to kind of strike his fancy i guess he wanted to find out if there was any money in it he was making money hand over hand then and he never stopped speculating and improving till hed scraped together three or four hundred thousand dollars they said a million but they like round numbers at moffitt and i guess half a million would lay over it comfortably and leave a few thousands to spare probably then he came on to new york  fulkerson struck a match against the ribbed side of the porcelain cup that held the matches in the centre of the table and lit a cigarette which he began to smoke throwing his head back with a leisurely effect as if he had got to the end of at least as much of his story as he meant to tell without prompting  march asked him the desired question what in the world for  fulkerson took out his cigarette and said with a smile to spend his money and get his daughters into the old knickerbocker society maybe he thought they were all the same kind of dutch  and has he succeeded  well theyre not social leaders yet but its only a question of timegeneration or twoespecially if times money and if every other week is the success its bound to be  you dont mean to say fulkerson said march with a halfdoubting halfdaunted laugh that hes your angel  thats what i mean to say returned fulkerson i ran onto him in broadway one day last summer if you ever saw anybody in your life youre sure to meet him in broadway again sooner or later thats the philosophy of the bunco business country people from the same neighborhood are sure to run up against each other the first time they come to new york i put out my hand and i said isnt this mr dryfoos from moffitt he didnt seem to have any use for my hand he let me keep it and he squared those old lips of his till his imperial stuck straight out ever see bernhardt in letrangere well the american husband is old dryfoos all over no mustache and haycolored chinwhiskers cut slanting froze the corners of his mouth he cocked his little gray eyes at me and says he yes young man my name is dryfoos and im from moffitt but i dont want no present of longfellows works illustrated and i dont want to taste no fine teas but i know a policeman that does and if youre the son of my old friend squire strohfeldt youd better get out well then said i how would you like to go into the newspaper syndicate business he gave another look at me and then he burst out laughing and he grabbed my hand and he just froze to it i never saw anybody so glad  well the long and the short of it was that i asked him round here to maronis to dinner and before we broke up for the night we had settled the financial side of the plan thats brought you to new york  i can see said fulkerson who had kept his eyes fast on marchs face that you dont more than half like the idea of dryfoos it ought to give you more confidence in the thing than you ever had you neednt be afraid he added with some feeling that i talked dryfoos into the thing for my own advantage  oh my dear fulkerson march protested all the more fervently because he was really a little guilty  well of course not i didnt mean you were but i just happened to tell him what i wanted to go into when i could see my way to it and he caught on of his own accord the fact is said fulkerson i guess id better make a clean breast of it now im at it dryfoos wanted to get something for that boy of his to do hes in railroads himself and hes in mines and other things and he keeps busy and he cant bear to have his boy hanging round the house doing nothing like as if he was a girl i told him that the great object of a rich man was to get his son into just that fix but he couldnt seem to see it and the boy hated it himself hes got a good head and he wanted to study for the ministry when they were all living together out on the farm but his father had the oldfashioned ideas about that you know they used to think that any sort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher out of but they wanted the good timber for business and so the old man wouldnt let him youll see the fellow youll like him hes no fool i can tell you and hes going to be our publisher nominally at first and actually when ive taught him the ropes a little     xii  fulkerson stopped and looked at march whom he saw lapsing into a serious silence doubtless he divined his uneasiness with the facts that had been given him to digest he pulled out his watch and glanced at it see here how would you like to go up to fortysixth street with me and drop in on old dryfoos nows your chance hes going west tomorrow and wont be back for a month or so theyll all be glad to see you and youll understand things better when youve seen him and his family i cant explain  march reflected a moment then he said with a wisdom that surprised him for he would have liked to yield to the impulse of his curiosity perhaps wed better wait till mrs march comes down and let things take the usual course the dryfoos ladies will want to call on her as the lastcomer and if i treated myself en garcon now and paid the first visit it might complicate matters  well perhaps youre right said fulkerson i dont know much about these things and i dont believe ma dryfoos does either he was on his legs lighting another cigarette i suppose the girls are getting themselves up in etiquette though well then lets have a look at the every other week building and then if you like your quarters there you can go round and close for mrs greens flat  marchs dormant allegiance to his wifes wishes had been roused by his decision in favor of good social usage i dont think i shall take the flat he said  well dont reject it without giving it another look anyway come on  he helped march on with his light overcoat and the little stir they made for their departure caught the notice of the old german he looked up from his beer at them march was more than ever impressed with something familiar in his face in compensation for his prudence in regard to the dryfooses he now indulged an impulse he stepped across to where the old man sat with his bald head shining like ivory under the gasjet and his fine patriarchal length of bearded mask taking picturesque lights and shadows and put out his hand to him  lindau isnt this mr lindau  the old man lifted himself slowly to his feet with mechanical politeness and cautiously took marchs hand yes my name is lindau he said slowly while he scanned marchs face then he broke into a long cry ahhhhh my dear poy my gong friendt mymyidt is passil marge not zo ah ha ha ha how gladt i am to zee you why i am gladt and you rememberdt me you remember schiller and goethe and uhland and indianapolis you still lif in indianapolis it sheers my hardt to zee you but you are lidtle oldt too tventyfive years makes a difference ah i am gladt dell me idt is passil marge not zo  he looked anxiously into marchs face with a gentle smile of mixed hope and doubt and march said as sure as its berthold lindau and i guess its you and you remember the old times you were as much of a boy as i was lindau are you living in new york do you recollect how you tried to teach me to fence i dont know how to this day lindau how good you were and how patient do you remember how we used to sit up in the little parlor back of your printingoffice and read die rauber and die theilung der erde and die glocke and mrs lindau is she with  deadtdeadt long ago right after i got home from the wartventy years ago but tell me you are married children yes goodt and how oldt are you now  it makes me seventeen to see you lindau but ive got a son nearly as old  ah ha ha goodt and where do you lif  well im just coming to live in new york march said looking over at fulkerson who had been watching his interview with the perfunctory smile of sympathy that people put on at the meeting of old friends i want to introduce you to my friend mr fulkerson he and i are going into a literary enterprise here  ah zo said the old man with polite interest he took fulkersons proffered hand and they all stood talking a few moments together  then fulkerson said with another look at his watch well march were keeping mr lindau from his dinner  dinner cried the old man idts better than breadt and meadt to see mr marge  i must be going anyway said march but i must see you again soon lindau where do you live i want a long talk  and i you will find me here at dinnertime said the old man it is the best place and march fancied him reluctant to give another address  to cover his consciousness he answered gayly then its auf wiedersehen with us well  also the old man took his hand and made a mechanical movement with his mutilated arm as if he would have taken it in a double clasp he laughed at himself i wanted to gif you the other handt too but i gafe it to your gountry a goodt while ago  to my country asked march with a sense of pain and yet lightly as if it were a joke of the old mans your country too lindau  the old man turned very grave and said almost coldly what gountry hass a poor man got mr marge  well you ought to have a share in the one you helped to save for us rich men lindau march returned still humoring the joke  the old man smiled sadly but made no answer as he sat down again  seems to be a little soured said fulkerson as they went down the steps he was one of those americans whose habitual conception of life is unalloyed prosperity when any experience or observation of his went counter to it he sufferedsomething like physical pain he eagerly shrugged away the impression left upon his buoyancy by lindau and added to marchs continued silence what did i tell you about meeting every man in new york that you ever knew before  i never expected to meat lindau in the world again said march more to himself than to fulkerson i had an impression that he had been killed in the war i almost wish he had been  oh hello now cried fulkerson  march laughed but went on soberly he was a man predestined to adversity though when i first knew him out in indianapolis he was starving along with a sick wife and a sick newspaper it was before the germans had come over to the republicans generally but lindau was fighting the antislavery battle just as naturally at indianapolis in 1858 as he fought behind the barricades at berlin in 1848 and yet he was always such a gentle soul and so generous he taught me german for the love of it he wouldnt spoil his pleasure by taking a cent from me he seemed to get enough out of my being young and enthusiastic and out of prophesying great things for me i wonder what the poor old fellow is doing here with that one hand of his  not amassing a very handsome pittance i guess as artemus ward would say said fulkerson getting back some of his lightness there are lots of twohanded fellows in new york that are not doing much better i guess maybe he gets some writing on the german papers  i hope so hes one of the most accomplished men he used to be a splendid musicianpianistand knows eight or ten languages  well its astonishing said fulkerson how much lumber those germans can carry around in their heads all their lives and never work it up into anything its a pity they couldnt do the acquiring and let out the use of their learning to a few bright americans we could make things hum if we could arrange em that way  he talked on unheeded by march who went along halfconsciously tormented by his lightness in the pensive memories the meeting with lindau had called up was this all that sweet unselfish nature could come to what a homeless old age at that meagre italian table dhote with that tall glass of beer for a halfhours oblivion that shabby dress that pathetic mutilation he must have a pension twelve dollars a month or eighteen from a grateful country but what else did he eke out with  well here we are said fulkerson cheerily he ran up the steps before march and opened the carpenters temporary valve in the door frame and led the way into a darkness smelling sweetly of unpainted woodwork and newly dried plaster their feat slipped on shavings and grated on sand he scratched a match and found a candle and then walked about up and down stairs and lectured on the advantages of the place he had fitted up bachelor apartments for himself in the house and said that he was going to have a flat to let on the top floor i didnt offer it to you because i supposed youd be too proud to live over your shop and its too small anyway only five rooms  yes thats too small said march shirking the other point  well then heres the room i intend for your office said fulkerson showing him into a large back parlor one flight up youll have it quiet from the street noises here and you can be at home or not as you please therell be a boy on the stairs to find out now you see this makes the grosvenor green flat practicable if you want it  march felt the forces of fate closing about him and pushing him to a decision he feebly fought them off till he could have another look at the flat then baked and subdued still more by the unexpected presence of mrs grosvenor green herself who was occupying it so as to be able to show it effectively he took it he was aware more than ever of its absurdities he knew that his wife would never cease to hate it but he had suffered one of those eclipses of the imagination to which men of his temperament are subject and into which he could see no future for his desires he felt a comfort in irretrievably committing himself and exchanging the burden of indecision for the burden of responsibility  i dont know said fulkerson as they walked back to his hotel together but you might fix it up with that lone widow and her pretty daughter to take part of their house here he seemed to be reminded of it by the fact of passing the house and march looked up at its dark front he could not have told exactly why he felt a pang of remorse at the sight and doubtless it was more regret for having taken the grosvenor green flat than for not having taken the widows rooms still he could not forget her wistfulness when his wife and he were looking at them and her disappointment when they decided against them he had toyed in his aftertalk to mrs march with a sort of hypothetical obligation they had to modify their plans so as to meet the widows want of just such a family as theirs they had both said what a blessing it would be to her and what a pity they could not do it but they had decided very distinctly that they could not now it seemed to him that they might and he asked himself whether he had not actually departed as much from their ideal as if he had taken board with the widow suddenly it seemed to him that his wife asked him this too  i reckon said fulkerson that she could have arranged to give you your meals in your rooms and it would have come to about the same thing as housekeeping  no sort of boarding can be the same as housekeeping said march i want my little girl to have the run of a kitchen and i want the whole family to have the moral effect of housekeeping its demoralizing to board in every way it isnt a home if anybody else takes the care of it off your hands  well i suppose so fulkerson assented but marchs words had a hollow ring to himself and in his own mind he began to retaliate his dissatisfaction upon fulkerson  he parted from him on the usual terms outwardly but he felt obscurely abused by fulkerson in regard to the dryfooses father and son he did not know but fulkerson had taken an advantage of him in allowing him to commit himself to their enterprise with out fully and frankly telling him who and what his backer was he perceived that with young dryfoos as the publisher and fulkerson as the general director of the paper there might be very little play for his own ideas of its conduct perhaps it was the hurt to his vanity involved by the recognition of this fact that made him forget how little choice he really had in the matter and how since he had not accepted the offer to edit the insurance paper nothing remained for him but to close with fulkerson in this moment of suspicion and resentment he accused fulkerson of hastening his decision in regard to the grosvenor green apartment he now refused to consider it a decision and said to himself that if he felt disposed to do so he would send mrs green a note reversing it in the morning but he put it all off till morning with his clothes when he went to bed he put off even thinking what his wife would say he cast fulkerson and his constructive treachery out of his mind too and invited into it some pensive reveries of the past when he still stood at the parting of the ways and could take this path or that in his middle life this was not possible he must follow the path chosen long ago wherever it led he was not master of himself as he once seemed but the servant of those he loved if he could do what he liked perhaps he might renounce this whole new york enterprise and go off somewhere out of the reach of care but he could not do what he liked that was very clear in the pathos of this conviction he dwelt compassionately upon the thought of poor old lindau he resolved to make him accept a handsome sum of moneymore than he could spare something that he would feel the loss ofin payment of the lessons in german and fencing given so long ago at the usual rate for such lessons his debt with interest for twentyodd years would run very far into the hundreds too far he perceived for his wifes joyous approval he determined not to add the interest or he believed that lindau would refuse the interest he put a fine speech in his mouth making him do so and after that he got lindau employment on every other week and took care of him till he died  through all his melancholy and munificence he was aware of sordid anxieties for having taken the grosvenor green apartment these began to assume visible tangible shapes as he drowsed and to became personal entities from which he woke with little starts to a realization of their true nature and then suddenly fell fast asleep  in the accomplishment of the events which his reverie played with there was much that retroactively stamped it with prophecy but much also that was better than he forboded he found that with regard to the grosvenor green apartment he had not allowed for his wifes willingness to get any sort of roof over her head again after the removal from their old home or for the alleviations that grow up through mere custom the practical workings of the apartment were not so bad it had its good points and after the first sensation of oppression in it they began to feel the convenience of its arrangement they were at that time of life when people first turn to their childrens opinion with deference and in the loss of keenness in their own likes and dislikes consult the young preferences which are still so sensitive it went far to reconcile mrs march to the apartment that her children were pleased with its novelty when this wore off for them she had herself begun to find it much more easily manageable than a house after she had put away several barrels of gimcracks and folded up screens and rugs and skins and carried them all off to the little dark storeroom which the flat developed she perceived at once a roominess and coziness in it unsuspected before then when people began to call she had a pleasure a superiority in saying that it was a furnished apartment and in disclaiming all responsibility for the upholstery and decoration if march was by she always explained that it was mr marchs fancy and amiably laughed it off with her callers as a mannish eccentricity nobody really seemed to think it otherwise than pretty and this again was a triumph for mrs march because it showed how inferior the new york taste was to the boston taste in such matters  march submitted silently to his punishment and laughed with her before company at his own eccentricity she had been so preoccupied with the adjustment of the family to its new quarters and circumstances that the time passed for laying his misgivings if they were misgivings about fulkerson before her and when an occasion came for expressing them they had themselves passed in the anxieties of getting forward the first number of every other week he kept these from her too and the business that brought them to new york had apparently dropped into abeyance before the questions of domestic economy that presented and absented themselves march knew his wife to be a woman of good mind and in perfect sympathy with him but he understood the limitations of her perspective and if he was not too wise he was too experienced to intrude upon it any affairs of his till her own were reduced to the right order and proportion it would have been folly to talk to her of fulkersons conjecturable uncandor while she was in doubt whether her cook would like the kitchen or her two servants would consent to room together and till it was decided what school tom should go to and whether bella should have lessons at home or not the relation which march was to bear to the dryfooses as owner and publisher was not to be discussed with his wife he might drag it in but he was aware that with her mind distracted by more immediate interests he could not get from her that judgment that reasoned divination which he relied upon so much she would try she would do her best but the result would be a view clouded and discolored by the effort she must make  he put the whole matter by and gave himself to the details of the work before him in this he found not only escape but reassurance for it became more and more apparent that whatever was nominally the structure of the business a man of his qualifications and his instincts could not have an insignificant place in it he had also the consolation of liking his work and of getting an instant grasp of it that grew constantly firmer and closer the joy of knowing that he had not made a mistake was great in giving rein to ambitions long forborne he seemed to get back to the youth when he had indulged them first and after half a lifetime passed in pursuits alien to his nature he was feeling the serene happiness of being mated through his work to his early love from the outside the spectacle might have had its pathos and it is not easy to justify such an experiment as he had made at his time of life except upon the ground where he rested from its considerationthe ground of necessity  his work was more in his thoughts than himself however and as the time for the publication of the first number of his periodical came nearer his cares all centred upon it without fixing any date fulkerson had announced it and pushed his announcements with the shameless vigor of a born advertiser he worked his interest with the press to the utmost and paragraphs of a variety that did credit to his ingenuity were afloat everywhere some of them were speciously unfavorable in tone they criticised and even ridiculed the principles on which the new departure in literary journalism was based others defended it others yet denied that this rumored principle was really the principle all contributed to make talk all proceeded from the same fertile invention  march observed with a degree of mortification that the talk was very little of it in the new york press there the references to the novel enterprise were slight and cold but fulkerson said dont mind that old man its the whole country that makes or breaks a thing like this new york has very little to do with it now if it were a play it would be different new york does make or break a play but it doesnt make or break a book it doesnt make or break a magazine the great mass of the readers are outside of new york and the rural districts are what we have got to go for they dont read much in new york they write and talk about what theyve written dont you worry  the rumor of fulkersons connection with the enterprise accompanied many of the paragraphs and he was able to stay marchs thirst for employment by turning over to him from day to day heaps of the manuscripts which began to pour in from his old syndicate writers as well as from adventurous volunteers all over the country with these in hand march began practically to plan the first number and to concrete a general scheme from the material and the experience they furnished they had intended to issue the first number with the new year and if it had been an affair of literature alone it would have been very easy but it was the art leg they limped on as fulkerson phrased it they had not merely to deal with the question of specific illustrations for this article or that but to decide the whole character of their illustrations and first of all to get a design for a cover which should both ensnare the heedless and captivate the fastidious these things did not come properly within marchs provincethat had been clearly understoodand for a while fulkerson tried to run the art leg himself the phrase was again his but it was simpler to make the phrase than to run the leg the difficult generation at once stiffbacked and slippery with which he had to do in this endeavor reduced even so buoyant an optimist to despair and after wasting some valuable weeks in trying to work the artists himself he determined to get an artist to work them but what artist it could not be a man with fixed reputation and a following he would be too costly and would have too many enemies among his brethren even if he would consent to undertake the job fulkerson had a man in mind an artist too who would have been the very thing if he had been the thing at all he had talent enough and his sort of talent would reach round the whole situation but as fulkerson said he was as many kinds of an ass as he was kinds of an artist     pg editors bookmarks      anticipative homesickness     any sort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher out of     appearance made him doubt their ability to pay so much     as much of his story as he meant to tell without prompting     considerable comfort in holding him accountable     extract what consolation lurks in the irreparable     flavors not very sharply distinguished from one another     handsome pittance     he expected to do the wrong thing when left to his own devices     hypothetical difficulty     neverblooming shrub     poverty as hopeless as any in the world     seeming interested in points necessarily indifferent to him     servant

homesick for them but failed     turn to their childrens opinion with deference     wish we didnt always recognize the facts as we do     a hazard of new fortunes  by william dean howells     part second  i  the evening when march closed with mrs greens reduced offer and decided to take her apartment the widow whose lodgings he had rejected sat with her daughter in an upper room at the back of her house in the shaded glow of the droplight she was sewing and the girl was drawing at the same table from time to time as they talked the girl lifted her head and tilted it a little on one side so as to get some desired effect of her work  its a mercy the cold weather holds off said the mother we should have to light the furnace unless we wanted to scare everybody away with a cold house and i dont know who would take care of it or what would become of us every way  they seem to have been scared away from a house that wasnt cold said the girl perhaps they might like a cold one but its too early for cold yet its only just in the beginning of november  the messenger says theyve had a sprinkling of snow  oh yes at st barnaby i dont know when they dont have sprinklings of snow there im awfully glad we havent got that winter before us  the widow sighed as mothers do who feel the contrast their experience opposes to the hopeful recklessness of such talk as this we may have a worse winter here she said darkly  then i couldnt stand it said the girl and i should go in for lighting out to florida doublequick  and how would you get to florida demanded her mother severely  oh by the usual conveyance pullman vestibuled train i suppose what makes you so blue mamma the girl was all the time sketching away rubbing out lifting her head for the effect and then bending it over her work again without looking at her mother  i am not blue alma but i cannot endure thisthis hopefulness of yours  why what harm does it do  harm echoed the mother  pending the effort she must make in saying the girl cut in yes harm youve kept your despair dusted off and ready for use at an instants notice ever since we came and what good has it done im going to keep on hoping to the bitter end thats what papa did  it was what the rev archibald leighton had done with all the consumptives buoyancy the morning he died he told them that now he had turned the point and was really going to get well the cheerfulness was not only in his disease but in his temperament its excess was always a little against him in his church work and mrs leighton was right enough in feeling that if it had not been for the ballast of her instinctive despondency he would have made shipwreck of such small chances of prosperity as befell him in life it was not from him that his daughter got her talent though he had left her his temperament intact of his widows legal thirds he was one of those men of whom the country people say when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him mrs leighton had long eked out their income by taking a summer boarder or two as a great favor into her family and when the greater need came she frankly gave up her house to the summerfolks as they call them in the country and managed it for their comfort from the small quarter of it in which she shut herself up with her daughter  the notion of shutting up is an exigency of the rounded period the fact is of course that alma leighton was not shut up in any sense whatever she was the pervading light if not force of the house she was a good cook and she managed the kitchen with the help of an irish girl while her mother looked after the rest of the housekeeping but she was not systematic she had inspiration but not discipline and her mother mourned more over the days when alma left the whole dinner to the irish girl than she rejoiced in those when one of almas great thoughts took form in a chickenpie of incomparable savor or in a matchless pudding the offdays came when her artistic nature was expressing itself in charcoal for she drew to the admiration of all among the lady boarders who could not draw the others had their reserves they readily conceded that alma had genius but they were sure she needed instruction on the other hand they were not so radical as to agree with the old painter who came every summer to paint the elms of the st barnaby meadows he contended that she needed to be a man in order to amount to anything but in this theory he was opposed by an authority of his own sex whom the lady sketchers believed to speak with more impartiality in a matter concerning them as much as alma leighton he said that instruction would do and he was not only younger and handsomer but he was fresher from the schools than old harrington who even the lady sketchers could see painted in an obsolescent manner his name was beatonangus beaton but he was not scotch or not more scotch than mary queen of scots was his father was a scotchman but beaton was born in syracuse new york and it had taken only three years in paris to obliterate many traces of native and ancestral manner in him he wore his black beard cut shorter than his mustache and a little pointed he stood with his shoulders well thrown back and with a lateral curve of his person when he talked about art which would alone have carried conviction even if he had not had a thick dark bang coming almost to the brows of his mobile gray eyes and had not spoken english with quick staccato impulses so as to give it the effect of epigrammatic and sententious french one of the ladies said that you always thought of him as having spoken french after it was over and accused herself of wrong in not being able to feel afraid of him none of the ladies was afraid of him though they could not believe that he was really so deferential to their work as he seemed and they knew when he would not criticise mr harringtons work that he was just acting from principle  they may or may not have known the deference with which he treated almas work but the girl herself felt that his abrupt impersonal comment recognized her as a real sister in art he told her she ought to come to new york and draw in the league or get into some painters private class and it was the sense of duty thus appealed to which finally resulted in the hazardous experiment she and her mother were now making there were no logical breaks in the chain of their reasoning from past success with boarders in st barnaby to future success with boarders in new york of course the outlay was much greater the rent of the furnished house they had taken was such that if they failed their experiment would be little less than ruinous  but they were not going to fail that was what alma contended with a hardy courage that her mother sometimes felt almost invited failure if it did not deserve it she was one of those people who believe that if you dread harm enough it is less likely to happen she acted on this superstition as if it were a religion  if it had not been for my despair as you call it alma she answered i dont know where we should have been now  i suppose we should have been in st barnaby said the girl and if its worse to be in new york you see what your despairs done mamma but whats the use you meant well and i dont blame you you cant expect even despair to come out always just the way you want it perhaps youve used too much of it the girl laughed and mrs leighton laughed too like every one else she was not merely a prevailing mood as people are apt to be in books but was an irregularly spheroidal character with surfaces that caught the different lights of circumstance and reflected them alma got up and took a pose before the mirror which she then transferred to her sketch the room was pinned about with other sketches which showed with fantastic indistinctness in the shaded gaslight alma held up the drawing how do you like it  mrs leighton bent forward over her sewing to look at it youve got the mans face rather weak  yes thats so either i see all the hidden weakness thats in mens natures and bring it to the surface in their figures or else i put my own weakness into them either way its a drawback to their presenting a truly manly appearance as long as i have one of the miserable objects before me i can draw him but as soon as his backs turned i get to putting ladies into mens clothes i should think youd be scandalized mamma if you were a really feminine person it must be your despair that helps you to bear up but whats the matter with the young lady in young ladys clothes any dust on her  what expressions said mrs leighton really alma for a refined girl you are the most unrefined  go onabout the girl in the picture said alma slightly knocking her mother on the shoulder as she stood over her  i dont see anything to her whats she doing  oh just being made love to i suppose  shes perfectly insipid  youre awfully articulate mamma now if mr wetmore were to criticise that picture hed draw a circle round it in the air and look at it through that and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other and then look at you as if you were a figure in it and then collapse awhile and moan a little and gasp isnt your young lady a little tootoo and then hed try to get the word out of you and groan and suffer some more and youd say she is rather and that would give him courage and hed say i dont mean that shes so very of course not you understand perfectly i see it myself now well thenand hed take your pencil and begin to drawi should give her a little moreah yes i see the differenceyou see the difference and hed go off to some one else and youd know that youd been doing the wishywashiest thing in the world though he hadnt spoken a word of criticism and couldnt but he wouldnt have noticed the expression at all hed have shown you where your drawing was bad he doesnt care for what he calls the literature of a thing he says that will take care of itself if the drawings good he doesnt like my doing these chic things but im going to keep it up for i think its the nearest way to illustrating  she took her sketch and pinned it up on the door  and has mr beaton been about yet asked her mother  no said the girl with her back still turned and she added i believe hes in new york mr wetmores seen him  its a little strange he doesnt call  it would be if he were not an artist but artists never do anything like other people he was on his good behavior while he was with us and hes a great deal more conventional than most of them but even he cant keep it up thats what makes me really think that women can never amount to anything in art they keep all their appointments and fulfil all their duties just as if they didnt know anything about art well most of them dont weve got that new model today  what new model  the one mr wetmore was telling us about the old german hes splendid hes got the most beautiful head just like the old masters things he used to be humphrey williamss model for his biblicalpieces but since hes dead the old man hardly gets anything to do mr wetmore says there isnt anybody in the bible that williams didnt paint him as hes the law and the prophets in all his old testament pictures and hes joseph peter judas iscariot and the scribes and pharisees in the new  its a good thing people dont know how artists work or some of the most sacred pictures would have no influence said mrs leighton  why of course not cried the girl and the influence is the last thing a painter thinks ofor supposes he thinks of what he knows hes anxious about is the drawing and the color but people will never understand how simple artists are when i reflect what a complex and sophisticated being i am im afraid i can never come to anything in art or i should be if i hadnt genius  do you think mr beaton is very simple asked mrs leighton  mr wetmore doesnt think hes very much of an artist he thinks he talks too well they believe that if a man can express himself clearly he cant paint  and what do you believe  oh i can express myself too  the mother seemed to be satisfied with this evasion after a while she said i presume he will call when he gets settled  the girl made no answer to this one of the girls says that old model is an educated man he was in the war and lost a hand doesnt it seem a pity for such a man to have to sit to a class of affected geese like us as a model i declare it makes me sick and we shall keep him a week and pay him six or seven dollars for the use of his grand old head and then what will he do the last time he was regularly employed was when mr mace was working at his damascus massacre then he wanted so many arab sheiks and christian elders that he kept old mr lindau steadily employed for six months now he has to pick up odd jobs where he can  i suppose he has his pension said mrs leighton  no one of the girlsthat was the way alma always described her fellowstudentssays he has no pension he didnt apply for it for a long time and then there was a hitch about it and it was somethingedvetoed i believe she said  who vetoed it asked mrs leighton with some curiosity about the process which she held in reserve  i dont knowwhoever vetoes things i wonder what mr wetmore does think of ushis class we must seem perfectly crazy there isnt one of us really knows what shes doing it for or what she expects to happen when shes done it i suppose every one thinks she has genius i know the nebraska widow does for she says that unless you have genius it isnt the least use everybodys puzzled to know what she does with her baby when shes at workwhether she gives it soothing syrup i wonder how mr wetmore can keep from laughing in our faces i know he does behind our backs  mrs leightons mind wandered back to another point then if he says mr beaton cant paint i presume he doesnt respect him very much  oh he never said he couldnt paint but i know he thinks so he says hes an excellent critic  alma her mother said with the effect of breaking off what do you suppose is the reason he hasnt been near us  why i dont know mamma except that it would have been natural for another person to come and hes an artist at least artist enough for that  that doesnt account for it altogether he was very nice at st barnaby and seemed so interested in youyour work  plenty of people were nice at st barnaby that rich mrs horn couldnt contain her joy when she heard we were coming to new york but she hasnt poured in upon us a great deal since we got here  but thats different shes very fashionable and shes taken up with her own set but mr beatons one of our kind  thank you papa wasnt quite a tombstonecutter mamma  that makes it all the harder to bear he cant be ashamed of us perhaps he doesnt know where we are  do you wish to send him your card mamma the girl flushed and towered in scorn of the idea  why no alma returned her mother  well then said alma  but mrs leighton was not so easily quelled she had got her mind on mr beaton and she could not detach it at once besides she was one of those women they are commoner than the same sort of men whom it does not pain to take out their most intimate thoughts and examine them in the light of other peoples opinions but i dont see how he can behave so he must know that  that what mamma demanded the girl  that he influenced us a great deal in coming  he didnt if he dared to presume to think such a thing  now alma said her mother with the clinging persistence of such natures you know he did and its no use for you to pretend that we didnt count upon him inin every way you may not have noticed his attentions and i dont say you did but others certainly did and i must say that i didnt expect he would drop us so  drop us cried alma in a fury oh  yes drop us alma he must know where we are of course mr wetmores spoken to him about you and its a shame that he hasnt been near us i should have thought common gratitude common decency would have brought him afterafter all we did for him  we did nothing for himnothing he paid his board and that ended it  no it didnt alma you know what he used to sayabout its being like home and all that and i must say that after his attentions to you and all the things you told me he said i expected something very dif  a sharp peal of the doorbell thrilled through the house and as if the pull of the bellwire had twitched her to her feet mrs leighton sprang up and grappled with her daughter in their common terror  they both glared at the clock and made sure that it was five minutes after nine then they abandoned themselves some moments to the unrestricted play of their apprehensions     ii  why alma whispered the mother who in the world can it be at this time of night you dont suppose he  well im not going to the door anyhow mother i dont care who it is and of course he wouldnt be such a goose as to come at this hour she put on a look of miserable trepidation and shrank back from the door while the hum of the bell died away in the hall  what shall we do asked mrs leighton helplessly  let him go awaywhoever they are said alma  another and more peremptory ring forbade them refuge in this simple expedient  oh dear what shall we do perhaps its a despatch  the conjecture moved alma to no more than a rigid stare i shall not go she said a third ring more insistent than the others followed and she said you go ahead mamma and ill come behind to scream if its anybody we can look through the sidelights at the door first  mrs leighton fearfully led the way from the back chamber where they bad been sitting and slowly descended the stairs alma came behind and turned up the hall gasjet with a sudden flash that made them both jump a little the gas inside rendered it more difficult to tell who was on the threshold but mrs leighton decided from a timorous peep through the scrims that it was a lady and gentleman something in this distribution of sex emboldened her she took her life in her hand and opened the door  the lady spoke does mrs leighton live heah she said in a rich throaty voice and she feigned a reference to the agents permit she held in her hand  yes said mrs leighton she mechanically occupied the doorway while alma already quivered behind her with impatience of her impoliteness  oh said the lady who began to appear more and more a young lady ah didnt know but ah had mistaken the hoase ah suppose its rather late to see the apawtments and ah most ask you to pawdon us she put this tentatively with a delicately growing recognition of mrs leighton as the lady of the house and a humorous intelligence of the situation in the glance she threw alma over her mothers shoulder ahm afraid we most have frightened you  oh not at all said alma and at the same time her mother said will you walk in please  the gentleman promptly removed his hat and made the leightons an inclusive bow you awe very kind madam and i am sorry for the trouble we awe giving you he was tall and severelooking with a gray trooperish mustache and irongray hair and as alma decided irongray eyes his daughter was short plump and freshcolored with an effect of liveliness that did not all express itself in her broadvowelled rather formal speech with its odd valuations of some of the auxiliary verbs and its total elision of the canine letter  we awe from the soath she said and we arrived this mawning but we got this cyahd from the brokah just befo dinnah and so we awe rathah late  not at all its only nine oclock said mrs leighton she looked up from the card the young lady had given her and explained we havent got in our servants yet and we had to answer the bell ourselves and  you were frightened of coase said the young lady caressingly  the gentleman said they ought not to have come so late and he offered some formal apologies  we should have been just as much scared any time after five oclock alma said to the sympathetic intelligence in the girls face  she laughed out of coase ah would have my hawt in my moath all day long too if ah was living in a big hoase alone  a moment of stiffness followed mrs leighton would have liked to withdraw from the intimacy of the situation but she did not know how it was very well for these people to assume to be what they pretended but she reflected too late she had no proof of it except the agents permit they were all standing in the hall together and she prolonged the awkward pause while she examined the permit you are mr woodburn she asked in a way that alma felt implied he might not be  yes madam from charlottesboag virginia he answered with the slight umbrage a man shows when the strange cashier turns his check over and questions him before cashing it  alma writhed internally but outwardly remained subordinate she examined the other girls dress and decided in a superficial consciousness that she had made her own bonnet  i shall be glad to show you my rooms said mrs leighton with an irrelevant sigh you must excuse their being not just as i should wish them were hardly settled yet  dont speak of it madam said the gentleman if you can overlook the trouble we awe giving you at such an unseasonable houah  ahm a hoasekeepah mahself miss woodburn joined in and ah know ho to accyoant fo everything  mrs leighton led the way upstairs and the young lady decided upon the large front room and small side room on the third story she said she could take the small one and the other was so large that her father could both sleep and work in it she seemed not ashamed to ask if mrs leightons price was inflexible but gave way laughing when her father refused to have any bargaining with a haughty selfrespect which he softened to deference for mrs leighton his impulsiveness opened the way for some confidence from her and before the affair was arranged she was enjoying in her quality of clerical widow the balm of the virginians reverent sympathy they said they were church people themselves  ah dont know what yo mothah means by yo hoase not being in oddah the young lady said to alma as they went downstairs together ahm a great hoasekeepah mahself and ah mean what ah say  they had all turned mechanically into the room where the leightons were sitting when the woodburns rang mr woodburn consented to sit down and he remained listening to mrs leighton while his daughter bustled up to the sketches pinned round the room and questioned alma about them  ah suppose you awe going to be a great awtust she said in friendly banter when alma owned to having done the things ahve a great notion to take a few lessons mahself whos yo teachah  alma said she was drawing in mr wetmores class and miss woodburn said well its just beautiful miss leighton its grand ah suppose its raght expensive now mah goodness we have to cyoant the coast so much nowadays it seems to me we do nothing but cyoant it ahd like to hah something once without askin the price  well if you didnt ask it said alma i dont believe mr wetmore would ever know what the price of his lessons was he has to think when you ask him  why he most be chomming said miss woodburn perhaps ah maght get the lessons for nothing from him well ah believe in my soul ahll trah now ho did you begin and ho do you expect to get anything oat of it she turned on alma eyes brimming with a shrewd mixture of fun and earnest and alma made note of the fact that she had an early nineteenthcentury face round arch a little coquettish but extremely sensible and unspoiledlooking such as used to be painted a good deal in miniature at that period a tendency of her brown hair to twine and twist at the temples helped the effect a high comb would have completed it alma felt if she had her bonnet off it was almost a yankee countrygirl type but perhaps it appeared so to alma because it was like that pure anglosaxon alma herself with her dull dark skin slender in figure slow in speech with aristocratic forms in her long hands and the oval of her fine face pointed to a long chin felt herself much more southern in style than this blooming bubbling bustling virginian  i dont know she answered slowly  going to take potraits suggested miss woodburn or just paint the ahdeal a demure burlesque lurked in her tone  i suppose i dont expect to paint at all said alma im going to illustrate booksif anybody will let me  ah should think theyd just joamp at you said miss woodburn ahll tell you what lets do miss leighton you make some pictures and ahll wrahte a book fo them ahve got to do something ali maght as well wrahte a book you know we southerners have all had to go to woak but ah dont mand it i tell papa i shouldnt ca fo the disgrace of bein poo if it wasnt fo the inconvenience  yes its inconvenient said alma but you forget it when youre at work dont you think  mah yes perhaps thats one reason why poo people have to woak so hawdto keep their wands off their poverty  the girls both tittered and turned from talking in a low tone with their backs toward their elders and faced them  well madison said mr woodburn it is time we should go i bid you goodnight madam he bowed to mrs leighton goodnight he bowed again to alma  his daughter took leave of them in formal phrase but with a jolly cordiality of manner that deformalized it we shall be roand raght soon in the mawning then she threatened at the door  we shall be all ready for you alma called after her down the steps  well alma her mother asked when the door closed upon them  she doesnt know any more about art said alma thannothing at all but shes jolly and goodhearted she praised everything that was bad in my sketches and said she was going to take lessons herself when a person talks about taking lessons as if they could learn it you know where they belong artistically  mrs leighton shook her head with a sigh i wish i knew where they belonged financially we shall have to get in two girls at once i shall have to go out the first thing in the morning and then our troubles will begin  well didnt you want them to begin i will stay home and help you get ready our prosperity couldnt begin without the troubles if you mean boarders and boarders mean servants i shall be very glad to be afflicted with a cook for a while myself  yes but we dont know anything about these people or whether they will be able to pay us did she talk as if they were well off  she talked as if they were poor poo she called it  yes how queerly she pronounced said mrs leighton well i ought to have told them that i required the first week in advance  mamma if thats the way youre going to act  oh of course i couldnt after he wouldnt let her bargain for the rooms i didnt like that  i did and you can see that they were perfect ladies or at least one of them alma laughed at herself but her mother did not notice  their being ladies wont help if theyve got no money it ll make it all the worse  very well then we have no money either were a match for them any day there we can show them that two can play at that game     iii  arnus beatons studio looked at first glance like many other painters studios a gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light casts of feet hands faces hung to nails about prints sketches in oil and watercolor stuck here and there lower down a rickety table with paint and palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossed comfortlessly on it an easel with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness with its head on one side and a stocking on one leg and a japanese dress dropped before it dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor canvases faced to the mopboard an open trunk overflowing with costumes these features one might notice anywhere but besides there was a bookcase with an unusual number of books in it and there was an open colonial writingdesk clawfooted brasshandled and scutcheoned with foreign periodicalsfrench and englishlittering its leaf and some pages of manuscript scattered among them above all there was a sculptors revolving stand supporting a bust which beaton was modelling with an eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of the old man who sat on the platform beside it  few men have been able to get through the world with several gifts to advantage in all and most men seem handicapped for the race if they have more than one but they are apparently immensely interested as well as distracted by them when beaton was writing he would have agreed up to a certain point with any one who said literature was his proper expression but then when he was painting up to a certain point he would have maintained against the world that he was a colorist and supremely a colorist at the certain point in either art he was apt to break away in a frenzy of disgust and wreak himself upon some other in these moods he sometimes designed elevations of buildings very striking very original very chic very everything but habitable it was in this way that he had tried his hand on sculpture which he had at first approached rather slightingly as a mere decorative accessory of architecture but it had grown in his respect till he maintained that the accessory business ought to be all the other way that temples should be raised to enshrine statues not statues made to ornament temples that was putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance this was when he had carried a plastic study so far that the sculptors who saw it said that beaton might have been an architect but would certainly never be a sculptor at the same time he did some hurried nervous things that had a popular charm and that sold in plaster reproductions to the profit of another beaton justly despised the popular charm in these as well as in the paintings he sold from time to time he said it was flat burglary to have taken money for them and he would have been living almost wholly upon the bounty of the old tombstonecutter in syracuse if it had not been for the syndicate letters which he supplied to fulkerson for ten dollars a week  they were very well done but he hated doing them after the first two or three and had to be punched up for them by fulkerson who did not cease to prize them and who never failed to punch him up beaton being what he was fulkerson was his creditor as well as patron and fulkerson being what he was had an enthusiastic patience with the elusive facile adaptable unpractical nature of beaton he was very proud of his artletters as he called them but then fulkerson was proud of everything he secured for his syndicate the fact that he had secured it gave it value he felt as if he had written it himself  one art trod upon anothers heels with beaton the day before he had rushed upon canvas the conception of a picture which he said to himself was glorious and to others at the table dhote of maroni was not bad he had worked at it in a fury till the light failed him and he execrated the dying day but he lit his lamp and transferred the process of his thinking from the canvas to the opening of the syndicate letter which he knew fulkerson would be coming for in the morning he remained talking so long after dinner in the same strain as he had painted and written in that he could not finish his letter that night the next morning while he was making his tea for breakfast the postman brought him a letter from his father enclosing a little check and begging him with tender almost deferential urgence to come as lightly upon him as possible for just now his expenses were very heavy it brought tears of shame into beatons eyesthe fine smouldering floating eyes that many ladies admired under the thick bangand he said to himself that if he were half a man he would go home and go to work cutting gravestones in his fathers shop but he would wait at least to finish his picture and as a sop to his conscience to stay its immediate ravening he resolved to finish that syndicate letter first and borrow enough money from fulkerson to be able to send his fathers check back or if not that then to return the sum of it partly in fulkersons check while he still teemed with both of these good intentions the old man from whom he was modelling his head of judas came and beaton saw that he must get through with him before he finished either the picture or the letter he would have to pay him for the time anyway he utilized the remorse with which he was tingling to give his judas an expression which he found novel in the treatment of that charactera look of such touching appealing selfabhorrence that beatons artistic joy in it amounted to rapture between the breathless moments when he worked in dead silence for an effect that was trying to escape him he sang and whistled fragments of comic opera  in one of the hushes there came a blow on the outside of the door that made beaton jump and swear with a modified profanity that merged itself in apostrophic prayer he knew it must be fulkerson and after roaring come in he said to the model that ll do this morning lindau  fulkerson squared his feet in front of the bust and compared it by fleeting glances with the old man as he got stiffly up and suffered beaton to help him on with his thin shabby overcoat  can you come tomorrow lindau  no not tomorrow mr peaton i haf to zit for the young ladties  oh said beaton wetmores class is miss leighton doing you  i dont know their namess lindau began when fulkerson said  hope you havent forgotten mine mr lindau i met you with mr march at maronis one night fulkerson offered him a universally shakable hand  oh yes i am gladt to zee you again mr vulkerson and mr margehe dont zeem to gome any more  up to his eyes in work been moving on from boston and getting settled and starting in on our enterprise beaton here hasnt got a very flattering likeness of you hey well goodmorning he said for lindau appeared not to have heard him and was escaping with a bow through the door  beaton lit a cigarette which he pinched nervously between his lips before he spoke youve come for that letter i suppose fulkerson it isnt done  fulkerson turned from staring at the bust to which he had mounted what you fretting about that letter for i dont want your letter  beaton stopped biting his cigarette and looked at him dont want my letter oh very good he bristled up he took his cigarette from his lips and blew the smoke through his nostrils and then looked at fulkerson  no i dont want your letter i want you  beacon disdained to ask an explanation but he internally lowered his crest while he continued to look at fulkerson without changing his defiant countenance this suited fulkerson well enough and he went on with relish im going out of the syndicate business old man and im on a new thing he put his leg over the back of a chair and rested his foot on its seat and with one hand in his pocket he laid the scheme of every other week before beaton with the help of the other the artist went about the room meanwhile with an effect of indifference which by no means offended fulkerson he took some water into his mouth from a tumbler which he blew in a fine mist over the head of judas before swathing it in a dirty cotton cloth he washed his brushes and set his palette he put up on his easel the picture he had blocked on the day before and stared at it with a gloomy face then he gathered the sheets of his unfinished letter together and slid them into a drawer of his writingdesk by the time he had finished and turned again to fulkerson fulkerson was saying i did think we could have the first number out by newyears but it will take longer than thata month longer but im not sorry for the holidays kill everything and by february or the middle of february people will get their breath again and begin to look round and ask whats new then well reply in the language of shakespeare and milton every other week and dont you forget it he took down his leg and asked got a pipe of baccy anywhere  beaton nodded at a clay stem sticking out of a japanese vase of bronze on his mantel theres yours he said and fulkerson said thanks and filled the pipe and sat down and began to smoke tranquilly  beaton saw that he would have to speak now and what do you want with me  you oh yes fulkerson humorously dramatized a return to himself from a pensive absence want you for the art department  beaton shook his head im not your man fulkerson he said compassionately you want a more practical hand one thats in touch with whats going im getting further and further away from this century and its claptrap i dont believe in your enterprise i dont respect it and i wont have anything to do with it it wouldchoke me that kind of thing  thats all right said fulkerson he esteemed a man who was not going to let himself go cheap or if it isnt we can make it you and march will pull together firstrate i dont care how much ideal you put into the thing the more the better i can look after the other end of the schooner myself  you dont understand me said beaton im not trying to get a rise out of you im in earnest what you want is some man who can have patience with mediocrity putting on the style of genius and with genius turning mediocrity on his hands i havent any luck with men i dont get on with them im not popular beaton recognized the fact with the satisfaction which it somehow always brings to human pride  so much the better fulkerson was ready for him at this point i dont want you to work the oldestablished racket the reputations when i want them ill go to them with a pocketful of rocksknockdown argument but my idea is to deal with the volunteer material look at the way the periodicals are carried on now names names names in a country thats just boiling over with literary and artistic ability of every kind the new fellows have no chance the editors all engage their material i dont believe there are fifty volunteer contributions printed in a year in all the new york magazines its all wrong its suicidal every other week is going back to the good old anonymous system the only fair system its worked well in literature and it will work well in art  it wont work well in art said beaton there you have a totally different set of conditions what youll get by inviting volunteer illustrations will be a lot of amateur trash and how are you going to submit your literature for illustration it cant be done at any rate i wont undertake to do it  well get up a school of illustration said fulkerson with cynical security you can read the things and explain em and your pupils can make their sketches under your eye they wouldnt be much further out than most illustrations are if they never knew what they were illustrating you might select from what comes in and make up a sort of pictorial variations to the literature without any particular reference to it well i understand you to accept  no you dont  that is to consent to help us with your advice and criticism thats all i want it wont commit you to anything and you can be as anonymous as anybody at the door fulkerson added bytheway the new manthe fellow thats taken my old syndicate businesswill want you to keep on but i guess hes going to try to beat you down on the price of the letters hes going in for retrenchment i brought along a check for this one im to pay for that he offered beaton an envelope  i cant take it fulkerson the letters paid for already fulkerson stepped forward and laid the envelope on the table among the tubes of paint  it isnt the letter merely i thought you wouldnt object to a little advance on your every other week work till you kind of got started  beaton remained inflexible it cant be done fulkerson dont i tell you i cant sell myself out to a thing i dont believe in cant you understand that  oh yes i can understand that firstrate i dont want to buy you i want to borrow you its all right see come round when you can id like to introduce you to old march thats going to be our address he put a card on the table beside the envelope and beaton allowed him to go without making him take the check back he had remembered his fathers plea that unnerved him and he promised himself again to return his fathers poor little check and to work on that picture and give it to fulkerson for the check he had left and for his back debts he resolved to go to work on the picture at once he had set his palette for it but first he looked at fulkersons check it was for only fifty dollars and the canny scotch blood in beaton rebelled he could not let this picture go for any such money he felt a little like a man whose generosity has been trifled with the conflict of emotions broke him up and he could not work     iv  the day wasted away in beatons hands at halfpast four oclock he went out to tea at the house of a lady who was at home that afternoon from four till seven by this time beaton was in possession of one of those other selves of which we each have several about us and was again the laconic staccato rather worldlified young artist whose moments of a controlled utterance and a certain distinction of manner had commended him to mrs horns fancy in the summer at st barnaby  mrs horns rooms were large and they never seemed very full though this perhaps was because people were always so quiet the ladies who outnumbered the men ten to one as they always do at a new york tea were dressed in sympathy with the low tone every one spoke in and with the subdued light which gave a crepuscular uncertainty to the few objects the dim pictures the unexcited upholstery of the rooms one breathed free of bricabrac there and the newcomer breathed softly as one does on going into church after service has begun this might be a suggestion from the voiceless behavior of the manservant who let you in but it was also because mrs horns at home was a ceremony a decorum and not festival at far greater houses there was more gayety at richer houses there was more freedom the suppression at mrs horns was a personal not a social effect it was an efflux of her character demure silentious vague but very correct  beaton easily found his way to her around the grouped skirts and among the detached figures and received a pressure of welcome from the hand which she momentarily relaxed from the teapot she sat behind a table put crosswise of a remote corner and offered tea to people whom a niece of hers received provisionally or sped finally in the outer room they did not usually take tea and when they did they did not usually drink it but beaton was feverishly glad of his cup he took rum and lemon in it and stood talking at mrs horns side till the next arrival should displace him he talked in his french manner  i have been hoping to see you she said i wanted to ask you about the leightons did they really come  i believe so they are in townyes i havent seen them  then you dont know how theyre getting onthat pretty creature with her cleverness and poor mrs leighton i was afraid they were venturing on a rash experiment do you know where they are  in west eleventh street somewhere miss leighton is in mr wetmores class  i must look them up do you know their number  not at the moment i can find out  do said mrs horn what courage they must have to plunge into new york as theyve done i really didnt think they would i wonder if theyve succeeded in getting anybody into their house yet  i dont know said beaton  i discouraged their coming all i could she sighed and i suppose you did too but its quite useless trying to make people in a place like st barnaby understand how it is in town  yes said beaton he stirred his tea while inwardly he tried to believe that he had really discouraged the leightons from coming to new york perhaps the vexation of his failure made him call mrs horn in his heart a fraud  yes she went on it is very very hard and when they wont understand and rush on their doom you feel that they are going to hold you respons  mrs horns eyes wandered from beaton her voice faltered in the faded interest of her remark and then rose with renewed vigor in greeting a lady who came up and stretched her glove across the teacups  beaton got himself away and out of the house with a much briefer adieu to the niece than he had meant to make the patronizing compassion of mrs horn for the leightons filled him with indignation toward her toward himself there was no reason why he should not have ignored them as he had done but there was a feeling it was his nature to be careless and he had been spoiled into recklessness he neglected everybody and only remembered them when it suited his whim or his convenience but he fiercely resented the inattentions of others toward himself he had no scruple about breaking an engagement or failing to keep an appointment he made promises without thinking of their fulfilment and not because he was a faithless person but because he was imaginative and expected at the time to do what he said but was fickle and so did not as most of his shortcomings were of a society sort no great harm was done to anybody else he had contracted somewhat the circle of his acquaintance by what some people called his rudeness but most people treated it as his oddity and were patient with it one lady said she valued his coming when he said he would come because it had the charm of the unexpected only it shows that it isnt always the unexpected that happens she explained  it did not occur to him that his behavior was immoral he did not realize that it was creating a reputation if not a character for him while we are still young we do not realize that our actions have this effect it seems to us that people will judge us from what we think and feel later we find out that this is impossible perhaps we find it out too late some of us never find it out at all  in spite of his shame about the leightons beaton had no present intention of looking them up or sending mrs horn their address as a matter of fact he never did send it but he happened to meet mr wetmore and his wife at the restaurant where he dined and he got it of the painter for himself he did not ask him how miss leighton was getting on but wetmore launched out with alma for a tacit text on the futility of women generally going in for art even when they have talent theyve got too much against them where a girl doesnt seem very strong like miss leighton no amount of chic is going to help  his wife disputed him on behalf of her sex as women always do  no dolly he persisted shed better be home milking the cows and leading the horse to water  do you think shed better be up till two in the morning at balls and going all day to receptions and luncheons  oh guess it isnt a question of that even if she werent drawing you knew them at home he said to beaton  yes  i remember her mother said you suggested me well the girl has some notion of it theres no doubt about that butshes a woman the trouble with these talented girls is that theyre all woman if they werent there wouldnt be much chance for the men beaton but weve got providence on our own side from the start im able to watch all their inspirations with perfect composure i know just how soon its going to end in nervous breakdown somebody ought to marry them all and put them out of their misery  and what will you do with your students who are married already his wife said she felt that she had let him go on long enough  oh they ought to get divorced  you ought to be ashamed to take their money if thats what you think of them  my dear i have a wife to support  beaton intervened with a question do you mean that miss leighton isnt standing it very well  how do i know she isnt the kind that bends shes the kind that breaks  after a little silence mrs wetmore asked wont you come home with us mr beaton  thank you no i have an engagement  i dont see why that should prevent you said wetmore but you always were a punctilious cuss well  beaton lingered over his cigar but no one else whom he knew came in and he yielded to the threefold impulse of conscience of curiosity of inclination in going to call at the leightons he asked for the ladies and the maid showed him into the parlor where he found mrs leighton and miss woodburn  the widow met him with a welcome neatly marked by resentment she meant him to feel that his not coming sooner had been noticed miss woodburn bubbled and gurgled on and did what she could to mitigate his punishment but she did not feel authorized to stay it till mrs leighton by studied avoidance of her daughters name obliged beaton to ask for her then miss woodburn caught up her work and said ahll go and tell her mrs leighton at the top of the stairs she found alma and alma tried to make it seem as if she had not been standing there mah goodness chald theres the handsomest young man asking for you down there you evah saw alh told you mothah ah would come up fo you  whatwho is it  dont you know but bo could you hes got the most beautiful eyes and he weas his hai in a bang and he talks english like it was something else and his names mr beaton  did heask for me said alma with a dreamy tone she put her hand on the stairs rail and a little shiver ran over her  didnt i tell you of coase he did and you ought to go raght down if you want to save the poo fellahs lahfe you mothahs just freezin him to death     v  she is cried alma tchk she flew downstairs and flitted swiftly into the room and fluttered up to beaton and gave him a crushing handshake  how very kind of you to come and see us mr beaton when did you come to new york dont you find it warm here weve only just lighted the furnace but with this mild weather it seems too early mamma does keep it so hot she rushed about opening doors and shutting registers and then came back and sat facing him from the sofa with a mask of radiant cordiality how have you been since we saw you  very well said beaton i hope youre well miss leighton  oh perfectly i think new york agrees with us both wonderfully i never knew such air and to think of our not having snow yet i should think everybody would want to come here why dont you come mr beaton  beaton lifted his eyes and looked at her ii live in new york he faltered  in new york city she exclaimed  surely alma said her mother you remember mr beatons telling us he lived in new york  but i thought you came from rochester or was it syracuse i always get those places mixed up  probably i told you my father lived at syracuse ive been in new york ever since i came home from paris said beaton with the confusion of a man who feels himself played upon by a woman  from paris alma echoed leaning forward with her smiling mask tight on wasnt it munich where you studied  i was at munich too i met wetmore there  oh do you know mr wetmore  why alma her mother interposed again it was mr beaton who told you of mr wetmore  was it why yes to be sure it was mrs horn who suggested mr ilcomb i remember now i cant thank you enough for having sent me to mr wetmore mr beaton isnt he delightful oh yes im a perfect wetmorian i can assure you the whole class is the same way  i just met him and mrs wetmore at dinner said beaton attempting the recovery of something that he had lost through the girls shining ease and steely sprightliness she seemed to him so smooth and hard with a repellent elasticity from which he was flung off i hope youre not working too hard miss leighton  oh no i enjoy every minute of it and grow stronger on it do i look very much wasted away she looked him full in the face brilliantly smiling and intentionally beautiful  no he said with a slow sadness i never saw you looking better  poor mr beaton she said in recognition of his doleful tune it seems to be quite a blow  oh no  i remember all the good advice you used to give me about not working too hard and probably its that thats saved my lifethat and the househunting has mamma told you of our adventures in getting settled  some time we must it was such fun and didnt you think we were fortunate to get such a pretty house you must see both our parlors she jumped up and her mother followed her with a bewildered look as she ran into the back parlor and flashed up the gas  come in here mr beaton i want to show you the great feature of the house she opened the low windows that gave upon a glazed veranda stretching across the end of the room just think of this in new york you cant see it very well at night but when the southern sun pours in here all the afternoon  yes i can imagine it he said he glanced up at the birdcage hanging from the roof i suppose gypsy enjoys it  you remember gypsy she said and she made a cooing kissing little noise up at the bird who responded drowsily poor old gypsum well he shant be disturbed yes its gyps delight and colonel woodburn likes to write here in the morning think of us having a real live author in the house and miss woodburn im so glad youve seen her theyre southern people  yes that was obvious in her case  from her accent isnt it fascinating i didnt believe i could ever endure southerners but were like one family with the woodburns i should think youd want to paint miss woodburn dont you think her coloring is delicious and such a quaint kind of eighteenthcentury type of beauty but shes perfectly lovely every way and everything she says is so funny the southerners seem to be such great talkers better than we are dont you think  i dont know said beaton in pensive discouragement he was sensible of being manipulated operated but he was helpless to escape from the performer or to fathom her motives his pensiveness passed into gloom and was degenerating into sulky resentment when he went away after several failures to get back to the old ground he had held in relation to alma he retrieved something of it with mrs leighton but alma glittered upon him to the last with a keen impenetrable candor a childlike singleness of glance covering unfathomable reserve  well alma said her mother when the door had closed upon him  well mother then after a moment she said with a rush did you think i was going to let him suppose we were piqued at his not coming did you suppose i was going to let him patronize us or think that we were in the least dependent on his favor or friendship  her mother did not attempt to answer her she merely said i shouldnt think he would come any more  well we have got on so far without him perhaps we can live through the rest of the winter  i couldnt help feeling sorry for him he was quite stupefied i could see that he didnt know what to make of you  hes not required to make anything of me said alma  do you think he really believed you had forgotten all those things  impossible to say mamma  well i dont think it was quite right alma  ill leave him to you the next time miss woodburn said you were freezing him to death when i came down  that was quite different but there wont be any next time im afraid sighed mrs leighton  beaton went home feeling sure there would not he tried to read when he got to his room but almas looks tones gestures whirred through and through the woof of the story like shuttles he could not keep them out and he fell asleep at last not because he forgot them but because he forgave them he was able to say to himself that he had been justly cut off from kindness which he knew how to value in losing it he did not expect ever to right himself in almas esteem but he hoped some day to let her know that he had understood it seemed to him that it would be a good thing if she should find it out after his death he imagined her being touched by it under those circumstances     vi  in the morning it seemed to beaton that he had done himself injustice when he uncovered his judas and looked at it he could not believe that the man who was capable of such work deserved the punishment miss leighton had inflicted upon him he still forgave her but in the presence of a thing like that he could not help respecting himself he believed that if she could see it she would be sorry that she had cut herself off from his acquaintance he carried this strain of conviction all through his syndicate letter which he now took out of his desk and finished with an increasing security of his opinions and a mounting severity in his judgments he retaliated upon the general condition of art among us the pangs of wounded vanity which alma had made him feel and he folded up his manuscript and put it in his pocket almost healed of his humiliation he had been able to escape from its sting so entirely while he was writing that the notion of making his life more and more literary commended itself to him as it was now evident that the future was to be one of renunciation of selfforgetting an oblivion tinged with bitterness he formlessly reasoned in favor of reconsidering his resolution against fulkersons offer one must call it reasoning but it was rather that swift internal dramatization which constantly goes on in persons of excitable sensibilities and which now seemed to sweep beaton physically along toward the every other week office and carried his mind with lightning celerity on to a time when he should have given that journal such quality and authority in matters of art as had never been enjoyed by any in america before with the prosperity which he made attend his work he changed the character of the enterprise and with fulkersons enthusiastic support he gave the public an art journal of as high grade as les lettres et les arts and very much that sort of thing all this involved now the unavailing regret of alma leighton and now his reconciliation with her they were married in grace church because beaton had once seen a marriage there and had intended to paint a picture of it some time  nothing in these fervid fantasies prevented his responding with due dryness to fulkersons cheery hello old man when he found himself in the building fitted up for the every other week office fulkersons room was back of the smaller one occupied by the bookkeeper they had been respectively the receptionroom and diningroom of the little place in its dwellinghouse days and they had been simply and tastefully treated in their transformation into business purposes the narrow old trim of the doors and windows had been kept and the quaintly ugly marble mantels the architect had said better let them stay they expressed epoch if not character  well have you come round to go to work just hang up your coat on the floor anywhere fulkerson went on  ive come to bring you that letter said beaton all the more haughtily because he found that fulkerson was not alone when he welcomed him in these free and easy terms there was a quietlooking man rather stout and a little above the middle height with a full closecropped irongray beard seated beyond the table where fulkerson tilted himself back with his knees set against it and leaning against the mantel there was a young man with a singularly gentle face in which the look of goodness qualified and transfigured a certain simplicity his large blue eyes were somewhat prominent and his rather narrow face was drawn forward in a nose a little too long perhaps if it had not been for the full chin deeply cut below the lip and jutting firmly forward  introduce you to mr march our editor mr beaton fulkerson said rolling his head in the direction of the elder man and then nodding it toward the younger he said mr dryfoos mr beaton beaton shook hands with march and then with mr dryfoos and fulkerson went on gayly we were just talking of you beatonwell you know the old saying mr march as i told you is our editor and mr dryfoos has charge of the publishing departmenthes the countingroom incarnate the source of power the fountain of corruption the element that prevents journalism being the high and holy thing that it would be if there were no money in it mr dryfoos turned his large mild eyes upon beaton and laughed with the uneasy concession which people make to a character when they do not quite approve of the characters language what mr march and i are trying to do is to carry on this thing so that there wont be any money in itor very little and were planning to give the public a better article for the price than its ever had before now heres a dummy weve had made up for every other week and as weve decided to adopt it we would naturally like your opinion of it sos to know what opinion to have of you he reached forward and pushed toward beaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinary duodecimo book its ivorywhite pebbled paper cover was prettily illustrated with a watercolored design irregularly washed over the greater part of its surface quite across the page at top and narrowing from right to left as it descended in the triangular space left blank the title of the periodical and the publishers imprint were tastefully lettered so as to be partly covered by the background of color  its like some of those tartarin books of daudets said beacon looking at it with more interest than he suffered to be seen but its a book not a magazine he opened its pages of thick mellow white paper with uncut leaves the first few pages experimentally printed in the type intended to be used and illustrated with some sketches drawn into and over the text for the sake of the effect  a daniela daniel come to judgment sit down danel and take it easy fulkerson pushed a chair toward beaton who dropped into it youre right danel its a book to all practical intents and purposes and what we propose to do with the american public is to give it twentyfour books like this a yeara complete libraryfor the absurd sum of six dollars we dont intend to sell emits no name for the transactionbut to give em and what we want to get out of youbeg borrow buy or steal from you is an opinion whether we shall make the american public this princely present in paper covers like this or in some sort of flexible boards so they can set them on the shelf and say no more about it now danel come to judgment as our respected friend shylock remarked  beacon had got done looking at the dummy and he dropped it on the table before fulkerson who pushed it away apparently to free himself from partiality i dont know anything about the business side and i cant tell about the effect of either style on the sales but youll spoil the whole character of the cover if you use anything thicker than that thickish paper  all right very good firstrate the ayes have it paper it is i dont mind telling you that we had decided for that paper before you came in mr march wanted it because he felt in his bones just the way you do about it and mr dryfoos wanted it because hes the countingroom incarnate and its cheaper and i wanted it because i always like to go with the majority now what do you think of that little design itself  the sketch beaton pulled the book toward him again and looked at it again rather decorative drawings not remarkable graceful rather nice he pushed the book away again and fulkerson pulled it to his aide of the table  well thats a piece of that amateur trash you despise so much i went to a painter i knowbytheway he was guilty of suggesting you for this thing but i told him i was ahead of himand i got him to submit my idea to one of his class and thats the result well now there aint anything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover and were going to have a pretty cover for every other week every time weve cut loose from the old traditional quarto literary newspaper size and weve cut loose from the old twocolumn big page magazine size were going to have a duodecimo page clear black print and paper that ll make your mouth water and were going to have a fresh illustration for the cover of each number and we aint agoing to give the public any rest at all sometimes were going to have a delicate little landscape like this and sometimes were going to have an indelicate little figure or as much so as the law will allow  the young man leaning against the mantelpiece blushed a sort of protest  march smiled and said dryly those are the numbers that mr fulkerson is going to edit himself  exactly and mr beaton here is going to supply the floating females gracefully airing themselves against a sunset or something of that kind beaton frowned in embarrassment while fulkerson went on philosophically its astonishing how you fellows can keep it up at this stage of the proceedings you can paint things that your harshest critic would be ashamed to describe accurately youre as free as the theatre but thats neither here nor there what im after is the fact that were going to have variety in our titlepages and we are going to have novelty in the illustrations of the body of the book march here if he had his own way wouldnt have any illustrations at all  not because i dont like them mr beacon march interposed but because i like them too much i find that i look at the pictures in an illustrated article but i dont read the article very much and i fancy thats the case with most other people youve got to doing them so prettily that you take our eyes off the literature if you dont take our minds off  like the society beauties on the stage people go in for the beauty so much that they dont know what the play is but the boxoffice gets there all the same and thats what mr dryfoos wants fulkerson looked up gayly at mr dryfoos who smiled deprecatingly  it was different march went on when the illustrations used to be bad then the text had some chance  old legitimate drama days when ugliness and genius combined to storm the galleries said fulkerson  we can still make them bad enough said beaton ignoring fulkerson in his remark to march  fulkerson took the reply upon himself well you neednt make em so bad as the oldstyle cuts but you can make them unobtrusive modestly retiring weve got hold of a process something like that those french fellows gave daudet thirtyfive thousand dollars to write a novel to use with kind of thing that begins at one side or one corner and spreads in a sort of dim religious style over the print till you cant tell which is which then weve got a notion that where the pictures dont behave quite so sociably they can be dropped into the text like a little casual remark dont you know or a comment that has some connection or maybe none at all with whats going on in the story something like this fulkerson took away one knee from the table long enough to open the drawer and pull from it a book that he shoved toward beacon thats a spanish book i happened to see at brentanos and i froze to it on account of the pictures i guess theyre pretty good  do you expect to get such drawings in this country asked beaton after a glance at the book such charactersuch drama you wont  well im not so sure said fulkerson come to get our amateurs warmed up to the work but what i want is to get the physical effect so to speakget that sized picture into our page and set the fashion of it i shouldnt care if the illustration was sometimes confined to an initial letter and a tailpiece  couldnt be done here we havent the touch were good in some things but this isnt in our way said beaton stubbornly i cant think of a man who could do it that is among those that would  well think of some woman then said fulkerson easily ive got a notion that the women could help us out on this thing come to get em interested there aint anything so popular as female fiction why not try female art  the females themselves have been supposed to have been trying it for a good while march suggested and mr dryfoos laughed nervously beaton remained solemnly silent  yes i know fulkerson assented but i dont mean that kind exactly what we want to do is to work the ewig weibliche in this concern we want to make a magazine that will go for the womens fancy every time i dont mean with recipes for cooking and fashions and personal gossip about authors and society but real hightone literature that will show women triumphing in all the stories or else suffering tremendously weve got to recognize that women form threefourths of the reading public in this country and go for their tastes and their sensibilities and their sexpiety along the whole line they do like to think that women can do things better than men and if we can let it leak out and get around in the papers that the managers of every other week couldnt stir a peg in the line of the illustrations they wanted till they got a lot of godgifted girls to help them it ll make the fortune of the thing see  he looked sunnily round at the other men and march said you ought to be in charge of a siamese white elephant fulkerson its a disgrace to be connected with you  it seems to me said becton that youd better get a godgifted girl for your art editor  fulkerson leaned alertly forward and touched him on the shoulder with a compassionate smile my dear boy they havent got the genius of organization it takes a very masculine man for thata man who combines the most subtle and refined sympathies with the most forceful purposes and the most ferruginous willpower which his name is angus beaton and here he sets  the others laughed with fulkerson at his gross burlesque of flattery and becton frowned sheepishly i suppose you understand this mans style he growled toward march  he does my son said fulkerson he knows that i cannot tell a lie he pulled out his watch and then got suddenly upon his feet  its quarter of twelve and ive got an appointment beaton rose too and fulkerson put the two books in his lax hands take these along michelangelo da vinci my friend and put your multitudinous mind on them for about an hour and let us hear from you tomorrow we hang upon your decision  theres no deciding to be done said beaton you cant combine the two styles theyd kill each other  a danel a danel come to judgment i knew you could help us out take em along and tell us which will go the furthest with the ewig weibliche dryfoos i want a word with you he led the way into the front room flirting an airy farewell to beaton with his hand as he went     vii  march and beaton remained alone together for a moment and march said i hope you will think it worth while to take hold with us mr beaton mr fulkerson puts it in his own way of course but we really want to make a nice thing of the magazine he had that timidity of the elder in the presence of the younger man which the younger preoccupied with his own timidity in the presence of the elder cannot imagine besides march was aware of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from beaton as an artist and he only ventured to feel his way toward sympathy with him we want to make it good we want to make it high fulkerson is right about aiming to please the women but of course he caricatures the way of going about it  for answer beaton flung out i cant go in for a thing i dont understand the plan of  march took it for granted that he had wounded some exposed sensibility of beatons he continued still more deferentially mr fulkersons notioni must say the notion is his evolved from his syndicate experienceis that we shall do best in fiction to confine our selves to short stories and make each number complete in itself he found that the most successful things he could furnish his newspapers were short stories we americans are supposed to excel in writing them and most people begin with them in fiction and its mr fulkersons idea to work unknown talent as he says and so he thinks he can not only get them easily but can gradually form a school of shortstory writers i cant say i follow him altogether but i respect his experience we shall not despise translations of short stories but otherwise the matter will all be original and of course it wont all be short stories we shall use sketches of travel and essays and little dramatic studies and bits of biography and history but all very light and always short enough to be completed in a single number mr fulkerson believes in pictures and most of the things would be capable of illustration  i see said beaton  i dont know but this is the whole affair said march beginning to stiffen a little at the young mans reticence  i understand thank you for taking the trouble to explain goodmorning beaton bowed himself off without offering to shake hands  fulkerson came in after a while from the outer office and mr dryfoos followed him well what do you think of our art editor  is he our art editor asked march i wasnt quite certain when he left  did he take the books  yes he took the books  i guess hes all right then fulkerson added in concession to the umbrage he detected in march  beaton has his times of being the greatest ass in the solar system but he usually takes it out in personal conduct when it comes to work hes a regular horse  he appears to have compromised for the present by being a perfect mule said march  well hes in a transition state fulkerson allowed hes the man for us he really understands what we want youll see hell catch on that lurid glare of his will wear off in the course of time hes really a good fellow when you take him off his guard and hes full of ideas hes spread out over a good deal of ground at present and so hes pretty thin but come to gather him up into a lump theres a good deal of substance to him yes there is hes a firstrate critic and hes a nice fellow with the other artists they laugh at his universality but they all like him hes the best kind of a teacher when he condescends to it and hes just the man to deal with our volunteer work yes sir hes a prize well i must go now  fulkerson went out of the street door and then came quickly back bythebye march i saw that old dynamiter of yours round at beatons room yesterday  what old dynamiter of mine  that old onehanded dutchmanfriend of your youththe one we saw at maronis  ohlindau said march with a vague pang of self reproach for having thought of lindau so little after the first flood of his tender feeling toward him was past  yes our versatile friend was modelling him as judas iscariot lindau makes a firstrate judas and beaton has got a big thing in that head if he works the religious people right but what i was thinking of was thisit struck me just as i was going out of the door didnt you tell me lindau knew forty or fifty different languages  four or five yes  well we wont quarrel about the number the question is why not work him in the field of foreign literature you cant go over all their reviews and magazines and he could do the smelling for you if you could trust his nose would he know a good thing  i think he would said march on whom the scope of fulkersons suggestion gradually opened he used to have good taste and he must know the ground why its a capital idea fulkerson lindau wrote very fair english and he could translate with a little revision  and he would probably work cheap well hadnt you better see him about it i guess it ll be quite a windfall for him  yes it will ill look him up thank you for the suggestion fulkerson  oh dont mention it i dont mind doing every other week a good turn now and then when it comes in my way fulkerson went out again and this time march was finally left with mr dryfoos  mrs march was very sorry not to be at home when your sisters called the other day she wished me to ask if they had any afternoon in particular there was none on your mothers card  no sir said the young man with a flush of embarrassment that seemed habitual with him she has no day shes at home almost every day she hardly ever goes out  might we come some evening march asked we should be very glad to do that if she would excuse the informality then i could come with mrs march  mother isnt very formal said the young man she would be very glad to see you  then well come some night this week if you will let us when do you expect your father back  not much before christmas hes trying to settle up some things at moffitt  and what do you think of our art editor asked march with a smile for the change of subject  oh i dont know much about such things said the young man with another of his embarrassed flushes mr fulkerson seems to feel sure that he is the one for us  mr fulkerson seemed to think that i was the one for you too said march and he laughed thats what makes me doubt his infallibility but he couldnt do worse with mr beaton  mr dryfoos reddened and looked down as if unable or unwilling to cope with the difficulty of making a polite protest against marchs selfdepreciation he said after a moment its new business to all of us except mr fulkerson but i think it will succeed i think we can do some good in it  march asked rather absently some good then he added oh yes i think we can what do you mean by good improve the public taste elevate the standard of literature give young authors and artists a chance  this was the only good that had ever been in marchs mind except the good that was to come in a material way from his success to himself and to his family  i dont know said the young man and he looked down in a shamefaced fashion he lifted his head and looked into marchs face i suppose i was thinking that some time we might help along if we were to have those sketches of yours about life in every part of new york  marchs authorial vanity was tickled fulkerson has been talking to you about them he seemed to think they would be a card he believes that theres no subject so fascinating to the general average of people throughout the country as life in new york city and he liked my notion of doing these things march hoped that dryfoos would answer that fulkerson was perfectly enthusiastic about his notion but he did not need this stimulus and at any rate he went on without it the fact is its something that struck my fancy the moment i came here i found myself intensely interested in the place and i began to make notes consciously and unconsciously at once yes i believe i can get something quite attractive out of it i dont in the least know what it will be yet except that it will be very desultory and i couldnt at all say when i can get at it if we postpone the first number till february i might get a little paper into that yes i think it might be a good thing for us march said with modest selfappreciation  if you can make the comfortable people understand how the uncomfortable people live it will be a very good thing mr march sometimes it seems to me that the only trouble is that we dont know one another well enough and that the first thing is to do this the young fellow spoke with the seriousness in which the beauty of his face resided whenever he laughed his face looked weak even silly it seemed to be a sense of this that made him hang his head or turn it away at such times  thats true said march from the surface only and then those phases of low life are immensely picturesque of course we must try to get the contrasts of luxury for the sake of the full effect that wont be so easy you cant penetrate to the dinnerparty of a millionaire under the wing of a detective as you could to a carouse in mulberry street or to his childrens nursery with a philanthropist as you can to a streetboys lodginghouse march laughed and again the young man turned his head away still something can be done in that way by tact and patience     vii  that evening march went with his wife to return the call of the dryfoos ladies on their way uptown in the elevated he told her of his talk with young dryfoos i confess i was a little ashamed before him afterward for having looked at the matter so entirely from the aesthetic point of view but of course you know if i went to work at those things with an ethical intention explicitly in mind i should spoil them  of course said his wife she had always heard him say something of this kind about such things  he went on but i suppose thats just the point that such a nature as young dryfooss cant get hold of or keep hold of were a queer lot down there isabelperfect menagerie if it hadnt been that fulkerson got us together and really seems to know what he did it for i should say he was the oddest stick among us but when i think of myself and my own crankiness for the literary department and young dryfoos who ought really to be in the pulpit or a monastery or something for publisher and that young beaton who probably hasnt a moral fibre in his composition for the art man i dont know but we could give fulkerson odds and still beat him in oddity  his wife heaved a deep sigh of apprehension of renunciation of monition well im glad you can feel so light about it basil  light i feel gay with fulkerson at the helm i tell you the rocks and the lee shore had better keep out of the way he laughed with pleasure in his metaphor just when you think fulkerson has taken leave of his senses he says or does something that shows he is on the most intimate and inalienable terms with them all the time you know how ive been worrying over those foreign periodicals and trying to get some translations from them for the first number well fulkerson has brought his centipedal mind to bear on the subject and hes suggested that old german friend of mine i was telling you ofthe one i met in the restaurantthe friend of my youth  do you think he could do it asked mrs march sceptically  hes a perfect babel of strange tongues and hes the very man for the work and i was ashamed i hadnt thought of him myself for i suspect he needs the work  well be careful how you get mixed up with him then basil said his wife who had the natural misgiving concerning the friends of her husbands youth that all wives have you know the germans are so unscrupulously dependent you dont know anything about him now  im not afraid of lindau said march he was the best and kindest man i ever saw the most highminded the most generous he lost a hand in the war that helped to save us and keep us possible and that stump of his is character enough for me  oh you dont think i could have meant anything against him said mrs march with the tender fervor that every woman who lived in the time of the war must feel for those who suffered in it all that i meant was that i hoped you would not get mixed up with him too much youre so apt to be carried away by your impulses  they didnt carry me very far away in the direction of poor old lindau im ashamed to think said march i meant all sorts of fine things by him after i met him and then i forgot him and i had to be reminded of him by fulkerson  she did not answer him and he fell into a remorseful reverie in which he rehabilitated lindau anew and provided handsomely for his old age he got him buried with military honors and had a shaft raised over him with a medallion likeness by beaton and an epitaph by himself by the time they reached fortysecond street there was no time to write lindaus life however briefly before the train stopped  they had to walk up four blocks and then half a block across before they came to the indistinctive brownstone house where the dryfooses lived it was larger than some in the same block but the next neighborhood of a huge apartmenthouse dwarfed it again march thought he recognized the very flat in which he had disciplined the surly janitor but he did not tell his wife he made her notice the transition character of the street which had been mostly built up in apartmenthouses with here and there a single dwelling dropped far down beneath and beside them to that jagtoothed effect on the skyline so often observable in such new york streets i dont know exactly what the old gentleman bought here for he said as they waited on the steps after ringing unless he expects to turn it into flats byandby otherwise i dont believe hell get his money back  an irish servingman with a certain surprise that delayed him said the ladies were at home and let the marches in and then carried their cards upstairs the drawingroom where he said they could sit down while he went on this errand was delicately decorated in white and gold and furnished with a sort of extravagant good taste there was nothing to object to in the satin furniture the pale soft rich carpet the pictures and the bronze and china bricabrac except that their costliness was too evident everything in the room meant money too plainly and too much of it the marches recognized this in the hoarse whispers which people cannot get their voices above when they try to talk away the interval of waiting in such circumstances they conjectured from what they had heard of the dryfooses that this tasteful luxury in no wise expressed their civilization though when you come to that said march i dont know that mrs greens gimcrackery expresses ours  well basil i didnt take the gimcrackery that was your  the rustle of skirts on the stairs without arrested mrs march in the wellmerited punishment which she never failed to inflict upon her husband when the question of the gimcrackerythey always called it thatcame up she rose at the entrance of a brightlooking prettylooking mature youngish lady in black silk of a neutral implication who put out her hand to her and said with a very cheery very ladylike accent mrs march and then added to both of them while she shook hands with march and before they could get the name out of their months no not miss dryfoos neither of them nor mrs dryfoos mrs mandel the ladies will be down in a moment wont you throw off your sacque mrs march im afraid its rather warm here coming from the outside  i will throw it back if youll allow me said mrs march with a sort of provisionality as if pending some uncertainty as to mrs mandels quality and authority she did not feel herself justified in going further  but if she did not know about mrs mandel mrs mandel seemed to know about her oh well do she said with a sort of recognition of the propriety of her caution i hope you are feeling a little at home in new york we heard so much of your trouble in getting a flat from mr fulkerson  well a true bostonian doesnt give up quite so soon said mrs march  but i will say new york doesnt seem so far away now were here  im sure youll like it every one does mrs mandel added to march its very sharp out isnt it  rather sharp but after our boston winters i dont know but i ought to repudiate the word  ah wait till you have been here through march said mrs mandel she began with him but skillfully transferred the close of her remark and the little smile of menace that went with it to his wife  yes said mrs march or april either talk about our east winds  oh im sure they cant be worse than our winds mrs mandel returned caressingly  if we escape new york pneumonia march laughed it will only be to fall a prey to new york malaria as soon as the frost is out of the ground  oh but you know said mrs mandel i think our malaria has really been slandered a little its more a matter of drainageof plumbing i dont believe it would be possible for malaria to get into this house weve had it gone over so thoroughly  mrs march said while she tried to divine mrs mandels position from this statement its certainly the first duty  if mrs march could have had her way we should have had the drainage of our whole ward put in order said her husband before we ventured to take a furnished apartment for the winter  mrs mandel looked discreetly at mrs march for permission to laugh at this but at the same moment both ladies became preoccupied with a second rustling on the stairs  two tall welldressed young girls came in and mrs mandel introduced miss dryfoos mrs march and miss mela dryfoos mr march she added and the girls shook hands in their several ways with the marches  miss dryfoos had keen black eyes and her hair was intensely black her face but for the slight inward curve of the nose was regular and the smallness of her nose and of her mouth did not weaken her face but gave it a curious effect of fierceness of challenge she had a large black fan in her hand which she waved in talking with a slow watchful nervousness her sister was blonde and had a profile like her brothers but her chin was not so salient and the weak look of the mouth was not corrected by the spirituality or the fervor of his eyes though hers were of the same mottled blue she dropped into the low seat beside mrs mandel and intertwined her fingers with those of the hand which mrs mandel let her have she smiled upon the marches while miss dryfoos watched them intensely with her eyes first on one and then on the other as if she did not mean to let any expression of theirs escape her  my mother will be down in a minute she said to mrs march  i hope were not disturbing her it is so good of you to let us come in the evening mrs march replied  oh not at all said the girl we receive in the evening  when we do receive miss mela put in we dont always get the chance to she began a laugh which she checked at a smile from mrs mandel which no one could have seen to be reproving  miss dryfoos looked down at her fan and looked up defiantly at mrs march i suppose you have hardly got settled we were afraid we would disturb you when we called  oh no we were very sorry to miss your visit we are quite settled in our new quarters of course its all very different from boston  i hope its more of a sociable place there miss mela broke in again i never saw such an unsociable place as new york weve been in this house three months and i dont believe that if we stayed three years any of the neighbors would call  i fancy proximity doesnt count for much in new york march suggested  mrs mandel said thats what i tell miss mela but she is a very social nature and cant reconcile herself to the fact  no i cant the girl pouted i think it was twice as much fun in moffitt i wish i was there now  yes said march i think theres a great deal more enjoyment in those smaller places theres not so much going on in the way of public amusements and so people make more of one another there are not so many concerts theatres operas  oh theyve got a splendid operahouse in moffitt its just grand said miss mela  have you been to the opera here this winter mrs march asked of the elder girl  she was glaring with a frown at her sister and detached her eyes from her with an effort what did you say she demanded with an absent bluntness oh yes yes we went once father took a box at the metropolitan  then you got a good dose of wagner i suppose said march  what asked the girl  i dont think miss dryfoos is very fond of wagners music mrs mandel said i believe you are all great wagnerites in boston  im a very bad bostonian mrs mandel i suspect myself of preferring verdi march answered  miss dryfoos looked down at her fan again and said i like trovatore the best  its an opera i never get tired of said march and mrs march and mrs mandel exchanged a smile of compassion for his simplicity he detected it and added but i dare say i shall come down with the wagner fever in time ive been exposed to some malignant cases of it  that night we were there said miss mela they had to turn the gas down all through one part of it and the papers said the ladies were awful mad because they couldnt show their diamonds i dont wonder if they all had to pay as much for their boxes as we did we had to pay sixty dollars she looked at the marches for their sensation at this expense  march said well i think i shall take my box by the month then it must come cheaper wholesale  oh no it dont said the girl glad to inform him the people that own their boxes and that had to give fifteen or twenty thousand dollars apiece for them have to pay sixty dollars a night whenever theres a performance whether they go or not  then i should go every night march said  most of the ladies were low neck  march interposed well i shouldnt go lowneck  the girl broke into a fondly approving laugh at his drolling oh i guess you love to train us girls wanted to go low neck too but father said we shouldnt and mother said if we did she wouldnt come to the front of the box once well she didnt anyway we might just as well a gone low neck she stayed back the whole time and when they had that dancethe ballet you knowshe just shut her eyes well conrad didnt like that part much either but us girls and mrs mandel we brazened it out right in the front of the box we were about the only ones there that went high neck conrad had to wear a swallowtail but father hadnt any and he had to patch out with a white cravat you couldnt see what he had on in the back o the box anyway  mrs march looked at miss dryfoos who was waving her fan more and more slowly up and down and who when she felt herself looked at returned mrs marchs smile which she meant to be ingratiating and perhaps sympathetic with a flash that made her start and then ran her fierce eyes over marchs face here comes mother she said with a sort of breathlessness as if speaking her thought aloud and through the open door the marches could see the old lady on the stairs  she paused halfway down and turning called up coonrod coonrod you bring my shawl down with you  her daughter mela called out to her now mother christine ll give it to you for not sending mike  well i dont know where he is mely child the mother answered back he aint never around when hes wanted and when he aint it seems like a body couldnt git shet of him nohow  well you ought to ring for him cried miss mela enjoying the joke  her mother came in with a slow step her head shook slightly as she looked about the room perhaps from nervousness perhaps from a touch of palsy in either case the fact had a pathos which mrs march confessed in the affection with which she took her hard dry large old hand when she was introduced to her and in the sincerity which she put into the hope that she was well  im just middlin mrs dryfoos replied i aint never so well nowadays i tell fawther i dont believe it agrees with me very well here but he says ill git used to it hes away now out at moffitt she said to march and wavered on foot a moment before she sank into a chair she was a tall woman who had been a beautiful girl and her gray hair had a memory of blondeness in it like lindaus march noticed she wore a simple silk gown of a quakerly gray and she held a handkerchief folded square as it had come from the laundress something like the sabbath quiet of a little wooden meetinghouse in thick western woods expressed itself to him from her presence  laws mother said miss mela what you got that old thing on for if id a known youd a come down in that  coonrod said it was all right mely said her mother  miss mela explained to the marches mother was raised among the dunkards and she thinks its wicked to wear anything but a gray silk even for dressup  you haint never heared o the dunkards i reckon the old woman said to mrs march some folks calls em the beardy men because they dont never shave and they wash feet like they do in the testament my uncle was one he raised me  i guess pretty much everybodys a beardy man nowadays if he aint a dunkard  miss mela looked round for applause of her sally but march was saying to his wife its a pennsylvania german sect i believesomething like the quakers i used to see them when i was a boy  arent they something like the mennists asked mrs mandel  theyre good people said the old woman and the world d be a heap better off if there was more like em  her son came in and laid a soft shawl over her shoulders before he shook hands with the visitors i am glad you found your way here he said to them  christine who had been bending forward over her fan now lifted herself up with a sigh and leaned back in her chair  im sorry my father isnt here said the young man to mrs march hes never met you yet  no and i should like to see him we hear a great deal about your father you know from mr fulkerson  oh i hope you dont believe everything mr fulkerson says about people mela cried hes the greatest person for carrying on when he gets going i ever saw it makes christine just as mad when him and mother gets to talking about religion she says she knows he dont care anything more about it than the man in the moon i reckon he dont try it on much with father  your fawther aint ever been a perfessor her mother interposed but hes always been a good churchgoin man  not since we come to new york retorted the girl  hes been all broke up since he come to new york said the old woman with an aggrieved look  mrs mandel attempted a diversion have you heard any of our great new york preachers yet mrs march  no i havent mrs march admitted and she tried to imply by her candid tone that she intended to begin hearing them the very next sunday  there are a great many things here said conrad to take your thoughts off the preaching that you hear in most of the churches i think the city itself is preaching the best sermon all the time  i dont know that i understand you said march  mela answered for him oh conrad has got a lot of notions that nobody can understand you ought to see the church he goes to when he does go id about as lief go to a catholic church myself i dont see a bit o difference hes the greatest crony with one of their preachers he dresses just like a priest and he says he is a priest she laughed for enjoyment of the fact and her brother cast down his eyes  mrs march in her turn tried to take from it the personal tone which the talk was always assuming have you been to the fall exhibition she asked christine and the girl drew herself up out of the abstraction she seemed sunk in  the exhibition she looked at mrs mandel  the pictures of the academy you know mrs mandel explained where i wanted you to go the day you had your dress tried on  no we havent been yet is it good she had turned to mrs march again  i believe the fall exhibitions are never so good as the spring ones but there are some good pictures  i dont believe i care much about pictures said christine i dont understand them  ah thats no excuse for not caring about them said march lightly the painters themselves dont half the time  the girl looked at him with that glance at once defiant and appealing insolent and anxious which he had noticed before especially when she stole it toward himself and his wife during her sisters babble in the light of fulkersons history of the family its origin and its ambition he interpreted it to mean a sense of her sisters folly and an ignorant will to override his opinion of anything incongruous in themselves and their surroundings he said to himself that she was deathly proudtoo proud to try to palliate anything but capable of anything that would put others under her feet her eyes seemed hopelessly to question his wifes social quality and he fancied with not unkindly interest the inexperienced girls doubt whether to treat them with much or little respect he lost himself in fancies about her and her ideals necessarily sordid of her possibilities of suffering of the triumphs and disappointments before her her sister would accept both with a lightness that would keep no trace of either but in her they would sink lastingly deep he came out of his reverie to find mrs dryfoos saying to him in her hoarse voice  i think its a shame some of the picturs a body sees in the winders they say theres a law aginst them things and if there is i dont understand why the police dont take up them that paints em i hear 182 tell since i been here that theres women that goes to have picturs took from them that way by men painters the point seemed aimed at march as if he were personally responsible for the scandal and it fell with a silencing effect for the moment nobody seemed willing to take it up and mrs dryfoos went on with an old womans severity i say they ought to be all tarred and feathered and rode on a rail theyd be drummed out of town in moffitt  miss mela said with a crowing laugh i should think they would and they wouldnt anybody go low neck to the operahouse there eithernot low neck the way they do here anyway  and that pack of worthless hussies her mother resumed that come out on the stage and begun to kick  laws mother the girl shouted i thought you said you had your eyes shut  all but these two simpler creatures were abashed at the indecorum of suggesting in words the commonplaces of the theatre and of art  well i did mely as soon as i could believe my eyes i dont know what theyre doin in all their churches to let such things go on said the old woman its a sin and a shame i think dont you coonrod  a ring at the door cut short whatever answer he was about to deliver  if its going to be company coonrod said his mother making an effort to rise i reckon i better go upstairs  its mr fulkerson i guess said conrad he thought he might come and at the mention of this light spirit mrs dryfoos sank contentedly back in her chair and a relaxation of their painful tension seemed to pass through the whole company conrad went to the door himself the servingman tentatively appeared some minutes later and let in fulkersons cheerful voice before his cheerful person  ah how dye do conrad brought our friend mr beaton with me those within heard him say and then after a sound of putting off overcoats they saw him fill the doorway with his feet set square and his arms akimbo     ix  ah hello hello fulkerson said in recognition of the marches regular gathering of the clans how are you mrs dryfoos how do you do mrs mandel miss christine mela aunt hitty and all the folks how you wuz he shook hands gayly all round and took a chair next the old lady whose hand he kept in his own and left conrad to introduce beaton but he would not let the shadow of beatons solemnity fall upon the company he began to joke with mrs dryfoos and to match rheumatisms with her and he included all the ladies in the range of appropriate pleasantries ive brought mr beaton along tonight and i want you to make him feel at home like you do me mrs dryfoos he hasnt got any rheumatism to speak of but his parents live in syracuse and hes a kind of an orphan and weve just adopted him down at the office when you going to bring the young ladies down there mrs mandel for a champagne lunch i will have some hydromela and christine it heigh hows that for a little starter we dropped in at your place a moment mrs march and gave the young folks a few pointers about their studies my goodness it does me good to see a boy like that of yours business from the word go and your girl just scoops my youthful affections shes a beauty and i guess shes good too well well what a world it is miss christine wont you show mr beaton that seal ring of yours he knows about such things and i brought him here to see it as much as anything its an intaglio i brought from the other side he explained to mrs march and i guess youll like to look at it tried to give it to the dryfoos family and when i couldnt i sold it to em bound to see it on miss christines hand somehow hold on let him see it where it belongs first  he arrested the girl in the motion she made to take off the ring and let her have the pleasure of showing her hand to the company with the ring on it then he left her to hear the painters words about it which he continued to deliver dissyllabically as he stood with her under a gasjet twisting his elastic figure and bending his head over the ring  well mely child fulkerson went on with an open travesty of her mothers habitual address and how are you getting along mrs mandel hold you up to the proprieties pretty strictly well thats right you know youd be roaming all over the pasture if she didnt  the girl gurgled out her pleasure in his funning and everybody took him on his own ground of privileged character he brought them all together in their friendliness for himself and before the evening was over he had inspired mrs mandel to have them served with coffee and had made both the girls feel that they had figured brilliantly in society and that two young men had been devoted to them  oh i think hes just as lovely as he can live said mela as she stood a moment with her sister on the scene of her triumph where the others had left them after the departure of their guests  who asked christine deeply as she glanced down at her ring her eyes burned with a softened fire  she had allowed beaton to change it himself from the finger where she had worn it to the finger on which he said she ought to wear it she did not know whether it was right to let him but she was glad she had done it  who mr fulkerson goosiepoosie not that old stuckup mr beaton of yours  he is proud assented christine with a throb of exultation  beaton and fulkerson went to the elevated station with the marches but the painter said he was going to walk home and fulkerson let him go alone  one way is enough for me he explained when i walk up i dont walk down byebye my son he began talking about beaton to the marches as they climbed the station stairs together that fellow puzzles me i dont know anybody that i have such a desire to kick and at the same time that i want to flatter up so much affect you that way he asked of march  well as far as the kicking goes yes  and how is it with you mrs march  oh i want to flatter him up  no really why hold on ive got the change  fulkerson pushed march away from the ticketoffice window and made them his guests with the inexorable american hospitality for the ride downtown three he said to the ticketseller and when he had walked them before him out on the platform and dropped his tickets into the urn he persisted in his inquiry why  why because you always want to flatter conceited people dont you mrs march answered with a laugh  do you yes i guess you do you think beaton is conceited  well slightly mr fulkerson  i guess youre partly right said fulkerson with a sigh so unaccountable in its connection that they all laughed  an ideal busted march suggested  no not that exactly said fulkerson but i had a notion maybe beaton wasnt conceited all the time  oh mrs march exulted nobody could be so conceited all the time as mr beaton is most of the time he must have moments of the direst modesty when hed be quite flatteryproof  yes thats what i mean i guess thats what makes me want to kick him hes left compliments on my hands that no decent man would  oh thats tragical said march  mr fulkerson mrs march began with change of subject in her voice who is mrs mandel  who what do you think of her he rejoined ill tell you about her when we get in the cars look at that thing aint it beautiful  they leaned over the track and looked up at the next station where the train just starting throbbed out the flameshot steam into the white moonlight  the most beautiful thing in new yorkthe one always and certainly beautiful thing here said march and his wife sighed yes yes she clung to him and remained rapt by the sight till the train drew near and then pulled him back in a panic  well there aint really much to tell about her fulkerson resumed when they were seated in the car shes an invention of mine  of yours cried mrs march  of course exclaimed her husband  yesat least in her present capacity she sent me a story for the syndicate back in july some time along about the time i first met old dryfoos here it was a little too long for my purpose and i thought i could explain better how i wanted it cut in a call than i could in a letter she gave a brooklyn address and i went to see her i found her said fulkerson with a vague defiance a perfect lady she was living with an aunt over there and she had seen better days when she was a girl and worse ones afterward i dont mean to say her husband was a bad fellow i guess he was pretty good he was her musicteacher she met him in germany and they got married there and got through her property before they came over here well she didnt strike me like a person that could make much headway in literature her story was well enough but it hadnt much sand in it kind ofwell academic you know i told her so and she understood and cried a little but she did the best she could with the thing and i took it and syndicated it she kind of stuck in my mind and the first time i went to see the dryfooses they were stopping at a sort of family hotel then till they could find a house fulkerson broke off altogether and said i dont know as i know just how the dryfooses struck you mrs march  cant you imagine she answered with a kindly smile  yes but i dont believe i could guess how they would have struck you last summer when i first saw them my oh my there was the native earth for you mely is a pretty wild colt now but you ought to have seen her before she was broken to harness  and christine ever see that black leopard they got up there in the central park that was christine well i saw what they wanted they all saw itnobody is a fool in all directions and the dryfooses are in their right senses a good deal of the time well to cut a long story short i got mrs mandel to take em in handthe old lady as well as the girls she was a born lady and always lived like one till she saw mandel and that something academic that killed her for a writer was just the very thing for them she knows the world well enough to know just how much polish they can take on and she dont try to put on a bit more see  yes i can see said mrs march  well she took hold at once as ready as a hospitaltrained nurse and there aint anything readier on this planet she runs the whole concern socially and economically takes all the care of housekeeping off the old ladys hands and goes round with the girls bythebye im going to take my meals at your widows march and conrads going to have his lunch there im sick of browsing about  mr marchs widow said his wife looking at him with provisional severity  i have no widow isabel he said and never expect to have till i leave you in the enjoyment of my lifeinsurance i suppose fulkerson means the lady with the daughter who wanted to take us to board  oh yes how are they getting on i do wonder mrs march asked of fulkerson  well theyve got one family to board but its a small one i guess theyll pull through they didnt want to take any day boarders at first the widow said i guess they have had to come to it  poor things sighed mrs march i hope theyll go back to the country  well i dont know when youve once tasted new yorkyou wouldnt go back to boston would you  instantly  fulkerson laughed out a tolerant incredulity     x  beaton lit his pipe when he found himself in his room and sat down before the dull fire in his grate to think it struck him there was a dull fire in his heart a great deal like it and he worked out a fanciful analogy with the coals still alive and the ashes creeping over them and the dead clay and cinders he felt sick of himself sick of his life and of all his works he was angry with fulkerson for having got him into that art department of his for having bought him up and he was bitter at fate because he had been obliged to use the money to pay some pressing debts and had not been able to return the check his father had sent him he pitied his poor old father he ached with compassion for him and he set his teeth and snarled with contempt through them for his own baseness this was the kind of world it was but he washed his hands of it the fault was in human nature and he reflected with pride that he had at least not invented human nature he had not sunk so low as that yet the notion amused him he thought he might get a satanic epigram out of it some way but in the mean time that girl that wild animal she kept visibly tangibly before him if he put out his hand he might touch hers he might pass his arm round her waist in paris in a set he knew there what an effect she would be with that look of hers and that beauty all out of drawing they would recognize the flame quality in her he imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit or nymph naiad whatever from one of her native gaswells he began to sketch on a bit of paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed a level dismal landscape and a vast flame against an empty sky and a shape out of the flame that took on a likeness and floated detached from it the sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it beaton laughed out pretty good to let fulkerson have that for the cover of his first number in black and red it would be effective it would catch the eye from the newsstands he made a motion to throw it on the fire but held it back and slid it into the tabledrawer and smoked on he saw the dummy with the other sketch in the open drawer which he had brought away from fulkersons in the morning and slipped in there and he took it out and looked at it he made some criticisms in line with his pencil on it correcting the drawing here and there and then he respected it a little more though he still smiled at the feminine qualitya young lady quality  in spite of his experience the night he called upon the leightons beaton could not believe that alma no longer cared for him she played at having forgotten him admirably but he knew that a few months before she had been very mindful of him he knew he had neglected them since they came to new york where he had led them to expect interest if not attention but he was used to neglecting people and he was somewhat less used to being punished for itpunished and forgiven he felt that alma had punished him so thoroughly that she ought to have been satisfied with her work and to have forgiven him in her heart afterward he bore no resentment after the first tingling moments werepast he rather admired her for it and he would have been ready to go back half an hour later and accept pardon and be on the footing of last summer again even now he debated with himself whether it was too late to call but decidedly a quarter to ten seemed late the next day he determined never to call upon the leightons again but he had no reason for this it merely came into a transitory scheme of conduct of retirement from the society of women altogether and after dinner he went round to see them  he asked for the ladies and they all three received him alma not without a surprise that intimated itself to him and her mother with no appreciable relenting miss woodburn with the needlework which she found easier to be voluble over than a book expressed in her welcome a neutrality both cordial to beaton and loyal to alma  is it snowing outdos she asked briskly after the greetings were transacted mah goodness she said in answer to his apparent surprise at the question ah mahght as well have stayed in the soath for all the winter ah have seen in new york yet  we dont often have snow much before newyears said beaton  miss woodburn is wild for a real northern winter mrs leighton explained  the othah naght ah woke up and looked oat of the window and saw all the roofs covered with snow and it turned oat to be nothing but moonlaght ah was never so disappointed in mah lahfe said miss woodburn  if youll come to st barnaby next summer you shall have all the winter you want said alma  i cant let you slander st barnaby in that way said beaton with the air of wishing to be understood as meaning more than he said  yes returned alma coolly i didnt know you were so fond of the climate  i never think of it as a climate its a landscape it doesnt matter whether its hot or cold  with the thermometer twenty below youd find that it mattered alma persisted  is that the way you feel about st barnaby too mrs leighton beaton asked with affected desolation  i shall be glad enough to go back in the summer mrs leighton conceded  and i should be glad to go now said beaton looking at alma he had the dummy of every other week in his hand and he saw almas eyes wandering toward it whenever he glanced at her i should be glad to go anywhere to get out of a job ive undertaken he continued to mrs leighton theyre going to start some sort of a new illustrated magazine and theyve got me in for their art department im not fit for it id like to run away dont you want to advise me a little mrs leighton you know how much i value your taste and id like to have you look at the design for the cover of the first number theyre going to have a different one for every number i dont know whether youll agree with me but i think this is rather nice  he faced the dummy round and then laid it on the table before mrs leighton pushing some of her work aside to make room for it and standing over her while she bent forward to look at it  alma kept her place away from the table  mah goodness ho exciting said miss woodburn may anybody look  everybody said beaton  well isnt it perfectly choming miss woodburn exclaimed come and look at this miss leighton she called to alma who reluctantly approached  what lines are these mrs leighton asked pointing to beatons pencil scratches  theyre suggestions of modifications he replied  i dont think they improve it much what do you think alma  oh i dont know said the girl constraining her voice to an effect of indifference and glancing carelessly down at the sketch the design might be improved but i dont think those suggestions would do it  theyre mine said beaton fixing his eyes upon her with a beautiful sad dreaminess that he knew he could put into them he spoke with a dreamy remoteness of tonehis windharp stop wetmore called it  i supposed so said alma calmly  oh mah goodness cried miss woodburn is that the way you awtusts talk to each othah well ahm glad ahm not an awtustunless i could do all the talking  artists cannot tell a fib alma said or even act one and she laughed in beatons upturned face  he did not unbend his dreamy gaze youre quite right the suggestions are stupid  alma turned to miss woodburn you hear even when we speak of our own work  ah nevah hoad anything lahke it  and the design itself beaton persisted  oh im not an art editor alma answered with a laugh of exultant evasion  a tall dark gravelooking man of fifty with a swarthy face and irongray mustache and imperial and goatee entered the room beaton knew the type he had been through virginia sketching for one of the illustrated papers and he had seen such men in richmond miss woodburn hardly needed to say may ah introduce you to mah fathaw conel woodburn mr beaton  the men shook hands and colonel woodburn said in that soft gentle slow southern voice without our northern contractions i am very glad to meet you sir happy to make yo acquaintance do not move madam he said to mrs leighton who made a deprecatory motion to let him pass to the chair beyond her i can find my way he bowed a bulk that did not lend itself readily to the devotion and picked up the ball of yarn she had let drop out of her lap in half rising yo worsteds madam  yarn yarn colonel woodburn alma shouted youre quite incorrigible a spade is a spade  but sometimes it is a trump my dear young lady said the colonel with unabated gallantry and when yo mothah uses yarn it is worsteds but i respect worsteds even under the name of yarn our ladiesmy own mothah and sistahshad to knit the socks we woreall we could get in the woe  yes and aftah the woe his daughter put in the knitting has not stopped yet in some places have you been much in the soath mr beaton  beaton explained just how much  well sir said the colonel then you have seen a country making gigantic struggles to retrieve its losses sir the south is advancing with enormous strides sir  too fast for some of us to keep up said miss woodburn in an audible aside the pace in charlottesboag is pofectly killing and we had to drop oat into a slow place like new york  the progress in the south is material now said the colonel and those of us whose interests are in another direction find ourselvesisolated isolated sir the intellectual centres are still in the noth sir the great cities draw the mental activity of the country to them sir necessarily new york is the metropolis  oh everything comes here said beaton impatient of the elders ponderosity another sort of man would have sympathized with the southerners willingness to talk of himself and led him on to speak of his plans and ideals but the sort of man that beaton was could not do this he put up the dummy into the wrapper he had let drop on the floor beside him and tied it round with string while colonel woodburn was talking he got to his feet with the words he spoke and offered mrs leighton his hand  must you go she asked in surprise  i am on my way to a reception he said she had noticed that he was in evening dress and now she felt the vague hurt that people invited nowhere feel in the presence of those who are going somewhere she did not feel it for herself but for her daughter and she knew alma would not have let her feel it if she could have prevented it but alma had left the room for a moment and she tacitly indulged this sense of injury in her behalf  please say goodnight to miss leighton for me beaton continued he bowed to miss woodburn goodnight miss woodburn and to her father bluntly goodnight  goodnight sir said the colonel with a sort of severe suavity  oh isnt he choming miss woodburn whispered to mrs leighton when beaton left the room  alma spoke to him in the hall without you knew that was my design mr beaton why did you bring it  why he looked at her in gloomy hesitation  then he said you know why i wished to talk it over with you to serve you please you get back your good opinion but ive done neither the one nor the other ive made a mess of the whole thing  alma interrupted him has it been accepted  it will be accepted if you will let it  let it she laughed i shall be delighted she saw him swayed a little toward her its a matter of business isnt it  purely goodnight  when alma returned to the room colonel woodburn was saying to mrs leighton i do not contend that it is impossible madam but it is very difficult in a thoroughly commercialized society like yours to have the feelings of a gentleman how can a business man whose prosperity whose earthly salvation necessarily lies in the adversity of some one else be delicate and chivalrous or even honest if we could have had time to perfect our system at the south to eliminate what was evil and develop what was good in it we should have had a perfect system but the virus of commercialism was in us too it forbade us to make the best of a divine institution and tempted us to make the worst now the curse is on the whole country the dollar is the measure of every value the stamp of every success what does not sell is a failure and what sells succeeds  the hobby is oat mah deah said miss woodburn in an audible aside to alma  were you speaking of me colonel woodburn alma asked  surely not my dear young lady  but hes been saying that awtusts are just as greedy aboat money as anybody said his daughter  the law of commercialism is on everything in a commercial society the colonel explained softening the tone in which his convictions were presented the final reward of art is money and not the pleasure of creating  perhaps they would be willing to take it all oat in that if othah people would let them pay their bills in the pleasure of creating his daughter teased  they are helpless like all the rest said her father with the same deference to her as to other women i do not blame them  oh mah goodness didnt you say sir that mr beaton had bad manners  alma relieved a confusion which he seemed to feel in reference to her bad manners he has no manners that is when hes himself he has pretty good ones when hes somebody else  miss woodburn began oh mah and then stopped herself almas mother looked at her with distressed question but the girl seemed perfectly cool and contented and she gave her mind provisionally to a point suggested by colonel woodburns talk  still i cant believe it was right to hold people in slavery to whip them and sell them it never did seem right to me she added in apology for her extreme sentiments to the gentleness of her adversary  i quite agree with you madam said the colonel those were the abuses of the institution but if we had not been vitiated on the one hand and threatened on the other by the spirit of commercialism from the northand from europe toothose abuses could have been eliminated and the institution developed in the direction of the mild patriarchalism of the divine intention the colonel hitched his chair which figured a hobby careering upon its hind legs a little toward mrs leighton and the girls approached their heads and began to whisper they fell deferentially silent when the colonel paused in his argument and went on again when he went on  at last they heard mrs leighton saying and have you heard from the publishers about your book yet  then miss woodburn cut in before her father could answer the coase of commercialism is on that too they are trahing to fahnd oat whethah it will pay  and they are rightquite right said the colonel there is no longer any other criterion and even a work that attacks the system must be submitted to the tests of the system  the system wont accept destruction on any othah tomes said miss woodburn demurely     xi  at the reception where two men in livery stood aside to let him pass up the outside steps of the house and two more helped him off with his overcoat indoors and a fifth miscalled his name into the drawingroom the syracuse stonecutters son met the niece of mrs horn and began at once to tell her about his evening at the dryfooses he was in very good spirits for so far as he could have been elated or depressed by his parting with alma leighton he had been elated she had not treated his impudence with the contempt that he felt it deserved she must still be fond of him and the warm sense of this by operation of an obscure but wellrecognized law of the masculine being disposed him to be rather fond of miss vance she was a slender girl whose semiaesthetic dress flowed about her with an accentuation of her long forms and redeemed them from censure by the very frankness with which it confessed them nobody could have said that margaret vance was too tall her pretty little head which she had an effect of choosing to have little in the same spirit of judicious defiance had a good deal of reading in it she was proud to know literary and artistic fashions as well as society fashions she liked being singled out by an exterior distinction so obvious as beatons and she listened with sympathetic interest to his account of those people he gave their natural history reality by drawing upon his own he reconstructed their plebeian past from the experiences of his childhood and his youth of the preparisian period and he had a pang of suicidal joy in insulting their ignorance of the world  what different kinds of people you meet said the girl at last with an envious sigh her reading had enlarged the bounds of her imagination if not her knowledge the novels nowadays dealt so much with very common people and made them seem so very much more worth while than the people one met  she said something like this to beaton he answered you can meet the people im talking of very easily if you want to take the trouble its what they came to new york for i fancy its the great ambition of their lives to be met  oh yes said miss vance fashionably and looked down then she looked up and said intellectually dont you think its a great pity how much better for them to have stayed where they were and what they were  then you could never have had any chance of meeting them said beaton i dont suppose you intend to go out to the gas country  no said miss vance amused not that i shouldnt like to go  what a daring spirit you ought to be on the staff of every other week said beaton  the staffevery other week what is it  the missing link the longfelt want of a tie between the arts and the dollars beaton gave her a very picturesque a very dramatic sketch of the theory the purpose and the personnel of the new enterprise  miss vance understood too little about business of any kind to know how it differed from other enterprises of its sort she thought it was delightful she thought beaton must be glad to be part of it though he had represented himself so bored so injured by fulkersons insisting upon having him and is it a secret is it a thing not to be spoken of  tutt altro fulkerson will be enraptured to have it spoken of in society he would pay any reasonable bill for the advertisement  what a delightful creature tell him it shall all be spent in charity  he would like that he would get two paragraphs out of the fact and your name would go into the literary notes of all the newspapers  oh but i shouldnt want my name used cried the girl half horrified into fancying the situation real  then youd better not say anything about every other week fulkerson is preternaturally unscrupulous  march began to think so too at times he was perpetually suggesting changes in the makeup of the first number with a view to its greater vividness of effect one day he came and said this thing isnt going to have any sort of get up and howl about it unless you have a paper in the first number going for bevanss novels better get maxwell to do it  why i thought you liked bevanss novels  so i did but where the good of every other week is concerned i am a roman father the popular gag is to abuse bevans and maxwell is the man to do it there hasnt been a new magazine started for the last three years that hasnt had an article from maxwell in its first number cutting bevans all to pieces if people dont see it theyll think every other week is some old thing  march did not know whether fulkerson was joking or not he suggested perhaps theyll think its an old thing if they do see it  well get somebody else then or else get maxwell to write under an assumed name ori forgot hell be anonymous under our system anyway now there aint a more popular racket for us to work in that first number than a good swinging attack on bevans people read his books and quarrel over em and the critics are all against him and a regular flaying with salt and vinegar rubbed in afterward will tell more with people who like good oldfashioned fiction than anything else i like bevanss things but dad burn it when it comes to that first number id offer up anybody  what an immoral little wretch you are fulkerson said march with a laugh  fulkerson appeared not to be very strenuous about the attack on the novelist say he called out gayly what should you think of a paper defending the late lamented system of slavery  what do you mean fulkerson asked march with a puzzled smile  fulkerson braced his knees against his desk and pushed himself back but kept his balance to the eye by canting his hat sharply forward theres an old cock over there at the widows thats written a book to prove that slavery was and is the only solution of the labor problem hes a southerner  i should imagine march assented  hes got it on the brain that if the south could have been let alone by the commercial spirit and the pseudophilanthropy of the north it would have worked out slavery into a perfectly ideal condition for the laborer in which he would have been insured against want and protected in all his personal rights by the state he read the introduction to me last night i didnt catch on to all the pointshis daughters an awfully pretty girl and i was carrying that fact in my mind all the time too you knowbut thats about the gist of it  seems to regard it as a lost opportunity said march  exactly what a mighty catchy title neigh look well on the titlepage  well written  i reckon so i dont know the colonel read it mighty eloquently  it mightnt be such bad business said march in a muse could you get me a sight of it without committing yourself  if the colonel hasnt sent it off to another publisher this morning he just got it back with thanks yesterday he likes to keep it travelling  well try it ive a notion it might be a curious thing  look here march said fulkerson with the effect of taking a fresh hold i wish you could let me have one of those new york things of yours for the first number after all thats going to be the great card  i couldnt fulkerson i couldnt really i want to philosophize the material and im too new to it all yet i dont want to do merely superficial sketches  of course of course i understand that well i dont want to hurry you seen that old fellow of yours yet i think we ought to have that translation in the first number dont you we want to give em a notion of what were going to do in that line  yes said march and i was going out to look up lindau this morning ive inquired at maronis and he hasnt been there for several days ive some idea perhaps hes sick but they gave me his address and im going to see  well thats right we want the first number to be the keynote in every way  march shook his head you cant make it so the first number is bound to be a failure always as far as the representative character goes its invariably the case look at the first numbers of all the things youve seen started theyre experimental almost amateurish and necessarily so not only because the men that are making them up are comparatively inexperienced like ourselves but because the material sent them to deal with is more or less consciously tentative people send their adventurous things to a new periodical because the whole thing is an adventure ive noticed that quality in all the volunteer contributions its in the articles that have been done to order even no ive about made up my mind that if we can get one good striking paper into the first number that will take peoples minds off the others we shall be doing all we can possible hope for i should like march added less seriously to make up three numbers ahead and publish the third one first  fulkerson dropped forward and struck his fist on the desk its a firstrate idea why not do it  march laughed fulkerson i dont believe theres any quackish thing you wouldnt do in this cause from time to time im thoroughly ashamed of being connected with such a charlatan  fulkerson struck his hat sharply backward ah dad burn it to give that thing the right kind of start id walk up and down broadway between two boards with the titlepage of every other week facsimiled on one and my name and address on the  he jumped to his feet and shouted march ill do it  what  ill hire a lot of fellows to make mudturtles of themselves and ill have a lot of big facsimiles of the titlepage and ill paint the town red  march looked aghast at him oh come now fulkerson  i mean it i was in london when a new man had taken hold of the old cornhill and they were trying to boom it and they had a procession of these mudturtles that reached from charing cross to temple bar cornhill magazine sixpence not a dull page in it i said to myself then that it was the livest thing i ever saw i respected the man that did that thing from the bottom of my heart i wonder i ever forgot it but it shows what a shaky thing the human mind is at its best  you infamous mountebank said march with great amusement at fulkersons access you call that congeries of advertising instinct of yours the human mind at its best come dont be so diffident fulkerson well im off to find lindau and when i come back i hope mr dryfoos will have you under control i dont suppose youll be quite sane again till after the first number is out perhaps public opinion will sober you then  confound it march how do you think they will take it i swear im getting so nervous i dont know half the time which end of me is up i believe if we dont get that thing out by the first of february it ll be the death of me  couldnt wait till washingtons birthday i was thinking it would give the day a kind of distinction and strike the public imagination if  no ill be dogged if i could fulkerson lapsed more and more into the parlance of his early life in this season of strong excitement i believe if beaton lags any on the art leg ill kill him  well i shouldnt mind your killing beaton said march tranquilly as he went out  he went over to third avenue and took the elevated down to chatham square he found the variety of people in the car as unfailingly entertaining as ever he rather preferred the east side to the west side lines because they offered more nationalities conditions and characters to his inspection they draw not only from the uptown american region but from all the vast hive of populations swarming between them and the east river he had found that according to the hour american husbands going to and from business and american wives going to and from shopping prevailed on the sixth avenue road and that the most picturesque admixture to these familiar aspects of human nature were the brilliant eyes and complexions of the american hebrews who otherwise contributed to the effect of wellclad comfort and citizenselfsatisfaction of the crowd now and then he had found himself in a car mostly filled with neapolitans from the constructions far up the line where he had read how they are worked and fed and housed like beasts and listening to the jargon of their unintelligible dialect he had occasion for pensive question within himself as to what notion these poor animals formed of a free republic from their experience of life under its conditions and whether they found them practically very different from those of the immemorial brigandage and enforced complicity with rapine under which they had been born but after all this was an infrequent effect however massive of travel on the west side whereas the east offered him continual entertainment in like sort the sort was never quite so squalid for short distances the lowest poverty the hardest pressed labor must walk but march never entered a car without encountering some interesting shape of shabby adversity which was almost always adversity of foreign birth new york is still popularly supposed to be in the control of the irish but march noticed in these east side travels of his what must strike every observer returning to the city after a prolonged absence the numerical subordination of the dominant race if they do not outvote them the people of germanic of slavonic of pelasgic of mongolian stock outnumber the prepotent celts and march seldom found his speculation centred upon one of these the small eyes the high cheeks the broad noses the puff lips the bare cuefilleted skulls of russians poles czechs chinese the furtive glitter of italians the blonde dulness of germans the cold quiet of scandinaviansfire under icewere aspects that he identified and that gave him abundant suggestion for the personal histories he constructed and for the more publicspirited reveries in which he dealt with the future economy of our heterogeneous commonwealth it must be owned that he did not take much trouble about this what these poor people were thinking hoping fearing enjoying suffering just where and how they lived who and what they individually werethese were the matters of his waking dreams as he stared hard at them while the train raced farther into the gay uglinessthe shapeless graceful reckless picturesqueness of the bowery  there were certain signs certain facades certain audacities of the prevailing hideousness that always amused him in that uproar to the eye which the strident forms and colors made he was interested in the insolence with which the railway had drawn its erasing line across the corinthian front of an old theatre almost grazing its fluted pillars and flouting its dishonored pediment the colossal effigies of the fat women and the tuftheaded circassian girls of cheap museums the vistas of shabby cross streets the survival of an old hiproofed house here and there at their angles the swiss chalet histrionic decorativeness of the stations in prospect or retrospect the vagaries of the lines that narrowed together or stretched apart according to the width of the avenue but always in wanton disregard of the life that dwelt and bought and sold and rejoiced or sorrowed and clattered or crawled around below abovewere features of the frantic panorama that perpetually touched his sense of humor and moved his sympathy accident and then exigency seemed the forces at work to this extraordinary effect the play of energies as free and planless as those that force the forest from the soil to the sky and then the fierce struggle for survival with the stronger life persisting over the deformity the mutilation the destruction the decay of the weaker the whole at moments seemed to him lawless godless the absence of intelligent comprehensive purpose in the huge disorder and the violent struggle to subordinate the result to the greater good penetrated with its dumb appeal the consciousness of a man who had always been too selfenwrapped to perceive the chaos to which the individual selfishness must always lead  but there was still nothing definite nothing better than a vague discomfort however poignant in his half recognition of such facts and he descended the station stairs at chatham square with a sense of the neglected opportunities of painters in that locality he said to himself that if one of those fellows were to see in naples that turmoil of cars trucks and teams of every sort intershot with footpassengers going and coming to and from the crowded pavements under the web of the railroad tracks overhead and amid the spectacular approach of the streets that open into the square he would have it down in his sketchbook at once he decided simultaneously that his own local studies must be illustrated and that he must come with the artist and show him just which bits to do not knowing that the two arts can never approach the same material from the same point he thought he would particularly like his illustrator to render the dickensy cockneyish quality of the shabbygenteel balladseller of whom he stopped to ask his way to the street where lindau lived and whom he instantly perceived to be with his stock in trade the sufficient object of an entire study by himself he had his ballads strung singly upon a cord against the house wall and held down in piles on the pavement with stones and blocks of wood their control in this way intimated a volatility which was not perceptible in their sentiment they were mostly tragical or doleful some of them dealt with the wrongs of the workingman others appealed to a gay experience of the high seas but vastly the greater part to memories and associations of an irish origin some still uttered the poetry of plantation life in the artless accents of the endman where they trusted themselves with syntax that yielded promptly to any exigency of rhythmic art to the ordinary american speech it was to strike directly for the affections to celebrate the domestic ties and above all to embalm the memories of angel and martyr mothers whose dissipated sons deplored their sufferings too late march thought this not at all a bad thing in them he smiled in patronage of their simple pathos he paid the tribute of a laugh when the poet turned as he sometimes did from his conception of angel and martyr motherhood and portrayed the mother in her more familiar phases of virtue and duty with the retributive shingle or slipper in her hand he bought a pocketful of this literature popular in a sense which the most successful book can never be and enlisted the ballad vendor so deeply in the effort to direct him to lindaus dwelling by the best way that he neglected another customer till a sarcasm on his absentmindedness stung hint to retort im atrying to answer a gentleman a civil question thats where the absentminded comes in  it seemed for some reason to be a day of leisure with the chinese dwellers in mott street which march had been advised to take first they stood about the tops of basement stairs and walked two and two along the dirty pavement with their little hands tucked into their sleeves across their breasts aloof in immaculate cleanliness from the filth around them and scrutinizing the scene with that cynical sneer of faint surprise to which all aspects of our civilization seem to move their superiority their numbers gave character to the street and rendered not them but what was foreign to them strange there so that march had a sense of missionary quality in the old catholic church built long before their incursion was dreamed of it seemed to have come to them there and he fancied in the statued saint that looked down from its facade something not so much tolerant as tolerated something propitiatory almost deprecatory it was a fancy of course the street was sufficiently peopled with christian children at any rate swarming and shrieking at their games and presently a christian mother appeared pushed along by two policemen on a handcart with a gelatinous tremor over the paving and a gelatinous jouncing at the curbstones she lay with her face to the sky sending up an inarticulate lamentation but the indifference of the officers forbade the notion of tragedy in her case she was perhaps a local celebrity the children left off their games and ran gayly trooping after her even the young fellow and young girl exchanging playful blows in a robust flirtation at the corner of a liquor store suspended their scuffle with a pleased interest as she passed march understood the unwillingness of the poor to leave the worst conditions in the city for comfort and plenty in the country when he reflected upon this dramatic incident one of many no doubt which daily occur to entertain them in such streets a small town could rarely offer anything comparable to it and the country never he said that if life appeared so hopeless to him as it must to the dwellers in that neighborhood he should not himself be willing to quit its distractions its alleviations for the vague promise of unknown good in the distance somewhere  but what charm could such a man as lindau find in such a place it could not be that he lived there because he was too poor to live elsewhere with a shutting of the heart march refused to believe this as he looked round on the abounding evidences of misery and guiltily remembered his neglect of his old friend lindau could probably find as cheap a lodging in some decenter part of the town and in fact there was some amelioration of the prevailing squalor in the quieter street which he turned into from mott  a woman with a tiedup face of toothache opened the door for him when he pulled with a shiver of foreboding the bellknob from which a yard of rusty crape dangled but it was not lindau who was dead for the woman said he was at home and sent march stumbling up the four or five dark flights of stairs that led to his tenement it was quite at the top of the house and when march obeyed the germanenglish komm that followed his knock he found himself in a kitchen where a meagre breakfast was scattered in stale fragments on the table before the stove the place was bare and cold a halfempty beer bottle scarcely gave it a convivial air on the left from this kitchen was a room with a bed in it which seemed also to be a cobblers shop on the right through a door that stood ajar came the germanenglish voice again saying this time hier     xii  march pushed the door open into a room like that on the left but with a writingdesk instead of a cobblers bench and a bed where lindau sat propped up with a coat over his shoulders and a skullcap on his head reading a book from which he lifted his eyes to stare blankly over his spectacles at march his hairy old breast showed through the nightshirt which gaped apart the stump of his left arm lay upon the book to keep it open  ah my tear yong friendt passil marge iss it you he called out joyously the next moment  why are you sick lindau march anxiously scanned his face in taking his hand  lindau laughed no im all righdt only a lidtle lazy and a lidtle eggonomigal idts jeaper to stay in pedt sometimes as to geep a fire agoin all the time dont wandt to gome too hardt on the brafer mann you know       braver mann er schafft mir zu essen  you remember heine you readt heine still who is your favorite boet now passil you write some boetry yourself yet no well i am gladt to zee you brush those baperss off of that jair well idt is goodt for zore eyess how didt you findt where i lif  they told me at maronis said march he tried to keep his eyes on lindaus face and not see the discomfort of the room but he was aware of the shabby and frowsy bedding the odor of stale smoke and the pipes and tobacco shreds mixed with the books and manuscripts strewn over the leaf of the writingdesk he laid down on the mass the pile of foreign magazines he had brought under his arm they gave me another address first  yes i have chust gome here said lindau idt is not very coy neigh  it might be gayer march admitted with a smile still he added soberly a good many people seem to live in this part of the town apparently they die here too lindau there is crape on your outside door i didnt know but it was for you  nodt this time said lindau in the same humor berhaps some other time we geep the ondertakers bratty puzy down here  well said march undertakers must live even if the rest of us have to die to let them lindau laughed and march went on but im glad it isnt your funeral lindau and you say youre not sick and so i dont see why we shouldnt come to business  pusiness lindau lifted his eyebrows you gome on pusiness  and pleasure combined said march and he went on to explain the service he desired at lindaus hands  the old man listened with serious attention and with assenting nods that culminated in a spoken expression of his willingness to undertake the translations march waited with a sort of mechanical expectation of his gratitude for the work put in his way but nothing of the kind came from lindau and march was left to say well everything is understood then and i dont know that i need add that if you ever want any little advance on the work  i will ask you said lindau quietly and i thank you for that but i can wait i tont needt any money just at bresent as if he saw some appeal for greater frankness in marchs eye he went on i tidnt gome here begause i was too boor to lif anywhere else and i tont stay in pedt begause i couldnt haf a fire to geep warm if i wanted it im nodt zo padt off as marmontel when he went to paris im a lidtle loaxurious that is all if i stay in pedt its zo i can fling money away on somethings else heigh  but what are you living here for lindau march smiled at the irony lurking in lindaus words  well you zee i foundt i was begoming a lidtle too moch of an aristograt i hadt a room oap in creenvidge willage among dose pig pugs over on the west side and i foundtliudaus voice lost its jesting quality and his face darkenedthat i was beginning to forget the boor  i should have thought said march with impartial interest that you might have seen poverty enough now and then in greenwich village to remind you of its existence  nodt like here said lindau andt you must zee it all the dtimezee it hear it smell it dtaste itor you forget it that is what i gome here for i was begoming a ploated aristograt i thought i was nodt like these beople down here when i gome down once to look aroundt i thought i must be somethings else and zo i zaid i better take myself in time and i gome here among my brothersthe becears and the thiefs a noise made itself heard in the next room as if the door were furtively opened and a faint sound of tiptoeing and of hands clawing on a table  thiefs lindau repeated with a shout lidtle thiefs that gabture your breakfast ah ha ha a wild scurrying of feet joyous cries and tittering and a slamming door followed upon his explosion and he resumed in the silence idt is the children cot pack from school they gome and steal what i leaf there on my daple idts one of our lidtle chokes we onderstand one another thats all righdt once the gobbler in the other room there he used to chase em he couldnt onderstand their lidtle tricks now dot gopplers teadt and he tont chase em any more he was a bohemian gindt of grazy i cuess  well its a sociable existence march suggested but perhaps if you let them have the things without stealing  oh no no most nodt mage them too gonceitedt they mostnt go and feel themselfs petter than those boor millionairss that hadt to steal their money  march smiled indulgently at his old friends violence oh there are fagots and fagots you know lindau perhaps not all the millionaires are so guilty  let us speak german cried lindau in his own tongue pushing his book aside and thrusting his skullcap back from his forehead how much money can a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing some other man  well if youll let me answer in english said march i should say about five thousand dollars a year i name that figure because its my experience that i never could earn more but the experience of other men may be different and if they tell me they can earn ten or twenty or fifty thousand a year im not prepared to say they cant do it  lindau hardly waited for his answer not the most gifted man that ever lived in the practice of any art or science and paid at the highest rate that exceptional genius could justly demand from those who have worked for their money could ever earn a million dollars it is the landlords and the merchant princes the railroad kings and the coal barons the oppressors to whom you instinctively give the titles of tyrantsit is these that make the millions but no man earns them what artist what physician what scientist what poet was ever a millionaire  i can only think of the poet rogers said march amused by lindaus tirade but he was as exceptional as the other rogers the martyr who died with warm feet lindau had apparently not understood his joke and he went on with the american ease of mind about everything but you must allow lindau that some of those fellows dont do so badly with their guilty gains some of them give work to armies of poor people  lindau furiously interrupted yes when they have gathered their millions together from the hunger and cold and nakedness and ruin and despair of hundreds of thousands of other men they give work to the poor they give work they allow their helpless brothers to earn enough to keep life in them they give work who is it gives toil and where will your rich men be when once the poor shall refuse to give toil why you have come to give me work  march laughed outright well im not a millionaire anyway lindau and i hope you wont make an example of me by refusing to give toil i dare say the millionaires deserve it but id rather they wouldnt suffer in my person  no returned the old man mildly relaxing the fierce glare he had bent upon march no man deserves to sufer at the hands of another i lose myself when i think of the injustice in the world but i must not forget that i am like the worst of them  you might go up fifth avenue and live among the rich awhile when youre in danger of that suggested march at any rate he added by an impulse which he knew he could not justify to his wife i wish youd come some day and lunch with their emissary ive been telling mrs march about you and i want her and the children to see you come over with these things and report he put his hand on the magazines as he rose  i will come said lindau gently  shall i give you your book asked march  no i gidt oap bretty soon  andandcan you dress yourself  i vhistle and one of those lidtle fellowss comess we haf to dake gare of one another in a blace like this idt iss nodt like the worldt said lindau gloomily  march thought he ought to cheer him up oh it isnt such a bad world lindau after all the average of millionaires is small in it he added and i dont believe theres an american living that could look at that arm of yours and not wish to lend you a hand for the one you gave us all march felt this to be a fine turn and his voice trembled slightly in saying it  lindau smiled grimly you think zo i wouldnt moch like to drost em ive driedt idt too often he began to speak german again fiercely besides they owe me nothing do you think i knowingly gave my hand to save this oligarchy of traders and tricksters this aristocracy of railroad wreckers and stock gamblers and mineslave drivers and millserf owners no i gave it to the slave the slaveha ha hawhom i helped to unshackle to the common liberty of hunger and cold and you think i would be the beneficiary of such a state of things  im sorry to hear you talk so lindau said march very sorry he stopped with a look of pain and rose to go lindau suddenly broke into a laugh and into english  oh well it is only dalk passil and it toes me goodt my parg is worse than my pidte i cuess i pring these things roundt bretty soon goodbye passil my tear poy auf wiedersehen     xiii  march went away thinking of what lindau had said but not for the impersonal significance of his words so much as for the light they cast upon lindau himself he thought the words violent enough but in connection with what he remembered of the cheery poetic hopeful idealist they were even more curious than lamentable in his own life of comfortable reverie he had never heard any one talk so before but he had read something of the kind now and then in blatant labor newspapers which he had accidentally fallen in with and once at a strikers meeting he had heard rich people denounced with the same frenzy he had made his own reflections upon the tastelessness of the rhetoric and the obvious buncombe of the motive and he had not taken the matter seriously  he could not doubt lindaus sincerity and he wondered how he came to that way of thinking from his experience of himself he accounted for a prevailing literary quality in it he decided it to be from lindaus reading and feeling rather than his reflection that was the notion he formed of some things he had met with in ruskin to much the same effect he regarded them with amusement as the chimeras of a rhetorician run away with by his phrases  but as to lindau the chief thing in his mind was a conception of the droll irony of a situation in which so fervid a hater of millionaires should be working indirectly at least for the prosperity of a man like dryfoos who as march understood had got his money together out of every gamblers chance in speculation and all a schemers thrift from the error and need of others the situation was not more incongruous however than all the rest of the every other week affair it seemed to him that there were no crazy fortuities that had not tended to its existence and as time went on and the day drew near for the issue of the first number the sense of this intensified till the whole lost at moments the quality of a waking fact and came to be rather a fantastic fiction of sleep  yet the heterogeneous forces did cooperate to a reality which march could not deny at least in their presence and the first number was representative of all their nebulous intentions in a tangible form as a result it was so respectable that march began to respect these intentions began to respect himself for combining and embodying them in the volume which appealed to him with a novel fascination when the first advance copy was laid upon his desk every detail of it was tiresomely familiar already but the whole had a fresh interest now he now saw how extremely fit and effective miss leightons decorative design for the cover was printed in black and brickred on the delicate gray tone of the paper it was at once attractive and refined and he credited beaton with quite all he merited in working it over to the actual shape the touch and the taste of the art editor were present throughout the number as fulkerson said beaton had caught on with the delicacy of a hummingbird and the tenacity of a bulldog to the virtues of their illustrative process and had worked it for all it was worth there were seven papers in the number and a poem on the last page of the cover and he had found some graphic comment for each it was a larger proportion than would afterward be allowed but for once in a way it was allowed fulkerson said they could not expect to get their money back on that first number anyway seven of the illustrations were beatons two or three he got from practised hands the rest were the work of unknown people which he had suggested and then related and adapted with unfailing ingenuity to the different papers he handled the illustrations with such sympathy as not to destroy their individual quality and that indefinable charm which comes from good amateur work in whatever art he rescued them from their weaknesses and errors while he left in them the evidence of the pleasure with which a clever young man or a sensitive girl or a refined woman had done them inevitably from his manipulation however the art of the number acquired homogeneity and there was nothing casual in its appearance the result march eagerly owned was better than the literary result and he foresaw that the number would be sold and praised chiefly for its pictures yet he was not ashamed of the literature and he indulged his admiration of it the more freely because he had not only not written it but in a way had not edited it to be sure he had chosen all the material but he had not voluntarily put it all together for that number it had largely put itself together as every number of every magazine does and as it seems more and more to do in the experience of every editor there had to be of course a story and then a sketch of travel there was a literary essay and a social essay there was a dramatic trifle very gay very light there was a dashing criticism on the new pictures the new plays the new books the new fashions and then there was the translation of a bit of vivid russian realism which the editor owed to lindaus exploration of the foreign periodicals left with him lindau was himself a romanticist of the victor hugo sort but he said this fragment of dostoyevski was good of its kind the poem was a bit of society verse with a backward look into simpler and wholesomer experiences  fulkerson was extremely proud of the number but he said it was too goodtoo good from every point of view the cover was too good and the paper was too good and that device of rough edges which got over the objection to uncut leaves while it secured their aesthetic effect was a thing that he trembled for though he rejoiced in it as a stroke of the highest genius it had come from beaton at the last moment as a compromise when the problem of the vulgar croppiness of cut leaves and the unpopularity of uncut leaves seemed to have no solution but suicide fulkerson was still morally crawling round on his hands and knees as he said in abject gratitude at beatons feet though he had his qualms his questions and he declared that beaton was the most inspired ass since balaams were all asses of course he admitted in semiapology to march but were no such asses as beaton he said that if the tasteful decorativeness of the thing did not kill it with the public outright its literary excellence would give it the finishing stroke perhaps that might be overlooked in the impression of novelty which a first number would give but it must never happen again he implored march to promise that it should never happen again he said their only hope was in the immediate cheapening of the whole affair it was bad enough to give the public too much quantity for their money but to throw in such quality as that was simply ruinous it must be stopped these were the expressions of his intimate moods every front that he presented to the public wore a glow of lofty of devout exultation his pride in the number gushed out in fresh bursts of rhetoric to every one whom he could get to talk with him about it he worked the personal kindliness of the press to the utmost he did not mind making himself ridiculous or becoming a joke in the good cause as he called it he joined in the applause when a humorist at the club feigned to drop dead from his chair at fulkersons introduction of the topic and he went on talking that first number into the surviving spectators he stood treat upon all occasions and he lunched attaches of the press at all hours he especially befriended the correspondents of the newspapers of other cities for as he explained to march those fellows could give him any amount of advertising simply as literary gossip many of the fellows were ladies who could not be so summarily asked out to lunch but fulkersons ingenuity was equal to every exigency and he contrived somehow to make each of these feel that she had been possessed of exclusive information there was a moment when march conjectured a willingness in fulkerson to work mrs march into the advertising department by means of a tea to these ladies and their friends which she should administer in his apartment but he did not encourage fulkerson to be explicit and the moment passed afterward when he told his wife about it he was astonished to find that she would not have minded doing it for fulkerson and he experienced another proof of the bluntness of the feminine instincts in some directions and of the personal favor which fulkerson seemed to enjoy with the whole sex this alone was enough to account for the willingness of these correspondents to write about the first number but march accused him of sending it to their addresses with boxes of jacqueminot roses and huyler candy  fulkerson let him enjoy his joke he said that he would do that or anything else for the good cause short of marrying the whole circle of female correspondents  march was inclined to hope that if the first number had been made too good for the country at large the more enlightened taste of metropolitan journalism would invite a compensating favor for it in new york but first fulkerson and then the event proved him wrong in spite of the quality of the magazine and in spite of the kindness which so many newspaper men felt for fulkerson the notices in the new york papers seemed grudging and provisional to the ardor of the editor a merit in the work was acknowledged and certain defects in it for which march had trembled were ignored but the critics astonished him by selecting for censure points which he was either proud of or had never noticed which being now brought to his notice he still could not feel were faults he owned to fulkerson that if they had said so and so against it he could have agreed with them but that to say thus and so was preposterous and that if the advertising had not been adjusted with such generous recognition of the claims of the different papers he should have known the countingroom was at the bottom of it as it was he could only attribute it to perversity or stupidity it was certainly stupid to condemn a magazine novelty like every other week for being novel and to augur that if it failed it would fail through its departure from the lines on which all the other prosperous magazines had been built was in the last degree perverse and it looked malicious the fact that it was neither exactly a book nor a magazine ought to be for it and not against it since it would invade no other field it would prosper on no ground but its own     xiv  the more march thought of the injustice of the new york press which had not however attacked the literary quality of the number the more bitterly he resented it and his wifes indignation superheated his own every other week had become a very personal affair with the whole family the children shared their parents disgust belle was outspoken in her denunciations of a venal press mrs march saw nothing but ruin ahead and began tacitly to plan a retreat to boston and an establishment retrenched to the basis of two thousand a year she shed some secret tears in anticipation of the privations which this must involve but when fulkerson came to see march rather late the night of the publication day she nobly told him that if the worst came to the worst she could only have the kindliest feeling toward him and should not regard him as in the slightest degree responsible  oh hold on hold on he protested you dont think weve made a failure do you  why of course she faltered while march remained gloomily silent  well i guess well wait for the official count first even new york hasnt gone against us and i guess theres a majority coming down to harlem river that could sweep everything before it anyway  what do you mean fulkerson march demanded sternly  oh nothing only the news company has ordered ten thousand now and you know we had to give them the first twenty on commission  what do you mean march repeated his wife held her breath  i mean that the first number is a booming success already and that its going to a hundred thousand before it stops that unanimity and variety of censure in the morning papers combined with the attractiveness of the thing itself has cleared every stand in the city and now if the favor of the country press doesnt turn the tide against us our fortunes made the marches remained dumb why look here didnt i tell you those criticisms would be the making of us when they first began to turn you blue this morning march  he came home to lunch perfectly sick said mrs marcli and i wouldnt let him go back again  didnt i tell you so fulkerson persisted  march could not remember that he had or that he had been anything but incoherently and hysterically jocose over the papers but he said yes yesi think so  i knew it from the start said fulkerson the only other person who took those criticisms in the right spirit was mother dryfoosive just been bolstering up the dryfoos family she had them read to her by mrs mandel and she understood them to be all the most flattering prophecies of success well i didnt read between the lines to that extent quite but i saw that they were going to help us if there was anything in us more than anything that could have been done and there was something in us i tell you march that sevenshooting selfcocking donkey of a beaton has given us the greatest start hes caught on like a mouse hes made the thing awfully chic its jimmy theres lots of dog about it hes managed that process so that the illustrations look as expensive as firstclass woodcuts and theyre cheaper than chromos hes put style into the whole thing  oh yes said march with eager meekness its beaton thats done it  fulkerson read jealousy of beaton in mrs marchs face beaton has given us the start because his work appeals to the eye theres no denying that the pictures have sold this first number but i expect the literature of this first number to sell the pictures of the second ive been reading it all over nearly since i found how the cat was jumping i was anxious about it and i tell you old man its good yes sir i was afraid maybe you had got it too good with that boston refinement of yours but i reckon you havent ill risk it i dont see how you got so much variety into so few things and all of them palpitant all of em on the keen jump with actuality  the mixture of american slang with the jargon of european criticism in fulkersons talk made march smile but his wife did not seem to notice it in her exultation that is just what i say she broke in its perfectly wonderful i never was anxious about it a moment except as you say mr fulkerson i was afraid it might be too good  they went on in an antiphony of praise till march said really i dont see whats left me but to strike for higher wages i perceive that im indispensable  why old man youre coming in on the divvy you know said fulkerson  they both laughed and when fulkerson was gone mrs march asked her husband what a divvy was  its a chicken before its hatched  no truly  he explained and she began to spend the divvy  at mrs leightons fulkerson gave alma all the honor of the success he told her mother that the girls design for the cover had sold every number and mrs leighton believed him  well ah think ah maght have some of the glory miss woodburn pouted where am ah comin in  youre coming in on the cover of the next number said fulkerson were going to have your face there miss leightons going to sketch it in he said this reckless of the fact that he had already shown them the design of the second number which was beatons weird bit of gascountry landscape  ah dont see why you dont wrahte the fiction for your magazine mr fulkerson said the girl  this served to remind fulkerson of something he turned to her father ill tell you what colonel woodburn i want mr march to see some chapters of that book of yours ive been talking to him about it  i do not think it would add to the popularity of your periodical sir said the colonel with a stately pleasure in being asked my views of a civilization based upon responsible slavery would hardly be acceptable to your commercialized society  well not as a practical thing of course fulkerson admitted but as something retrospective speculative i believe it would make a hit theres so much going on now about social questions i guess people would like to read it  i do not know that my work is intended to amuse people said the colonel with some state  mah goodness ah only wish it was then said his daughter and she added yes mr fulkerson the colonel will be very glad to submit potions of his woak to yo edito we want to have some of the honaw perhaps we can say we helped to stop yo magazine if we didnt help to stawt it  they all laughed at her boldness and fulkerson said it ll take a good deal more than that to stop every other week the colonels whole book couldnt do it then he looked unhappy for colonel woodburn did not seem to enjoy his reassuring words but miss woodburn came to his rescue you maght illustrate it with the potrait of the awthoris daughtaw if its too late for the covah  going to have that in every number miss woodburn he cried  oh mah goodness she said with mock humility  alma sat looking at her piquant head black unconsciously outlined against the lamp as she sat working by the table just keep still a moment  she got her sketchblock and pencils and began to draw fulkerson tilted himself forward and looked over her shoulder he smiled outwardly inwardly he was divided between admiration of miss woodburns arch beauty and appreciation of the skill which reproduced it at the same time he was trying to remember whether march had authorized him to go so far as to ask for a sight of colonel woodburns manuscript he felt that he had trenched upon marchs province and he framed one apology to the editor for bringing him the manuscript and another to the author for bringing it back  most ah hold raght still like it was a photograph asked miss woodburn can ah toak  talk all you want said alma squinting her eyes and you neednt be either adamantine nor yetwooden  oh ho very good of you well if ah can toakgo on mr fulkerson  me talk i cant breathe till this thing is done sighed fulkerson at that point of his mental drama the colonel was behaving rustily about the return of his manuscript and he felt that he was looking his last on miss woodburns profile  is she getting it raght asked the girl  i dont know which is which said fulkerson  oh ah hope ah shall ah dont want to go round feelin like a sheet of papah half the time  you could rattle on just the same suggested alma  oh now jost listen to that mr fulkerson do you call that any way to toak to people  you might know which you were by the color fulkerson began and then he broke off from the personal consideration with a business inspiration and smacked himself on the knee we could print it in color  mrs leighton gathered up her sewing and held it with both hands in her lap while she came round and looked critically at the sketch and the model over her glasses its very good alma she said  colonel woodburn remained restively on his side of the table of course mr fulkerson you were jesting sir when you spoke of printing a sketch of my daughter  why i dont knowif you object  i do sirdecidedly said the colonel  then that settles it of coursei only meant  indeed it doesnt cried the girl whos to know who its from ahm jost set on havin it printed ahm going to appear as the head of slaveryin opposition to the head of liberty  therell be a revolution inside of fortyeight hours and well have the colonels system going wherever a copy of every other week circulates said fulkerson  this sketch belongs to me alma interposed im not going to let it be printed  oh mah goodness said miss woodburn laughing goodhumoredly thats becose you were brought up to hate slavery  i should like mr beaton to see it said mrs leighton in a sort of absent tone she added to fulkerson i rather expected he might be in tonight  well if he comes well leave it to beaton fulkerson said with relief in the solution and an anxious glance at the colonel across the table to see how he took that form of the joke miss woodburn intercepted his glance and laughed and fulkerson laughed too but rather forlornly  alma set her lips primly and turned her head first on one side and then on the other to look at the sketch i dont think well leave it to mr beaton even if he comes  we left the other design for the cover to beaton fulkerson insinuated i guess you neednt be afraid of him  is it a question of my being afraid alma asked she seemed coolly intent on her drawing  miss leighton thinks he ought to be afraid of her miss woodburn explained  its a question of his courage then said alma  well i dont think there are many young ladies that beatons afraid of said fulkerson giving himself the respite of this purely random remark while he interrogated the faces of mrs leighton and colonel woodburn for some light upon the tendency of their daughters words  he was not helped by mrs leightons saying with a certain anxiety i dont know what you mean mr fulkerson  well youre as much in the dark as i am myself then said fulkerson i suppose i meant that beaton is ratherafavorite you know the women like him  mrs leighton sighed and colonel woodburn rose and left the room  in the silence that followed fulkerson looked from one lady to the other with dismay i seem to have put my foot in it somehow he suggested and miss woodburn gave a cry of laughter  poo mr fulkerson poo mr fulkerson papa thoat you wanted him to go  wanted him to go repeated fulkerson  we always mention mr beaton when we want to get rid of papa  well it seems to me that i have noticed that he didnt take much interest in beaton as a general topic but i dont know that i ever saw it drive him out of the room before  well he isnt always so bad said miss woodburn but it was a case of hate at first sight and it seems to be growin on papa  well i can understand that said fulkerson the impulse to destroy beaton is something that everybody has to struggle against at the start  i must say mr fulkerson said mrs leighton in the tremor through which she nerved herself to differ openly with any one she liked i never had to struggle with anything of the kind in regard to mr beaton he has always been most respectful andandconsiderate with me whatever he has been with others  well of course mrs leighton fulkerson came back in a soothing tone but you see youre the rule that proves the exception i was speaking of the way men felt about beaton its different with ladies i just said so  is it always different alma asked lifting her head and her hand from her drawing and staring at it absently  fulkerson pushed both his hands through his whiskers look here look here he said wont somebody start some other subject we havent had the weather up yet have we or the opera what is the matter with a few remarks about politics  why ah thoat you lahked to toak about the staff of yo magazine said miss woodburn  oh i do said fulkerson but not always about the same member of it he gets monotonous when he doesnt get complicated ive just come round from the marches he added to mrs leighton  i suppose theyve got thoroughly settled in their apartment by this time mrs leighton said something like this whenever the marches were mentioned at the bottom of her heart she had not forgiven them for not taking her rooms she had liked their looks so much and she was always hoping that they were uncomfortable or dissatisfied she could not help wanting them punished a little  well yes as much as they ever will be fulkerson answered the boston style is pretty different you know and the marches are oldfashioned folks and i reckon they never went in much for bricabrac theyve put away nine or ten barrels of dragon candlesticks but they keep finding new ones  their landlady has just joined our class said alma isnt her name green she happened to see my copy of every other week and said she knew the editor and told me  well its a little world said fulkerson you seem to be touching elbows with everybody just think of your having had our head translator for a model  ah think that your whole publication revolves aroand the leighton family said miss woodburn  thats pretty much so fulkerson admitted anyhow the publisher seems disposed to do so  are you the publisher i thought it was mr dryfoos said alma  it is  oh  the tone and the word gave fulkerson a discomfort which he promptly confessed missed again  the girls laughed and he regained something of his lost spirits and smiled upon their gayety which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it  miss woodburn asked and is mr dryfoos senio anything like ouah mr dryfoos  not the least  but hes jost as exemplary  yes in his way  well ah wish ah could see all those pinks of puffection togethah once  why look here ive been thinking id celebrate a little when the old gentleman gets back have a little suppersomething of that kind how would you like to let me have your parlors for it mrs leighton you ladies could stand on the stairs and have a peep at us in the bunch  oh mah what a privilege and will miss alma be there with the othah contributors ah shall jost expah of envy  she wont be there in person said fulkerson but shell be represented by the head of the art department  mah goodness and wholl the head of the publishing department represent  he can represent you said alma  well ah want to be represented someho  well have the banquet the night before you appear on the cover of our fourth number said fulkerson  ah thoat that was doubly fobidden said miss woodburn by the stern parent and the envious awtust  well get beaton to get round them somehow i guess we can trust him to manage that  mrs leighton sighed her resentment of the implication  i always feel that mr beaton doesnt do himself justice she began  fulkerson could not forego the chance of a joke well maybe he would rather temper justice with mercy in a case like his this made both the younger ladies laugh i judge this is my chance to get off with my life he added and he rose as he spoke mrs leighton i am about the only man of my sex who doesnt thirst for beatons blood most of the time but i know him and i dont hes more kinds of a good fellow than people generally understand he doesnt wear his heart upon his sleevenot his ulster sleeve anyway you can always count me on your side when its a question of finding beaton not guilty if hell leave the state  alma set her drawing against the wall in rising to say goodnight to fulkerson he bent over on his stick to look at it well its beautiful he sighed with unconscious sincerity  alma made him a courtesy of mock modesty thanks to miss woodburn  oh no all she had to do was simply to stay put  dont you think ah might have improved it if ah had looked better the girl asked gravely  oh you couldnt said fulkerson and he went off triumphant in their applause and their cries of which which  mrs leighton sank deep into an accusing gloom when at last she found herself alone with her daughter i dont know what you are thinking about alma leighton if you dont like mr beaton  i dont  you dont you know better than that you know that you did care for him  oh thats a very different thing thats a thing that can be got over  got over repeated mrs leighton aghast  of course it can dont be romantic mamma people get over dozens of such fancies they even marry for love two or three times  never cried her mother doing her best to feel shocked and at last looking it  her looking it had no effect upon alma you can easily get over caring for people but you cant get over liking themif you like them because they are sweet and good thats what lasts i was a simple goose and he imposed upon me because he was a sophisticated goose now the case is reversed  he does care for you now you can see it why do you encourage him to come here  i dont said alma i will tell him to keep away if you like but whether he comes or goes it will be the same  not to him alma he is in love with you  he has never said so  and you would really let him say so when you intend to refuse him  i cant very well refuse him till he does say so  this was undeniable mrs leighton could only demand in an awful tone may i ask whyif you cared for him and i know you care for him still you will refuse him  alma laughed becausebecause im wedded to my art and im not going to commit bigamy whatever i do  alma  well then because i dont like himthat is i dont believe in him and dont trust him hes fascinating but hes false and hes fickle he cant help it i dare say  and you are perfectly hard is it possible that you were actually pleased to have mr fulkerson tease you about mr dryfoos  oh goodnight now mamma this is becoming personal     pg editors bookmarks      artists never do anything like other people     ballast of her instinctive despondency     clinging persistence of such natures     dividend its a chicken before its hatched     gayety which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it     hopeful recklessness     how much can a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing     i cannot endure thisthis hopefulness of yours     if you dread harm enough it is less likely to happen     it must be your despair that helps you to bear up     marry for love two or three times     no man deserves to sufer at the hands of another     patience with mediocrity putting on the style of genius     person talks about taking lessons as if they could learn it     say when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him     shouldnt ca fo the disgrace of bein pooits inconvenience     timidity of the elder in the presence of the younger man     a hazard of new fortunes  by william dean howells     part third  i  the scheme of a banquet to celebrate the initial success of every other week expanded in fulkersons fancy into a series instead of the publishing and editorial force with certain of the more representative artists and authors sitting down to a modest supper in mrs leightons parlors he conceived of a dinner at delmonicos with the principal literary and artistic people throughout the country as guests and an inexhaustible hospitality to reporters and correspondents from whom paragraphs prophetic and historic would flow weeks before and after the first of the series he said the thing was a new departure in magazines it amounted to something in literature as radical as the american revolution in politics it was the idea of self government in the arts and it was this idea that had never yet been fully developed in regard to it that was what must be done in the speeches at the dinner and the speeches must be reported then it would go like wildfire he asked march whether he thought mr depew could be got to come mark twain he was sure would come he was a literary man they ought to invite mr evarts and the cardinal and the leading protestant divines his ambition stopped at nothing nothing but the question of expense there he had to wait the return of the elder dryfoos from the west and dryfoos was still delayed at moffitt and fulkerson openly confessed that he was afraid he would stay there till his own enthusiasm escaped in other activities other plans  fulkerson was as little likely as possible to fall under a superstitious subjection to another man but march could not help seeing that in this possible measure dryfoos was fulkersons fetish he did not revere him march decided because it was not in fulkersons nature to revere anything he could like and dislike but he could not respect apparently however dryfoos daunted him somehow and besides the homage which those who have not pay to those who have fulkerson rendered dryfoos the tribute of a feeling which march could only define as a sort of bewilderment as well as march could make out this feeling was evoked by the spectacle of dryfooss unfailing luck which fulkerson was fond of dazzling himself with it perfectly consisted with a keen sense of whatever was sordid and selfish in a man on whom his career must have had its inevitable effect he liked to philosophize the case with march to recall dryfoos as he was when he first met him still somewhat in the sap at moffitt and to study the processes by which he imagined him to have dried into the hardened speculator without even the pretence to any advantage but his own in his ventures he was aware of painting the character too vividly and he warned march not to accept it exactly in those tints but to subdue them and shade it for himself he said that where his advantage was not concerned there was ever so much good in dryfoos and that if in some things he had grown inflexible he had expanded in others to the full measure of the vast scale on which he did business it had seemed a little odd to march that a man should put money into such an enterprise as every other week and go off about other affairs not only without any sign of anxiety but without any sort of interest but fulkerson said that was the splendid side of dryfoos he had a courage a magnanimity that was equal to the strain of any such uncertainty he had faced the music once for all when he asked fulkerson what the thing would cost in the different degrees of potential failure and then he had gone off leaving everything to fulkerson and the younger dryfoos with the instruction simply to go ahead and not bother him about it fulkerson called that pretty tall for an old fellow who used to bewail the want of pigs and chickens to occupy his mind he alleged it as another proof of the versatility of the american mind and of the grandeur of institutions and opportunities that let every man grow to his full size so that any man in america could run the concern if necessary he believed that old dryfoos could step into bismarcks shoes and run the german empire at ten days notice or about as long as it would take him to go from new york to berlin but bismarck would not know anything about dryfooss plans till dryfoos got ready to show his hand fulkerson himself did not pretend to say what the old man had been up to since he went west he was at moffitt first and then he was at chicago and then he had gone out to denver to look after some mines he had out there and a railroad or two and now he was at moffitt again he was supposed to be closing up his affairs there but nobody could say  fulkerson told march the morning after dryfoos returned that he had not only not pulled out at moffitt but had gone in deeper ten times deeper than ever he was in a royal goodhumor fulkerson reported and was going to drop into the office on his way up from the street march understood wall street that afternoon he was tickled to death with every other week so far as it had gone and was anxious to pay his respects to the editor  march accounted for some rhetoric in this but let it flatter him and prepared himself for a meeting about which he could see that fulkerson was only less nervous than he had shown himself about the public reception of the first number it gave march a disagreeable feeling of being owned and of being about to be inspected by his proprietor but he fell back upon such independence as he could find in the thought of those two thousand dollars of income beyond the caprice of his owner and maintained an outward serenity  he was a little ashamed afterward of the resolution it had cost him to do so it was not a question of dryfooss physical presence that was rather effective than otherwise and carried a suggestion of moneyed indifference to convention in the gray business suit of provincial cut and the low widebrimmed hat of flexible black felt he had a stick with an oldfashioned top of buckhorn worn smooth and bright by the palm of his hand which had not lost its character in fat and which had a history of former work in its enlarged knuckles though it was now as soft as marchs and must once have been small even for a man of mr dryfooss stature he was below the average size but what struck march was the fact that dryfoos seemed furtively conscious of being a country person and of being aware that in their meeting he was to be tried by other tests than those which would have availed him as a shrewd speculator he evidently had some curiosity about march as the first of his kind whom he had encountered some such curiosity as the country school trustee feels and tries to hide in the presence of the new schoolmaster but the whole affair was of course on a higher plane on one side dryfoos was much more a man of the world than march was and he probably divined this at once and rested himself upon the fact in a measure it seemed to be his preference that his son should introduce them for he came upstairs with conrad and they had fairly made acquaintance before fulkerson joined them  conrad offered to leave them at once but his father made him stay i reckon mr march and i havent got anything so private to talk about that we want to keep it from the other partners well mr march are you getting used to new york yet it takes a little time  oh yes but not so much time as most places everybody belongs more or less in new york nobody has to belong here altogether  yes that is so you can try it and go away if you dont like it a good deal easier than you could from a smaller place wouldnt make so much talk would it he glanced at march with a jocose light in his shrewd eyes that is the way i feel about it all the time just visiting now it wouldnt be that way in boston i reckon  you couldnt keep on visiting there your whole life said march  dryfoos laughed showing his lower teeth in a way that was at once simple and fierce mr fulkerson didnt hardly know as he could get you to leave i suppose you got used to it there i never been in your city  i had got used to it but it was hardly my city except by marriage my wifes a bostonian  shes been a little homesick here then said dryfoos with a smile of the same quality as his laugh  less than i expected said march of course she was very much attached to our old home  i guess my wife wont ever get used to new york said dryfoos and he drew in his lower lip with a sharp sigh but my girls like it theyre young you never been out our way yet mr march out west  well only for the purpose of being born and brought up i used to live in crawfordsville and then indianapolis  indianapolis is bound to be a great place said dryfoos i remember now mr fulkerson told me you was from our state he went on to brag of the west as if march were an easterner and had to be convinced you ought to see all that country its a great country  oh yes said march i understand that he expected the praise of the great west to lead up to some comment on every other week and there was abundant suggestion of that topic in the manuscripts proofs of letterpress and illustrations with advance copies of the latest number strewn over his table  but dryfoos apparently kept himself from looking at these things he rolled his head about on his shoulders to take in the character of the room and said to his son you didnt change the woodwork after all  no the architect thought we had better let it be unless we meant to change the whole place he liked its being oldfashioned  i hope you feel comfortable here mr march the old man said bringing his eyes to bear upon him again after their tour of inspection  too comfortable for a workingman said march and he thought that this remark must bring them to some talk about his work but the proprietor only smiled again  i guess i shant lose much on this house he returned as if musing aloud this downtown property is coming up business is getting in on all these side streets i thought i paid a pretty good price for it too he went on to talk of real estate and march began to feel a certain resentment at his continued avoidance of the only topic in which they could really have a common interest you live down this way somewhere dont you the old man concluded  yes i wished to be near my work march was vexed with himself for having recurred to it but afterward he was not sure but dryfoos shared his own diffidence in the matter and was waiting for him to bring it openly into the talk at times he seemed wary and masterful and then march felt that he was being examined and tested at others so simple that march might well have fancied that he needed encouragement and desired it he talked of his wife and daughters in a way that invited march to say friendly things of his family which appeared to give the old man first an undue pleasure and then a final distrust at moments he turned with an effect of finding relief in it to his son and spoke to him across march of matters which he was unacquainted with he did not seem aware that this was rude but the young man must have felt it so he always brought the conversation back and once at some cost to himself when his father made it personal  i want to make a regular new york business man out of that fellow he said to march pointing at conrad with his stick you spose im ever going to do it  well i dont know said march trying to fall in with the joke do you mean nothing but a business man  the old man laughed at whatever latent meaning he fancied in this and said you think he would be a little too much for me there well ive seen enough of em to know it dont always take a large pattern of a man to do a large business but i want him to get the business training and then if he wants to go into something else he knows what the world is anyway heigh  oh yes march assented with some compassion for the young man reddening patiently under his fathers comment  dryfoos went on as if his son were not in hearing now that boy wanted to be a preacher what does a preacher know about the world he preaches against when hes been brought up a preacher he dont know so much as a bad little boy in his sundayschool he knows about as much as a girl i always told him you be a man first and then you be a preacher if you want to heigh  precisely march began to feel some compassion for himself in being witness of the young fellows discomfort under his fathers homily  when we first come to new york i told him now heres your chance to see the world on a big scale you know already what work and saving and steady habits and sense will bring a man to you dont want to go round among the rich you want to go among the poor and see what laziness and drink and dishonesty and foolishness will bring men to and i guess he knows about as well as anybody and if he ever goes to preaching hell know what hes preaching about the old man smiled his fierce simple smile and in his sharp eyes march fancied contempt of the ambition he had balked in his son the present scene must have been one of many between them ending in meek submission on the part of the young man whom his father perhaps without realizing his cruelty treated as a child march took it hard that he should be made to suffer in the presence of a coordinate power like himself and began to dislike the old man out of proportion to his offence which might have been mere want of taste or an effect of mere embarrassment before him but evidently whatever rebellion his daughters had carried through against him he had kept his dominion over this gentle spirit unbroken march did not choose to make any response but to let him continue if he would entirely upon his own impulse     ii  a silence followed of rather painful length it was broken by the cheery voice of fulkerson sent before him to herald fulkersons cheery person well i suppose youve got the glorious success of every other week down pretty cold in your talk by this time i should have been up sooner to join you but i was nipping a man for the last page of the cover i guess well have to let the muse have that for an advertisement instead of a poem the next time march well the old gentleman given you boys your scolding the person of fulkerson had got into the room long before he reached this question and had planted itself astride a chair fulkerson looked over the chairback now at march and now at the elder dryfoos as he spoke  march answered him i guess we must have been waiting for you fulkerson at any rate we hadnt got to the scolding yet  why i didnt suppose mr dryfoos could a held in so long i understood he was awful mad at the way the thing started off and wanted to give you a piece of his mind when he got at you i inferred as much from a remark that he made march and dryfoos looked foolish as men do when made the subject of this sort of merry misrepresentation  i reckon my scolding will keep awhile yet said the old man dryly  well then i guess its a good chance to give mr dryfoos an idea of what weve really donejust while were resting as artemus ward says heigh march  i will let you blow the trumpet fulkerson i think it belongs strictly to the advertising department said march he now distinctly resented the old mans failure to say anything to him of the magazine he made his inference that it was from a suspicion of his readiness to presume upon a recognition of his share in the success and he was determined to second no sort of appeal for it  the advertising department is the heart and soul of every business said fulkerson hardily and i like to keep my hand in with a little practise on the trumpet in private i dont believe mr dryfoos has got any idea of the extent of this thing hes been out among those rackensackens where we were all born and hes read the notices in their seven by nine dailies and hes seen the thing selling on the cars and he thinks he appreciates whats been done but i should just like to take him round in this little old metropolis awhile and show him every other week on the centre tables of the millionairesthe vanderbilts and the astorsand in the homes of culture and refinement everywhere and let him judge for himself its the talk of the clubs and the dinnertables children cry for it its the castoria of literature and the pearline of art the wontbehappytillhegetsit of every en lightened man woman and child in this vast city i knew we could capture the country but my goodness i didnt expect to have new york fall into our hands at a blow but thats just exactly what new york has done every other week supplies the longfelt want thats been grinding round in new york and keeping it awake nights ever since the war its the culmination of all the high and ennobling ideals of the past  how much asked dryfoos do you expect to get out of it the first year if it keeps the start its got  comes right down to business every time said fulkerson referring the characteristic to march with a delighted glance well sir if everything works right and we get rain enough to fill up the springs and it isnt a grasshopper year i expect to clear above all expenses something in the neighborhood of twentyfive thousand dollars  humph and you are all going to work a yeareditor manager publisher artists writers printers and the rest of emto clear twentyfive thousand dollarsi made that much in half a day in moffitt once i see it made in half a minute in wall street sometimes the old man presented this aspect of the case with a goodnatured contempt which included fulkerson and his enthusiasm in an obvious liking  his son suggested but when we make that money here no one loses it  can you prove that his father turned sharply upon him whatever is won is lost its all a game it dont make any difference what you bet on business is business and a business man takes his risks with his eyes open  ah but the glory fulkerson insinuated with impudent persiflage i hadnt got to the glory yet because its hard to estimate it but put the glory at the lowest figure mr dryfoos and add it to the twentyfive thousand and youve got an annual income from every other week of dollars enough to construct a silver railroad doubletrack from this office to the moon i dont mention any of the sister planets because i like to keep within bounds  dryfoos showed his lower teeth for pleasure in fulkersons fooling and said thats what i like about you mr fulkersonyou always keep within bounds  well i aint a shrinking boston violet like march here more sunflower in my style of diffidence but i am modest i dont deny it said fulkerson and i do hate to have a thing overstated  and the gloryyou do really think theres something in the glory that pays  not a doubt of it i shouldnt care for the paltry return in money said fulkerson with a burlesque of generous disdain if it wasnt for the glory along with it  and how should you feel about the glory if there was no money along with it  well sir im happy to say we havent come to that yet  now conrad here said the old man with a sort of pathetic rancor would rather have the glory alone i believe he dont even care much for your kind of glory either mr fulkerson  fulkerson ran his little eyes curiously over conrads face and then marchs as if searching for a trace there of something gone before which would enable him to reach dryfooss whole meaning he apparently resolved to launch himself upon conjecture oh well we know how conrad feels about the things of this world anyway i should like to take em on the plane of another sphere too sometimes but i noticed a good while ago that this was the world i was born into and so i made up my mind that i would do pretty much what i saw the rest of the folks doing here below and i cant see but what conrad runs the thing on business principles in his department and i guess youll find it so if you look into it i consider that were a whole team and big dog under the wagon with you to draw on for supplies and march here at the head of the literary business and conrad in the countingroom and me to do the heavy lying in the advertising part oh and beaton of course in the art i most forgot beatonhamlet with hamlet left out  dryfoos looked across at his son wasnt that the fellows name that was there last night  yes said conrad  the old man rose well i reckon i got to be going you ready to go uptown conrad  well not quite yet father  the old man shook hands with march and went downstairs followed by his son  fulkerson remained  he didnt jump at the chance you gave him to compliment us all round fulkerson said march with a smile not wholly of pleasure  fulkerson asked with as little joy in the grin he had on didnt he say anything to you before i came in  not a word  dogged if i know what to make of it sighed fulkerson but i guess hes been having a talk with conrad thats soured on him i reckon maybe he came back expecting to find that boy reconciled to the glory of this world and conrads showed himself just as set against it as ever  it might have been that march admitted pensively i fancied something of the kind myself from words the old man let drop  fulkerson made him explain and then he said  thats it then and its all right conrad ll come round in time and all weve got to do is to have patience with the old man till he does i know he likes you fulkerson affirmed this only interrogatively and looked so anxiously to march for corroboration that march laughed  he dissembled his love he said but afterward in describing to his wife his interview with mr dryfoos he was less amused with this fact  when she saw that he was a little cast down by it she began to encourage him hes just a common ignorant man and probably didnt know how to express himself you may be perfectly sure that hes delighted with the success of the magazine and that he understands as well as you do that he owes it all to you  ah im not so sure i dont believe a mans any better for having made money so easily and rapidly as dryfoos has done and i doubt if hes any wiser i dont know just the point hes reached in his evolution from grub to beetle but i do know that so far as its gone the process must have involved a bewildering change of ideals and criterions i guess hes come to despise a great many things that he once respected and that intellectual ability is among themwhat we call intellectual ability he must have undergone a moral deterioration an atrophy of the generous instincts and i dont see why it shouldnt have reached his mental makeup he has sharpened but he has narrowed his sagacity has turned into suspicion his caution to meanness his courage to ferocity thats the way i philosophize a man of dryfooss experience and i am not very proud when i realize that such a man and his experience are the ideal and ambition of most americans i rather think they came pretty near being mine once  no dear they never did his wife protested  well theyre not likely to be in the future the dryfoos feature of every other week is thoroughly distasteful to me  why but he hasnt really got anything to do with it has he beyond furnishing the money  thats the impression that fulkerson has allowed us to get but the man that holds the purse holds the reins he may let us guide the horse but when he likes he can drive if we dont like his driving then we can get down  mrs march was less interested in this figure of speech than in the personal aspects involved then you think mr fulkerson has deceived you  oh no said her husband laughing but i think he has deceived himself perhaps  how she pursued  he may have thought he was using dryfoos when dryfoos was using him and he may have supposed he was not afraid of him when he was very much so his courage hadnt been put to the test and courage is a matter of proof like proficiency on the fiddle you know you cant tell whether youve got it till you try  nonsense do you mean that he would ever sacrifice you to mr dryfoos  i hope he may not be tempted but id rather be taking the chances with fulkerson alone than with fulkerson and dryfoos to back him dryfoos seems somehow to take the poetry and the pleasure out of the thing  mrs march was a long time silent then she began well my dear i never wanted to come to new york  neither did i march promptly put in  but now that were here she went on im not going to have you letting every little thing discourage you i dont see what there was in mr dryfooss manner to give you any anxiety hes just a common stupid inarticulate country person and he didnt know how to express himself as i said in the beginning and thats the reason he didnt say anything  well i dont deny youre right about it  its dreadful his wife continued to be mixed up with such a man and his family but i dont believe hell ever meddle with your management and till he does all you need do is to have as little to do with him as possible and go quietly on your own way  oh i shall go on quietly enough said march i hope i shant begin going stealthily  well my dear said mrs march just let me know when youre tempted to do that if ever you sacrifice the smallest grain of your honesty or your selfrespect to mr dryfoos or anybody else i will simply renounce you  in view of that im rather glad the management of every other week involves tastes and not convictions said march     iii  that night dryfoos was wakened from his afterdinner nap by the sound of gay talk and nervous giggling in the drawingroom the talk which was christines and the giggling which was melas were intershot with the heavier tones of a mans voice and dryfoos lay awhile on the leathern lounge in his library trying to make out whether he knew the voice his wife sat in a deep chair before the fire with her eyes on his face waiting for him to wake  who is that out there he asked without opening his eyes  indeed indeed i dont know jacob his wife answered i reckon its just some visitor of the girls  was i snoring  not a bit you was sleeping as quiet i did hate to have em wake you and i was just goin out to shoo them theyve been playin something and that made them laugh  i didnt know but i had snored said the old man sitting up  no said his wife then she asked wistfully was you out at the old place jacob  yes  did it look natural  yes mostly theyre sinking the wells down in the woods pasture  andthe childrens graves  they havent touched that part but i reckon we got to have em moved to the cemetery i bought a lot  the old woman began softly to weep it does seem too hard that they cant be let to rest in peace pore little things i wanted you and me to lay there too when our time come jacob just there back o the beehives and under them shoomakesmy i can see the very place and i dont believe ill ever feel at home anywheres else i woont know where i am when the trumpet sounds i have to think before i can tell where the east is in new york and what if i should git faced the wrong way when i raise jacob i wonder you could sell it her head shook and the firelight shone on her tears as she searched the folds of her dress for her pocket  a peal of laughter came from the drawingroom and then the sound of chords struck on the piano  hush dont you cry lizbeth said dryfoos here take my handkerchief ive got a nice lot in the cemetery and im goin to have a monument with two lambs on itlike the one you always liked so much it aint the fashion any more to have family buryin grounds theyre collectin em into the cemeteries all round  i reckon i got to bear it said his wife muffling her face in his handkerchief and i suppose the lord kin find me wherever i am but i always did want to lay just there you mind how we used to go out and set there after milkin and watch the sun go down and talk about where their angels was and try to figger it out  i remember lizbeth  the mans voice in the drawingroom sang a snatch of french song insolent mocking salient and then christines attempted the same strain and another cry of laughter from mela followed  well i always did expect to lay there but i reckon its all right it wont be a great while now anyway jacob i dont believe im agoin to live very long i know it dont agree with me here  oh i guess it does lizbeth youre just a little pulled down with the weather its coming spring and you feel it but the doctor says youre all right i stopped in on the way up and he says so  i reckon he dont know everything the old woman persisted ive been runnin down ever since we left moffitt and i didnt feel any too well there even its a very strange thing jacob that the richer you git the less you aint able to stay where you want to dead or alive  its for the children we do it said dryfoos we got to give them their chance in the world  oh the world they ought to bear the yoke in their youth like we done i know its what coonrod would like to do  dryfoos got upon his feet if coonrod ll mind his own business and do what i want him to hell have yoke enough to bear he moved from his wife without further effort to comfort her and pottered heavily out into the diningroom beyond its obscurity stretched the glitter of the deep drawingroom his feet in their broad flat slippers made no sound on the dense carpet and he came unseen upon the little group there near the piano mela perched upon the stool with her back to the keys and beaton bent over christine who sat with a banjo in her lap letting him take her hands and put them in the right place on the instrument her face was radiant with happiness and mela was watching her with foolish unselfish pleasure in her bliss  there was nothing wrong in the affair to a man of dryfooss traditions and perceptions and if it had been at home in the farm sittingroom or even in his parlor at moffitt he would not have minded a young mans placing his daughters hands on a banjo or even holding them there it would have seemed a proper attention from him if he was courting her but here in such a house as this with the daughter of a man who had made as much money as he had he did not know but it was a liberty he felt the angry doubt of it which beset him in regard to so many experiences of his changed life he wanted to show his sense of it if it was a liberty but he did not know how and he did not know that it was so besides he could not help a touch of the pleasure in christines happiness which mela showed and he would have gone back to the library if he could without being discovered  but beaton had seen him and dryfoos with a nonchalant nod to the young man came forward what you got there christine  a banjo said the girl blushing in her fathers presence  mela gurgled mr beaton is learnun her the first position  beaton was not embarrassed he was in evening dress and his face pointed with its brown beard showed extremely handsome above the expanse of his broad white shirtfront he gave back as nonchalant a nod as he had got and without further greeting to dryfoos he said to christine no no you must keep your hand and arm so he held them in position there now strike with your right hand see  i dont believe i can ever learn said the girl with a fond upward look at him  oh yes you can said beaton  they both ignored dryfoos in the little play of protests which followed and he said half jocosely half suspiciously and is the banjo the fashion now he remembered it as the emblem of lowdown show business and associated it with endmen and blackened faces and grotesque shirtcollars  its all the rage mela shouted in answer for all everybody plays it mr beaton borrowed this from a lady friend of his  humph pity i got you a piano then said dryfoos a banjo would have been cheaper  beaton so far admitted him to the conversation as to seem reminded of the piano by his mentioning it he said to mela oh wont you just strike those chords and as mela wheeled about and beat the keys he took the banjo from christine and sat down with it this way he strummed it and murmured the tune dryfoos had heard him singing from the library while he kept his beautiful eyes floating on christines you try that now its very simple  where is mrs mandel dryfoos demanded trying to assert himself  neither of the girls seemed to have heard him at first in the chatter they broke into over what beaton proposed then mela said absently oh she had to go out to see one of her friends thats sick and she struck the piano keys come try it chris  dryfoos turned about unheeded and went back to the library he would have liked to put beaton out of his house and in his heart he burned against him as a contumacious hand he would have liked to discharge him from the art department of every other week at once but he was aware of not having treated beaton with much ceremony and if the young man had returned his behavior in kind with an electrical response to his own feeling had he any right to complain after all there was no harm in his teaching christine the banjo  his wife still sat looking into the fire i cant see she said as weve got a bit more comfort of our lives jacob because weve got such piles and piles of money i wisht to gracious we was back on the farm this minute i wisht you had held out aginst the childern about sellin it twould a bin the best thing fur em i say i believe in my soul theyll git spoiled here in new york i kin see a change in em areadyin the girls  dryfoos stretched himself on the lounge again i cant see as coonrod is much comfort either why aint he here with his sisters what does all that work of his on the east side amount to it seems as if he done it to cross me as much as anything dryfoos complained to his wife on the basis of mere affectional habit which in married life often survives the sense of intellectual equality he did not expect her to reason with him but there was help in her listening and though she could only soothe his fretfulness with soft answers which were often wide of the purpose he still went to her for solace here ive gone into this newspaper business or whatever it is on his account and he dont seem any more satisfied than ever i can see he haint got his heart in it  the pore boy tries i know he does jacob and he wants to please you but he give up a good deal when he give up bein a preacher i spose we ought to remember that  a preacher sneered dryfoos i reckon bein a preacher wouldnt satisfy him now he had the impudence to tell me this afternoon that he would like to be a priest and he threw it up to me that he never could be because id kept him from studyin  he dont mean a catholic priestnot a roman one jacob the old woman explained wistfully hes told me all about it they aint the kind o catholics we been used to some sort of piscopalians and they do a heap o good amongst the poor folks over there he says we aint got any idea how folks lives in them tenement houses hundreds of em in one house and whole families in a room and it burns in his heart to help em like them fathers as he calls em that gives their lives to it he cant be a father he says because he cant git the eddication now but he can be a brother and i cant find a word to say aginst it when it gits to talkin jacob  i aint saying anything against his priests lizbeth said dryfoos theyre all well enough in their way theyve given up their lives to it and its a matter of business with them like any other but what im talking about now is coonrod i dont object to his doin all the charity he wants to and the lord knows ive never been stingy with him about it he might have all the money he wants to give round any way he pleases  thats what i told him once but he says money aint the thingor not the only thing you got to give to them poor folks you got to give your time and your knowledge and your lovei dont know what all you got to give yourself if you expect to help em thats what coonrod says  well i can tell him that charity begins at home said dryfoos sitting up in his impatience and hed better give himself to us a littleto his old father and mother and his sisters whats he doin goin off there to his meetings and i dont know what all an leavin them here alone  why aint mr beaton with em asked the old woman i thought i heared his voice  mr beaton of course he is and whos mr beaton anyway  why aint he one of the men in coonrods office i thought i heared  yes he is but who is he whats he doing round here is he makin up to christine  i reckon he is from melys talk shes about crazy over the fellow dont you like him jacob  i dont know him or what he is he hasnt got any manners who brought him here howd he come to come in the first place  mr fulkerson brung him i believe said the old woman patiently  fulkerson dryfoos snorted wheres mrs mandel i should like to know he brought her too does she go traipsin off this way every evening  no she seems to be here pretty regular most o the time i dont know how we could ever git along without her jacob she seems to know just what to do and the girls would be ten times as outbreakin without her i hope you aint thinkin o turnin her off jacob  dryfoos did not think it necessary to answer such a question its all fulkerson fulkerson fulkerson it seems to me that fulkerson about runs this family he brought mrs mandel and he brought that beaton and he brought that boston fellow i guess i give him a dose though and ill learn fulkerson that he cant have everything his own way i dont want anybody to help me spend my money i made it and i can manage it i guess mr fulkerson can bear a little watching now hes been travelling pretty free and hes got the notion hes driving maybe im agoing to look after that book a little myself  youll kill yourself jacob said his wife tryin to do so many things and what is it all fur i dont see as were better off any for all the money its just as much care as it used to be when we was all there on the farm together i wisht we could go back ja  we cant go back shouted the old man fiercely theres no farm any more to go back to the fields is full of gaswells and oilwells and hellholes generally the house is tore down and the barns goin  the barn gasped the old woman oh my  if i was to give all im worth this minute we couldnt go back to the farm any more than them girls in there could go back and be little children i dont say were any better off for the money ive got more of it now than i ever had and theres no end to the luck it pours in but i feel like i was tied hand and foot i dont know which way to move i dont know whats best to do about anything the money dont seem to buy anything but more and more care and trouble we got a big house that we aint at home in and we got a lot of hired girls round under our feet that hinder and dont help our children dont mind us and we got no friends or neighbors but it had to be i couldnt help but sell the farm and we cant go back to it for it aint there so dont you say anything more about it lizbeth  pore jacob said his wife well i woont dear     iv  it was clear to beaton that dryfoos distrusted him and the fact heightened his pleasure in christines liking for him he was as sure of this as he was of the other though he was not so sure of any reason for his pleasure in it she had her charm the charm of wildness to which a certain wildness in himself responded and there were times when his fancy contrived a common future for them which would have a prosperity forced from the old fellows love of the girl beaton liked the idea of this compulsion better than he liked the idea of the money there was something a little repulsive in that he imagined himself rejecting it he almost wished he was enough in love with the girl to marry her without it that would be fine he was taken with her in a certain measure in a certain way the question was in what measure in what way  it was partly to escape from this question that he hurried downtown and decided to spend with the leightons the hour remaining on his hands before it was time to go to the reception for which he was dressed it seemed to him important that he should see alma leighton after all it was her charm that was most abiding with him perhaps it was to be final he found himself very happy in his present relations with her she had dropped that barrier of pretences and ironical surprise it seemed to him that they had gone back to the old ground of common artistic interest which he had found so pleasant the summer before apparently she and her mother had both forgiven his neglect of them in the first months of their stay in new york he was sure that mrs leighton liked him as well as ever and if there was still something a little provisional in almas manner at times it was something that piqued more than it discouraged it made him curious not anxious  he found the young ladies with fulkerson when he rang he seemed to be amusing them both and they were both amused beyond the merit of so small a pleasantry beaton thought when fulkerson said introduce myself mr beaton mr fulkerson of every other week think ive met you at our place the girls laughed and alma explained that her mother was not very well and would be sorry not to see him then she turned as he felt perversely and went on talking with fulkerson and left him to miss woodburn  she finally recognized his disappointment ah dont often get a chance at you mr beaton and ahm just goin to toak yo to death yo have been soath yoself and yo know ho we do toak  ive survived to say yes beaton admitted  oh now do you think we toak so much mo than you do in the noth the young lady deprecated  i dont know i only know you cant talk too much for me i should like to hear you say soath and house and about for the rest of my life  thats what ah call raght personal mr beaton now ahm goin to be personal too miss woodburn flung out over her lap the square of cloth she was embroidering and asked him dont you think thats beautiful now as an awtusta great awtust  as a great awtust yes said beaton mimicking her accent if i were less than great i might have something to say about the arrangement of colors youre as bold and original as nature  really oh now do tell me yo favoite colo mr beaton  my favorite color bless my soul why should i prefer any is blue good or red wicked do people have favorite colors beaton found himself suddenly interested  of cose they do answered the girl dont awtusts  i never heard of one that hadconsciously  is it possible i supposed they all had now mah favoite colo is gawnet dont you think its a pretty colo  it depends upon how its used do you mean in neckties beaton stole a glance at the one fulkerson was wearing  miss woodburn laughed with her face bowed upon her wrist ah do think you gentlemen in the noth awe ten tahms as lahvely as the ladies  strange said beaton in the southsoath excuse me i made the observation that the ladies were ten times as lively as the gentlemen what is that youre working  this miss woodburn gave it another flirt and looked at it with a glance of dawning recognition oh this is a tablecovah wouldnt you lahke to see where its to go  why certainly  well if youll be raght good ill let yo give me some professional advass about putting something in the coners or not when you have seen it on the table  she rose and led the way into the other room beaton knew she wanted to talk with him about something else but he waited patiently to let her play her comedy out she spread the cover on the table and he advised her as he saw she wished against putting anything in the corners just run a line of her stitch around the edge he said  mr fulkerson and ah why weve been having a regular faght aboat it she commented but we both agreed fahnally to leave it to you mr fulkerson said youd be sure to be raght ahm so glad you took mah sahde but hes a great admahrer of yours mr beaton she concluded demurely suggestively  is he well im a great admirer of fulkerson said beaton with a capricious willingness to humor her wish to talk about fulkerson hes a capital fellow generous magnanimous with quite an ideal of friendship and an eye single to the main chance all the time he would advertise every other week on his family vault  miss woodburn laughed and said she should tell him what beaton had said  do but hes used to defamation from me and hell think youre joking  ah suppose said miss woodburn that hes quahte the tahpe of a new york business man she added as if it followed logically hes so different from what i thought a new york business man would be  its your virginia tradition to despise business said beaton rudely  miss woodburn laughed again despahse it mah goodness we want to get into it and woak it fo all its woth as mr fulkerson says that tradition is all past you dont know what the soath is now ah suppose mah fathaw despahses business but hes a tradition himself as ah tell him beaton would have enjoyed joining the young lady in anything she might be going to say in derogation of her father but he restrained himself and she went on more and more as if she wished to account for her fathers habitual hauteur with beaton if not to excuse it ah tell him he dont understand the rising generation he was brought up in the old school and he thinks were all just lahke he was when he was young with all those ahdeals of chivalry and family but mah goodness its money that cyoants noadays in the soath just lahke it does everywhere else ah suppose if we could have slavery back in the fawm mah fathaw thinks it could have been brought up to when the commercial spirit wouldnt let it alone it would be the best thing but we cant have it back and ah tell him we had better have the commercial spirit as the next best thing  miss woodburn went on with sufficient loyalty and piety to expose the difference of her own and her fathers ideals but with what beaton thought less reference to his own unsympathetic attention than to a knowledge finally of the personnel and materiel of every other week and mr fulkersons relation to the enterprise you most excuse my asking so many questions mr beaton you know its all mah doing that we awe heah in new york ah just told mah fathaw that if he was evah goin to do anything with his wrahtings he had got to come noth and ah made him come ah believe hed have stayed in the soath all his lahfe and now mr fulkerson wants him to let his editor see some of his wrahtings and ah wanted to know something aboat the magazine we awe a great deal excited aboat it in this hoase you know mr beaton she concluded with a look that now transferred the interest from fulkerson to alma she led the way back to the room where they were sitting and went up to triumph over fulkerson with beatons decision about the tablecover  alma was left with beaton near the piano and he began to talk about the dryfooses as he sat down on the pianostool he said he had been giving miss dryfoos a lesson on the banjo he had borrowed the banjo of miss vance then he struck the chord he had been trying to teach christine and played over the air he had sung  how do you like that he asked whirling round  it seems rather a disrespectful little tune somehow said alma placidly  beaton rested his elbow on the corner of the piano and gazed dreamily at her your perceptions are wonderful it is disrespectful i played it up there because i felt disrespectful to them  do you claim that as a merit  no i state it as a fact how can you respect such people  you might respect yourself then said the girl or perhaps that wouldnt be so easy either  no it wouldnt i like to have you say these things to me said beaton impartially  well i like to say them alma returned  they do me good  oh i dont know that that was my motive  there is no one like youno one said beaton as if apostrophizing her in her absence to come from that house with its assertions of moneyyou can hear it chink you can smell the foul old banknotes it stifles youinto an atmosphere like this is like coming into another world  thank you said alma im glad there isnt that unpleasant odor here but i wish there was a little more of the chinking  no no dont say that he implored i like to think that there is one soul uncontaminated by the sense of money in this big brutal sordid city  you mean two said alma with modesty but if you stifle at the dryfooses why do you go there  why do i go he mused dont you believe in knowing all the natures the types you can those girls are a strange study the young one is a simple earthly creature as common as an oatfield and the other a sort of sylvan life fierce flashing feline  alma burst out into a laugh what apt alliteration and do they like being studied i should think the sylvan life mightscratch  no said beaton with melancholy absence it onlypurrs  the girl felt a rising indignation well then mr beaton i should hope it would scratch and bite too i think youve no business to go about studying people as you do its abominable  go on said the young man that puritan conscience of yours it appeals to the old covenanter strain in melike a voice of preexistence go on  oh if i went on i should merely say it was not only abominable but contemptible  you could be my guardian angel alma said the young man making his eyes more and more slumbrous and dreamy  stuff i hope i have a soul above buttons  he smiled as she rose and followed her across the room goodnight mr beaton she said  miss woodburn and fulkerson came in from the other room what youre not going beaton  yes im going to a reception i stopped in on my way  to kill time alma explained  well said fulkerson gallantly this is the last place i should like to do it but i guess id better be going too it has sometimes occurred to me that there is such a thing as staying too late but with brother beaton here just starting in for an evenings amusement it does seem a little early yet cant you urge me to stay somebody  the two girls laughed and miss woodburn said  mr beaton is such a butterfly of fashion ah wish ah was on mah way to a pawty ah feel quahte envious  but he didnt say it to make you alma explained with meek softness  well we cant all be swells where is your party anyway beaton asked fulkerson how do you manage to get your invitations to those things i suppose a fellow has to keep hinting round pretty lively neigh  beaton took these mockeries serenely and shook hands with miss woodburn with the effect of having already shaken hands with alma she stood with hers clasped behind her     v  beaton went away with the smile on his face which he had kept in listening to fulkerson and carried it with him to the reception he believed that alma was vexed with him for more personal reasons than she had implied it flattered him that she should have resented what he told her of the dryfooses she had scolded him in their behalf apparently but really because he had made her jealous by his interest of whatever kind in some one else what followed had followed naturally unless she had been quite a simpleton she could not have met his provisional lovemaking on any other terms and the reason why beaton chiefly liked alma leighton was that she was not a simpleton even up in the country when she was overawed by his acquaintance at first she was not very deeply overawed and at times she was not overawed at all at such times she astonished him by taking his most solemn histrionics with flippant incredulity and even burlesquing them but he could see all the same that he had caught her fancy and he admired the skill with which she punished his neglect when they met in new york he had really come very near forgetting the leightons the intangible obligations of mutual kindness which hold some men so fast hung loosely upon him it would not have hurt him to break from them altogether but when he recognized them at last he found that it strengthened them indefinitely to have alma ignore them so completely if she had been sentimental or softly reproachful that would have been the end he could not have stood it he would have had to drop her but when she met him on his own ground and obliged him to be sentimental the game was in her hands beaton laughed now when he thought of that and he said to himself that the girl had grown immensely since she had come to new york nothing seemed to have been lost upon her she must have kept her eyes uncommonly wide open he noticed that especially in their talks over her work she had profited by everything she had seen and heard she had all of wetmores ideas pat it amused beaton to see how she seized every useful word that he dropped too and turned him to technical account whenever she could he liked that she had a great deal of talent there was no question of that if she were a man there could be no question of her future he began to construct a future for her it included provision for himself too it was a common future in which their lives and work were united  he was full of the glow of its prosperity when he met margaret vance at the reception  the house was one where people might chat a long time together without publicly committing themselves to an interest in each other except such a grew out of each others ideas miss vance was there because she united in her catholic sympathies or ambitions the objects of the fashionable people and of the aesthetic people who met there on common ground it was almost the only house in new york where this happened often and it did not happen very often there it was a literary house primarily with artistic qualifications and the frequenters of it were mostly authors and artists wetmore who was always trying to fit everything with a phrase said it was the unfrequenters who were fashionable there was great ease there and simplicity and if there was not distinction it was not for want of distinguished people but because there seems to be some solvent in new york life that reduces all men to a common level that touches everybody with its potent magic and brings to the surface the deeply underlying nobody the effect for some temperaments for consciousness for egotism is admirable for curiosity for hero worship it is rather baffling it is the spirit of the street transferred to the drawingroom indiscriminating levelling but doubtless finally wholesome and witnessing the immensity of the place if not consenting to the grandeur of reputations or presences  beaton now denied that this house represented a salon at all in the old sense and he held that the salon was impossible even undesirable with us when miss vance sighed for it at any rate he said that this turmoil of coming and going this bubble and babble this cackling and hissing of conversation was not the expression of any such civilization as had created the salon here he owned were the elements of intellectual delightfulness but he said their assemblage in such quantity alone denied the salon there was too much of a good thing the french word implied a long evening of general talk among the guests crowned with a little chicken at supper ending at cockcrow here was tea with milk or with lemonbaths of it and claretcup for the hardier spirits throughout the evening it was very nice very pleasant but it was not the little chickennot the salon in fact he affirmed the salon descended from above out of the great world and included the aesthetic world in it but our great worldthe rich people were stupid with no wish to be otherwise they were not even curious about authors and artists beaton fancied himself speaking impartially and so he allowed himself to speak bitterly he said that in no other city in the world except vienna perhaps were such people so little a part of society  it isnt altogether the rich peoples fault said margaret and she spoke impartially too i dont believe that the literary men and the artists would like a salon that descended to them madame geoffrin you know was very plebeian her husband was a business man of some sort  he would have been a howling swell in new york said beaton still impartially  wetmore came up to their corner with a scroll of bread and butter in one hand and a cup of tea in the other large and fat and cleanshaven he looked like a monk in evening dress  we were talking about salons said margaret  why dont you open a salon yourself asked wetmore breathing thickly from the anxiety of getting through the crowd without spilling his tea  like poor lady barberina lemon said the girl with a laugh what a good story that idea of a woman who couldnt be interested in any of the arts because she was socially and traditionally the material of them we can never reach that height of nonchalance in this country  not if we tried seriously suggested the painter ive an idea that if the americans ever gave their minds to that sort of thing they could take the palmor the cake as beaton here would sayjust as they do in everything else when we do have an aristocracy it will be an aristocracy that will go ahead of anything the world has ever seen why dont somebody make a beginning and go in openly for an ancestry and a lower middle class and an hereditary legislature and all the rest weve got liveries and crests and palaces and caste feeling were all right as far as weve gone and weve got the money to go any length  like your naturalgas man mr beaton said the girl with a smiling glance round at him  ah said wetmore stirring his tea has beaton got a naturalgas man  my naturalgas man said beaton ignoring wetmores question doesnt know how to live in his palace yet and i doubt if he has any caste feeling i fancy his family believe themselves victims of it they sayone of the young ladies doesthat she never saw such an unsociable place as new york nobody calls  thats good said wetmore i suppose theyre all ready for company too good cook furniture servants carriages  galore said beaton  well thats too bad theres a chance for you miss vance doesnt your philanthropy embrace the socially destitute as well as the financially just think of a family like that without a friend in a great city i should think common charity had a duty therenot to mention the uncommon  he distinguished that kind as margarets by a glance of ironical deference she had a repute for good works which was out of proportion to the works as it always is but she was really active in that way under the vague obligation which we now all feel to be helpful she was of the church which seems to have found a reversion to the imposing ritual of the past the way back to the early ideals of christian brotherhood  oh they seem to have mr beaton margaret answered and beaton felt obscurely flattered by her reference to his patronage of the dryfooses  he explained to wetmore they have me because they partly own me dryfoos is fulkersons financial backer in every other week  is that so well thats interesting too arent you rather astonished miss vance to see what a petty thing beaton is making of that magazine of his  oh said margaret its so very nice every way it makes you feel as if you did have a country after all its as chicthat detestable little wordas those new french books  beaton modelled it on them but you mustnt suppose he does everything about every other week hed like you to beaton you havent come up to that cover of your first number since that was the design of one of my pupils miss vancea little girl that beaton discovered down in new hampshire last summer  oh yes and have you great hopes of her mr wetmore  she seems to have more love of it and knack for it than any one of her sex ive seen yet it really looks like a case of art for arts sake at times but you cant tell theyre liable to get married at any moment you know look here beaton when your naturalgas man gets to the picturebuying stage in his development just remember your old friends will you you know miss vance those new fellows have their regular stages they never know what to do with their money but they find out that people buy pictures at one point they shut your things up in their houses where nobody comes and after a while they overeat themselvesthey dont know what else to doand die of apoplexy and leave your pictures to a gallery and then they see the light its slow but its pretty sure well i see beaton isnt going to move on as he ought to do and so i must he always was an unconventional creature  wetmore went away but beaton remained and he outstayed several other people who came up to speak to miss vance she was interested in everybody and she liked the talk of these clever literary artistic clerical even theatrical people and she liked the sort of court with which they recognized her fashion as well as her cleverness it was very pleasant to be treated intellectually as if she were one of themselves and socially as if she was not habitually the same but a sort of guest in bohemia a distinguished stranger if it was arcadia rather than bohemia still she felt her quality of distinguished stranger the flattery of it touched her fancy and not her vanity she had very little vanity beatons devotion made the same sort of appeal it was not so much that she liked him as she liked being the object of his admiration she was a girl of genuine sympathies intellectual rather than sentimental in fact she was an intellectual person whom qualities of the heart saved from being disagreeable as they saved her on the other hand from being worldly or cruel in her fashionableness she had read a great many books and had ideas about them quite courageous and original ideas she knew about picturesshe had been in wetmores class she was fond of music she was willing to understand even politics in boston she might have been agnostic but in new york she was sincerely religious she was very accomplished and perhaps it was her goodness that prevented her feeling what was not best in beaton  do you think she said after the retreat of one of the comers and goers left her alone with him again that those young ladies would like me to call on them  those young ladies beaton echoed miss leighton and  no i have been there with my aunts cards already  oh yes said beaton as if he had known of it he admired the pluck and pride with which alma had refrained from ever mentioning the fact to him and had kept her mother from mentioning it which must have been difficult  i mean the miss dryfooses it seems really barbarous if nobody goes near them we do all kinds of things and help all kinds of people in some ways but we let strangers remain strangers unless they know how to make their way among us  the dryfooses certainly wouldnt know how to make their way among you said beaton with a sort of dreamy absence in his tone  miss vance went on speaking out the process of reasoning in her mind rather than any conclusions she had reached we defend ourselves by trying to believe that they must have friends of their own or that they would think us patronizing and wouldnt like being made the objects of social charity but they neednt really suppose anything of the kind  i dont imagine they would said beaton i think theyd be only too happy to have you come but you wouldnt know what to do with each other indeed miss vance  perhaps we shall like each other said the girl bravely and then we shall know what church are they of  i dont believe theyre of any said beaton the mother was brought up a dunkard  a dunkard  beaton told what he knew of the primitive sect with its early christian polity its literal interpretation of christs ethics and its quaint ceremonial of footwashing he made something picturesque of that the father is a mammonworshipper pure and simple i suppose the young ladies go to church but i dont know where they havent tried to convert me  ill tell them not to despairafter ive converted them said miss vance will you let me use you as a point dappui mr beaton  any way you like if youre really going to see them perhaps id better make a confession i left your banjo with them after i got it put in order  how very nice then we have a common interest already  do you mean the banjo or  the banjo decidedly which of them plays  neither but the eldest heard that the banjo was all the rage as the youngest says perhaps you can persuade them that good works are the rage too  beaton had no very lively belief that margaret would go to see the dryfooses he did so few of the things he proposed that he went upon the theory that others must be as faithless still he had a cruel amusement in figuring the possible encounter between margaret vance with her intellectual elegance her eager sympathies and generous ideals and those girls with their rude past their false and distorted perspective their sordid and hungry selfishness and their faith in the omnipotence of their fathers wealth wounded by their experience of its present social impotence at the bottom of his heart he sympathized with them rather than with her he was more like them  people had ceased coming and some of them were going miss vance said she must go too and she was about to rise when the host came up with march beaton turned away  miss vance i want to introduce mr march the editor of every other week you oughtnt to be restricted to the art department we literary fellows think that arm of the service gets too much of the glory nowadays his banter was for beaton but he was already beyond earshot and the host went on  mr march can talk with you about your favorite boston hes just turned his back on it  oh i hope not said miss vance i cant imagine anybody voluntarily leaving boston  i dont say hes so bad as that said the host committing march to her he came to new york because he couldnt help itlike the rest of us i never know whether thats a compliment to new york or not  they talked boston a little while without finding that they had common acquaintance there miss vance must have concluded that society was much larger in boston than she had supposed from her visits there or else that march did not know many people in it but she was not a girl to care much for the inferences that might be drawn from such conclusions she rather prided herself upon despising them and she gave herself to the pleasure of being talked to as if she were of marchs own age in the glow of her sympathetic beauty and elegance he talked his best and tried to amuse her with his jokes which he had the art of tingeing with a little seriousness on one side he made her laugh and he flattered her by making her think in her turn she charmed him so much by enjoying what he said that he began to brag of his wife as a good husband always does when another woman charms him and she asked oh was mrs march there and would he introduce her  she asked mrs march for her address and whether she had a day and she said she would come to see her if she would let her mrs march could not be so enthusiastic about her as march was but as they walked home together they talked the girl over and agreed about her beauty and her amiability mrs march said she seemed very unspoiled for a person who must have been so much spoiled they tried to analyze her charm and they succeeded in formulating it as a combination of intellectual fashionableness and worldly innocence i think said mrs march that city girls brought up as she must have been are often the most innocent of all they never imagine the wickedness of the world and if they marry happily they go through life as innocent as children everything combines to keep them so the very hollowness of society shields them they are the loveliest of the human race but perhaps the rest have to pay too much for them  for such an exquisite creature as miss vance said march we couldnt pay too much  a wild laughing cry suddenly broke upon the air at the streetcrossing in front of them a girls voice called out run run jen the copper is after you a womans figure rushed stumbling across the way and into the shadow of the houses pursued by a burly policeman  ah but if thats part of the price  they went along fallen from the gay spirit of their talk into a silence which he broke with a sigh can that poor wretch and the radiant girl we left yonder really belong to the same system of things how impossible each makes the other seem     vi  mrs horn believed in the world and in society and its unwritten constitution devoutly and she tolerated her nieces benevolent activities as she tolerated her aesthetic sympathies because these things however oddly were toleratedeven encouragedby society and they gave margaret a charm they made her originality interesting mrs horn did not intend that they should ever go so far as to make her troublesome and it was with a sense of this abeyant authority of her aunts that the girl asked her approval of her proposed call upon the dryfooses she explained as well as she could the social destitution of these opulent people and she had of course to name beaton as the source of her knowledge concerning them  did mr beaton suggest your calling on them  no he rather discouraged it  and why do you think you ought to go in this particular instance new york is full of people who dont know anybody  margaret laughed i suppose its like any other charity you reach the cases you know of the others you say you cant help and you try to ignore them  its very romantic said mrs horn i hope youve counted the cost all the possible consequences  margaret knew that her aunt had in mind their common experience with the leightons whom to give their common conscience peace she had called upon with her aunts cards and excuses and an invitation for her thursdays somewhat too late to make the visit seem a welcome to new york she was so coldly received not so much for herself as in her quality of envoy that her aunt experienced all the comfort which vicarious penance brings she did not perhaps consider sufficiently her nieces guiltlessness in the expiation margaret was not with her at st barnaby in the fatal fortnight she passed there and never saw the leightons till she went to call upon them she never complained the strain of asceticism which mysteriously exists in us all and makes us put peas boiled or unboiled in our shoes gave her patience with the snub which the leightons presented her for her aunt but now she said with this in mind nothing seems simpler than to get rid of people if you dont want them you merely have to let them alone  it isnt so pleasant letting them alone said mrs horn  or having them let you alone said margaret for neither mrs leighton nor alma had ever come to enjoy the belated hospitality of mrs horns thursdays  yes or having them let you alone mrs horn courageously consented and all that i ask you margaret is to be sure that you really want to know these people  i dont said the girl seriously in the usual way  then the question is whether you do in the un usual way they will build a great deal upon you said mrs horn realizing how much the leightons must have built upon her and how much out of proportion to her desert they must now dislike her for she seemed to have had them on her mind from the time they came and had always meant to recognize any reasonable claim they had upon her  it seems very odd very sad margaret returned that you never could act unselfishly in society affairs if i wished to go and see those girls just to do them a pleasure and perhaps because if theyre strange and lonely i might do them good evenit would be impossible  quite said her aunt such a thing would be quixotic society doesnt rest upon any such basis it cant it would go to pieces if people acted from unselfish motives  then its a painted savage said the girl all its favors are really bargains its gifts are for gifts back again  yes that is true said mrs horn with no more sense of wrong in the fact than the political economist has in the fact that wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit you get what you pay for its a matter of business she satisfied herself with this formula which she did not invent as fully as if it were a reason but she did not dislike her nieces revolt against it that was part of margarets originality which pleased her aunt in proportion to her own conventionality she was really a timid person and she liked the show of courage which margarets magnanimity often reflected upon her she had through her a repute with people who did not know her well for intellectual and moral qualities she was supposed to be literary and charitable she almost had opinions and ideals but really fell short of their possession she thought that she set bounds to the girls originality because she recognized them margaret understood this better than her aunt and knew that she had consulted her about going to see the dryfooses out of deference and with no expectation of luminous instruction she was used to being a law to herself but she knew what she might and might not do so that she was rather a bylaw she was the kind of girl that might have fancies for artists and poets but might end by marrying a prosperous broker and leavening a vast lump of moneyed and fashionable life with her culture generosity and goodwill the intellectual interests were first with her but she might be equal to sacrificing them she had the best heart but she might know how to harden it if she was eccentric her social orbit was defined comets themselves traverse space on fixed lines she was like every one else a congeries of contradictions and inconsistencies but obedient to the general expectation of what a girl of her position must and must not finally be provisionally she was very much what she liked to be     vii  margaret vance tried to give herself some reason for going to call upon the dryfooses but she could find none better than the wish to do a kind thing this seemed queerer and less and less sufficient as she examined it and she even admitted a little curiosity as a harmless element in her motive without being very well satisfied with it she tried to add a slight sense of social duty and then she decided to have no motive at all but simply to pay her visit as she would to any other eligible strangers she saw fit to call upon she perceived that she must be very careful not to let them see that any other impulse had governed her she determined if possible to let them patronize her to be very modest and sincere and diffident and above all not to play a part this was easy compared with the choice of a manner that should convey to them the fact that she was not playing a part when the hesitating irish servingman had acknowledged that the ladies were at home and had taken her card to them she sat waiting for them in the drawingroom her study of its appointments with their impersonal costliness gave her no suggestion how to proceed the two sisters were upon her before she had really decided and she rose to meet them with the conviction that she was going to play a part for want of some chosen means of not doing so she found herself before she knew it making her banjo a property in the little comedy and professing so much pleasure in the fact that miss dryfoos was taking it up she had herself been so much interested by it anything she said was a relief from the piano and then between the guitar and the banjo one must really choose the banjo unless one wanted to devote ones whole natural life to the violin of course there was the mandolin but margaret asked if they did not feel that the bit of shell you struck it with interposed a distance between you and the real soul of the instrument and then it did have such a faint mosquitoy little tone she made much of the question which they left her to debate alone while they gazed solemnly at her till she characterized the tone of the mandolin when mela broke into a large coarse laugh  well thats just what it does sound like she explained defiantly to her sister i always feel like it was going to settle somewhere and i want to hit myself a slap before it begins to bite i dont see what ever brought such a thing into fashion  margaret had not expected to be so powerfully seconded and she asked after gathering herself together and you are both learning the banjo my no said mela ive gone through enough with the piano christine is learnun it  im so glad you are making my banjo useful at the outset miss dryfoos both girls stared at her but found it hard to cope with the fact that this was the lady friend whose banjo beaton had lent them mr beaton mentioned that he had left it here i hope youll keep it as long as you find it useful  at this amiable speech even christine could not help thanking her of course she said i expect to get another right off mr beaton is going to choose it for me  you are very fortunate if you havent a teacher yet i should so like to recommend mine  mela broke out in her laugh again oh i guess christines pretty well suited with the one shes got she said with insinuation her sister gave her a frowning glance and margaret did not tempt her to explain  then thats much better she said i have a kind of superstition in such matters i dont like to make a second choice in a shop i like to take the first thing of the kind im looking for and even if i choose further i come back to the original  how funny said mela well now im just the other way i always take the last thing after ive picked over all the rest my luck always seems to be at the bottom of the heap now christine shes more like you i believe she could walk right up blindfolded and put her hand on the thing she wants every time  im like father said christine softened a little by the celebration of her peculiarity he says the reason so many people dont get what they want is that they dont want it bad enough now when i want a thing it seems to me that i want it all through  well thats just like father too said mela thats the way he done when he got that eightyacre piece next to moffitt that he kept when he sold the farm and thats got some of the best gaswells on it now that there is anywhere she addressed the explanation to her sister to the exclusion of margaret who nevertheless listened with a smiling face and a resolutely polite air of being a party to the conversation mela rewarded her amiability by saying to her finally youve never been in the naturalgas country have you  oh no and i should so much like to see it said margaret with a fervor that was partly voluntary  would you well were kind of sick of it but i suppose it would strike a stranger  i never got tired of looking at the big wells when they lit them up said christine it seems as if the world was on fire  yes and when you see the surfacegas burnun down in the woods like it used to by our springhouseso still and never spreadun any just like a bed of some kind of wild flowers when you ketch sight of it a piece off  they began to tell of the wonders of their strange land in an antiphony of reminiscences and descriptions they unconsciously imputed a merit to themselves from the number and violence of the wells on their fathers property they bragged of the high civilization of moffitt which they compared to its advantage with that of new york they became excited by margarets interest in natural gas and forgot to be suspicious and envious  she said as she rose oh how much i should like to see it all then she made a little pause and added  im so sorry my aunts thursdays are over she never has them after lent but were to have some people tuesday evening at a little concert which a musical friend is going to give with some other artists there wont be any banjos im afraid but therell be some very good singing and my aunt would be so glad if you could come with your mother  she put down her aunts card on the table near her while mela gurgled as if it were the best joke oh my mother never goes anywhere you couldnt get her out for love or money but she was herself overwhelmed with a simple joy at margarets politeness and showed it in a sensuous way like a child as if she had been tickled she came closer to margaret and seemed about to fawn physically upon her  aint she just as lovely as she can live she demanded of her sister when margaret was gone  i dont know said christine i guess she wanted to know who mr beaton had been lending her banjo to  pshaw do you suppose shes in love with him asked mela and then she broke into her hoarse laugh at the look her sister gave her well dont eat me christine i wonder who she is anyway im goun to git it out of mr beaton the next time he calls i guess shes somebody mrs mandel can tell i wish that old friend of hers would hurry up and git wellor something but i guess we appeared about as well as she did i could see she was afraid of you christine i reckon its gittun around a little about father and when it does i dont believe we shall want for callers say are you goun to that concert of theirs  i dont know not till i know who they are first  well weve got to hump ourselves if were goun to find out before tuesday  as she went home margaret felt wrought in her that most incredible of the miracles which nevertheless any one may make his experience she felt kindly to these girls because she had tried to make them happy and she hoped that in the interest she had shown there had been none of the poison of flattery she was aware that this was a risk she ran in such an attempt to do good if she had escaped this effect she was willing to leave the rest with providence     viii  the notion that a girl of margaret vances traditions would naturally form of girls like christine and mela dryfoos would be that they were abashed in the presence of the new conditions of their lives and that they must receive the advance she had made them with a certain grateful humility however they received it she had made it upon principle from a romantic conception of duty but this was the way she imagined they would receive it because she thought that she would have done so if she had been as ignorant and unbred as they her error was in arguing their attitude from her own temperament and endowing them for the purposes of argument with her perspective they had not the means intellectual or moral of feeling as she fancied if they had remained at home on the farm where they were born christine would have grown up that embodiment of impassioned suspicion which we find oftenest in the narrowest spheres and mela would always have been a goodnatured simpleton but they would never have doubted their equality with the wisest and the finest as it was they had not learned enough at school to doubt it and the splendor of their fathers success in making money had blinded them forever to any possible difference against them they had no question of themselves in the social abeyance to which they had been left in new york they had been surprised mystified it was not what they had expected there must be some mistake  they were the victims of an accident which would be repaired as soon as the fact of their fathers wealth had got around they had been steadfast in their faith through all their disappointment that they were not only better than most people by virtue of his money but as good as any and they took margarets visit so far as they investigated its motive for a sign that at last it was beginning to get around of course a thing could not get around in new york so quick as it could in a small place they were confirmed in their belief by the sensation of mrs mandel when she returned to duty that afternoon and they consulted her about going to mrs horns musicale if she had felt any doubt at the name for there were horns and hornsthe address on the card put the matter beyond question and she tried to make her charges understand what a precious chance had befallen them she did not succeed they had not the premises the experience for a sufficient impression and she undid her work in part by the effort to explain that mrs horns standing was independent of money that though she was positively rich she was comparatively poor christine inferred that miss vance had called because she wished to be the first to get in with them since it had begun to get around this view commended itself to mela too but without warping her from her opinion that miss vance was all the same too sweet for anything she had not so vivid a consciousness of her fathers money as christine had but she reposed perhaps all the more confidently upon its power she was far from thinking meanly of any one who thought highly of her for it that seemed so natural a result as to be amiable even admirable she was willing that any such person should get all the good there was in such an attitude toward her  they discussed the matter that night at dinner before their father and mother who mostly sat silent at their meals the father frowning absently over his plate with his head close to it and making play into his mouth with the back of his knife he had got so far toward the use of his fork as to despise those who still ate from the edge of their knives and the mother partly missing hers at times in the nervous tremor that shook her face from side to side  after a while the subject of melas hoarse babble and of christines highpitched thin sharp forays of assertion and denial in the field which her sisters voice seemed to cover made its way into the old mans consciousness and he perceived that they were talking with mrs mandel about it and that his wife was from time to time offering an irrelevant and mistaken comment he agreed with christine and silently took her view of the affair some time before he made any sign of having listened there had been a time in his life when other things besides his money seemed admirable to him he had once respected himself for the hardheaded practical common sense which first gave him standing among his country neighbors which made him supervisor school trustee justice of the peace county commissioner secretary of the moffitt county agricultural society in those days he had served the public with disinterested zeal and proud ability he used to write to the lake shore farmer on agricultural topics he took part in opposing through the moffitt papers the legislative waste of the peoples money on the question of selling a local canal to the railroad company which killed that fine old state work and let the dry ditch grow up to grass he might have gone to the legislature but he contented himself with defeating the moffitt member who had voted for the job if he opposed some measures for the general good like high schools and school libraries it was because he lacked perspective in his intense individualism and suspected all expense of being spendthrift he believed in good district schools and he had a fondness crude but genuine for some kinds of readinghistory and forensics of an elementary sort  with his good head for figures he doubted doctors and despised preachers he thought lawyers were all rascals but he respected them for their ability he was not himself litigious but he enjoyed the intellectual encounters of a difficult lawsuit and he often attended a sitting of the fall term of court when he went to town for the pleasure of hearing the speeches he was a good citizen and a good husband as a good father he was rather severe with his children and used to whip them especially the gentle conrad who somehow crossed him most till the twins died after that he never struck any of them and from the sight of a blow dealt a horse he turned as if sick it was a long time before he lifted himself up from his sorrow and then the will of the man seemed to have been breached through his affections he let the girls do as they pleasedthe twins had been girls he let them go away to school and got them a piano it was they who made him sell the farm if conrad had only had their spirit he could have made him keep it he felt and he resented the want of support he might have found in a less yielding spirit than his sons  his moral decay began with his perception of the opportunity of making money quickly and abundantly which offered itself to him after he sold his farm he awoke to it slowly from a desolation in which he tasted the last bitter of homesickness the utter misery of idleness and listlessness when he broke down and cried for the hardworking wholesome life he had lost he was near the end of this season of despair but he was also near the end of what was best in himself he devolved upon a meaner ideal than that of conservative good citizenship which had been his chief moral experience the money he had already made without effort and without merit bred its unholy selflove in him he began to honor money especially money that had been won suddenly and in large sums for money that had been earned painfully slowly and in little amounts he had only pity and contempt the poison of that ambition to go somewhere and be somebody which the local speculators had instilled into him began to work in the vanity which had succeeded his somewhat scornful selfrespect he rejected europe as the proper field for his expansion he rejected washington he preferred new york whither the men who have made money and do not yet know that money has made them all instinctively turn he came where he could watch his money breed more money and bring greater increase of its kind in an hour of luck than the toil of hundreds of men could earn in a year he called it speculation stocks the street and his pride his faith in himself mounted with his luck he expected when he had sated his greed to begin to spend and he had formulated an intention to build a great house to add another to the palaces of the countrybred millionaires who have come to adorn the great city in the mean time he made little account of the things that occupied his children except to fret at the ungrateful indifference of his son to the interests that could alone make a man of him he did not know whether his daughters were in society or not with people coming and going in the house he would have supposed they must be so no matter who the people were in some vague way he felt that he had hired society in mrs mandel at so much a year he never met a superior himself except now and then a man of twenty or thirty millions to his one or two and then he felt his soul creep within him without a sense of social inferiority it was a question of financial inferiority and though dryfooss soul bowed itself and crawled it was with a gamblers admiration of wonderful luck other men said these manymillioned millionaires were smart and got their money by sharp practices to which lesser men could not attain but dryfoos believed that he could compass the same ends by the same means with the same chances he respected their money not them  when he now heard mrs mandel and his daughters talking of that person whoever she was that mrs mandel seemed to think had honored his girls by coming to see them his curiosity was pricked as much as his pride was galled  well anyway said mela i dont care whether christines goon or not i am and you got to go with me mrs mandel  well theres a little difficulty said mrs mandel with her unfailing dignity and politeness i havent been asked you know  then what are we goun to do demanded mela almost crossly she was physically too amiable she felt too well corporeally ever to be quite cross she might a knowedwell knownwe couldnt a come alone in new york i dont see why we couldnt i dont call it much of an invitation  i suppose she thought you could come with your mother mrs mandel suggested  she didnt say anything about mother did she christine or yes she did too and i told her she couldnt git mother out dont you remember  i didnt pay much attention said christine i wasnt certain we wanted to go  i reckon you wasnt goun to let her see that we cared much said mela half reproachful half proud of this attitude of christine well i dont see but what we got to stay at home she laughed at this lame conclusion of the matter  perhaps mr conradyou could very properly take him without an express invitation mrs mandel began  conrad looked up in alarm and protest ii dont think i could go that evening  whats the reason his father broke in harshly youre not such a sheep that youre afraid to go into company with your sisters or are you too good to go with them  if its to be anything like that night when them hussies come out and danced that way said mrs dryfoos i dont blame coonrod for not wantun to go i never saw the beat of it  mela sent a yelling laugh across the table to her mother well i wish miss vance could a heard that why mother did you think it like the ballet  well i didnt know mely child said the old woman i didnt know what it was like i haint never been to one and you cant be too keerful where you go in a place like new york  whats the reason you cant go dryfoos ignored the passage between his wife and daughter in making this demand of his son with a sour face  i have an engagement that nightits one of our meetings  i reckon you can let your meeting go for one night said dryfoos it cant be so important as all that that you must disappoint your sisters  i dont like to disappoint those poor creatures they depend so much upon the meetings  i reckon they can stand it for one night said the old man he added the poor ye have with you always  thats so coonrod said his mother its the saviours own words  yes mother but theyre not meant just as father used them  how do you know how they were meant or how i used them cried the father now you just make your plans to go with the girls tuesday night they cant go alone and mrs mandel cant go with them  pshaw said mela we dont want to take conrad away from his meetun do we chris  i dont know said christine in her high fine voice they could get along without him for one night as father says  well im not agoun to take him said mela now mrs mandel just think out some other way say whats the reason we couldnt get somebody else to take us just as well aint that rulable  it would be allowable  allowable i mean mela corrected herself  but it might look a little significant unless it was some old family friend  well lets get mr fulkerson to take us hes the oldest family friend we got  i wont go with mr fulkerson said christine serenely  why im sure christine her mother pleaded mr fulkerson is a very good young man and very nice appearun  mela shouted hes ten times as pleasant as that old mr beaton of christines  christine made no effort to break the constraint that fell upon the table at this sally but her father said christine is right mela it wouldnt do for you to go with any other young man conrad will go with you  im not certain i want to go yet said christine  well settle that among yourselves but if you want to go your brother will go with you  of course coonrod ll go if his sisters wants him to the old woman pleaded i reckon it aint agoun to be anything very bad and if it is coonrod why you can just git right up and come out  it will be all right mother and i will go of course  there now i knowed you would coonrod now fawther this appeal was to make the old man say something in recognition of conrads sacrifice  youll always find he said that its those of your own household that have the first claim on you  thats so coonrod urged his mother its bible truth your fawther aint a perfesser but he always did read his bible search the scriptures thats what it means  laws cried mely a body can see easy enough from mother where conrads wantun to be a preacher comes from i should a thought shed a wanted to been one herself  let your women keep silence in the churches said the old woman solemnly  there you go again mother i guess if you was to say that to some of the lady ministers nowadays youd git yourself into trouble mela looked round for approval and gurgled out a hoarse laugh     ix  the dryfooses went late to mrs horns musicale in spite of mrs mandels advice christine made the delay both because she wished to show miss vance that she was not anxious and because she had some vague notion of the distinction of arriving late at any sort of entertainment mrs mandel insisted upon the difference between this musicale and an ordinary reception but christine rather fancied disturbing a company that had got seated and perhaps making people rise and stand while she found her way to her place as she had seen them do for a tardy comer at the theatre  mela whom she did not admit to her reasons or feelings always followed her with the servile admiration she had for all that christine did and she took on trust as somehow successful the result of christines obstinacy when they were allowed to stand against the wall at the back of the room through the whole of the long piece begun just before they came in there had been no one to receive them a few people in the rear rows of chairs near them turned their heads to glance at them and then looked away again mela had her misgivings but at the end of the piece miss vance came up to them at once and then mela knew that she had her eyes on them all the time and that christine must have been right christine said nothing about their coming late and so mela did not make any excuse and miss vance seemed to expect none she glanced with a sort of surprise at conrad when christine introduced him mela did not know whether she liked their bringing him till she shook hands with him and said oh i am very glad indeed mr dryfoos and i have met before without explaining where or when she led them to her aunt and presented them and then said im going to put you with some friends of yours and quickly seated them next the marches mela liked that well enough she thought she might have some joking with mr march for all his wife was so stiff but the look which christine wore seemed to forbid provisionally at least any such recreation on her part christine was cool with the marches it went through her mind that they must have told miss vance they knew her and perhaps they had boasted of her intimacy she relaxed a little toward them when she saw beaton leaning against the wall at the end of the row next mrs march then she conjectured that he might have told miss vance of her acquaintance with the marches and she bent forward and nodded to mrs march across conrad mela and mr march she conceived of him as a sort of hand of her fathers but she was willing to take them at their apparent social valuation for the time she leaned back in her chair and did not look up at beaton after the first furtive glance though she felt his eyes on her  the music began again almost at once before mela had time to make conrad tell her where miss vance had met him before she would not have minded interrupting the music but every one else seemed so attentive even christine that she had not the courage the concert went onto an end without realizing for her the ideal of pleasure which one ought to find in society she was not exacting but it seemed to her there were very few young men and when the music was over and their opportunity came to be sociable they were not very sociable they were not introduced for one thing but it appeared to mela that they might have got introduced if they had any sense she saw them looking at her and she was glad she had dressed so much she was dressed more than any other lady there and either because she was the most dressed of any person there or because it had got around who her father was she felt that she had made an impression on the young men in her satisfaction with this and from her good nature she was contented to be served with her refreshments after the concert by mr march and to remain joking with him she was at her ease she let her hoarse voice out in her largest laugh she accused him to the admiration of those near of getting her into a perfect gale it appeared to her in her own pleasure her mission to illustrate to the rather subdued people about her what a good time really was so that they could have it if they wanted it her joy was crowned when march modestly professed himself unworthy to monopolize her and explained how selfish he felt in talking to a young lady when there were so many young men dying to do so  oh pshaw dyun yes cried mela tasting the irony i guess i see them  he asked if he might really introduce a friend of his to her and she said well yes if he thought he could live to get to her and march brought up a man whom he thought very young and mela thought very old he was a contributor to every other week and so march knew him he believed himself a student of human nature in behalf of literature and he now set about studying mela he tempted her to express her opinion on all points and he laughed so amiably at the boldness and humorous vigor of her ideas that she was delighted with him she asked him if he was a newyorker by birth and she told him she pitied him when he said he had never been west she professed herself perfectly sick of new york and urged him to go to moffitt if he wanted to see a real live town he wondered if it would do to put her into literature just as she was with all her slang and brag but he decided that he would have to subdue her a great deal he did not see how he could reconcile the facts of her conversation with the facts of her appearance her beauty her splendor of dress her apparent right to be where she was these things perplexed him he was afraid the great american novel if true must be incredible mela said he ought to hear her sister go on about new york when they first came but she reckoned that christine was getting so she could put up with it a little better now she looked significantly across the room to the place where christine was now talking with beaton and the student of human nature asked was she here and would she introduce him mela said she would the first chance she got and she added they would be much pleased to have him call she felt herself to be having a beautiful time and she got directly upon such intimate terms with the student of human nature that she laughed with him about some peculiarities of his such as his going so far about to ask things he wanted to know from her she said she never did believe in beating about the bush much she had noticed the same thing in miss vance when she came to call that day and when the young man owned that he came rather a good deal to mrs horns house she asked him well what sort of a girl was miss vance anyway and where did he suppose she had met her brother the student of human nature could not say as to this and as to miss vance he judged it safest to treat of the nonsociety side of her character her activity in charity her special devotion to the work among the poor on the east side which she personally engaged in  oh thats where conrad goes too mela interrupted ill bet anything thats where she met him i wisht i could tell christine but i suppose she would want to kill me if i was to speak to her now  the student of human nature said politely oh shall i take you to her  mela answered i guess you better not with a laugh so significant that he could not help his inferences concerning both christines absorption in the person she was talking with and the habitual violence of her temper he made note of how mela helplessly spoke of all her family by their names as if he were already intimate with them he fancied that if he could get that in skillfully it would be a valuable color in his study the english lord whom she should astonish with it began to form himself out of the dramatic nebulosity in his mind and to whirl on a definite orbit in american society but he was puzzled to decide whether melas willingness to take him into her confidence on short notice was typical or personal the trait of a daughter of the naturalgas millionaire or a foible of her own  beaton talked with christine the greater part of the evening that was left after the concert he was very grave and took the tone of a fatherly friend he spoke guardedly of the people present and moderated the severity of some of christines judgments of their looks and costumes he did this out of a sort of unreasoned allegiance to margaret whom he was in the mood of wishing to please by being very kind and good as she always was he had the sense also of atoning by this behavior for some reckless things he had said before that to christine he put on a sad reproving air with her and gave her the feeling of being held in check  she chafed at it and said glancing at margaret in talk with her brother i dont think miss vance is so very pretty do you  i never think whether shes pretty or not said becton with dreamy affectation she is merely perfect does she know your brother  so she says i didnt suppose conrad ever went anywhere except to tenementhouses  it might have been there becton suggested she goes among friendless people everywhere  maybe thats the reason she came to see us said christine  becton looked at her with his smouldering eyes and felt the wish to say yes it was exactly that but he only allowed himself to deny the possibility of any such motive in that case he added i am so glad you know her miss dryfoos i never met miss vance without feeling myself better and truer somehow or the wish to be so  and you think we might be improved too christine retorted well i must say youre not very flattering mr becton anyway  becton would have liked to answer her according to her cattishness with a good clawing sarcasm that would leave its smart in her pride but he was being good and he could not change all at once besides the girls attitude under the social honor done her interested him he was sure she had never been in such good company before but he could see that she was not in the least affected by the experience he had told her who this person and that was and he saw she had understood that the names were of consequence but she seemed to feel her equality with them all her serenity was not obviously akin to the savage stoicism in which beaton hid his own consciousness of social inferiority but having won his way in the world so far by his talent his personal quality he did not conceive the simple fact in her case christine was selfpossessed because she felt that a knowledge of her fathers fortune had got around and she had the peace which money gives to ignorance but beaton attributed her poise to indifference to social values this while he inwardly sneered at it avenged him upon his own too keen sense of them and together with his temporary allegiance to margarets goodness kept him from retaliating christines vulgarity he said i dont see how that could be and left the question of flattery to settle itself  the people began to go away following each other up to take leave of mrs horn christine watched them with unconcern and either because she would not be governed by the general movement or because she liked being with beaton gave no sign of going mela was still talking to the student of human nature sending out her laugh in deep gurgles amid the unimaginable confidences she was making him about herself her family the staff of every other week mrs mandel and the kind of life they had all led before she came to them he was not a blind devotee of art for arts sake and though he felt that if one could portray mela just as she was she would be the richest possible material he was rather ashamed to know some of the things she told him and he kept looking anxiously about for a chance of escape the company had reduced itself to the dryfoos groups and some friends of mrs horns who had the right to linger when margaret crossed the room with conrad to christine and beaton  im so glad miss dryfoos to find that i was not quite a stranger to you all when i ventured to call the other day your brother and i are rather old acquaintances though i never knew who he was before i dont know just how to say we met where he is valued so much i suppose i mustnt try to say how much she added with a look of deep regard at him  conrad blushed and stood folding his arms tight over his breast while his sister received margarets confession with the suspicion which was her first feeling in regard to any new thing what she concluded was that this girl was trying to get in with them for reasons of her own she said yes its the first i ever heard of his knowing you hes so much taken up with his meetings he didnt want to come tonight  margaret drew in her lip before she answered without apparent resentment of the awkwardness or ungraciousness whichever she found it i dont wonder you become so absorbed in such work that you think nothing else is worth while but im glad mr dryfoos could come with you im so glad you could all come i knew you would enjoy the music do sit down  no said christine bluntly we must be going mela she called out come  the last group about mrs horn looked round but christine advanced upon them undismayed and took the hand mrs horn promptly gave her well i must bid you goodnight  oh goodnight murmured the elder lady so very kind of you to come  ive had the best kind of a time said mela cordially i haint laughed so much i dont know when  oh im glad you enjoyed it said mrs horn in the same polite murmur she had used with christine but she said nothing to either sister about any future meeting  they were apparently not troubled mela said over her shoulder to the student of human nature the next time i see you ill give it to you for what you said about moffitt  margaret made some entreating paces after them but she did not succeed in covering the retreat of the sisters against critical conjecture she could only say to conrad as if recurring to the subject i hope we can get our friends to play for us some night i know it isnt any real help but such things take the poor creatures out of themselves for the time being dont you think  oh yes he answered theyre good in that way he turned back hesitatingly to mrs horn and said with a blush i thank you for a happy evening  oh i am very glad she replied in her murmur  one of the old friends of the house arched her eyebrows in saying goodnight and offered the two young men remaining seats home in her carriage beaton gloomily refused and she kept herself from asking the student of human nature till she had got him into her carriage what is moffitt and what did you say about it  now you see margaret said mrs horn with bated triumph when the people were all gone  yes i see the girl consented from one point of view of course its been a failure i dont think weve given miss dryfoos a pleasure but perhaps nobody could and at least weve given her the opportunity of enjoying herself  such people said mrs horn philosophically people with their money must of course be received sooner or later you cant keep them out only i believe i would rather let some one else begin with them the leightons didnt come  i sent them cards i couldnt call again  mrs horn sighed a little i suppose mr dryfoos is one of your fellowphilanthropists  hes one of the workers said margaret i met him several times at the hall but i only knew his first name i think hes a great friend of father benedict he seems devoted to the work dont you think he looks good  very said mrs horn with a color of censure in her assent the younger girl seemed more amiable than her sister but what manners  dreadful said margaret with knit brows and a pursed mouth of humorous suffering but she appeared to feel very much at home  oh as to that neither of them was much abashed do you suppose mr beaton gave the other one some hints for that quaint dress of hers i dont imagine that black and lace is her own invention she seems to have some sort of strange fascination for him  shes very picturesque margaret explained and artists see points in people that the rest of us dont  could it be her money mrs horn insinuated he must be very poor  but he isnt base retorted the girl with a generous indignation that made her aunt smile  oh no but if he fancies her so picturesque it doesnt follow that he would object to her being rich  it would with a man like mr beaton  you are an idealist margaret i suppose your mr march has some disinterested motive in paying court to miss melapamela i suppose is her name he talked to her longer than her literature would have lasted  he seems a very kind person said margaret  and mr dryfoos pays his salary  i dont know anything about that but that wouldnt make any difference with him  mrs horn laughed out at this security but she was not displeased by the nobleness which it came from she liked margaret to be highminded and was really not distressed by any good that was in her  the marches walked home both because it was not far and because they must spare in carriage hire at any rate as soon as they were out of the house she applied a point of conscience to him  i dont see how you could talk to that girl so long basil and make her laugh so  why there seemed no one else to do it till i thought of kendricks  yes but i kept thinking now hes pleasant to her because he thinks its to his interest if she had no relation to every other week he wouldnt waste his time on her  isabel march complained i wish you wouldnt think of me in he him and his i never personalize you in my thoughts you remain always a vague unindividualized essence not quite without form and void but nounless and pronounless i call that a much more beautiful mental attitude toward the object of ones affections but if you must he and him and his me in your thoughts i wish youd have more kindly thoughts of me  do you deny that its true basil  do you believe that its true isabel  no matter but could you excuse it if it were  ah i see youd have been capable of it in my place and youre ashamed  yes sighed the wife im afraid that i should but tell me that you wouldnt basil  i can tell you that i wasnt but i suppose that in a real exigency i could truckle to the proprietary dryfooses as well as you  oh no you mustnt dear im a woman and im dreadfully afraid but you must always be a man especially with that horrid old mr dryfoos promise me that youll never yield the least point to him in a matter of right and wrong  not if hes right and im wrong  dont trifle dear you know what i mean will you promise  ill promise to submit the point to you and let you do the yielding as for me i shall be adamant nothing i like better  theyre dreadful even that poor good young fellow whos so different from all the rest hes awful too because you feel that hes a martyr to them  and i never did like martyrs a great deal march interposed  i wonder how they came to be there mrs march pursued unmindful of his joke  that is exactly what seemed to be puzzling miss mela about us she asked and i explained as well as i could and then she told me that miss vance had come to call on them and invited them and first they didnt know how they could come till they thought of making conrad bring them but she didnt say why miss vance called on them mr dryfoos doesnt employ her on every other week but i suppose she has her own vile little motive  it cant be their money it cant be sighed mrs march  well i dont know we all respect money  yes but miss vances position is so secure she neednt pay court to those stupid vulgar people  well lets console ourselves with the belief that she would if she needed such people as the dryfooses are the raw material of good society it isnt made up of refined or meritorious peopleprofessors and litterateurs ministers and musicians and their families all the fashionable people there tonight were like the dryfooses a generation or two ago i dare say the material works up faster now and in a season or two you wont know the dryfooses from the other plutocrats they willa little better than they do now theyll see a difference but nothing radical nothing painful people who get up in the world by service to othersthrough letters or art or sciencemay have their modest little misgivings as to their social value but people that rise by moneyespecially if their gains are suddennever have and thats the kind of people that form our nobility theres no use pretending that we havent a nobility we might as well pretend we havent firstclass cars in the presence of a vestibuled pullman those girls had no more doubt of their right to be there than if they had been duchesses we thought it was very nice of miss vance to come and ask us but they didnt they werent afraid or the least embarrassed they were perfectly naturallike born aristocrats and you may be sure that if the plutocracy that now owns the country ever sees fit to take on the outward signs of an aristocracytitles and arms and ancestorsit wont falter from any inherent question of its worth money prizes and honors itself and if there is anything it hasnt got it believes it can buy it  well basil said his wife i hope you wont get infected with lindaus ideas of rich people some of them are very good and kind  who denies that not even lindau himself its all right and the great thing is that the evenings enjoyment is over ive got my society smile off and im radiantly happy go on with your little pessimistic diatribes isabel you cant spoil my pleasure  i could see said mela as she and christine drove home together that she was as jealous as she could be all the time you was talkun to mr beaton she pretended to be talkun to conrad but she kep her eye on you pretty close i can tell you i bet she just got us there to see how him and you would act together and i reckon she was satisfied hes dead gone on you chris  christine listened with a dreamy pleasure to the flatteries with which mela plied her in the hope of some return in kind and not at all because she felt spitefully toward miss vance or in anywise wished her ill who was that fellow with you so long asked christine i suppose you turned yourself inside out to him like you always do  mela was transported by the cruel ingratitude its a lie i didnt tell him a single thing  conrad walked home choosing to do so because he did not wish to hear his sisters talk of the evening and because there was a tumult in his spirit which he wished to let have its way in his life with its single purpose defeated by stronger wills than his own and now struggling partially to fulfil itself in acts of devotion to others the thought of women had entered scarcely more than in that of a child his ideals were of a virginal vagueness faces voices gestures had filled his fancy at times but almost passionately and the sensation that he now indulged was a kind of worship ardent but reverent and exalted the brutal experiences of the world make us forget that there are such natures in it and that they seem to come up out of the lowly earth as well as down from the high heaven in the heart of this man well on toward thirty there had never been left the stain of a base thought not that suggestion and conjecture had not visited him but that he had not entertained them or in anywise made them his in a catholic age and country he would have been one of those monks who are sainted after death for the angelic purity of their lives and whose names are invoked by believers in moments of trial like san luigi gonzaga as he now walked along thinking with a lovers beatified smile on his face of how margaret vance had spoken and looked he dramatized scenes in which he approved himself to her by acts of goodness and unselfishness and died to please her for the sake of others he made her praise him for them to his face when he disclaimed their merit and after his death when he could not all the time he was poignantly sensible of her grace her elegance her style they seemed to intoxicate him some tones of her voice thrilled through his nerves and some looks turned his brain with a delicious swooning sense of her beauty her refinement bewildered him but all this did not admit the idea of possession even of aspiration at the most his worship only set her beyond the love of other men as far as beyond his own     pg editors bookmarks      affectional habit     brag of his wife as a good husband always does     but when

success of every other week dryfoos had never meddled in any manner with the conduct of the periodical but fulkerson easily saw that he was proud of his relation to it and he proceeded upon the theory that he would be willing to have this relation known on the days when he had been lucky in stocks he was apt to drop in at the office on eleventh street on his way uptown and listen to fulkersons talk he was on good enough terms with march who revised his first impressions of the man but they had not much to say to each other and it seemed to march that dryfoos was even a little afraid of him as of a piece of mechanism he had acquired but did not quite understand he left the working of it to fulkerson who no doubt bragged of it sufficiently the old man seemed to have as little to say to his son he shut himself up with fulkerson where the others could hear the manager begin and go on with an unstinted flow of talk about every other week for fulkerson never talked of anything else if he could help it and was always bringing the conversation back to it if it strayed  the day he spoke of the dinner he rose and called from his door march i say come down here a minute will you conrad i want you too  the editor and the publisher found the manager and the proprietor seated on opposite sides of the table its about those funeral baked meats you know fulkerson explained and i was trying to give mr dryfoos some idea of what we wanted to do that is what i wanted to do he continued turning from march to dryfoos march here is opposed to it of course hed like to publish every other week on the sly keep it out of the papers and off the newsstands hes a modest boston petunia and he shrinks from publicity but i am not that kind of herb myself and i want all the publicity we can getbeg borrow or stealfor this thing i say that you cant work the sacred rites of hospitality in a better cause and what i propose is a little dinner for the purpose of recognizing the hit weve made with this thing my idea was to strike you for the necessary funds and do the thing on a handsome scale the term little dinner is a mere figure of speech a little dinner wouldnt make a big talk and what we want is the big talk at present if we dont lay up a cent my notion was that pretty soon after lent now when everybody is feeling just right we should begin to send out our paragraphs affirmative negative and explanatory and along about the first of may we should sit down about a hundred strong the most distinguished people in the country and solemnize our triumph there it is in a nutshell i might expand and i might expound but thats the sum and substance of it  fulkerson stopped and ran his eyes eagerly over the faces of his three listeners one after the other march was a little surprised when dryfoos turned to him but that reference of the question seemed to give fulkerson particular pleasure what do you think mr march  the editor leaned back in his chair i dont pretend to have mr fulkersons genius for advertising but it seems to me a little early yet we might celebrate later when weve got more to celebrate at present were a pleasing novelty rather than a fixed fact  ah you dont get the idea said fulkerson what we want to do with this dinner is to fix the fact  am i going to come in anywhere the old man interrupted  youre going to come in at the head of the procession we are going to strike everything that is imaginative and romantic in the newspaper soul with you and your history and your fancy for going in for this thing i can start you in a paragraph that will travel through all the newspapers from maine to texas and from alaska to florida we have had all sorts of rich men backing up literary enterprises but the naturalgas man in literature is a new thing and the combination of your picturesque past and your aesthetic present is something that will knock out the sympathies of the american public the first round i feel said fulkerson with a tremor of pathos in his voice that every other week is at a disadvantage before the public as long as its supposed to be my enterprise my idea as far as im known at all im known simply as a syndicate man and nobody in the press believes that ive got the money to run the thing on a grand scale a suspicion of insolvency must attach to it sooner or later and the fellows on the press will work up that impression sooner or later if we dont give them something else to work up now as soon as i begin to give it away to the correspondents that youre in it with your untold millionsthat in fact it was your idea from the start that you originated it to give full play to the humanitarian tendencies of conrad here whos always had these theories of cooperation and longed to realize them for the benefit of our struggling young writers and artists  march had listened with growing amusement to the mingled burlesque and earnest of fulkersons selfsacrificing impudence and with wonder as to how far dryfoos was consenting to his preposterous proposition when conrad broke out mr fulkerson i could not allow you to do that it would not be true i did not wish to be here andand what i thinkwhat i wish to dothat is something i will not let any one put me in a false position about no the blood rushed into the young mans gentle face and he met his fathers glance with defiance  dryfoos turned from him to fulkerson without speaking and fulkerson said caressingly why of course coonrod i know how you feel and i shouldnt let anything of that sort go out uncontradicted afterward but there isnt anything in these times that would give us better standing with the public than some hint of the way you feel about such things the publics expects to be interested and nothing would interest it more than to be told that the success of every other week sprang from the first application of the principle of live and let live to a literary enterprise it would look particularly well coming from you and your father but if you object we can leave that part out though if you approve of the principle i dont see why you need object the main thing is to let the public know that it owes this thing to the liberal and enlightened spirit of one of the foremost capitalists of the country and that his purposes are not likely to be betrayed in the hands of his son i should get a little cut made from a photograph of your father and supply it gratis with the paragraphs  i guess said the old man we will get along without the cut  fulkerson laughed well well have it your own way but the sight of your face in the patent outsides of the country press would be worth half a dozen subscribers in every school district throughout the length and breadth of this fair land  there was a fellow dryfoos explained in an aside to march that was getting up a history of moffitt and he asked me to let him put a steel engraving of me in he said a good many prominent citizens were going to have theirs in and his price was a hundred and fifty dollars i told him i couldnt let mine go for less than two hundred and when he said he could give me a splendid plate for that money i said i should want it cash you never saw a fellow more astonished when he got it through him that i expected him to pay the two hundred  fulkerson laughed in keen appreciation of the joke well sir i guess every other week will pay you that much but if you wont sell at any price all right we must try to worry along without the light of your countenance on the posters but we got to have it for the banquet  i dont seem to feel very hungry yet said they old man dryly  oh lappeit vient en mangeant as our french friends say youll be hungry enough when you see the preliminary little neck clam its too late for oysters  doesnt that fact seem to point to a postponement till they get back sometime in october march suggested  no no said fulkerson you dont catch on to the business end of this thing my friends youre proceeding on something like the old exploded idea that the demand creates the supply when everybody knows if hes watched the course of modern events that its just as apt to be the other way i contend that weve got a real substantial success to celebrate now but even if we hadnt the celebration would do more than anything else to create the success if we got it properly before the public people will say those fellows are not fools they wouldnt go and rejoice over their magazine unless they had got a big thing in it and the state of feeling we should produce in the public mind would make a boom of perfectly unprecedented grandeur for e o w heigh  he looked sunnily from one to the other in succession the elder dryfoos said with his chin on the top of his stick i reckon those little neck clams will keep  well just as you say fulkerson cheerfully assented i understand you to agree to the general principle of a little dinner  the smaller the better said the old man  well i say a little dinner because the idea of that seems to cover the case even if we vary the plan a little i had thought of a reception maybe that would include the lady contributors and artists and the wives and daughters of the other contributors that would give us the chance to ring in a lot of society correspondents and get the thing written up in firstclass shape bytheway cried fulkerson slapping himself on the leg why not have the dinner and the reception both  i dont understand said dryfoos  why have a select little dinner for ten or twenty choice spirits of the male persuasion and then about ten oclock throw open your palatial drawingrooms and admit the females to champagne salads and ices it is the very thing come  what do you think of it mr march asked dryfoos on whose social inexperience fulkersons words projected no very intelligible image and who perhaps hoped for some more light  its a beautiful vision said march and if it will take more time to realize it i think i approve i approve of anything that will delay mr fulkersons advertising orgie  then fulkerson pursued we could have the pleasure of miss christine and miss melas company and maybe mrs dryfoos would look in on us in the course of the evening theres no hurry as mr march suggests if we can give the thing this shape i will cheerfully adopt the idea of my honorable colleague  march laughed at his impudence but at heart he was ashamed of fulkerson for proposing to make use of dryfoos and his house in that way he fancied something appealing in the look that the old man turned on him and something indignant in conrads flush but probably this was only his fancy he reflected that neither of them could feel it as people of more worldly knowledge would and he consoled himself with the fact that fulkerson was really not such a charlatan as he seemed but it went through his mind that this was a strange end for all dryfooss moneymaking to come to and he philosophically accepted the fact of his own humble fortunes when he reflected how little his money could buy for such a man it was an honorable use that fulkerson was putting it to in every other week it might be far more creditably spent on such an enterprise than on horses or wines or women the usual resources of the brute rich and if it were to be lost it might better be lost that way than in stocks he kept a smiling face turned to dryfoos while these irreverent considerations occupied him and hardened his heart against father and son and their possible emotions  the old man rose to put an end to the interview he only repeated i guess those clams will keep till fall  but fulkerson was apparently satisfied with the progress he had made and when he joined march for the stroll homeward after office hours he was able to detach his mind from the subject as if content to leave it  this is about the best part of the year in new york he said in some of the areas the grass had sprouted and the tender young foliage had loosened itself froze the buds on a sidewalk tree here and there the soft air was full of spring and the delicate sky far aloof had the look it never wears at any other season it aint a time of year to complain much of anywhere but i dont want anything better than the month of may in new york farther south its too hot and ive been in boston in may when that east wind of yours made every nerve in my body get up and howl i reckon the weather has a good deal to do with the local temperament the reason a new york man takes life so easily with all his rush is that his climate dont worry him but a boston man must be rasped the whole while by the edge in his air that accounts for his sharpness and when hes lived through twentyfive or thirty boston mays he gets to thinking that providence has some particular use for him or he wouldnt have survived and that makes him conceited see  i see said march but i dont know how youre going to work that idea into an advertisement exactly  oh pahaw now march you dont think ive got that on the brain all the time  you were gradually leading up to every other week somehow  no sir i wasnt i was just thinking what a different creature a massachusetts man is from a virginian and yet i suppose theyre both as pure english stock as youll get anywhere in america marsh i think colonel woodburns paper is going to make a hit  youve got there when it knocks down the sale about onehalf i shall know its made a hit  im not afraid said fulkerson that thing is going to attract attention its well writtenyou can take the pomposity out of it here and there and its novel our people like a bold strike and its going to shake them up tremendously to have serfdom advocated on high moral grounds as the only solution of the labor problem you see in the first place he goes for their sympathies by the way he portrays the actual relations of capital and labor he shows how things have got to go from bad to worse and then he trots out his little old hobby and proves that if slavery had not been interfered with it would have perfected itself in the interest of humanity he makes a pretty strong plea for it  march threw back his head and laughed hes converted you i swear fulkerson if we had accepted and paid for an article advocating cannibalism as the only resource for getting rid of the superfluous poor youd begin to believe in it  fulkerson smiled in approval of the joke and only said i wish you could meet the colonel in the privacy of the domestic circle march youd like him hes a splendid old fellow regular type talk about spring  you ought to see the widows little back yard these days you know that glass gallery just beyond the diningroom those girls have got the potplants out of that and a lot more and theyve turned the edges of that back yard along the fence into a regular bower theyve got sweet peas planted and nasturtiums and we shall be in a blaze of glory about the beginning of june fun to see em work in the garden and the bird bossing the job in his cage under the cherrytree have to keep the middle of the yard for the clothesline but six days in the week its a lawn and i go over it with a mower myself march there aint anything like a home is there dear little cot of your own heigh i tell you march when i get to pushing that mower round and the colonel is smoking his cigar in the gallery and those girls are pottering over the flowers one of these soft evenings after dinner i feel like a human being yes i do i struck it rich when i concluded to take my meals at the widows for eight dollars a week i get good board refined society and all the advantages of a christian home bytheway youve never had much talk with miss woodburn have you march  not so much as with miss woodburns father  well he is rather apt to scoop the conversation i must draw his fire sometime when you and mrs march are around and get you a chance with miss woodburn  i should like that better i believe said march  well i shouldnt wonder if you did curious but miss woodburn isnt at all your idea of a southern girl shes got lots of go shes never idle a minute she keeps the old gentleman in firstclass shape and she dont believe a bit in the slavery solution of the labor problem says shes glad its gone and if its anything like the effects of it shes glad it went before her time no sir shes as full of snap as the liveliest kind of a northern girl none of that sunny southern languor you read about  i suppose the typical southerner like the typical anything else is pretty difficult to find said march but perhaps miss woodburn represents the new south the modern conditions must be producing a modern type  well thats what she and the colonel both say they say there aint anything left of that walter scott dignity and chivalry in the rising generation takes too much time you ought to see her sketch the oldschool highandmighty manners as they survive among some of the antiques in charlottesburg if that thing could be put upon the stage it would be a killing success makes the old gentleman laugh in spite of himself but hes as proud of her as punch anyway why dont you and mrs march come round oftener look here how would it do to have a little excursion somewhere after the spring fairly gets in its work  reporters present  no no nothing of that kind perfectly sincere and disinterested enjoyment  oh a few handbills to be scattered around buy every other week look out for the next number of every other week every other week at all the newsstands well ill talk it over with mrs march i suppose theres no great hurry  march told his wife of the idyllic mood in which he had left fulkerson at the widows door and she said he must be in love  why of course i wonder i didnt think of that but fulkerson is such an impartial admirer of the whole sex that you cant think of his liking one more than another i dont know that he showed any unjust partiality though in his talk of those girls as he called them and i always rather fancied that mrs mandelhes done so much for her you know and she is such a wellbalanced wellpreserved person and so ladylike and correct  fulkerson had the word for her academic shes everything that instruction and discipline can make of a woman but i shouldnt think they could make enough of her to be in love with  well i dont know the academic has its charm there are moods in which i could imagine myself in love with an academic person that regularity of line that reasoned strictness of contour that neatness of pose that slightly conventional but harmonious grouping of the emotions and moralsyou can see how it would have its charm the wedgwood in human nature i wonder where mrs mandel keeps her urn and her willow  i should think she might have use for them in that family poor thing said mrs march  ah that reminds me said her husband that we had another talk with the old gentleman this afternoon about fulkersons literary artistic and advertising orgie and its postponed till october  the later the better i should think said mrs march who did not really think about it at all but whom the date fixed for it caused to think of the intervening time we have got to consider what we will do about the summer before long basil  oh not yet not yet he pleaded with that mans willingness to abide in the present which is so trying to a woman its only the end of april  it will be the end of june before we know and these people wanting the boston house another year complicates it we cant spend the summer there as we planned  they oughtnt to have offered us an increased rent they have taken an advantage of us  i dont know that it matters said mrs march i had decided not to go there  had you this is a surprise  everything is a surprise to you basil when it happens  true i keep the world fresh that way  it wouldnt have been any change to go from one city to another for the summer we might as well have stayed in new york  yes i wish we had stayed said march idly humoring a conception of the accomplished fact mrs green would have let us have the gimcrackery very cheap for the summer months and we could have made all sorts of nice little excursions and trips off and been twice as well as if we had spent the summer away  nonsense you know we couldnt spend the summer in new york  i know i could  what stuff you couldnt manage  oh yes i could i could take my meals at fulkersons widows or at maronis with poor old lindau hes got to dining there again or i could keep house and he could dine with me here  there was a teasing look in marchs eyes and he broke into a laugh at the firmness with which his wife said i think if there is to be any housekeeping i will stay too and help to look after it i would try not intrude upon you and your guest  oh we should be only too glad to have you join us said march playing with fire  very well then i wish you would take him off to maronis the next time he comes to dine here cried his wife  the experiment of making marchs old friend free of his house had not given her all the pleasure that so kind a thing ought to have afforded so good a woman she received lindau at first with robust benevolence and the high resolve not to let any of his little peculiarities alienate her from a sense of his claim upon her sympathy and gratitude not only as a man who had been so generously fond of her husband in his youth but a hero who had suffered for her country her theory was that his mutilation must not be ignored but must be kept in mind as a monument of his sacrifice and she fortified bella with this conception so that the child bravely sat next his maimed arm at table and helped him to dishes he could not reach and cut up his meat for him as for mrs march herself the thought of his mutilation made her a little faint she was not without a bewildered resentment of its presence as a sort of oppression she did not like his drinking so much of marchs beer either it was no harm but it was somehow unworthy out of character with a hero of the war but what she really could not reconcile herself to was the violence of lindaus sentiments concerning the whole political and social fabric she did not feel sure that he should be allowed to say such things before the children who had been nurtured in the faith of bunker hill and appomattox as the beginning and the end of all possible progress in human rights as a woman she was naturally an aristocrat but as an american she was theoretically a democrat and it astounded it alarmed her to hear american democracy denounced as a shuffling evasion she had never cared much for the united states senate but she doubted if she ought to sit by when it was railed at as a rich mans club it shocked her to be told that the rich and poor were not equal before the law in a country where justice must be paid for at every step in fees and costs or where a poor man must go to war in his own person and a rich man might hire someone to go in his mrs march felt that this rebellious mind in lindau really somehow outlawed him from sympathy and retroactively undid his past suffering for the country she had always particularly valued that provision of the law because in forecasting all the possible mischances that might befall her own son she had been comforted by the thought that if there ever was another war and tom were drafted his father could buy him a substitute compared with such blasphemy as this lindaus declaration that there was not equality of opportunity in america and that fully onehalf the people were debarred their right to the pursuit of happiness by the hopeless conditions of their lives was flattering praise she could not listen to such things in silence though and it did not help matters when lindau met her arguments with facts and reasons which she felt she was merely not sufficiently instructed to combat and he was not quite gentlemanly to urge i am afraid for the effect on the children she said to her husband such perfectly distorted ideastom will be ruined by them  oh let tom find out where theyre false said march it will be good exercise for his faculties of research at any rate those things are getting said nowadays hell have to hear them sooner or later  had he better hear them at home demanded his wife  why you know as youre here to refute them isabel he teased perhaps its the best place but dont mind poor old lindau my dear he says himself that his parg is worse than his pidte you know  ah its too late now to mind him she sighed in a moment of rash good feeling or perhaps an exalted conception of duty she had herself proposed that lindau should come every week and read german with tom and it had become a question first how they could get him to take pay for it and then how they could get him to stop it mrs march never ceased to wonder at herself for having brought this about for she had warned her husband against making any engagement with lindau which would bring him regularly to the house the germans stuck so and were so unscrupulously dependent yet the deed being done she would not ignore the duty of hospitality and it was always she who made the old man stay to their sundayevening tea when he lingered near the hour reading schiller and heine and uhland with the boy in the clean shirt with which he observed the day lindaus linen was not to be trusted during the week she now concluded a season of mournful reflection by saying he will get you into trouble somehow basil  well i dont know how exactly i regard lindau as a political economist of an unusual type but i shall not let him array me against the constituted authorities short of that i think i am safe  well be careful basil be careful you know you are so rash  i suppose i may continue to pity him he is such a poor lonely old fellow are you really sorry hes come into our lives my dear  no no not that i feel as you do about it but i wish i felt easier about himsure that is that were not doing wrong to let him keep on talking so  i suspect we couldnt help it march returned lightly its one of what lindau calls his brincibles to say what he thinks     ii  the marches had no longer the gross appetite for novelty which urges youth to a surfeit of strange scenes experiences ideas and makes travel with all its annoyances and fatigues an inexhaustible delight but there is no doubt that the chief pleasure of their life in new york was from its quality of foreignness the flavor of olives which once tasted can never be forgotten the olives may not be of the first excellence they may be a little stale and small and poor to begin with but they are still olives and the fond palate craves them the sort which grew in new york on lower sixth avenue and in the region of jefferson market and on the soft exposures south of washington square were none the less acceptable because they were of the commonest italian variety  the marches spent a good deal of time and money in a grocery of that nationality where they found all the patriotic comestibles and potables and renewed their faded italian with the friendly family in charge italian table dhotes formed the adventure of the week on the day when mrs march let her domestics go out and went herself to dine abroad with her husband and children and they became adepts in the restaurants where they were served and which they varied almost from dinner to dinner the perfect decorum of these places and their immunity from offence in any emboldened the marches to experiment in spanish restaurants where red pepper and beans insisted in every dinner and where once they chanced upon a night of olla podrida with such appeals to marchs memory of a boyish ambition to taste the dish that he became poetic and then pensive over its cabbage and carrots peas and bacon for a rare combination of international motives they prized most the table dhote of a french lady who had taken a spanish husband in a second marriage and had a cuban negro for her cook with a crosseyed alsation for waiter and a slim young southamerican for cashier march held that some thing of the catholic character of these relations expressed itself in the generous and tolerant variety of the dinner which was singularly abundant for fifty cents without wine at one very neat french place he got a dinner at the same price with wine but it was not so abundant and march inquired in fruitless speculation why the table dhote of the italians a notoriously frugal and abstemious people should be usually more than you wanted at seventyfive cents and a dollar and that of the french rather less at half a dollar he could not see that the frequenters were greatly different at the different places they were mostly americans of subdued manners and conjecturably subdued fortunes with here and there a table full of foreigners there was no noise and not much smoking anywhere march liked going to that neat french place because there madame sat enthroned and high behind a comptoir at one side of the room and every body saluted her in going out it was there that a gentlelooking young couple used to dine in whom the marches became effectlessly interested because they thought they looked like that when they were young the wife had an aesthetic dress and defined her pretty head by wearing her backhair pulled up very tight under her bonnet the husband had dreamy eyes set wide apart under a pure forehead they are artists august i think march suggested to the waiter when he had vainly asked about them oh hartis cedenly august consented but heaven knows whether they were or what they were march never learned  this immunity from acquaintance this touchand go quality in their new york sojourn this almost loss of individuality at times after the intense identification of their boston life was a relief though mrs march had her misgivings and questioned whether it were not perhaps too relaxing to the moral fibre march refused to explore his conscience he allowed that it might be so but he said he liked now and then to feel his personality in that state of solution they went and sat a good deal in the softening evenings among the infants and dotards of latin extraction in washington square safe from all who ever knew them and enjoyed the advancing season which thickened the foliage of the trees and flattered out of sight the church wardens gothic of the university building the infants were sometimes cross and cried in their weary mothers or little sisters arms but they did not disturb the dotards who slept some with their heads fallen forward and some with their heads fallen back march arbitrarily distinguished those with the drooping faces as tipsy and ashamed to confront the public the small italian children raced up and down the asphalt paths playing american games of tag and hide andwhoop larger boys passed ball in training for potential championships the marches sat and mused or quarrelled fitfully about where they should spend the summer like sparrows he once said till the electric lights began to show distinctly among the leaves and they looked round and found the infants and dotards gone and the benches filled with lovers that was the signal for the marches to go home he said that the spectacle of so much courtship as the eye might take in there at a glance was not perhaps oppressive but the thought that at the same hour the same thing was going on all over the country wherever two young fools could get together was more than he could bear he did not deny that it was natural and in a measureuthorized but he declared that it was hackneyed and the fact that it must go on forever as long as the race lasted made him tired  at home generally they found that the children had not missed them and were perfectly safe it was one of the advantages of a flat that they could leave the children there whenever they liked without anxiety they liked better staying there than wandering about in the evening with their parents whose excursions seemed to them somewhat aimless and their pleasures insipid they studied or read or looked out of the window at the street sights and their mother always came back to them with a pang for their lonesomeness bella knew some little girls in the house but in a ceremonious way tom had formed no friendships among the boys at school such as he had left in boston as nearly as he could explain the new york fellows carried canes at an age when they would have had them broken for them by the other boys at boston and they were both sissyish and fast it was probably prejudice he never could say exactly what their demerits were and neither he nor bella was apparently so homesick as they pretended though they answered inquirers the one that new york was a hole and the other that it was horrid and that all they lived for was to get back to boston in the mean time they were thrown much upon each other for society which march said was well for both of them he did not mind their cultivating a little gloom and the sense of a common wrong it made them better comrades and it was providing them with amusing reminiscences for the future they really enjoyed bohemianizing in that harmless way though tom had his doubts of its respectability he was very punctilious about his sister and went round from his own school every day to fetch her home from hers the whole family went to the theatre a good deal and enjoyed themselves together in their desultory explorations of the city  they lived near greenwich village and march liked strolling through its quaintness toward the waterside on a sunday when a hereditary sabbatarianism kept his wife at home he made her observe that it even kept her at home from church he found a lingering quality of pure americanism in the region and he said the very bells called to worship in a nasal tone he liked the streets of small brick houses with here and there one painted red and the mortar lines picked out in white and with now and then a fine wooden portal of fluted pillars and a bowed transom the rear of the tenementhouses showed him the picturesqueness of clotheslines fluttering far aloft as in florence and the new apartmenthouses breaking the old skyline with their towering stories implied a life as alien to the american manner as anything in continental europe in fact foreign faces and foreign tongues prevailed in greenwich village but no longer german or even irish tongues or faces the eyes and earrings of italians twinkled in and out of the alleyways and basements and they seemed to abound even in the streets where long ranks of trucks drawn up in sunday rest along the curbstones suggested the presence of a race of sturdier strength than theirs march liked the swarthy strange visages he found nothing menacing for the future in them for wickedness he had to satisfy himself as he could with the sneering insolent cleanshaven mug of some rare american of the bhoy type now almost as extinct in new york as the dodo or the volunteer fireman when he had found his way among the ashbarrels and the groups of decently dressed churchgoers to the docks he experienced a sufficient excitement in the recent arrival of a french steamer whose sheds were thronged with hacks and expresswagons and in a tacit inquiry into the emotions of the passengers fresh from the cleanliness of paris and now driving up through the filth of those streets  some of the streets were filthier than others there was at least a choice there were boxes and barrels of kitchen offal on all the sidewalks but not everywhere manureheaps and in some places the stench was mixed with the more savory smell of cooking one sunday morning before the winter was quite gone the sight of the frozen refuse melting in heaps and particularly the loathsome edges of the rotting ice near the gutters with the strata of wastepaper and straw litter and eggshells and orange peel potatoskins and cigarstumps made him unhappy he gave a whimsical shrug for the squalor of the neighboring houses and said to himself rather than the boy who was with him its curious isnt it how fond the poor people are of these unpleasant thoroughfares you always find them living in the worst streets  the burden of all the wrong in the world comes on the poor said the boy every sort of fraud and swindling hurts them the worst the city wastes the money its paid to clean the streets with and the poor have to suffer for they cant afford to pay twice like the rich  march stopped short hallo tom is that your wisdom  its what mr lindau says answered the boy doggedly as if not pleased to have his ideas mocked at even if they were secondhand  and you didnt tell him that the poor lived in dirty streets because they liked them and were too lazy and worthless to have them cleaned  no i didnt  im surprised what do you think of lindau generally speaking tom  well sir i dont like the way he talks about some things i dont suppose this country is perfect but i think its about the best there is and it dont do any good to look at its drawbacks all the time  sound my son said march putting his hand on the boys shoulder and beginning to walk on well  well then he says that it isnt the public frauds only that the poor have to pay for but they have to pay for all the vices of the rich that when a speculator fails or a bank cashier defaults or a firm suspends or hard times come its the poor who have to give up necessaries where the rich give up luxuries  well well and then  well then i think the crank comes in in mr lindau he says theres no need of failures or frauds or hard times its ridiculous there always have been and there always will be but if you tell him that it seems to make him perfectly furious  march repeated the substance of this talk to his wife im glad to know that tom can see through such ravings he has lots of good common sense  it was the afternoon of the same sunday and they were sauntering up fifth avenue and admiring the wide old double houses at the lower end at one corner they got a distinct pleasure out of the gnarled elbows that a pollarded wistaria leaned upon the top of a garden wallfor its convenience in looking into the street he said the line of these comfortable dwellings once so fashionable was continually broken by the facades of shops and march professed himself vulgarized by a want of style in the people they met in their walk to twentythird street  take me somewhere to meet my fellowexclusives isabel he demanded i pine for the society of my peers  he hailed a passing omnibus and made his wife get on the roof with him think of our doing such a thing in boston she sighed with a little shiver of satisfaction in her immunity from recognition and comment  you wouldnt be afraid to do it in london or paris  no we should be strangers therejust as we are in new york i wonder how long one could be a stranger here  oh indefinitely in our way of living the place is really vast so much larger than it used to seem and so heterogeneous  when they got down very far uptown and began to walk back by madison avenue they found themselves in a different population from that they dwelt among not heterogeneous at all very homogeneous and almost purely american the only qualification was american hebrew such a welldressed wellsatisfied wellfed looking crowd poured down the broad sidewalks before the handsome stupid houses that march could easily pretend he had got among his fellowplutocrats at last still he expressed his doubts whether this sunday afternoon parade which seemed to be a thing of custom represented the best form among the young people of that region he wished he knew he blamed himself for becoming of a fastidious conjecture he could not deny the fashion and the richness and the indigeneity of the spectacle the promenaders looked newyorky they were the sort of people whom you would know for newyorkers elsewhereso well equipped and so perfectly kept at all points their silk hats shone and their boots their frocks had the right distension behind and their bonnets perfect poise and distinction  the marches talked of these and other facts of their appearance and curiously questioned whether this were the best that a great material civilization could come to it looked a little dull the mens faces were shrewd and alert and yet they looked dull the womens were pretty and knowing and yet dull it was probably the holiday expression of the vast prosperous commercial class with unlimited money and no ideals that money could not realize fashion and comfort were all that they desired to compass and the culture that furnishes showily that decorates and that tells the culture say of plays and operas rather than books  perhaps the observers did the promenaders injustice they might not have been as commonminded as they looked but march said i understand now why the poor people dont come up here and live in this clean handsome respectable quarter of the town they would be bored to death on the whole i think i should prefer mott street myself  in other walks the marches tried to find some of the streets they had wandered through the first day of their wedding journey in new york so long ago they could not make sure of them but once they ran down to the battery and easily made sure of that though not in its old aspect they recalled the hot morning when they sauntered over the trodden weed that covered the sickly grassplots there and sentimentalized the sweltering paupers who had crept out of the squalid tenements about for a breath of air after a sleepless night now the paupers were gone and where the old mansions that had fallen to their use once stood there towered aloft and abroad those heights and masses of manystoried brickwork for which architecture has yet no proper form and aesthetics no name the trees and shrubs all in their young spring green blew briskly over the guarded turf in the south wind that came up over the water and in the wellpaved alleys the ghosts of eighteenthcentury fashion might have met each other in their old haunts and exchanged stately congratulations upon its vastly bettered condition and perhaps puzzled a little over the colossal lady on bedloes island with her lifted torch and still more over the curving tracks and chaletstations of the elevated road it is an outlook of unrivalled beauty across the bay that smokes and flashes with the in numerable stacks and sails of commerce to the hills beyond where the moving forest of masts halts at the shore and roots itself in the groves of the many villaged uplands the marches paid the charming prospects a willing duty and rejoiced in it as generously as if it had been their own perhaps it was they decided he said people owned more things in common than they were apt to think and they drew the consolations of proprietorship from the excellent management of castle garden which they penetrated for a moments glimpse of the huge rotunda where the immigrants first set foot on our continent it warmed their hearts so easily moved to any cheap sympathy to see the friendly care the nation took of these humble guests they found it even pathetic to hear the proper authority calling out the names of such as had kin or acquaintance waiting there to meet them no one appeared troubled or anxious the officials had a conscientious civility the government seemed to manage their welcome as well as a private company or corporation could have done in fact it was after the simple strangers had left the government care that march feared their woes might begin and he would have liked the government to follow each of them to his home wherever he meant to fix it within our borders he made note of the looks of the licensed runners and touters waiting for the immigrants outside the government premises he intended to work them up into a dramatic effect in some sketch but they remained mere material in his memorandumbook together with some quaint old houses on the sixth avenue road which he had noticed on the way down on the way up these were superseded in his regard by some hiproof structures on the ninth avenue which he thought more dutchlooking the perspectives of the crossstreets toward the river were very lively with their turmoil of trucks and cars and carts and hacks and foot passengers ending in the chimneys and masts of shipping and final gleams of dancing water at a very noisy corner clangorous with some sort of ironworking he made his wife enjoy with him the quiet sarcasm of an inn that called itself the homelike hotel and he speculated at fantastic length on the gentle associations of one who should have passed his youth under its roof     iii  first and last the marches did a good deal of travel on the elevated roads which he said gave you such glimpses of material aspects in the city as some violent invasion of others lives might afford in human nature once when the impulse of adventure was very strong in them they went quite the length of the west side lines and saw the city pushing its way by irregular advances into the country some spaces probably held by the owners for that rise in value which the industry of others providentially gives to the land of the wise and good it left vacant comparatively far down the road and built up others at remoter points it was a world of lofty apartment houses beyond the park springing up in isolated blocks with stretches of invaded rusticity between and here and there an old countryseat standing dusty in its budding vines with the ground before it in rocky upheaval for city foundations but wherever it went or wherever it paused new york gave its peculiar stamp and the adventurers were amused to find one hundred and twentyfifth street inchoately like twentythird street and fourteenth street in its shops and shoppers the butchers shops and milliners shops on the avenue might as well have been at tenth as at one hundredth street  the adventurers were not often so adventurous they recognized that in their willingness to let their fancy range for them and to let speculation do the work of inquiry they were no longer young their point of view was singularly unchanged and their impressions of new york remained the same that they had been fifteen years before huge noisy ugly kindly it seemed to them now as it seemed then the main difference was that they saw it more now as a life and then they only regarded it as a spectacle and march could not release himself from a sense of complicity with it no matter what whimsical or alien or critical attitude he took a sense of the striving and the suffering deeply possessed him and this grew the more intense as he gained some knowledge of the forces at workforces of pity of destruction of perdition of salvation he wandered about on sunday not only through the streets but into this tabernacle and that as the spirit moved him and listened to those who dealt with christianity as a system of economics as well as a religion he could not get his wife to go with him she listened to his report of what he heard and trembled it all seemed fantastic and menacing she lamented the literary peace the intellectual refinement of the life they had left behind them and he owned it was very pretty but he said it was not lifeit was deathinlife she liked to hear him talk in that strain of virtuous selfdenunciation but she asked him which of your prophets are you going to follow and he answered allall and a fresh one every sunday and so they got their laugh out of it at last but with some sadness at heart and with a dim consciousness that they had got their laugh out of too many things in life  what really occupied and compassed his activities in spite of his strenuous reveries of work beyond it was his editorship on its social side it had not fulfilled all the expectations which fulkersons radiant sketch of its duties and relations had caused him to form of it most of the contributions came from a distance even the articles written in new york reached him through the post and so far from having his valuable time as they called it consumed in interviews with his collaborators he rarely saw any of them the boy on the stairs who was to fence him from importunate visitors led a life of luxurious disoccupation and whistled almost uninterruptedly when any one came march found himself embarrassed and a little anxious the visitors were usually young men terribly respectful but cherishing as he imagined ideals and opinions chasmally different from his and he felt in their presence something like an anachronism something like a fraud he tried to freshen up his sympathies on them to get at what they were really thinking and feeling and it was some time before he could understand that they were not really thinking and feeling anything of their own concerning their art but were necessarily in their quality of young inexperienced men mere acceptants of older mens thoughts and feelings whether they were tremendously conservative as some were or tremendously progressive as others were certain of them called themselves realists certain romanticists but none of them seemed to know what realism was or what romanticism they apparently supposed the difference a difference of material march had imagined himself taking home to lunch or dinner the aspirants for editorial favor whom he liked whether he liked their work or not but this was not an easy matter those who were at all interesting seemed to have engagements and preoccupations after two or three experiments with the bashfuller sortthose who had come up to the metropolis with manuscripts in their hands in the good old literary traditionhe wondered whether he was otherwise like them when he was young like them he could not flatter himself that he was not and yet he had a hope that the world had grown worse since his time which his wife encouraged  mrs march was not eager to pursue the hospitalities which she had at first imagined essential to the literary prosperity of every other week her family sufficed her she would willingly have seen no one out of it but the strangers at the weekly tabledhote dinner or the audiences at the theatres marchs devotion to his work made him reluctant to delegate it to any one and as the summer advanced and the question of where to go grew more vexed he showed a mans base willingness to shirk it for himself by not going anywhere he asked his wife why she did not go somewhere with the children and he joined her in a search for nonmalarial regions on the map when she consented to entertain this notion but when it came to the point she would not go he offered to go with her then and then she would not let him she said she knew he would be anxious about his work he protested that he could take it with him to any distance within a few hours but she would not be persuaded she would rather he stayed the effect would be better with mr fulkerson they could make excursions and they could all get off a week or two to the seashore near bostonthe only real seashorein august the excursions were practically confined to a single day at coney island and once they got as far as boston on the way to the seashore near boston that is mrs march and the children went an editorial exigency kept march at the last moment the boston streets seemed very queer and clean and empty to the children and the buildings little in the horsecars the boston faces seemed to arraign their mother with a downdrawn severity that made her feel very guilty she knew that this was merely the puritan mask the cast of a dead civilization which people of very amiable and tolerant minds were doomed to wear and she sighed to think that less than a year of the heterogeneous gayety of new york should have made her afraid of it the sky seemed cold and gray the east wind which she had always thought so delicious in summer cut her to the heart she took her children up to the south end and in the pretty square where they used to live they stood before their alienated home and looked up at its closeshuttered windows the tenants must have been away but mrs march had not the courage to ring and make sure though she had always promised herself that she would go all over the house when she came back and see how they had used it she could pretend a desire for something she wished to take away she knew she could not bear it now and the children did not seem eager she did not push on to the seaside it would be forlorn there without their father she was glad to go back to him in the immense friendly homelessness of new york and hold him answerable for the change in her heart or her mind which made its shapeless tumult a refuge and a consolation  she found that he had been giving the cook a holiday and dining about hither and thither with fulkerson once he had dined with him at the widows as they always called mrs leighton and then had spent the evening there and smoked with fulkerson and colonel woodburn on the gallery overlooking the back yard they were all spending the summer in new york the widow had got so good an offer for her house at st barnaby for the summer that she could not refuse it and the woodburns found new york a wateringplace of exemplary coolness after the burning augusts and septembers of charlottesburg  you can stand it well enough in our climate sir the colonel explained till you come to the september heat that sometimes runs well into october and then you begin to lose your temper sir its never quite so hot as it is in new york at times but its hot longer sir he alleged as if something of the sort were necessary the example of a famous southwestern editor who spent all his summers in a new york hotel as the most luxurious retreat on the continent consulting the weather forecasts and running off on torrid days to the mountains or the sea and then hurrying back at the promise of cooler weather the colonel had not found it necessary to do this yet and he had been reluctant to leave town where he was working up a branch of the inquiry which had so long occupied him in the libraries and studying the great problem of labor and poverty as it continually presented itself to him in the streets he said that he talked with all sorts of people whom he found monstrously civil if you took them in the right way and he went everywhere in the city without fear and apparently without danger march could not find out that he had ridden his hobby into the homes of want which he visited or had proposed their enslavement to the inmates as a short and simple solution of the great question of their lives he appeared to have contented himself with the collection of facts for the persuasion of the cultivated classes it seemed to march a confirmation of this impression that the colonel should address his deductions from these facts so unsparingly to him he listened with a respectful patience for which fulkerson afterward personally thanked him fulkerson said it was not often the colonel found such a good listener generally nobody listened but mrs leighton who thought his ideas were shocking but honored him for holding them so conscientiously fulkerson was glad that march as the literary department had treated the old gentleman so well because there was an open feud between him and the art department beaton was outrageously rude fulkerson must say though as for that the old colonel seemed quite able to take care of himself and gave beaton an unqualified contempt in return for his unmannerliness the worst of it was it distressed the old lady so she admired beaton as much as she respected the colonel and she admired beaton fulkerson thought rather more than miss leighton did he asked march if he had noticed them together march had noticed them but without any very definite impression except that beaton seemed to give the whole evening to the girl afterward he recollected that he had fancied her rather harassed by his devotion and it was this point that he wished to present for his wifes opinion  girls often put on that air she said its one of their ways of teasing but then if the man was really very much in love and she was only enough in love to be uncertain of herself she might very well seem troubled it would be a very serious question girls often dont know what to do in such a case  yes said march ive often been glad that i was not a girl on that account but i guess that on general principles beaton is not more in love than she is i couldnt imagine that young man being more in love with anybody unless it was himself he might be more in love with himself than any one else was  well he doesnt interest me a great deal and i cant say miss leighton does either i think she can take care of herself she has herself very well in hand  why so censorious pleaded march i dont defend her for having herself in hand but is it a fault  mrs march did not say she asked and how does mr fulkersons affair get on  his affair you really think it is one well ive fancied so myself and ive had an idea of some time asking him fulkerson strikes one as truly domesticable conjugable at heart but ive waited for him to speak  i should think so  yes hes never opened on the subject yet do you know i think fulkerson has his moments of delicacy  moments hes all delicacy in regard to women  well perhaps so there is nothing in them to rouse his advertising instincts     iv  the dryfoos family stayed in town till august then the father went west again to look after his interests and mrs mandel took the two girls to one of the great hotels in saratoga fulkerson said that he had never seen anything like saratoga for fashion and mrs mandel remembered that in her own young ladyhood this was so for at least some weeks of the year she had been too far withdrawn from fashion since her marriage to know whether it was still so or not in this as in so many other matters the dryfoos family helplessly relied upon fulkerson in spite of dryfooss angry determination that he should not run the family and in spite of christines doubt of his omniscience if he did not know everything she was aware that he knew more than herself she thought that they had a right to have him go with them to saratoga or at least go up and engage their rooms beforehand but fulkerson did not offer to do either and she did not quite see her way to commanding his services the young ladies took what mela called splendid dresses with them they sat in the park of tall slim trees which the hotels quadrangle enclosed and listened to the music in the morning or on the long piazza in the afternoon and looked at the driving in the street or in the vast parlors by night where all the other ladies were and they felt that they were of the best there but they knew nobody and mrs mandel was so particular that mela was prevented from continuing the acquaintance even of the few young men who danced with her at the saturdaynight hops they drove about but they went to places without knowing why except that the carriage man took them and they had all the privileges of a proud exclusivism without desiring them once a motherly matron seemed to perceive their isolation and made overtures to them but then desisted as if repelled by christines suspicion or by melas too instant and hilarious goodfellowship which expressed itself in hoarse laughter and in a flow of talk full of topical and syntactical freedom from time to time she offered to bet christine that if mr fulkerson was only there they would have a good time she wondered what they were all doing in new york where she wished herself she rallied her sister about beaton and asked her why she did not write and tell him to come up there  mela knew that christine had expected beaton to follow them some banter had passed between them to this effect he said he should take them in on his way home to syracuse christine would not have hesitated to write to him and remind him of his promise but she had learned to distrust her literature with beaton since he had laughed at the spelling in a scrap of writing which dropped out of her musicbook one night she believed that he would not have laughed if he had known it was hers but she felt that she could hide better the deficiencies which were not committed to paper she could manage with him in talking she was too ignorant of her ignorance to recognize the mistakes she made then through her own passion she perceived that she had some kind of fascination for him she was graceful and she thought it must be that she did not understand that there was a kind of beauty in her small irregular features that piqued and haunted his artistic sense and a look in her black eyes beyond her intelligence and intention once he sketched her as they sat together and flattered the portrait without getting what he wanted in it he said he must try her some time in color and he said things which when she made mela repeat them could only mean that he admired her more than anybody else he came fitfully but he came often and she rested content in a girls indefiniteness concerning the affair if her thought went beyond lovemaking to marriage she believed that she could have him if she wanted him her fathers money counted in this she divined that beaton was poor but that made no difference she would have enough for both the money would have counted as an irresistible attraction if there had been no other  the affair had gone on in spite of the sidelong looks of restless dislike with which dryfoos regarded it but now when beaton did not come to saratoga it necessarily dropped and christines content with it she bore the trial as long as she could she used pride and resentment against it but at last she could not bear it and with melas help she wrote a letter bantering beaton on his stay in new york and playfully boasting of saratoga it seemed to them both that it was a very bright letter and would be sure to bring him they would have had no scruple about sending it but for the doubt they had whether they had got some of the words right mela offered to bet christine anything she dared that they were right and she said send it anyway it was no difference if they were wrong but christine could not endure to think of that laugh of beatons and there remained only mrs mandel as authority on the spelling christine dreaded her authority on other points but mela said she knew she would not interfere and she undertook to get round her mrs mandel pronounced the spelling bad and the taste worse she forbade them to send the letter and mela failed to get round her though she threatened if mrs mandel would not tell her how to spell the wrong words that she would send the letter as it was then mrs mandel said that if mr beaton appeared in saratoga she would instantly take them both home when mela reported this result christine accused her of having mismanaged the whole business she quarrelled with her and they called each other names christine declared that she would not stay in saratoga and that if mrs mandel did not go back to new york with her she should go alone they returned the first week in september but by that time beaton had gone to see his people in syracuse  conrad dryfoos remained at home with his mother after his father went west he had already taken such a vacation as he had been willing to allow himself and had spent it on a charity farm near the city where the fathers with whom he worked among the poor on the east side in the winter had sent some of their wards for the summer it was not possible to keep his recreation a secret at the office and fulkerson found a pleasure in figuring the jolly time brother conrad must have teaching farm work among those paupers and potential reprobates he invented details of his experience among them and march could not always help joining in the laugh at conrads humorless helplessness under fulkersons burlesque denunciation of a summer outing spent in such dissipation  they had time for a great deal of joking at the office during the season of leisure which penetrates in august to the very heart of business and they all got on terms of greater intimacy if not greater friendliness than before fulkerson had not had so long to do with the advertising side of human nature without developing a vein of cynicism of no great depth perhaps but broad and underlying his whole point of view he made light of beatons solemnity as he made light of conrads humanity the art editor with abundant sarcasm had no more humor than the publisher and was an easy prey in the managers hands but when he had been led on by fulkersons flatteries to make some betrayal of egotism he brooded over it till he had thought how to revenge himself in elaborate insult for beatons talent fulkerson never lost his admiration but his joke was to encourage him to give himself airs of being the sole source of the magazines prosperity no bait of this sort was too obvious for beaton to swallow he could be caught with it as often as fulkerson chose though he was ordinarily suspicious as to the motives of people in saying things with march he got on no better than at first he seemed to be lying in wait for some encroachment of the literary department on the art department and he met it now and then with anticipative reprisal after these rebuffs the editor delivered him over to the manager who could turn beatons contrarymindedness to account by asking the reverse of what he really wanted done this was what fulkerson said the fact was that he did get on with beaton and march contented himself with musing upon the contradictions of a character at once so vain and so offensive so fickle and so sullen so conscious and so simple  after the first jarring contact with dryfoos the editor ceased to feel the disagreeable fact of the old mans mastery of the financial situation none of the chances which might have made it painful occurred the control of the whole affair remained in fulkersons hands before he went west again dryfoos had ceased to come about the office as if having once worn off the novelty of the sense of owning a literary periodical he was no longer interested in it  yet it was a relief somehow when he left town which he did not do without coming to take a formal leave of the editor at his office he seemed willing to leave march with a better impression than he had hitherto troubled himself to make he even said some civil things about the magazine as if its success pleased him and he spoke openly to march of his hope that his son would finally become interested in it to the exclusion of the hopes and purposes which divided them it seemed to march that in the old mans warped and toughened heart he perceived a disappointed love for his son greater than for his other children but this might have been fancy lindau came in with some copy while dryfoos was there and march introduced them when lindau went out march explained to dryfoos that he had lost his hand in the war and he told him something of lindaus career as he had known it dryfoos appeared greatly pleased that every other week was giving lindau work he said that he had helped to enlist a good many fellows for the war and had paid money to fill up the moffitt county quota under the later calls for troops he had never been an abolitionist but he had joined the antinebraska party in 55 and he had voted for fremont and for every republican president since then  at his own house march saw more of lindau than of any other contributor but the old man seemed to think that he must transact all his business with march at his place of business the transaction had some peculiarities which perhaps made this necessary lindau always expected to receive his money when he brought his copy as an acknowledgment of the immediate right of the laborer to his hire and he would not take it in a check because he did not approve of banks and regarded the whole system of banking as the capitalistic manipulation of the peoples money he would receive his pay only from marchs hand because he wished to be understood as working for him and honestly earning money honestly earned and sometimes march inwardly winced a little at letting the old man share the increase of capital won by such speculation as dryfooss but he shook off the feeling as the summer advanced and the artists and classes that employed lindau as a model left town one after another he gave largely of his increasing leisure to the people in the office of every other week it was pleasant for march to see the respect with which conrad dryfoos always used him for the sake of his hurt and his gray beard there was something delicate and fine in it and there was nothing unkindly on fulkersons part in the hostilities which usually passed between himself and lindau fulkerson bore himself reverently at times too but it was not in him to keep that up especially when lindau appeared with more beer aboard than as fulkerson said he could manage shipshape on these occasions fulkerson always tried to start him on the theme of the unduly rich he made himself the champion of monopolies and enjoyed the invectives which lindau heaped upon him as a slave of capital he said that it did him good  one day with the usual show of writhing under lindaus scorn he said well i understand that although you despise me now lindau  i tont desbise you the old man broke in his nostrils swelling and his eyes flaming with excitement i bity you  well it seems to come to the same thing in the end said fulkerson what i understand is that you pity me now as the slave of capital but you would pity me a great deal more if i was the master of it  how you mean  if i was rich  that would tebendt said lindau trying to control himself if you hat inheritedt your money you might pe innocent but if you hat mate it efery man that resbectedt himself would haf to ask how you mate it and if you hat mate moch he would know  hold on hold on now lindau aint that rather unamerican doctrine were all brought up aint we to honor the man that made his money and look downor try to look down sometimes its difficult on the fellow that his father left it to  the old man rose and struck his breast on amerigan he roared and as he went on his accent grew more and more uncertain what iss amerigan dere iss no ameriga any more you start here free and brafe and you glaim for efery man de right to life liperty and de bursuit of habbiness and where haf you entedt no man that vorks vith his handts among you has the liperty to bursue his habbiness he iss the slafe of some richer man some gompany some gorporation dat crindt him down to the least he can lif on and that rops him of the marchin of his earnings that he knight pe habby on oh you amerigans you haf cot it down goldt as you say you tont puy foters you puy lechislatures and goncressmen you puy gourts you puy gombetitors you pay infentors not to infent you atfertise and the gountingroom sees dat de etitorialroom toesnt tink  yes weve got a little arrangement of that sort with march here said fulkerson  oh i am sawry said the old man contritely i meant noting bersonal i tont tink we are all cuilty or gorrubt and efen among the rich there are goodt men but gabidalhis passion rose againwhere you find gabidal millions of money that a man hass cot togeder in fife ten twenty years you findt the smell of tears and ploodt dat iss what i say and you cot to loog oudt for yourself when you meet a rich man whether you meet an honest man  well said fulkerson i wish i was a subject of suspicion with you lindau bytheway he added i understand that you think capital was at the bottom of the veto of that pension of yours  what bension what fetothe old man flamed up again no bension of mine was efer fetoedt i renounce my bension begause i would sgorn to dake money from a gofernment that i tont peliefe in any more where you hear that story  well i dont know said fulkerson rather embarrassed its common talk  its a gommon lie then when the time gome dat dis iss a free gountry again then i dake a bension again for my woundts but i would sdarfe before i dake a bension now from a rebublic dat iss bought oap by monobolies and ron by drusts and gompines and railroadts andt oil gompanies  look out lindau said fulkerson you bite yourself mit dat dog some day but when the old man with a ferocious gesture of renunciation whirled out of the place he added i guess i went a little too far that time i touched him on a sore place i didnt mean to i heard some talk about his pension being vetoed from miss leighton he addressed these exculpations to marchs grave face and to the pitying deprecation in the eyes of conrad dryfoos whom lindaus roaring wrath had summoned to the door but ill make it all right with him the next time he comes i didnt know he was loaded or i wouldnt have monkeyed with him  lindau does himself injustice when he gets to talking in that way said march i hate to hear him hes as good an american as any of us and its only because he has too high an ideal of us  oh go on rub it inrub it in cried fulkerson clutching his hair in suffering which was not altogether burlesque how did i know he had renounced his bension why didnt you tell me  i didnt know it myself i only knew that he had none and i didnt ask for i had a notion that it might be a painful subject  fulkerson tried to turn it off lightly well hes a noble old fellow pity he drinks march would not smile and fulkerson broke out dog on it ill make it up to the old fool the next time he comes i dont like that dynamite talk of his but any man thats given his hand to the country has got mine in his grip for good why march you dont suppose i wanted to hurt his feelings do you  why of course not fulkerson  but they could not get away from a certain ruefulness for that time and in the evening fulkerson came round to marchs to say that he had got lindaus address from conrad and had looked him up at his lodgings  well there isnt so much bricabrac there quite as mrs green left you but ive made it all right with lindau as far as im concerned i told him i didnt know when i spoke that way and i honored him for sticking to his brinciples i dont believe in his brincibles and we wept on each others necksat least he did dogged if he didnt kiss me before i knew what he was up to he said i was his chenerous gong friendt and he begged my barton if he had said anything to wound me i tell you it was an affecting scene march and rats enough round in that old barracks where he lives to fit out a firstclass case of delirium tremens what does he stay there for hes not obliged to  lindaus reasons as march repeated them affected fulkerson as deliciously comical but after that he confined his pleasantries at the office to beaton and conrad dryfoos or as he said he spent the rest of the summer in keeping lindau smoothed up  it is doubtful if lindau altogether liked this as well perhaps he missed the occasions fulkerson used to give him of bursting out against the millionaires and he could not well go on denouncing as the slafe of gabidal a man who had behaved to him as fulkerson had done though fulkersons servile relations to capital had been in nowise changed by his nople gonduct  their relations continued to wear this irksome character of mutual forbearance and when dryfoos returned in october and fulkerson revived the question of that dinner in celebration of the success of every other week he carried his complaisance to an extreme that alarmed march for the consequences     v  you see fulkerson explained i find that the old man has got an idea of his own about that banquet and i guess theres some sense in it he wants to have a preliminary little dinner where we can talk the thing up firsthalf a dozen of us and he wants to give us the dinner at his house well thats no harm i dont believe the old man ever gave a dinner and hed like to show off a little theres a good deal of human nature in the old man after all he thought of you of course and colonel woodburn and beaton and me at the foot of the table and conrad and i suggested kendricks hes such a nice little chap and the old man himself brought up the idea of lindau he said you told him something about him and he asked why couldnt we have him too and i jumped at it  have lindau to dinner asked march  certainly why not father dryfoos has a notion of paying the old fellow a compliment for what he done for the country there wont be any trouble about it you can sit alongside of him and cut up his meat for him and help him to things  yes but it wont do fulkerson i dont believe lindau ever had on a dresscoat in his life and i dont believe his brincibles would let him wear one  well neither had dryfoos for the matter of that hes as highprincipled as old panelectric himself when it comes to a dresscoat said fulkerson were all going to go in business dress the old man stipulated for that  it isnt the dresscoat alone march resumed lindau and dryfoos wouldnt get on you know theyre opposite poles in everything you mustnt do it dryfoos will be sure to say something to outrage lindaus brincibles and therell be an explosion its all well enough for dryfoos to feel grateful to lindau and his wish to honor him does him credit but to have lindau to dinner isnt the way at the best the old fellow would be very unhappy in such a house he would have a bad conscience and i should be sorry to have him feel that hed been recreant to his brincibles theyre about all hes got and whatever we think of them were bound to respect his fidelity to them march warmed toward lindau in taking this view of him i should feel ashamed if i didnt protest against his being put in a false position after all hes my old friend and i shouldnt like to have him do himself injustice if he is a crank  of course said fulkerson with some trouble in his face i appreciate your feeling but there aint any danger he added buoyantly anyhow you spoke too late as the irishman said to the chicken when he swallowed him in a fresh egg ive asked lindau and hes accepted with blayzure thats what he says  march made no other comment than a shrug  youll see fulkerson continued it ll go off all right ill engage to make it and i wont hold anybody else responsible  in the course of his married life march had learned not to censure the irretrievable but this was just what his wife had not learned and she poured out so much astonishment at what fulkerson had done and so much disapproval that march began to palliate the situation a little  after all it isnt a question of life and death and if it were i dont see how its to be helped now  oh its not to be helped now but i am surprised at mr fulkerson  well fulkerson has his moments of being merely human too  mrs march would not deign a direct defence of her favorite well im glad there are not to be ladies  i dont know dryfoos thought of having ladies but it seems your infallible fulkerson overruled him their presence might have kept lindau and our host in bounds  it had become part of the marches conjugal joke for him to pretend that she could allow nothing wrong in fulkerson and he now laughed with a mocking air of having expected it when she said well then if mr fulkerson says he will see that it all comes out right i suppose you must trust his tact i wouldnt trust yours basil the first wrong step was taken when mr lindau was asked to help on the magazine  well it was your infallible fulkerson that took the step or at least suggested it im happy to say i had totally forgotten my early friend  mrs march was daunted and silenced for a moment then she said oh pshaw you know well enough he did it to please you  im very glad he didnt do it to please you isabel said her husband with affected seriousness though perhaps he did  he began to look at the humorous aspect of the affair which it certainly had and to comment on the singular incongruities which every other week was destined to involve at every moment of its career i wonder if im mistaken in supposing that no other periodical was ever like it perhaps all periodicals are like it but i dont believe theres another publication in new york that could bring together in honor of itself a fraternity and equality crank like poor old lindau and a belated sociological crank like woodburn and a truculent speculator like old dryfoos and a humanitarian dreamer like young dryfoos and a sentimentalist like me and a nondescript like beaton and a pure advertising essence like fulkerson and a society spirit like kendricks if we could only allow one another to talk uninterruptedly all the time the dinner would be the greatest success in the world and we should come home full of the highest mutual respect but i suspect we cant manage thateven your infallible fulkerson couldnt work itand im afraid that therell be some listening that ll spoil the pleasure of the time  march was so well pleased with this view of the case that he suggested the idea involved to fulkerson fulkerson was too good a fellow not to laugh at another mans joke but he laughed a little ruefully and he seemed worn with more than one kind of care in the interval that passed between the present time and the night of the dinner  dryfoos necessarily depended upon him for advice concerning the scope and nature of the dinner but he received the advice suspiciously and contested points of obvious propriety with pertinacious stupidity fulkerson said that when it came to the point he would rather have had the thing as he called it at delmonicos or some other restaurant but when he found that dryfooss pride was bound up in having it at his own house he gave way to him dryfoos also wanted his womancook to prepare the dinner but fulkerson persuaded him that this would not do he must have it from a caterer then dryfoos wanted his maids to wait at table but fulkerson convinced him that this would be incongruous at a mans dinner it was decided that the dinner should be sent in from frescobaldis and dryfoos went with fulkerson to discuss it with the caterer he insisted upon having everything explained to him and the reason for having it and not something else in its place and he treated fulkerson and frescobaldi as if they were in league to impose upon him there were moments when fulkerson saw the varnish of professional politeness cracking on the neapolitans volcanic surface and caught a glimpse of the lava fires of the cooks nature beneath he trembled for dryfoos who was walking roughshod over him in the security of an american who had known how to make his money and must know how to spend it but he got him safely away at last and gave frescobaldi a wink of sympathy for his shrug of exhaustion as they turned to leave him  it was at first a relief and then an anxiety with fulkerson that lindau did not come about after accepting the invitation to dinner until he appeared at dryfooss house prompt to the hour there was to be sure nothing to bring him but fulkerson was uneasily aware that dryfoos expected to meet him at the office and perhaps receive some verbal acknowledgment of the honor done him dryfoos he could see thought he was doing all his invited guests a favor and while he stood in a certain awe of them as people of much greater social experience than himself regarded them with a kind of contempt as people who were going to have a better dinner at his house than they could ever afford to have at their own he had finally not spared expense upon it after pushing frescobaldi to the point of eruption with his misgivings and suspicions at the first interview he had gone to him a second time alone and told him not to let the money stand between him and anything he would like to do in the absence of frescobaldis fellowconspirator he restored himself in the caterers esteem by adding whatever he suggested and fulkerson after trembling for the old mans niggardliness was now afraid of a fantastic profusion in the feast dryfoos had reduced the scale of the banquet as regarded the number of guests but a confusing remembrance of what fulkerson had wished to do remained with him in part and up to the day of the dinner he dropped in at frescobaldis and ordered more dishes and more of them he impressed the italian as an american original of a novel kind and when he asked fulkerson how dryfoos had made his money and learned that it was primarily in natural gas he made note of some of his eccentric tastes as peculiarities that were to be caressed in any future naturalgas millionaire who might fall into his hands he did not begrudge the time he had to give in explaining to dryfoos the relation of the different wines to the different dishes dryfoos was apt to substitute a costlier wine where he could for a cheaper one and he gave frescobaldi carte blanche for the decoration of the table with pieces of artistic confectionery among these the caterer designed one for a surprise to his patron and a delicate recognition of the source of his wealth which he found dryfoos very willing to talk about when he intimated that he knew what it was  dryfoos left it to fulkerson to invite the guests and he found ready acceptance of his politeness from kendricks who rightly regarded the dinner as a part of the every other week business and was too sweet and kindhearted anyway not to seem very glad to come march was a matter of course but in colonel woodburn fulkerson encountered a reluctance which embarrassed him the more because he was conscious of having for motives of his own rather strained a point in suggesting the colonel to dryfoos as a fit subject for invitation there had been only one of the colonels articles printed as yet and though it had made a sensation in its way and started the talk about that number still it did not fairly constitute him a member of the staff or even entitle him to recognition as a regular contributor fulkerson felt so sure of pleasing him with dryfooss message that he delivered it in full family council at the widows his daughter received it with all the enthusiasm that fulkerson had hoped for but the colonel said stiffly i have not the pleasure of knowing mr dryfoos miss woodburn appeared ready to fall upon him at this but controlled herself as if aware that filial authority had its limits and pressed her lips together without saying anything  yes i know fulkerson admitted but it isnt a usual case mr dryfoos dont go in much for the conventionalities i reckon he dont know much about em come to boil it down and he hopedhere fulkerson felt the necessity of inventing a littlethat you would excuse any want of ceremony its to be such an informal affair anyway were all going in business dress and there aint going to be any ladies hed have come himself to ask you but hes a kind of a bashful old fellow its all right colonel woodburn  i take it that it is sir said the colonel courteously but with unabated state coming from you but in these matters we have no right to burden our friends with our decisions  of course of course said fulkerson feeling that he had been delicately told to mind his own business  i understand the colonel went on the relation that mr dryfoos bears to the periodical in which you have done me the honor to print my papah but this is a question of passing the bounds of a purely business connection and of eating the salt of a man whom you do not definitely know to be a gentleman  mah goodness his daughter broke in if you bah your own salt with his money  it is supposed that i earn his money before i buy my salt with it returned her father severely and in these times when money is got in heaps through the natural decay of our nefarious commercialism it behooves a gentleman to be scrupulous that the hospitality offered him is not the profusion of a thief with his booty i dont say that mr dryfooss goodfortune is not honest i simply say that i know nothing about it and that i should prefer to know something before i sat down at his board  youre all right colonel said fulkerson and so is mr dryfoos i give you my word that there are no flies on his personal integrity if thats what you mean hes hard and hed push an advantage but i dont believe he would take an unfair one hes speculated and made money every time but i never heard of his wrecking a railroad or belonging to any swindling company or any grinding monopoly he does chance it in stocks but hes always played on the square if you call stocks gambling  may i think this over till morning asked the colonel  oh certainly certainly said fulkerson eagerly i dont know as theres any hurry  miss woodburn found a chance to murmur to him before he went hell come and ahm so much oblahged mr fulkerson ah jost know its all you doing and it will give papa a chance to toak to some new people and get away from us evahlastin women for once  i dont see why any one should want to do that said fulkerson with grateful gallantry but ill be dogged he said to march when he told him about this odd experience if i ever expected to find colonel woodburn on old lindaus ground he did come round handsomely this morning at breakfast and apologized for taking time to think the invitation over before he accepted you understand he says that if it had been to the table of some friend not so prosperous as mr dryfoosyour friend mr march for instanceit would have been sufficient to know that he was your friend but in these days it is a duty that a gentleman owes himself to consider whether he wishes to know a rich man or not the chances of making money disreputably are so great that the chances are against a man who has made money if hes made a great deal of it  march listened with a face of ironical insinuation that was very good and he seems to have had a good deal of confidence in your patience and in your sense of his importance to the occasion  no no fulkerson protested theres none of that kind of thing about the colonel i told him to take time to think it over hes the simplesthearted old fellow in the world  i should say so after all he didnt give any reason he had for accepting but perhaps the young lady had the reason  pshaw march said fulkerson     vi  so far as the dryfoos family was concerned the dinner might as well have been given at frescobaldis rooms none of the ladies appeared mrs dryfoos was glad to escape to her own chamber where she sat before an autumnal fire shaking her head and talking to herself at times with the foreboding of evil which old women like her make part of their religion the girls stood just out of sight at the head of the stairs and disputed which guest it was at each arrival mrs mandel had gone to her room to write letters after beseeching them not to stand there when kendricks came christine gave mela a little pinch equivalent to a little mocking shriek for on the ground of his long talk with mela at mrs horns in the absence of any other admirer they based a superstition of his interest in her when beaton came mela returned the pinch but awkwardly so that it hurt and then christine involuntarily struck her  frescobaldis men were in possession everywhere they had turned the cook out of her kitchen and the waitress out of her pantry the reluctant irishman at the door was supplemented by a vivid italian who spoke french with the guests and said bien monsieur and toute suite and merci to all as he took their hats and coats and effused a hospitality that needed no language but the gleam of his eyes and teeth and the play of his eloquent hands from his professional dresscoat lustrous with the grease spotted on it at former dinners and parties they passed to the frocks of the elder and younger dryfoos in the drawingroom which assumed informality for the affair but did not put their wearers wholly at their ease the fathers coat was of black broadcloth and he wore it unbuttoned the skirts were long and the sleeves came down to his knuckles he shook hands with his guests and the same dryness seemed to be in his palm and throat as he huskily asked each to take a chair conrads coat was of modern texture and cut and was buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience within its lapels he met march with his entreating smile and he seemed no more capable of coping with the situation than his father they both waited for fulkerson who went about and did his best to keep life in the party during the halfhour that passed before they sat down at dinner beaton stood gloomily aloof as if waiting to be approached on the right basis before yielding an inch of his ground colonel woodburn awaiting the moment when he could sally out on his hobby kept himself intrenched within the dignity of a gentleman and examined askance the figure of old lindau as he stared about the room with his fine head up and his empty sleeve dangling over his wrist march felt obliged to him for wearing a new coat in the midst of that hostile luxury and he was glad to see dryfoos make up to him and begin to talk with him as if he wished to show him particular respect though it might have been because he was less afraid of him than of the others he heard lindau saying boat the name is choarman and dryfoos beginning to explain his pennsylvania dutch origin and he suffered himself with a sigh of relief to fall into talk with kendricks who was always pleasant he was willing to talk about something besides himself and had no opinions that he was not ready to hold in abeyance for the time being out of kindness to others in that group of impassioned individualities march felt him a refuge and comfortwith his harmless dilettante intention of some day writing a novel and his belief that he was meantime collecting material for it  fulkerson while breaking the ice for the whole company was mainly engaged in keeping colonel woodburn thawed out he took kendricks away from march and presented him to the colonel as a person who like himself was looking into social conditions he put one hand on kendrickss shoulder and one on the colonels and made some flattering joke apparently at the expense of the young fellow and then left them march heard kendricks protest in vain and the colonel say gravely i do not wonder sir that these things interest you they constitute a problem which society must solve or which will dissolve society and he knew from that formula which the colonel had once used with him that he was laying out a road for the exhibition of the hobbys paces later  fulkerson came back to march who had turned toward conrad dryfoos and said if we dont get this thing going pretty soon it ll be the death of me and just then frescobaldis butler came in and announced to dryfoos that dinner was served the old man looked toward fulkerson with a troubled glance as if he did not know what to do he made a gesture to touch lindaus elbow fulkerson called out heres colonel woodburn mr dryfoos as if dryfoos were looking for him and he set the example of what he was to do by taking lindaus arm himself mr lindau is going to sit at my end of the table alongside of march stand not upon the order of your going gentlemen but fall in at once he contrived to get dryfoos and the colonel before him and he let march follow with kendricks conrad came last with beaton who had been turning over the music at the piano and chafing inwardly at the whole affair at the table colonel woodburn was placed on dryfooss right and march on his left march sat on fulkersons right with lindau next him and the young men occupied the other seats  put you next to march mr lindau said fulkerson so you can begin to put apollinaris in his champagneglass at the right moment you know his little weakness of old sorry to say its grown on him  march laughed with kindly acquiescence in fulkersons wish to start the gayety and lindau patted him on the shoulder i know hiss veakness if he liges a class of vine it iss begause his loaf ingludes efen hiss enemy as shakespeare galled it  ah but shakespeare couldnt have been thinking of champagne said kendricks  i suppose sir colonel woodburn interposed with lofty courtesy champagne could hardly have been known in his day  i suppose not colonel returned the younger man deferentially he seemed to think that sack and sugar might be a fault but he didnt mention champagne  perhaps he felt there was no question about that suggested beaton who then felt that he had not done himself justice in the sally  i wonder just when champagne did come in said march  i know when it ought to come in said fulkerson before the soup  they all laughed and gave themselves the air of drinking champagne out of tumblers every day as men like to do dryfoos listened uneasily he did not quite understand the allusions though he knew what shakespeare was well enough conrads face expressed a gentle deprecation of joking on such a subject but he said nothing  the talk ran on briskly through the dinner the young men tossed the ball back and forth they made some wild shots but they kept it going and they laughed when they were hit the wine loosed colonel woodburns tongue he became very companionable with the young fellows with the feeling that a literary dinner ought to have a didactic scope he praised scott and addison as the only authors fit to form the minds of gentlemen  kendricks agreed with him but wished to add the name of flaubert as a master of style style you know he added is the man  very true sir you are quite right sir the colonel assented he wondered who flaubert was  beaton praised baudelaire and maupassant he said these were the masters he recited some lurid verses from baudelaire lindau pronounced them a disgrace to human nature and gave a passage from victor hugo on louis napoleon with his heavy german accent and then he quoted schiller ach boat that is a peaudifool not zo he demanded of march  yes beautiful but of course you know i think theres nobody like heine  lindau threw back his great old head and laughed showing a want of teeth under his mustache he put his hand on marchs back this poyhe was a poy denwars so gracy to pekin reading heine that he gommence with the tictionary bevore he knows any grammar and ve bick it out vort by vort togeder  he was a pretty cay poy in those days heigh lindau asked fulkerson burlesquing the old mans accent with an impudent wink that made lindau himself laugh but in the dark ages i mean there in indianapolis just how long ago did you old codgers meet there anyway fulkerson saw the restiveness in dryfooss eye at the purely literary course the talk had taken he had intended it to lead up that way to business to every other week but he saw that it was leaving dryfoos too far out and he wished to get it on the personal ground where everybody is at home  ledt me zee mused lindau wass it in fiftynine or zixty passil idt wass a year or dwo pefore the war proke oudt anyway  those were exciting times said dryfoos making his first entry into the general talk i went down to indianapolis with the first company from our place and i saw the redshirts pouring in everywhere they had a song    oh never mind the weather but git over double trouble    for were bound for the land of canaan  the fellows locked arms and went singin it up and down four or five abreast in the moonlight crowded everybody else off the sidewalk  i remember i remember said lindau nodding his head slowly up and down a coodt many off them nefer gome pack from that landt of ganaan mr dryfoos  youre right mr lindau but i reckon it was worth itthe country weve got now here young man he caught the arm of the waiter who was going round with the champagne bottle fill up mr lindaus glass there i want to drink the health of those old times with him heres to your empty sleeve mr lindau god bless it no offence to you colonel woodburn said dryfoos turning to him before he drank  not at all sir not at all said the colonel i will drink with you if you will permit me  well all drinkstanding cried fulkerson help march to get up somebody fill high the bowl with samian apollinaris for coonrod now then hurrah for lindau  they cheered and hammered on the table with the butts of their knifehandles lindau remained seated the tears came into his eyes he said i thank you chendlemen and hiccoughed  id a went into the war myself said dryfoos but i was raisin a family of young children and i didnt see how i could leave my farm but i helped to fill up the quota at every call and when the volunteering stopped i went round with the subscription paper myself and we offered as good bounties as any in the state my substitute was killed in one of the last skirmishesin fact after lees surrenderand ive took care of his family more or less ever since  bytheway march said fulkerson what sort of an idea would it be to have a good war storymight be a serialin the magazine the war has never fully panned out in fiction yet it was used a good deal just after it was over and then it was dropped i think its time to take it up again i believe it would be a card  it was running in marchs mind that dryfoos had an old rankling shame in his heart for not having gone into the war and that he had often made that explanation of his course without having ever been satisfied with it he felt sorry for him the fact seemed pathetic it suggested a dormant nobleness in the man  beaton was saying to fulkerson you might get a series of sketches by substitutes the substitutes havent been much heard from in the war literature how would the autobiography of a substitute do you might follow him up to the moment he was killed in the other mans place and inquire whether he had any right to the feelings of a hero when he was only hired in the place of one might call it the career of a deputy hero  i fancy said march that there was a great deal of mixed motive in the men who went into the war as well as in those who kept out of it we canonized all that died or suffered in it but some of them must have been selfseeking and lowminded like men in other vocations he found himself saying this in dryfooss behalf the old man looked at him gratefully at first he thought and then suspiciously  lindau turned his head toward him and said you are righdt passil you are righdt i haf zeen on the fieldt of pattle the voarst eggsipitions of human pasenesschelousy fanity ecodistic bridte i haf zeen men in the face off death itself gofferned by motifes as low asas pusiness motifes  well said fulkerson it would be a grand thing for every other week if we could get some of those ideas worked up into a series it would make a lot of talk  colonel woodburn ignored him in saying i think major lindau  high brifate prefet gorporal the old man interrupted in rejection of the title  hendricks laughed and said with a glance of appreciation at lindau brevet corporal is good  colonel woodburn frowned a little and passed over the joke i think mr lindau is right such exhibitions were common to both sides though if you gentlemen will pardon me for saying so i think they were less frequent on ours we were fighting more immediately for existence we were fewer than you were and we knew it we felt more intensely that if each were not for all then none was for any  the colonels words made their impression dryfoos said with authority that is so  colonel woodburn fulkerson called out if youll work up those ideas into a short papersay three thousand wordsill engage to make march take it  the colonel went on without replying but mr lindau is right in characterizing some of the motives that led men to the cannons mouth as no higher than business motives and his comparison is the most forcible that he could have used i was very much struck by it  the hobby was out the colonel was in the saddle with so firm a seat that no effort sufficed to dislodge him the dinner went on from course to course with barbaric profusion and from time to time fulkerson tried to bring the talk back to every other week but perhaps because that was only the ostensible and not the real object of the dinner which was to bring a number of men together under dryfooss roof and make them the witnesses of his splendor make them feel the power of his wealth fulkersons attempts failed the colonel showed how commercialism was the poison at the heart of our national life how we began as a simple agricultural people who had fled to these shores with the instinct divinely implanted of building a state such as the sun never shone upon before how we had conquered the wilderness and the savage how we had flung off in our struggle with the mothercountry the trammels of tradition and precedent and had settled down a free nation to the practice of the arts of peace how the spirit of commercialism had stolen insidiously upon us and the infernal impulse of competition had embroiled us in a perpetual warfare of interests developing the worst passions of our nature and teaching us to trick and betray and destroy one another in the strife for money till now that impulse had exhausted itself and we found competition gone and the whole economic problem in the hands of monopoliesthe standard oil company the sugar trust the rubber trust and what not and now what was the next thing affairs could not remain as they were it was impossible and what was the next thing  the company listened for the main part silently dryfoos tried to grasp the idea of commercialism as the colonel seemed to hold it he conceived of it as something like the drygoods business on a vast scale and he knew he had never been in that he did not like to hear competition called infernal he had always supposed it was something sacred but he approved of what colonel woodburn said of the standard oil company it was all true the standard oil has squeezed dryfoos once and made him sell it a lot of oilwells by putting down the price of oil so low in that region that he lost money on every barrel he pumped  all the rest listened silently except lindau at every point the colonel made against the present condition of things he said more and more fiercely you are righdt you are righdt his eyes glowed his hand played with his knifehilt when the colonel demanded and what is the next thing he threw himself forward and repeated yes sir what is the next thing  natural gas by thunder shouted fulkerson  one of the waiters had profited by lindaus posture to lean over him and put down in the middle of the table a structure in white sugar it expressed frescobaldis conception of a derrick and a touch of nature had been added in the flame of brandy which burned luridly up from a small pit in the centre of the base and represented the gas in combustion as it issued from the ground fulkerson burst into a roar of laughter with the words that recognized frescobaldis personal tribute to dryfoos everybody rose and peered over at the thing while he explained the work of sinking a gaswell as he had already explained it to frescobaldi in the midst of his lecture he caught sight of the caterer himself where he stood in the pantry doorway smiling with an artists anxiety for the effect of his masterpiece  come in come in frescobaldi we want to congratulate you fulkerson called to him here gentlemen heres frescobaldis health  they all drank and frescobaldi smiling brilliantly and rubbing his hands as he bowed right and left permitted himself to say to dryfoos you are please no you like  firstrate firstrate said the old man but when the italian had bowed himself out and his guests had sunk into their seats again he said dryly to fulkerson i reckon they didnt have to torpedo that well or the derrick wouldnt look quite so nice and clean  yes fulkerson answered and that aint quite the stylethat little wigglywaggly blue flamethat the gas acts when you touch off a good vein of it this might do for weak gas and he went on to explain  they call it weak gas when they tap it two or three hundred feet down and anybody can sink a well in his back yard and get enough gas to light and heat his house i remember one fellow that had it blazing up from a pipe through a flowerbed just like a jet of water from a fountain my my my you felyou gentlemenought to go out and see that country all of you wish we could torpedo this well mr dryfoos and let em see how it works mind that one you torpedoed for me you know when they sink a well he went on to the company they cant always most generally sometimes tell whether theyre goin to get gas or oil or salt water why when they first began to bore for salt water out on the kanawha back about the beginning of the century they used to get gas now and then and then they considered it a failure they called a gaswell a blower and give it up in disgust the time wasnt ripe for gas yet now they bore away sometimes till they get halfway to china and dont seem to strike anything worth speaking of then they put a dynamite torpedo down in the well and explode it they have a little bar of iron that they call a godevil and they just drop it down on the business end of the torpedo and then stand from under if you please you hear a noise and in about half a minute you begin to see one and it begins to rain oil and mud and salt water and rocks and pitchforks and adoptive citizens and when it clears up the derricks paintedgot a coat on that ll wear in any climate thats what our honored host meant generally get some visiting lady when theres one round to drop the godevil but that day we had to put up with conrad here they offered to let me drop it but i declined i told em i hadnt much practice with godevils in the newspaper syndicate business and i wasnt very well myself anyway astonishing fulkerson continued with the air of relieving his explanation by an anecdote how reckless they get using dynamite when theyre torpedoing wells we stopped at one place where a fellow was handling the cartridges pretty freely and mr dryfoos happened to caution him a little and that ass came up with one of em in his hand and began to pound it on the buggywheel to show us how safe it was i turned green i was so scared but mr dryfoos kept his color and kind of coaxed the fellow till he quit you could see he was the fool kind that if you tried to stop him hed keep on hammering that cartridge just to show that it wouldnt explode till he blew you into kingdom come when we got him to go away mr dryfoos drove up to his foreman pay sheney off and discharge him on the spot says he hes too safe a man to have round he knows too much about dynamite i never saw anybody so cool  dryfoos modestly dropped his head under fulkersons flattery and without lifting it turned his eyes toward colonel woodburn i had all sorts of men to deal with in developing my property out there but i had very little trouble with them generally speaking  ah ah you foundt the laboringman reasonabledractabletocile lindau put in  yes generally speaking dryfoos answered they mostly knew which side of their bread was buttered i did have one little difficulty at one time it happened to be when mr fulkerson was out there some of the men tried to form a union  no no cried fulkerson let me tell that i know you wouldnt do yourself justice mr dryfoos and i want em to know how a strike can be managed if you take it in time you see some of those fellows got a notion that there ought to be a union among the workingmen to keep up wages and dictate to the employers and mr dryfooss foreman was the ringleader in the business they understood pretty well that as soon as he found it out that foreman would walk the plank and so they watched out till they thought they had mr dryfoos just where they wanted himeverything on the keen jump and every man worth his weight in diamondsand then they came to him andtold him to sign a promise to keep that foreman to the end of the season or till he was through with the work on the dryfoos and hendry addition under penalty of having them all knock off mr dryfoos smelled a mouse but he couldnt tell where the mouse was he saw that they did have him and he signed of course there wasnt anything really against the fellow anyway he was a firstrate man and he did his duty every time only hed got some of those ideas into his head and they turned it mr dryfoos signed and then he laid low  march saw lindau listening with a mounting intensity and heard him murmur in german shameful shameful  fulkerson went on well it wasnt long before they began to show their hand but mr dryfoos kept dark he agreed to everything there never was such an obliging capitalist before there wasnt a thing they asked of him that he didnt do with the greatest of pleasure and all went merry as a marriagebell till one morning a whole gang of fresh men marched into the dryfoos and hendry addition under the escort of a dozen pinkertons with repeating rifles at halfcock and about fifty fellows found themselves out of a job you never saw such a mad set  pretty neat said kendricks who looked at the affair purely from an aesthetic point of view such a coup as that would tell tremendously in a play  that was vile treason said lindau in german to march hes an infamous traitor i cannot stay here i must go  he struggled to rise while march held him by the coat and implored him under his voice for heavens sake dont lindau you owe it to yourself not to make a scene if you come here something in it all affected him comically he could not help laughing  the others were discussing the matter and seemed not to have noticed lindau who controlled himself and sighed you are right i must have patience  beaton was saying to dryfoos pity your pinkertons couldnt have given them a few shots before they left  no that wasnt necessary said dryfoos i succeeded in breaking up the union i entered into an agreement with other parties not to employ any man who would not swear that he was nonunion if they had attempted violence of course they could have been shot but there was no fear of that those fellows can always be depended upon to cut one anothers throats in the long run  but sometimes said colonel woodburn who had been watching throughout for a chance to mount his hobby again they make a good deal of trouble first how was it in the great railroad strike of 77  well i guess there was a little trouble that time colonel said fulkerson but the men that undertake to override the laws and paralyze the industries of a country like this generally get left in the end  yes sir generally and up to a certain point always but its the exceptional that is apt to happen as well as the unexpected and a little reflection will convince any gentleman here that there is always a danger of the exceptional in your system the fact is those fellows have the game in their own hands already a strike of the whole body of the brotherhood of engineers alone would starve out the entire atlantic seaboard in a week labor insurrection could make head at a dozen given points and your government couldnt move a man over the roads without the help of the engineers  that is so said kendrick struck by the dramatic character of the conjecture he imagined a fiction dealing with the situation as something already accomplished  why dont some fellow do the battle of dorking act with that thing said fulkerson it would be a card  exactly what i was thinking mr fulkerson said kendricks  fulkerson laughed telepathyclear case of mind transference better see march here about it id like to have it in every other week it would make talk  perhaps it might set your people to thinking as well as talking said the colonel  well sir said dryfoos setting his lips so tightly together that his imperial stuck straight outward if i had my way there wouldnt be any brotherhood of engineers nor any other kind of labor union in the whole country  what shouted lindau you would sobbress the unionss of the voarkingmen  yes i would  and what would you do with the unionss of the gabidaliststhe drostsand gompines and boolss would you dake the righdt from one and gif it to the odder  yes sir i would said dryfoos with a wicked look at him  lindau was about to roar back at him with some furious protest but march put his hand on his shoulder imploringly and lindau turned to him to say in german but it is infamousinfamous what kind of man is this who is he he has the heart of a tyrant  colonel woodburn cut in you couldnt do that mr dryfoos under your system and if you attempted it with your conspiracy laws and that kind of thing it might bring the climax sooner than you expected your commercialized society has built its house on the sands it will have to go but i should be sorry if it went before its time  you are righdt sir said lindau it would be a bity i hobe it will last till it feelss its rottenness like herodt boat when its hour gomes when it trope to bieces with the veight off its own gorrubtionwhat then  its not to be supposed that a system of things like this can drop to pieces of its own accord like the old republic of venice said the colonel but when the last vestige of commercial society is gone then we can begin to build anew and we shall build upon the central idea not of the false liberty you now worship but of responsibility responsibility the enlightened the moneyed the cultivated class shall be responsible to the central authorityemperor duke president the name does not matterfor the national expense and the national defence and it shall be responsible to the workingclasses of all kinds for homes and lands and implements and the opportunity to labor at all times  the workingclasses shall be responsible to the leisure class for the support of its dignity in peace and shall be subject to its command in war the rich shall warrant the poor against planless production and the ruin that now follows against danger from without and famine from within and the poor  no no no shouted lindau the state shall do thatthe whole beople the men who voark shall have and shall eat and the men that will not voark they shall sdarfe but no man need sdarfe he will go to the state and the state will see that he haf voark and that he haf foodt all the roadts and mills and mines and landts shall be the beoples and be ron by the beople for the beople there shall be no rich and no boor and there shall not be war any more for what bower wouldt dare to addack a beople bound togeder in a broderhood like that  lion and lamb act said fulkerson not well knowing after so much champagne what words he was using  no one noticed him and colonel woodburn said coldly to lindau you are talking paternalism sir  and you are dalking feutalism retorted the old man  the colonel did not reply a silence ensued which no one broke till fulkerson said well now look here if either one of these millenniums was brought about by force of arms or otherwise what would become of every other week who would want march for an editor how would beaton sell his pictures who would print mr kendrickss little society verses and short stories what would become of conrad and his good works those named grinned in support of fulkersons diversion but lindau and the colonel did not speak dryfoos looked down at his plate frowning  a waiter came round with cigars and fulkerson took one ah he said as he bit off the end and leaned over to the emblematic masterpiece where the brandy was still feebly flickering i wonder if theres enough natural gas left to light my cigar his effort put the flame out and knocked the derrick over it broke in fragments on the table fulkerson cackled over the ruin i wonder if all moffitt will look that way after labor and capital have fought it out together i hope this aint ominous of anything personal dryfoos  ill take the risk of it said the old man harshly  he rose mechanically and fulkerson said to frescobaldis man you can bring us the coffee in the library  the talk did not recover itself there landau would not sit down he refused coffee and dismissed himself with a haughty bow to the company colonel woodburn shook hands elaborately all round when he had smoked his cigar the others followed him it seemed to march that his own goodnight from dryfoos was dry and cold     vii  march met fulkerson on the steps of the office next morning when he arrived rather later than his wont fulkerson did not show any of the signs of suffering from the last nights pleasure which painted themselves in marchs face he flirted his hand gayly in the air and said hows your poor head and broke into a knowing laugh you dont seem to have got up with the lark this morning the old gentleman is in there with conrad as bright as a biscuit hes beat you down well we did have a good time didnt we and old lindau and the colonel didnt they have a good time i dont suppose they ever had a chance before to give their theories quite so much air oh my how they did ride over us im just going down to see beaton about the cover of the christmas number i think we ought to try it in three or four colors if we are going to observe the day at all he was off before march could pull himself together to ask what dryfoos wanted at the office at that hour of the morning he always came in the afternoon on his way uptown  the fact of his presence renewed the sinister misgivings with which march had parted from him the night before but fulkersons cheerfulness seemed to gainsay them afterward march did not know whether to attribute this mood to the slipperiness that he was aware of at times in fulkerson or to a cynical amusement he might have felt at leaving him alone to the old man who mounted to his room shortly after march had reached it  a sort of dumb anger showed itself in his face his jaw was set so firmly that he did not seem able at once to open it he asked without the ceremonies of greeting what does that onearmed dutchman do on this book  what does he do march echoed as people are apt to do with a question that is mandatory and offensive  yes sir what does he do does he write for it  i suppose you mean lindau said march he saw no reason for refusing to answer dryfooss demand and he decided to ignore its terms no he doesnt write for it in the usual way he translates for it he examines the foreign magazines and draws my attention to anything he thinks of interest but i told you about this before  i know what you told me well enough and i know what he is he is a redmouthed labor agitator hes one of those foreigners that come here from places where theyve never had a decent meals victuals in their lives and as soon as they get their stomachs full they begin to make trouble between our people and their hands theres where the strikes come from and the unions and the secret societies they come here and break our sabbath and teach their atheism they ought to be hung let em go back if they dont like it over here they want to ruin the country  march could not help smiling a little at the words which came fast enough now in the hoarse staccato of dryfooss passion i dont know whom you mean by they generally speaking but i had the impression that poor old lindau had once done his best to save the country i dont always like his way of talking but i know that he is one of the truest and kindest souls in the world and he is no more an atheist than i am he is my friend and i cant allow him to be misunderstood  i dont care what he is dryfoos broke out i wont have him round he cant have any more work from this office i want you to stop it i want you to turn him off  march was standing at his desk as he had risen to receive dryfoos when he entered he now sat down and began to open his letters  do you hear the old man roared at him i want you to turn him off  excuse me mr dryfoos said march succeeding in an effort to speak calmly i dont know you in such a matter as this my arrangements as editor of every other week were made with mr fulkerson i have always listened to any suggestion he has had to make  i dont care for mr fulkerson he has nothing to do with it retorted dryfoos but he seemed a little daunted by marchs position  he has everything to do with it as far as i am concerned march answered with a steadiness that he did not feel i know that you are the owner of the periodical but i cant receive any suggestion from you for the reason that i have given nobody but mr fulkerson has any right to talk with me about its management  dryfoos glared at him for a moment and demanded threateningly then you say you wont turn that old loafer off you say that i have got to keep on paying my money out to buy beer for a man that would cut my throat if he got the chance  i say nothing at all mr dryfoos march answered the blood came into his face and he added but i will say that if you speak again of mr lindau in those terms one of us must leave this room i will not hear you  dryfoos looked at him with astonishment then he struck his hat down on his head and stamped out of the room and down the stairs and a vague pity came into marchs heart that was not altogether for himself he might be the greater sufferer in the end but he was sorry to have got the better of that old man for the moment and he felt ashamed of the anger into which dryfooss anger had surprised him he knew he could not say too much in defence of lindaus generosity and unselfishness and he had not attempted to defend him as a political economist he could not have taken any ground in relation to dryfoos but that which he held and he felt satisfied that he was right in refusing to receive instructions or commands from him yet somehow he was not satisfied with the whole affair and not merely because his present triumph threatened his final advantage but because he felt that in his heat he had hardly done justice to dryfooss rights in the matter it did not quite console him to reflect that dryfoos had himself made it impossible he was tempted to go home and tell his wife what had happened and begin his preparations for the future at once but he resisted this weakness and kept mechanically about his work opening the letters and the manuscripts before him with that curious double action of the mind common in men of vivid imaginations it was a relief when conrad dryfoos having apparently waited to make sure that his father would not return came up from the countingroom and looked in on march with a troubled face  mr march he began i hope father hasnt been saying anything to you that you cant overlook i know he was very much excited and when he is excited he is apt to say things that he is sorry for  the apologetic attitude taken for dryfoos so different from any attitude the peremptory old man would have conceivably taken for himself made march smile oh no i fancy the boot is on the other leg i suspect ive said some things your father cant overlook conrad he called the young man by his christian name partly to distinguish him from his father partly from the infection of fulkersons habit and partly from a kindness for him that seemed naturally to express itself in that way  i know he didnt sleep last night after you all went away conrad pursued and of course that made him more irritable and he was tried a good deal by some of the things that mr lindau said  i was tried a good deal myself said march lindau ought never to have been there  no conrad seemed only partially to assent  i told mr fulkerson so i warned him that lindau would be apt to break out in some way it wasnt just to him and it wasnt just to your father to ask him  mr fulkerson had a good motive conrad gently urged he did it because he hurt his feelings that day about the pension  yes but it was a mistake he knew that lindau was inflexible about his principles as he calls them and that one of his first principles is to denounce the rich in season and out of season i dont remember just what he said last night and i really thought id kept him from breaking out in the most offensive way but your father seems very much incensed  yes i know said conrad  of course i dont agree with lindau i think there are as many good kind just people among the rich as there are among the poor and that they are as generous and helpful but lindau has got hold of one of those partial truths that hurt worse than the whole truth and  partial truth the young man interrupted didnt the saviour himself say how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god  why bless my soul cried march do you agree with lindau  i agree with the lord jesus christ said the young man solemnly and a strange light of fanaticism of exaltation came into his wide blue eyes and i believe he meant the kingdom of heaven upon this earth as well as in the skies  march threw himself back in his chair and looked at him with a kind of stupefaction in which his eye wandered to the doorway where he saw fulkerson standing it seemed to him a long time before he heard him saying hello hello whats the row conrad pitching into you on old lindaus account too  the young man turned and after a glance at fulkersons light smiling face went out as if in his present mood he could not bear the contact of that persiflant spirit  march felt himself getting provisionally very angry again excuse me fulkerson but did you know when you went out what mr dryfoos wanted to see me for  well no i didnt exactly said fulkerson taking his usual seat on a chair and looking over the back of it at march i saw he was on his car about something and i thought id better not monkey with him much i supposed he was going to bring you to book about old lindau somehow fulkerson broke into a laugh  march remained serious mr dryfoos he said willing to let the simple statement have its own weight with fulkerson and nothing more came in here and ordered me to discharge lindau from his employment on the magazineto turn him off as he put it  did he asked fulkerson with unbroken cheerfulness the old man is business every time well i suppose you can easily get somebody else to do lindaus work for you this town is just running over with halfstarved linguists what did you say  what did i say march echoed look here fulkerson you may regard this as a joke but i dont im not used to being spoken to as if i were the foreman of a shop and told to discharge a sensitive and cultivated man like lindau as if he were a drunken mechanic and if thats your idea of me  oh hello now march you mustnt mind the old mans way he dont mean anything by ithe dont know any better if you come to that  then i know better said march i refused to receive any instructions from mr dryfoos whom i dont know in my relations with every other week and i referred him to you  you did fulkerson whistled he owns the thing  i dont care who owns the thing said march my negotiations were with you alone from the beginning and i leave this matter with you what do you wish done about lindau  oh better let the old fool drop said fulkerson hell light on his feet somehow and it will save a lot of rumpus  and if i decline to let him drop  oh come now march dont do that fulkerson began  if i decline to let him drop march repeated what will you do  ill be dogged if i know what ill do said fulkerson i hope you wont take that stand if the old man went so far as to speak to you about it his mind is made up and we might as well knock under first as last  and do you mean to say that you would not stand by me in what i considered my dutyin a matter of principle  why of course march said fulkerson coaxingly i mean to do the right thing but dryfoos owns the magazine  he doesnt own me said march rising he has made the little mistake of speaking to me as if he did and whenmarch put on his hat and took his overcoat down from its nailwhen you bring me his apologies or come to say that having failed to make him understand they were necessary you are prepared to stand by me i will come back to this desk otherwise my resignation is at your service  he started toward the door and fulkerson intercepted him ah now look here march dont do that hang it all dont you see where it leaves me now you just sit down a minute and talk it over i can make you seei can show youwhy confound the old dutch beerbuzzer twenty of him wouldnt be worth the trouble hes makin let him go and the old man ll come round in time  i dont think weve understood each other exactly mr fulkerson said march very haughtily perhaps we never can but ill leave you to think it out  he pushed on and fulkerson stood aside to let him pass with a dazed look and a mechanical movement there was something comic in his rueful bewilderment to march who was tempted to smile but he said to himself that he had as much reason to be unhappy as fulkerson and he did not smile his indignation kept him hot in his purpose to suffer any consequence rather than submit to the dictation of a man like dryfoos he felt keenly the degradation of his connection with him and all his resentment of fulkersons original uncandor returned at the same time his heart ached with foreboding it was not merely the work in which he had constantly grown happier that he saw taken from him but he felt the misery of the man who stakes the security and plenty and peace of home upon some cast and knows that losing will sweep from him most that most men find sweet and pleasant in life he faced the fact which no good man can front without terror that he was risking the support of his family and for a point of pride of honor which perhaps he had no right to consider in view of the possible adversity he realized as every hireling must no matter how skillfully or gracefully the tie is contrived for his wearing that he belongs to another whose will is his law his indignation was shot with abject impulses to go back and tell fulkerson that it was all right and that he gave up to end the anguish of his struggle he quickened his steps so that he found he was reaching home almost at a run     viii  he must have made more clatter than he supposed with his key at the apartment door for his wife had come to let him in when he flung it open why basil she said whats brought you back are you sick youre all pale well no wonder this is the last of mr fulkersons dinners you shall go to youre not strong enough for it and your stomach will be all out of order for a week how hot you are and in a drip of perspiration now youll be sick she took his hat away which hung dangling in his hand and pushed him into a chair with tender impatience what is the matter has anything happened  everything has happened he said getting his voice after one or two husky endeavors for it and then he poured out a confused and huddled statement of the case from which she only got at the situation by prolonged crossquestioning  at the end she said i knew lindau would get you into trouble  this cut march to the heart isabel he cried reproachfully  oh i know she retorted and the tears began to come i dont wonder you didnt want to say much to me about that dinner at breakfast i noticed it but i thought you were just dull and so i didnt insist i wish i had now if you had told me what lindau had said i should have known what would have come of it and i could have advised you  would you have advised me march demanded curiously to submit to bullying like that and meekly consent to commit an act of cruelty against a man who had once been such a friend to me  it was an unlucky day when you met him i suppose we shall have to go and just when we bad got used to new york and begun to like it i dont know where we shall go now boston isnt like home any more and we couldnt live on two thousand there i should be ashamed to try im sure i dont know where we can live on it i suppose in some country village where there are no schools or anything for the children i dont know what theyll say when we tell them poor things  every word was a stab in marchs heart so weakly tender to his own his wifes tears after so much experience of the comparative lightness of the griefs that weep themselves out in women always seemed wrung from his own soul if his children suffered in the least through him he felt like a murderer it was far worse than he could have imagined the way his wife took the affair though he had imagined certain words or perhaps only looks from her that were bad enough he had allowed for trouble but trouble on his account a svmpathy that might burden and embarrass him but he had not dreamed of this merely domestic this petty this sordid view of their potential calamity which left him wholly out of the question and embraced only what was most crushing and desolating in the prospect he could not bear it he caught up his hat again and with some hope that his wife would try to keep him rushed out of the house he wandered aimlessly about thinking the same exhausting thoughts over and over till he found himself horribly hungry then he went into a restaurant for his lunch and when he paid he tried to imagine how he should feel if that were really his last dollar  he went home toward the middle of the afternoon basely hoping that fulkerson had sent him some conciliatory message or perhaps was waiting there for him to talk it over march was quite willing to talk it over now but it was his wife who again met him at the door though it seemed another woman than the one he had left weeping in the morning  i told the children she said in smiling explanation of his absence from lunch that perhaps you were detained by business i didnt know but you had gone back to the office  did you think i would go back there isabel asked march with a haggard look well if you say so i will go back and do what dryfoos ordered me to do im sufficiently cowed between him and you i can assure you  nonsense she said i approve of everything you did but sit down now and dont keep walking that way and let me see if i understand it perfectly of course i had to have my say out  she made him go all over his talk with dryfoos again and report his own language precisely from time to time as she got his points she said that was splendid good enough for him and oh im so glad you said that to him at the end she said  well now lets look at it from his point of view lets be perfectly just to him before we take another step forward  or backward march suggested ruefully the case is simply this he owns the magazine  of course  and he has a right to expect that i will consider his pecuniary interests  oh those detestable pecuniary interests dont you wish there wasnt any money in the world  yes or else that there was a great deal more of it and i was perfectly willing to do that i have always kept that in mind as one of my duties to him ever since i understood what his relation to the magazine was  yes i can bear witness to that in any court of justice youve done it a great deal more than i could basil and it was just the same way with those horrible insurance people  i know march went on trying to be proof against her flatteries or at least to look as if he did not deserve praise i know that what lindau said was offensive to him and i can understand how he felt that he had a right to punish it all i say is that he had no right to punish it through me  yes said mrs march askingly  if it had been a question of making every other week the vehicle of lindaus peculiar opinionsthough theyre not so very peculiar he might have got the most of them out of ruskini shouldnt have had any ground to stand on or at least then i should have had to ask myself whether his opinions would be injurious to the magazine or not  i dont see mrs march interpolated how they could hurt it much worse than colonel woodburns article crying up slavery  well said march impartially we could print a dozen articles praising the slavery its impossible to have back and it wouldnt hurt us but if we printed one paper against the slavery which lindau claims still exists some people would call us bad names and the countingroom would begin to feel it but that isnt the point lindaus connection with every other week is almost purely mechanical hes merely a translator of such stories and sketches as he first submits to me and it isnt at all a question of his opinions hurting us but of my becoming an agent to punish him for his opinions that is what i wouldnt do thats what i never will do  if you did said his wife i should perfectly despise you i didnt understand how it was before i thought you were just holding out against dryfoos because he took a dictatorial tone with you and because you wouldnt recognize his authority but now im with you basil every time as that horrid little fulkerson says but who would ever have supposed he would be so base as to side against you  i dont know said march thoughtfully that we had a right to expect anything else fulkersons standards are low theyre merely business standards and the good thats in him is incidental and something quite apart from his morals and methods hes naturally a generous and rightminded creature but life has taught him to truckle and trick like the rest of us  it hasnt taught you that basil  dont be so sure perhaps its only that im a poor scholar but i dont know really that i despise fulkerson so much for his course this morning as for his gross and fulsome flatteries of dryfoos last night i could hardly stomach it  his wife made him tell her what they were and then she said yes that was loathsome i couldnt have believed it of mr fulkerson  perhaps he only did it to keep the talk going and to give the old man a chance to say something march leniently suggested it was a worse effect because he didnt or couldnt follow up fulkersons lead  it was loathsome all the same his wife insisted its the end of mr fulkerson as far as im concerned  i didnt tell you before march resumed after a moment of my little interview with conrad dryfoos after his father left and now he went on to repeat what had passed between him and the young man  i suspect that he and his father had been having some words before the old man came up to talk with me and that it was that made him so furious  yes but what a strange position for the son of such a man to take do you suppose he says such things to his father  i dont know but i suspect that in his meek way conrad would say what he believed to anybody i suppose we must regard him as a kind of crank  poor young fellow he always makes me feel sad somehow he has such a pathetic face i dont believe i ever saw him look quite happy except that night at mrs horns when he was talking with miss vance and then he made me feel sadder than ever  i dont envy him the life he leads at home with those convictions of his i dont see why it wouldnt be as tolerable there for old lindau himself  well now said mrs march let us put them all out of our minds and see what we are going to do ourselves  they began to consider their ways and means and how and where they should live in view of marchs severance of his relations with every other week they had not saved anything from the first years salary they had only prepared to save and they had nothing solid but their two thousand to count upon but they built a future in which they easily lived on that and on what march earned with his pen he became a free lance and fought in whatever cause he thought just he had no ties no chains they went back to boston with the heroic will to do what was most distasteful they would have returned to their own house if they had not rented it again but any rate mrs march helped out by taking boarders or perhaps only letting rooms to lodgers they had some hard struggles but they succeeded  the great thing she said is to be right im ten times as happy as if you had come home and told me that you had consented to do what dryfoos asked and he had doubled your salary  i dont think that would have happened in any event said march dryly  well no matter i just used it for an example  they both experienced a buoyant relief such as seems to come to people who begin life anew on whatever terms i hope we are young enough yet basil she said and she would not have it when he said they had once been younger  they heard the childrens knock on the door they knocked when they came home from school so that their mother might let them in shall we tell them at once she asked and ran to open for them before march could answer  they were not alone fulkerson smiling from ear to ear was with them is march in he asked  mr march is at home yes she said very haughtily hes in his study and she led the way there while the children went to their rooms  well march fulkerson called out at sight of him its all right the old man has come down  i suppose if you gentlemen are going to talk business mrs march began  oh we dont want you to go away said fulkerson i reckon march has told you anyway  yes ive told her said march dont go isabel what do you mean fulkerson  hes just gone on up home and he sent me round with his apologies he sees now that he had no business to speak to you as he did and he withdraws everything hed a come round himself if id said so but i told him i could make it all right  fulkerson looked so happy in having the whole affair put right and the marches knew him to be so kindly affected toward them that they could not refuse for the moment to share his mood they felt themselves slipping down from the moral height which they had gained and march made a clutch to stay himself with the question and lindau  well said fulkerson hes going to leave lindau to me you wont have anything to do with it ill let the old fellow down easy  do you mean asked march that mr dryfoos insists on his being dismissed  why there isnt any dismissing about it fulkerson argued if you dont send him any more work he wont do any more thats all or if he comes round you canhes to be referred to me  march shook his head and his wife with a sigh felt herself plucked up from the soft circumstance of their lives which she had sunk back into so quickly and set beside him on that cold peak of principle again it wont do fulkerson its very good of you and all that but it comes to the same thing in the end i could have gone on without any apology from mr dryfoos he transcended his authority but thats a minor matter i could have excused it to his ignorance of life among gentlemen but i cant consent to lindaus dismissalit comes to that whether you do it or i do it and whether its a positive or a negative thingbecause he holds this opinion or that  but dont you see said fulkerson that its just lindaus opinions the old man cant stand he hasnt got anything against him personally i dont suppose theres anybody that appreciates lindau in some ways more than the old man does  i understand he wants to punish him for his opinions well i cant consent to that directly or indirectly we dont print his opinions and he has a perfect right to hold them whether mr dryfoos agrees with them or not  mrs march had judged it decorous for her to say nothing but she now went and sat down in the chair next her husband  ah dog on it cried fulkerson rumpling his hair with both his hands what am i to do the old man says hes got to go  and i dont consent to his going said march  and you wont stay if he goes  fulkerson rose well well ive got to see about it im afraid the old man wont stand it march i am indeed i wish youd reconsider iid take it as a personal favor if you would it leaves me in a fix you see ive got to side with one or the other  march made no reply to this except to say yes you must stand by him or you must stand by me  well well hold on awhile ill see you in the morning dont take any steps  oh there are no steps to take said march with a melancholy smile the steps are stopped thats all he sank back into his chair when fulkerson was gone and drew a long breath this is pretty rough i thought we had got through it  no said his wife it seems as if i had to make the fight all over again  well its a good thing its a holy war  i cant bear the suspense why didnt you tell him outright you wouldnt go back on any terms  i might as well and got the glory hell never move dryfoos i suppose we both would like to go back if we could  oh i suppose so  they could not regain their lost exaltation their lost dignity at dinner mrs march asked the children how they would like to go back to boston to live  why were not going are we asked tom without enthusiasm  i was just wondering how you felt about it now she said with an underlook at her husband  well if we go back said bella i want to live on the back bay its awfully micky at the south end  i suppose i should go to harvard said tom and id room out at cambridge it would be easier to get at you on the back bay  the parents smiled ruefully at each other and in view of these grand expectations of his children march resolved to go as far as he could in meeting dryfooss wishes he proposed the theatre as a distraction from the anxieties that he knew were pressing equally on his wife we might go to the old homestead he suggested with a sad irony which only his wife felt  oh yes lets cried bella  while they were getting ready some one rang and bella went to the door and then came to tell her father that it was mr lindau he says he wants to see you just a moment hes in the parlor and he wont sit down or anything  what can he want groaned mrs march from their common dismay  march apprehended a storm in the old mans face but he only stood in the middle of the room looking very sad and grave you are going oudt he said i wont geep

boison  march tried to reason with lindau to show him the folly the injustice the absurdity of his course it ended in their both getting angry and in lindaus going away in a whirl of german that included basil in the guilt of the man whom lindau called his master  well said mrs march he is a crank and i think youre well rid of him now you have no quarrel with that horrid old dryfoos and you can keep right on  yes said march i wish it didnt make me feel so sneaking what a long day its been it seems like a century since i got up  yes a thousand years is there anything else left to happen  i hope not id like to go to bed  why arent you going to the theatre wailed bella coming in upon her fathers desperate expression  the theatre oh yes certainly i meant after we got home and march amused himself at the puzzled countenance of the child come on is tom ready     ix  fulkerson parted with the marches in such trouble of mind that he did not feel able to meet that night the people whom he usually kept so gay at mrs leightons table he went to maronis for his dinner for this reason and for others more obscure he could not expect to do anything more with dryfoos at once he knew that dryfoos must feel that he had already made an extreme concession to march and he believed that if he was to get anything more from him it must be after dryfoos had dined but he was not without the hope vague and indefinite as it might be that he should find lindau at maronis and perhaps should get some concession from him some word of regret or apology which he could report to dryfoos and at lest make the means of reopening the affair with him perhaps lindau when he knew how matters stood would back down altogether and for marchs sake would withdraw from all connection with every other week himself and so leave everything serene fulkerson felt capable in his desperation of delicately suggesting such a course to lindau or even of plainly advising it he did not care for lindau a great deal and he did care a great deal for the magazine  but he did not find lindau at maronis he only found beaton he sat looking at the doorway as fulkerson entered and fulkerson naturally came and took a place at his table something in beatons largeeyed solemnity of aspect invited fulkerson to confidence and he said as he pulled his napkin open and strung it still a little damp as the scanty oftenwashed linen at maronis was apt to be across his knees i was looking for you this morning to talk with you about the christmas number and i was a good deal worked up because i couldnt find you but i guess i might as well have spared myself my emotions  why asked beaton briefly  well i dont know as theres going to be any christmas number  why beaton asked again  row between the financial angel and the literary editor about the chief translator and polyglot smeller  lindau  lindau is his name  what does the literary editor expect after lindaus expression of his views last night  i dont know what he expected but the ground he took with the old man was that as lindaus opinions didnt characterize his work on the magazine he would not be made the instrument of punishing him for them the old man wanted him turned off as he calls it  seems to be pretty good ground said beaton impartially while he speculated with a dull trouble at heart on the effect the row would have on his own fortunes his late visit home had made him feel that the claim of his family upon him for some repayment of help given could not be much longer delayed with his mother sick and his father growing old he must begin to do something for them but up to this time he had spent his salary even faster than he had earned it when fulkerson came in he was wondering whether he could get him to increase it if he threatened to give up his work and he wished that he was enough in love with margaret vance or even christine dryfoos to marry her only to end in the sorrowful conviction that he was really in love with alma leighton who had no money and who had apparently no wish to be married for love even and what are you going to do about it he asked listlessly  be dogged if i know what im going to do about it said fulkerson ive been round all day trying to pick up the piecesrow began right after breakfast this morningand one time i thought id got the thing all put together again i got the old man to say that he had spoken to march a little too authoritatively about lindau that in fact he ought to have communicated his wishes through me and that he was willing to have me get rid of lindau and march neednt have anything to do with it i thought that was pretty white but march says the apologies and regrets are all well enough in their way but they leave the main question where they found it  what is the main question beaton asked pouring himself out some chianti as he set the flask down he made the reflection that if he would drink water instead of chianti he could send his father three dollars a week on his back debts and he resolved to do it  the main question as march looks at it is the question of punishing lindau for his private opinions he says that if he consents to my bouncing the old fellow its the same as if he bounced him  it might have that complexion in some lights said beaton he drank off his chianti and thought he would have it twice a week or make maroni keep the halfbottles over for him and send his father two dollars and what are you going to do now  thats what i dont know said fulkerson ruefully after a moment he said desperately beaton youve got a pretty good head why dont you suggest something  why dont you let march go beaton suggested  ah i couldnt said fulkerson i got him to break up in boston and come here i like him nobody else could get the hang of the thing like he has hesa friend fulkerson said this with the nearest approach he could make to seriousness which was a kind of unhappiness  beaton shrugged oh if you can afford to have ideals i congratulate you theyre too expensive for me then suppose you get rid of dryfoos  fulkerson laughed forlornly go on bildad like to sprinkle a few ashes over my boils dont mind me  they both sat silent a little while and then beaton said i suppose you havent seen dryfoos the second time  no i came in here to gird up my loins with a little dinner before i tackled him but something seems to be the matter with maronis cook i dont want anything to eat  the cookings about as bad as usual said beaton after a moment he added ironically for he found fulkersons misery a kind of relief from his own and was willing to protract it as long as it was amusing why not try an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary  what do you mean  get that other old fool to go to dryfoos for you  which other old fool the old fools seem to be as thick as flies  that southern one  colonel woodburn  mmmmm  he did seem to rather take to the colonel fulkerson mused aloud  of course he did woodburn with his idiotic talk about patriarchal slavery is the man on horseback to dryfooss muddy imagination hed listen to him abjectly and hed do whatever woodburn told him to do beaton smiled cynically  fulkerson got up and reached for his coat and hat youve struck it old man the waiter came up to help him on with his coat fulkerson slipped a dollar in his hand never mind the coat you can give the rest of my dinner to the poor paolo beaton shake youve saved my life little boy though i dont think you meant it he took beatons hand and solemnly pressed it and then almost ran out of the door  they had just reached coffee at mrs leightons when he arrived and sat down with them and began to put some of the life of his new hope into them his appetite revived and after protesting that he would not take anything but coffee he went back and ate some of the earlier courses but with the pressure of his purpose driving him forward he did not conceal from miss woodburn at least that he was eager to get her apart from the rest for some reason when he accomplished this it seemed as if he had contrived it all himself but perhaps he had not wholly contrived it  im so glad to get a chance to speak to you alone he said at once and while she waited for the next word he made a pause and then said desperately i want you to help me and if you cant help me theres no help for me  mah goodness she said is the case so bad as that what in the woald is the trouble  yes its a bad case said fulkerson i want your father to help me  oh i thoat you said me  yes i want you to help me with your father i suppose i ought to go to him at once but im a little afraid of him  and you awe not afraid of me i dont think thats very flattering mr fulkerson you ought to think ahm twahce as awful as papa  oh i do you see im quite paralyzed before you and so i dont feel anything  well its a pretty lahvely kyand of paralysis butgo on  i willi will if i can only begin  pohaps ah maght begin fo you  no you cant lord knows id like to let you well its like this  fulkerson made a clutch at his hair and then after another hesitation he abruptly laid the whole affair before her he did not think it necessary to state the exact nature of the offence lindau had given dryfoos for he doubted if she could grasp it and he was profuse of his excuses for troubling her with the matter and of wonder at himself for having done so in the rapture of his concern at having perhaps made a fool of himself he forgot why he had told her but she seemed to like having been confided in and she said well ah dont see what you can do with you ahdeals of friendship except stand bah mr mawch  my ideals of friendship what do you mean  oh dont you suppose we know mr beaton said you we a pofect bahyard in friendship and you would sacrifice anything to it  is that so said fulkerson thinking how easily he could sacrifice lindau in this case he had never supposed before that he was chivalrous in such matters but he now began to see it in that light and he wondered that he could ever have entertained for a moment the idea of throwing march over  but ah most say miss woodburn went on ah dont envy you you next interview with mr dryfoos ah suppose youll have to see him at once aboat it  the conjecture recalled fulkerson to the object of his confidences ah theres where your help comes in ive exhausted all the influence i have with dryfoos  good gracious you dont expect ah could have any  they both laughed at the comic dismay with which she conveyed the preposterous notion and fulkerson said if i judged from myself i should expect you to bring him round instantly  oh thank you mr fulkerson she said with mock meekness  not at all but it isnt dryfoos i want you to help me with its your father i want your father to interview dryfoos for me and iim afraid to ask him  poo mr fulkerson she said and she insinuated something through her burlesque compassion that lifted him to the skies he swore in his heart that the woman never lived who was so witty so wise so beautiful and so good come raght with me this minute if the cyoasts clea she went to the door of the diningroom and looked in across its gloom to the little gallery where her father sat beside a lamp reading his evening paper mrs leighton could be heard in colloquy with the cook below and alma had gone to her room she beckoned fulkerson with the hand outstretched behind her and said go and ask him  alone he palpitated  oh what a cyowahd she cried and went with him ah suppose youll want me to tell him aboat it  well i wish youd begin miss woodburn he said the fact is you know ive been over it so much im kind of sick of the thing  miss woodburn advanced and put her hand on her fathers shoulder look heah papa mr fulkerson wants to ask you something and he wants me to do it fo him  the colonel looked up through his glasses with the sort of ferocity elderly men sometimes have to put on in order to keep their glasses from falling off his daughter continued hes got into an awful difficulty with his edito and his proprieto and he wants you to pacify them  i do not know whethah i understand the case exactly said the colonel but mr fulkerson may command me to the extent of my ability  you dont understand it aftah what ahve said cried the girl then ah dont see but what youll have to explain it youself mr fulkerson  well miss woodburn has been so luminous about it colonel said fulkerson glad of the joking shape she had given the affair that i can only throw in a little sidelight here and there  the colonel listened as fulkerson went on with a grave diplomatic satisfaction he felt gratified honored even he said by mr fulkersons appeal to him and probably it gave him something of the high joy that an affair of honor would have brought him in the days when he had arranged for meetings between gentlemen next to bearing a challenge this work of composing a difficulty must have been grateful but he gave no outward sign of his satisfaction in making a resume of the case so as to get the points clearly in his mind  i was afraid sir he said with the state due to the serious nature of the facts that mr lindau had given mr dryfoos offence by some of his questions at the dinnertable last night  perfect red rag to a bull fulkerson put in and then he wanted to withdraw his words at the colonels look of displeasure  i have no reflections to make upon mr landau colonel woodburn continued and fulkerson felt grateful to him for going on i do not agree with mr lindau i totally disagree with him on sociological points but the course of the conversation had invited him to the expression of his convictions and he had a right to express them so far as they had no personal bearing  of course said fulkerson while miss woodburn perched on the arm of her fathers chair  at the same time sir i think that if mr dryfoos felt a personal censure in mr lindaus questions concerning his suppression of the strike among his workmen he had a right to resent it  exactly fulkerson assented  but it must be evident to you sir that a highspirited gentleman like mr marchi confess that my feelings are with him very warmly in the mattercould not submit to dictation of the nature you describe  yes i see said fulkerson and with that strange duplex action of the human mind he wished that it was his hair and not her fathers that miss woodburn was poking apart with the corner of her fan  mr lindau the colonel concluded was right from his point of view and mr dryfoos was equally right the position of mr march is perfectly correct  his daughter dropped to her feet from his chairarm mah goodness if nobodys in the wrong ho awe you evah going to get the mattah straight  yes you see fulkerson added nobody can give in  pardon me said the colonel the case is one in which all can give in  i dont know which ll begin said fulkerson  the colonel rose mr lindau must begin sir we must begin by seeing mr lindau and securing from him the assurance that in the expression of his peculiar views he had no intention of offering any personal offence to mr dryfoos if i have formed a correct estimate of mr lindau this will be perfectly simple  fulkerson shook his head but it wouldnt help dryfoos dont care a rap whether lindau meant any personal offence or not as far as that is concerned hes got a hide like a hippopotamus but what he hates is lindaus opinions and what he says is that no man who holds such opinions shall have any work from him and what march says is that no man shall be punished through him for his opinions he dont care what they are  the colonel stood a moment in silence and what do you expect me to do under the circumstances  i came to you for advicei thought you might suggest  do you wish me to see mr dryfoos  well thats about the size of it fulkerson admitted you see colonel he hastened on i know that you have a great deal of influence with him that article of yours is about the only thing hes ever read in every other week and hes proud of your acquaintance well you knowand here fulkerson brought in the figure that struck him so much in beatons phrase and had been on his tongue ever sinceyoure the man on horseback to him and hed be more apt to do what you say than if anybody else said it  you are very good sir said the colonel trying to be proof against the flattery but i am afraid you overrate my influence fulkerson let him ponder it silently and his daughter governed her impatience by holding her fan against her lips whatever the process was in the colonels mind he said at last i see no good reason for declining to act for you mr fulkerson and i shall be very happy if i can be of service to you buthe stopped fulkerson from cutting in with precipitate thanksi think i have a right sir to ask what your course will be in the event of failure  failure fulkerson repeated in dismay  yes sir i will not conceal from you that this mission is one not wholly agreeable to my feelings  oh i understand that colonel and i assure you that i appreciate i  there is no use trying to blink the fact sir that there are certain aspects of mr dryfooss character in which he is not a gentleman we have alluded to this fact before and i need not dwell upon it now i may say however that my misgivings were not wholly removed last night  no fulkerson assented though in his heart he thought the old man had behaved very well  what i wish to say now is that i cannot consent to act for you in this matter merely as an intermediary whose failure would leave the affair in state quo  i see said fulkerson  and i should like some intimation some assurance as to which party your own feelings are with in the difference  the colonel bent his eyes sharply on fulkerson miss woodburn let hers fall fulkerson felt that he was being tested and he said to gain time as between lindau and dryfoos though he knew this was not the point  as between mr dryfoos and mr march said the colonel  fulkerson drew a long breath and took his courage in both hands there cant be any choice for me in such a case im for march every time  the colonel seized his hand and miss woodburn said if there had been any choice fo you in such a case i should never have let papa stir a step with you  why in regard to that said the colonel with a literal application of the idea was it your intention that we should both go  well i dont know i suppose it was  i think it will be better for me to go alone said the colonel and with a color from his experience in affairs of honor he added in these matters a principal cannot appear without compromising his dignity i believe i have all the points clearly in mind and i think i should act more freely in meeting mr dryfoos alone  fulkerson tried to hide the eagerness with which he met these agreeable views he felt himself exalted in some sort to the level of the colonels sentiments though it would not be easy to say whether this was through the desperation bred of having committed himself to marchs side or through the buoyant hope he had that the colonel would succeed in his mission  im not afraid to talk with dryfoos about it he said  there is no question of courage said the colonel it is a question of dignityof personal dignity  well dont let that delay you papa said his daughter following him to the door where she found him his hat and fulkerson helped him on with his overcoat ah shall be jost wald to know ho its toned oat  wont you let me go up to the house with you fulkerson began i neednt go in  i prefer to go alone said the colonel i wish to turn the points over in my mind and i am afraid you would find me rather dull company  he went out and fulkerson returned with miss woodburn to the drawingroom where she said the leightons were they were not there but she did not seem disappointed  well mr fulkerson she said you have got an ahdeal of friendship sure enough  me said fulkerson oh my lord dont you see i couldnt do anything else and im scared half to death anyway if the colonel dont bring the old man round i reckon its all up with me but hell fetch him and im just prostrated with gratitude to you miss woodburn  she waved his thanks aside with her fan what do you mean by its being all up with you  why if the old man sticks to his position and i stick to march weve both got to go overboard together dryfoos owns the magazine he can stop it or he can stop us which amounts to the same thing as far as were concerned  and then what the girl pursued  and then nothingtill we pick ourselves up  do you mean that mr dryfoos will put you both oat of your places  he may  and mr mawch takes the risk of that jost fo a principle  i reckon  and you do it jost fo an ahdeal  it wont do to own it i must have my little axe to grind somewhere  well men awe splendid sighed the girl ah will say it  oh theyre not so much better than women said fulkerson with a nervous jocosity i guess march would have backed down if it hadnt been for his wife she was as hot as pepper about it and you could see that she would have sacrificed all her husbands relations sooner than let him back down an inch from the stand he had taken its pretty easy for a man to stick to a principle if he has a woman to stand by him but when you come to play it alone  mr fulkerson said the girl solemnly ah will stand bah you in this if all the woald tones against you the tears came into her eyes and she put out her hand to him  you will he shouted in a rapture in every wayand alwaysas long as you live do you mean it he had caught her hand to his breast and was grappling it tight there and drawing her to him  the changing emotions chased one another through her heart and over her face dismay shame pride tenderness you dont believe she said hoarsely that ah meant that  no but i hope you do mean it for if you dont nothing else means anything  there was no space there was only a point of wavering ah do mean it  when they lifted their eyes from each other again it was halfpast ten no you most go she said  but the colonelour fate  the conel is often oat late and ahm not afraid of ouah fate no that weve taken it into ouah own hands she looked at him with dewy eyes of trust of inspiration  oh its going to come out all right he said it cant come out wrong now no matter what happens but whod have thought it when i came into this house in such a state of sin and misery half an hour ago  three houahs and a half ago she said no you most jost go ahm tahed to death goodnight you can come in the mawning to seepapa she opened the door and pushed him out with enrapturing violence and he ran laughing down the steps into her fathers arms  why colonel i was just going up to meet you he had really thought he would walk off his exultation in that direction  i am very sorry to say mr fulkerson the colonel began gravely that mr dryfoos adheres to his position  oh all right said fulkerson with unabated joy its what i expected well my course is clear i shall stand by march and i guess the world wont come to an end if he bounces us both but im everlastingly obliged to you colonel woodburn and i dont know what to say to you ii wont detain you now its so late ill see you in the morning goodni  fulkerson did not realize that it takes two to part the colonel laid hold of his arm and turned away with him i will walk toward your place with you i can understand why you should be anxious to know the particulars of my interview with mr dryfoos and in the statement which followed he did not spare him the smallest it outlasted their walk and detained them long on the steps of the every other week building but at the end fulkerson let himself in with his key as light of heart as if he had been listening to the gayest promises that fortune could make  by the time he met march at the office next morning a little but only a very little misgiving saddened his golden heaven he took marchs hand with high courage and said well the old man sticks to his point march he added with the sense of saying it before miss woodburn and i stick by you ive thought it all over and id rather be right with you than wrong with him  well i appreciate your motive fulkerson said march but perhapsperhaps we can save over our heroics for another occasion lindau seems to have got in with his for the present  he told him of lindaus last visit and they stood a moment looking at each other rather queerly fulkerson was the first to recover his spirits well he said cheerily that lets us out  does it im not sure it lets me out said march but he said this in tribute to his crippled selfrespect rather than as a forecast of any action in the matter  why what are you going to do fulkerson asked if lindau wont work for dryfoos you cant make him  march sighed what are you going to do with this money he glanced at the heap of bills he had flung on the table between them  fulkerson scratched his head ah dogged if i know cant we give it to the deserving poor somehow if we can find em  i suppose weve no right to use it in any way  you must give it to dryfoos  to the deserving rich well you can always find them i reckon you dont want to appear in the transaction i dont either but i guess i must fulkerson gathered up the money and carried it to conrad he directed him to account for it in his books as consciencemoney and he enjoyed the joke more than conrad seemed to do when he was told where it came from  fulkerson was able to wear off the disagreeable impression the affair left during the course of the forenoon and he met miss woodburn with all a lovers buoyancy when he went to lunch she was as happy as he when he told her how fortunately the whole thing had ended and he took her view that it was a reward of his courage in having dared the worst they both felt as the newly plighted always do that they were in the best relations with the beneficent powers and that their felicity had been especially looked to in the disposition of events they were in a glow of rapturous content with themselves and radiant worship of each other she was sure that he merited the bright future opening to them both as much as if he owed it directly to some noble action of his own he felt that he was indebted for the favor of heaven entirely to the still incredible accident of her preference of him over other men  colonel woodburn who was not yet in the secret of their love perhaps failed for this reason to share their satisfaction with a result so unexpectedly brought about the blessing on their hopes seemed to his ignorance to involve certain sacrifices of personal feeling at which he hinted in suggesting that dryfoos should now be asked to make some abstract concessions and acknowledgments his daughter hastened to deny that these were at all necessary and fulkerson easily explained why the thing was over what was the use of opening it up again  perhaps none the colonel admitted but he added i should like the opportunity of taking mr lindaus hand in the presence of mr dryfoos and assuring him that i considered him a man of principle and a man of honora gentleman sir whom i was proud and happy to have known  well ahve no doabt said his daughter demurely that youll have the chance some day and we would all lahke to join you but at the same tahme ah think mr fulkerson is well oat of it fo the present     pg editors bookmarks      anticipative reprisal     buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience     courtship     got their laugh out of too many things in life

right to burden our friends with our decisions     travel with all its annoyances and fatigues     typical anything else is pretty difficult to find     a hazard of new fortunes  by william dean howells     part fifth  i  superficially the affairs of every other week settled into their wonted form again and for fulkerson they seemed thoroughly reinstated but march had a feeling of impermanency from what had happened mixed with a fantastic sense of shame toward lindau he did not sympathize with lindaus opinions he thought his remedy for existing evils as wildly impracticable as colonel woodburns but while he thought this and while he could justly blame fulkerson for lindaus presence at dryfooss dinner which his zeal had brought about in spite of marchs protests still he could not rid himself of the reproach of uncandor with lindau he ought to have told him frankly about the ownership of the magazine and what manner of man the man was whose money he was taking but he said that he never could have imagined that he was serious in his preposterous attitude in regard to a class of men who embody half the prosperity of the country and he had moments of revolt against his own humiliation before lindau in which he found it monstrous that he should return dryfooss money as if it had been the spoil of a robber his wife agreed with him in these moments and said it was a great relief not to have that tiresome old german coming about they had to account for his absence evasively to the children whom they could not very well tell that their father was living on money that lindau disdained to take even though lindau was wrong and their father was right this heightened mrs marchs resentment toward both lindau and dryfoos who between them had placed her husband in a false position if anything she resented dryfooss conduct more than lindaus he had never spoken to march about the affair since lindau had renounced his work or added to the apologetic messages he had sent by fulkerson so far as march knew dryfoos had been left to suppose that lindau had simply stopped for some reason that did not personally affect him they never spoke of him and march was too proud to ask either fulkerson or conrad whether the old man knew that lindau had returned his money he avoided talking to conrad from a feeling that if he did he should involuntarily lead him on to speak of his differences with his father between himself and fulkerson even he was uneasily aware of a want of their old perfect friendliness fulkerson had finally behaved with honor and courage but his provisional reluctance had given march the measure of fulkersons character in one direction and he could not ignore the fact that it was smaller than he could have wished  he could not make out whether fulkerson shared his discomfort or not it certainly wore away even with march as time passed and with fulkerson in the bliss of his fortunate love it was probably far more transient if it existed at all he advanced into the winter as radiantly as if to meet the spring and he said that if there were any pleasanter month of the year than november it was december especially when the weather was good and wet and muddy most of the time so that you had to keep indoors a long while after you called anywhere  colonel woodburn had the anxiety in view of his daughters engagement when she asked his consent to it that such a dreamer must have in regard to any reality that threatens to affect the course of his reveries he had not perhaps taken her marriage into account except as a remote contingency and certainly fulkerson was not the kind of soninlaw that he had imagined in dealing with that abstraction but because he had nothing of the sort definitely in mind he could not oppose the selection of fulkerson with success he really knew nothing against him and he knew many things in his favor fulkerson inspired him with the liking that every one felt for him in a measure he amused him he cheered him and the colonel had been so much used to leaving action of all kinds to his daughter that when he came to close quarters with the question of a soninlaw he felt helpless to decide it and he let her decide it as if it were still to be decided when it was submitted to him she was competent to treat it in all its phases not merely those of personal interest but those of duty to the broken southern past sentimentally dear to him and practically absurd to her no such south as he remembered had ever existed to her knowledge and no such civilization as he imagined would ever exist to her belief anywhere she took the world as she found it and made the best of it she trusted in fulkerson she had proved his magnanimity in a serious emergency and in small things she was willing fearlessly to chance it with him she was not a sentimentalist and there was nothing fantastic in her expectations she was a girl of good sense and right mind and she liked the immediate practicality as well as the final honor of fulkerson she did not idealize him but in the highest effect she realized him she did him justice and she would not have believed that she did him more than justice if she had sometimes known him to do himself less  their engagement was a fact to which the leighton household adjusted itself almost as simply as the lovers themselves miss woodburn told the ladies at once and it was not a thing that fulkerson could keep from march very long he sent word of it to mrs march by her husband and his engagement perhaps did more than anything else to confirm the confidence in him which had been shaken by his early behavior in the lindau episode and not wholly restored by his tardy fidelity to march but now she felt that a man who wished to get married so obviously and entirely for love was full of all kinds of the best instincts and only needed the guidance of a wife to become very noble she interested herself intensely in balancing the respective merits of the engaged couple and after her call upon miss woodburn in her new character she prided herself upon recognizing the worth of some strictly southern qualities in her while maintaining the general average of new england superiority she could not reconcile herself to the virginian custom illustrated in her having been christened with the surname of madison and she said that its pet form of mad which fulkerson promptly invented only made it more ridiculous  fulkerson was slower in telling beaton he was afraid somehow of beatons taking the matter in the cynical way miss woodburn said she would break off the engagement if beaton was left to guess it or find it out by accident and then fulkerson plucked up his courage beaton received the news with gravity and with a sort of melancholy meekness that strongly moved fulkersons sympathy and made him wish that beaton was engaged too  it made beaton feel very old it somehow left him behind and forgotten in a manner it made him feel trifled with something of the unfriendliness of fate seemed to overcast his resentment and he allowed the sadness of his conviction that he had not the means to marry on to tinge his recognition of the fact that alma leighton would not have wanted him to marry her if he had he was now often in that martyr mood in which he wished to help his father not only to deny himself chianti but to forego a furlined overcoat which he intended to get for the winter he postponed the moment of actual sacrifice as regarded the chianti and he bought the overcoat in an anguish of selfreproach he wore it the first evening after he got it in going to call upon the leightons and it seemed to him a piece of ghastly irony when alma complimented his picturesqueness in it and asked him to let her sketch him  oh you can sketch me he said with so much gloom that it made her laugh  if you think its so serious id rather not  no no go ahead how do you want me  oh fling yourself down on a chair in one of your attitudes of studied negligence and twist one corner of your mustache with affected absence of mind  and you think im always studied always affected  i didnt say so  i didnt ask you what you said  and i wont tell you what i think  ah i know what you think  what made you ask then the girl laughed again with the satisfaction of her sex in cornering a man  beaton made a show of not deigning to reply and put himself in the pose she suggested frowning  ah thats it but a little more animation    as when a great thought strikes along the brain    and flushes all the cheek  she put her forehead down on the back of her hand and laughed again you ought to be photographed you look as if you were sitting for it  beaton said thats because i know i am being photographed in one way i dont think you ought to call me affected i never am so with you i know it wouldnt be of any use  oh mr beaton you flatter  no i never flatter you  i meant you flattered yourself  how  oh i dont know imagine  i know what you mean you think i cant be sincere with anybody  oh no i dont  what do you think  that you canttry alma gave another victorious laugh  miss woodburn and fulkerson would once have both feigned a great interest in almas sketching beaton and made it the subject of talk in which they approached as nearly as possible the real interest of their lives now they frankly remained away in the diningroom which was very cozy after the dinner had disappeared the colonel sat with his lamp and paper in the gallery beyond mrs leighton was about her housekeeping affairs in the content she always felt when alma was with beaton  they seem to be having a pretty good time in there said fulkerson detaching himself from his own absolute good time as well as he could  at least alma does said miss woodburn  do you think she cares for him  quahte as moch as he desoves  what makes you all down on beaton around here hes not such a bad fellow  we awe not all doan on him mrs leighton isnt doan on him  oh i guess if it was the old lady there wouldnt be much question about it  they both laughed and alma said they seem to be greatly amused with something in there  me probably said beaton i seem to amuse everybody tonight  dont you always  i always amuse you im afraid alma  she looked at him as if she were going to snub him openly for using her name but apparently she decided to do it covertly you didnt at first i really used to believe you could be serious once  couldnt you believe it again now  not when you put on that windharp stop  wetmore has been talking to you about me he would sacrifice his best friend to a phrase he spends his time making them  hes made some very pretty ones about you  like the one you just quoted  no not exactly he admires you ever so much he says she stopped teasingly  what  he says you could be almost anything you wished if you didnt wish to be everything  that sounds more like the school of wetmore thats what you say alma well if there were something you wished me to be i could be it  we might adapt kingsley be good sweet man and let who will be clever he could not help laughing she went on i always thought that was the most patronizing and exasperating thing ever addressed to a human girl and weve had to stand a good deal in our time i should like to have it applied to the other sect a while as if any girl that was a girl would be good if she had the remotest chance of being clever  then you wouldnt wish me to be good beaton asked  not if you were a girl  you want to shock me well i suppose i deserve it but if i were onetenth part as good as you are alma i should have a lighter heart than i have now i know that im fickle but im not false as you think i am  who said i thought you were false  no one said beaton it isnt necessary when you look itlive it  oh dear i didnt know i devoted my whole time to the subject  i know im despicable i could tell you somethingthe history of this day eventhat would make you despise me beaton had in mind his purchase of the overcoat which alma was getting in so effectively with the money he ought to have sent his father but he went on darkly with a sense that what he was that moment suffering for his selfishness must somehow be a kind of atonement which would finally leave him to the guiltless enjoyment of the overcoat you wouldnt believe the depths of baseness i could descend to  i would try said alma rapidly shading the collar if youd give me some hint  beaton had a sudden wish to pour out his remorse to her but he was afraid of her laughing at him he said to himself that this was a very wholesome fear and that if he could always have her at hand he should not make a fool of himself so often a man conceives of such an office as the very noblest for a woman he worships her for it if he is magnanimous but beaton was silent and alma put back her head for the right distance on her sketch mr fulkerson thinks you are the sublimest of human beings for advising him to get colonel woodburn to interview mr dryfoos about lindau what have you ever done with your judas  i havent done anything with it nadel thought he would take hold of it at one time but he dropped it again after all i dont suppose it could be popularized fulkerson wanted to offer it as a premium to subscribers for every other week but i sat down on that  alma could not feel the absurdity of this and she merely said every other week seems to be going on just the same as ever  yes the trouble has all blown over i believe fulkerson said beaton with a return to what they were saying has managed the whole business very well but he exaggerates the value of my advice  very likely alma suggested vaguely or no excuse me he couldnt he couldnt she laughed delightedly at beatons foolish look of embarrassment  he tried to recover his dignity in saying hes a very good fellow and he deserves his happiness  oh indeed said alma perversely does any one deserve happiness  i know i dont sighed beaton  you mean you dont get it  i certainly dont get it  ah but that isnt the reason  what is  thats the secret of the universe she bit in her lower lip and looked at him with eyes of gleaming fun  are you never serious he asked  with serious people always  i am serious and you have the secret of my happiness he threw himself impulsively forward in his chair  oh pose pose she cried  i wont pose he answered and you have got to listen to me you know im in love with you and i know that once you cared for me cant that timewont itcome back again try to think so alma  no she said briefly and seriously enough  but that seems impossible what is it ive done what have you against me  nothing but that time is past i couldnt recall it if i wished why did you bring it up youve broken your word you know i wouldnt have let you keep coming here if you hadnt promised never to refer to it  how could i help it with that happiness near usfulkerson  oh its that i might have known it  no it isnt thatits something far deeper but if its nothing you have against me what is it alma that keeps you from caring for me now as you did then i havent changed  but i have i shall never care for you again mr beaton you might as well understand it once for all dont think its anything in yourself or that i think you unworthy of me im not so selfsatisfied as that i know very well that im not a perfect character and that ive no claim on perfection in anybody else i think women who want that are fools they wont get it and they dont deserve it but ive learned a good deal more about myself than i knew in st barnaby and a life of work of art and of art alone thats what ive made up my mind to  a woman thats made up her mind to that has no heart to hinder her  would a man have that had done so  but i dont believe you alma youre merely laughing at me and besides with me you neednt give up art we could work together you know how much i admire your talent i believe i could help itserve it i would be its willing slave and yours heaven knows  i dont want any slavenor any slavery i want to be free always now do you see i dont care for you and i never could in the old way but i should have to care for some one more than i believe i ever shall to give up my work shall we go on she looked at her sketch  no we shall not go on he said gloomily as he rose  i suppose you blame me she said rising too  oh no i blame no oneor only myself i threw my chance away  im glad you see that and im glad you did it you dont believe me of course why do men think life can be only the one thing to women and if you come to the selfish view who are the happy women im sure that if work doesnt fail me health wont and happiness wont  but you could work on with me  second fiddle do you suppose i shouldnt be woman enough to wish my work always less and lower than yours at least ive heart enough for that  youve heart enough for anything alma i was a fool to say you hadnt  i think the women who keep their hearts have an even chance at least of having heart  ah theres where youre wrong  but mine isnt mine to give you anyhow and now i dont want you ever to speak to me about this again  oh theres no danger he cried bitterly i shall never willingly see you again  thats as you like mr beaton weve had to be very frank but i dont see why we shouldnt be friends still we neednt if you dont like  and i may comei may come hereasas usual  why if you can consistently she said with a smile and she held out her hand to him  he went home dazed and feeling as if it were a bad joke that had been put upon him at least the affair went so deep that it estranged the aspect of his familiar studio some of the things in it were not very familiar he had spent lately a great deal on rugs on stuffs on japanese bricabrac when he saw these things in the shops he had felt that he must have them that they were necessary to him and he was partly in debt for them still without having sent any of his earnings to pay his father as he looked at them now he liked to fancy something weird and conscious in them as the silent witnesses of a broken life he felt about among some of the smaller objects on the mantel for his pipe before he slept he was aware in the luxury of his despair of a remote relief an escape and after all the understanding he had come to with alma was only the explicit formulation of terms long tacit between them beaton would have been puzzled more than he knew if she had taken him seriously it was inevitable that he should declare himself in love with her but he was not disappointed at her rejection of his love perhaps not so much as he would have been at its acceptance though he tried to think otherwise and to give himself airs of tragedy he did not really feel that the result was worse than what had gone before and it left him free  but he did not go to the leightons again for so long a time that mrs leighton asked alma what had happened alma told her  and he wont come any more her mother sighed with reserved censure  oh i think he will he couldnt very well come the next night but he has the habit of coming and with mr beaton habit is everythingeven the habit of thinking hes in love with some one  alma said her mother i dont think its very nice for a girl to let a young man keep coming to see her after shes refused him  why not if it amuses him and doesnt hurt the girl  but it does hurt her alma itits indelicate it isnt fair to him it gives him hopes  well mamma it hasnt happened in the given case yet if mr beaton comes again i wont see him and you can forbid him the house  if i could only feel sure alma said her mother taking up another branch of the inquiry that you really knew your own mind i should be easier about it  then you can rest perfectly quiet mamma i do know my own mind and whats worse i know mr beatons mind  what do you mean  i mean that he spoke to me the other night simply because mr fulkersons engagement had broken him all up  what expressions mrs leighton lamented  he let it out himself alma went on and you wouldnt have thought it was very flattering yourself when im made love to after this i prefer to be made love to in an offyear when there isnt another engaged couple anywhere about  did you tell him that alma  tell him that what do you mean mamma i may be indelicate but im not quite so indelicate as that  i didnt mean you were indelicate really alma but i wanted to warn you i think mr beaton was very much in earnest  oh so did he  and you didnt  oh yes for the time being i suppose hes very much in earnest with miss vance at times and with miss dryfoos at others sometimes hes a painter and sometimes hes an architect and sometimes hes a sculptor he has too many giftstoo many tastes  and if miss vance and miss dryfoos  oh do say sculpture and architecture mamma its getting so dreadfully personal  alma you know that i only wish to get at your real feeling in the matter  and you know that i dont want to let youespecially when i havent got any real feeling in the matter but i should thinkspeaking in the abstract entirelythat if either of those arts was ever going to be in earnest about him it would want his exclusive devotion for a week at least  i didnt know said mrs leighton that he was doing anything now at the others i thought he was entirely taken up with his work on every other week  oh he is he is  and you certainly cant say my dear that he hasnt been very kindvery useful to you in that matter  and so i ought to have said yes out of gratitude thank you mamma i didnt know you held me so cheap  you know whether i hold you cheap or not alma i dont want you to cheapen yourself i dont want you to trifle with any one i want you to be honest with yourself  well come now mamma suppose you begin ive been perfectly honest with myself and ive been honest with mr beaton i dont care for him and ive told him i didnt so he may be supposed to know it if he comes here after this hell come as a plain unostentatious friend of the family and its for you to say whether he shall come in that capacity or not i hope you wont trifle with him and let him get the notion that hes coming on any other basis  mrs leighton felt the comfort of the critical attitude far too keenly to abandon it for anything constructive she only said you know very well alma thats a matter i can have nothing to do with  then you leave him entirely to me  i hope you will regard his right to candid and open treatment  hes had nothing but the most open and candid treatment from me mamma its you that wants to play fast and loose with him and to tell you the truth i believe he would like that a good deal better i believe that if theres anything he hates its openness and candor alma laughed and put her arms round her mother who could not help laughing a little too     ii  the winter did not renew for christine and mela the social opportunity which the spring had offered after the musicale at mrs horns they both made their partycall as mela said in due season but they did not find mrs horn at home and neither she nor miss vance came to see them after people returned to town in the fall they tried to believe for a time that mrs horn had not got their cards this pretence failed them and they fell back upon their pride or rather christines pride mela had little but her goodnature to avail her in any exigency and if mrs horn or miss vance had come to call after a year of neglect she would have received them as amiably as if they had not lost a day in coming but christine had drawn a line beyond which they would not have been forgiven and she had planned the words and the behavior with which she would have punished them if they had appeared then neither sister imagined herself in anywise inferior to them but christine was suspicious at least and it was mela who invented the hypothesis of the lost cards as nothing happened to prove or to disprove the fact she said i move we put coonrod up to gittun it out of miss vance at some of their meetuns  if you do said christine ill kill you  christine however had the visits of beaton to console her and if these seemed to have no definite aim she was willing to rest in the pleasure they gave her vanity but mela had nothing sometimes she even wished they were all back on the farm  it would be the best thing for both of you said mrs dryfoos in answer to such a burst of desperation i dont think new york is any place for girls  well what i hate mother said mela is it dont seem to be any place for young men either she found this so good when she had said it that she laughed over it till christine was angry  a body would think there had never been any joke before  i dont see as its a joke said mrs dryfoos its the plain truth  oh dont mind her mother said mela shes put out because her old mr beaton hart been round for a couple o weeks if you dont watch out that fellow ll give you the slip yit christine after all your pains  well there aint anybody to give you the slip mela christine clawed back  no i hant ever set my traps for anybody this was what mela said for want of a better retort but it was not quite true when kendricks came with beaton to call after her fathers dinner she used all her cunning to ensnare him and she had him to herself as long as beaton stayed dryfoos sent down word that he was not very well and had gone to bed the novelty of mela had worn off for kendricks and she found him as she frankly told him not half as entertaining as he was at mrs horns but she did her best with him as the only flirtable material which had yet come to her hand it would have been her ideal to have the young men stay till past midnight and her father come downstairs in his stockingfeet and tell them it was time to go but they made a visit of decorous brevity and kendricks did not come again she met him afterward once as she was crossing the pavement in union square to get into her coupe and made the most of him but it was necessarily very little and so he passed out of her life without having left any trace in her heart though mela had a heart that she would have put at the disposition of almost any young man that wanted it kendricks himself manhattan cockney as he was with scarcely more out look into the average american nature than if he had been kept a prisoner in new york society all his days perceived a property in her which forbade him as a man of conscience to trifle with her something earthly good and kind if it was simple and vulgar in revising his impressions of her it seemed to him that she would come even to better literary effect if this were recognized in her and it made her sacred in spite of her willingness to fool and to be fooled in her merely human quality after all he saw that she wished honestly to love and to be loved and the lures she threw out to that end seemed to him pathetic rather than ridiculous he could not join beaton in laughing at her and he did not like beatons laughing at the other girl either it seemed to kendricks with the code of honor which he mostly kept to himself because he was a little ashamed to find there were so few others like it that if beaton cared nothing for the other girland christine appeared simply detestable to kendrickshe had better keep away from her and not give her the impression he was in love with her he rather fancied that this was the part of a gentleman and he could not have penetrated to that aesthetic and moral complexity which formed the consciousness of a nature like beatons and was chiefly a torment to itself he could not have conceived of the wayward impulses indulged at every moment in little things till the straight highway was traversed and wellnigh lost under their tangle to do whatever one likes is finally to do nothing that one likes even though one continues to do what one will but kendricks though a sage of twentyseven was still too young to understand this  beaton scarcely understood it himself perhaps because he was not yet twentyseven he only knew that his will was somehow sick that it spent itself in caprices and brought him no happiness from the fulfilment of the most vehement wish but he was aware that his wishes grew less and less vehement he began to have a fear that some time he might have none at all it seemed to him that if he could once do something that was thoroughly distasteful to himself he might make a beginning in the right direction but when he tried this on a small scale it failed and it seemed stupid some sort of expiation was the thing he needed he was sure but he could not think of anything in particular to expiate a man could not expiate his temperament and his temperament was what beaton decided to be at fault he perceived that it went deeper than even fate would have gone he could have fulfilled an evil destiny and had done with it however terrible his trouble was that he could not escape from himself and for the most part he justified himself in refusing to try after he had come to that distinct understanding with alma leighton and experienced the relief it really gave him he thought for a while that if it had fallen out otherwise and she had put him in charge of her destiny he might have been better able to manage his own but as it was he could only drift and let all other things take their course it was necessary that he should go to see her afterward to show her that he was equal to the event but he did not go so often and he went rather oftener to the dryfooses it was not easy to see margaret vance except on the society terms with much sneering and scorning he fulfilled the duties to mrs horn without which he knew he should be dropped from her list but one might go to many of her thursdays without getting many words with her niece beaton hardly knew whether he wanted many the girl kept the charm of her innocent stylishness but latterly she wanted to talk more about social questions than about the psychical problems that young people usually debate so personally son of the workingpeople as he was beaton had never cared anything about such matters he did not know about them or wish to know he was perhaps too near them besides there was an embarrassment at least on her part concerning the dryfooses she was too highminded to blame him for having tempted her to her failure with them by his talk about them but she was conscious of avoiding them in her talk she had decided not to renew the effort she had made in the spring because she could not do them good as fellowcreatures needing food and warmth and work and she would not try to befriend them socially she had a horror of any such futile sentimentality she would have liked to account to beaton in this way for a course which she suspected he must have heard their comments upon but she did not quite know how to do it she could not be sure how much or how little he cared for them some tentative approaches which she made toward explanation were met with such eager disclaim of personal interest that she knew less than before what to think and she turned the talk from the sisters to the brother whom it seemed she still continued to meet in their common work among the poor  he seems very different she ventured  oh quite said beaton hes the kind of person that you might suppose gave the catholics a hint for the cloistral life hes a cloistered naturethe nature that atones and suffers for but hes awfully dull company dont you think i never can get anything out of him  hes very much in earnest  remorselessly weve got a profane and mundane creature there at the office who runs us all and its shocking merely to see the contact of the tyro natures when fulkerson gets to joking dryfooshe likes to put his joke in the form of a pretence that dryfoos is actuated by a selfish motive that he has an eye to office and is working up a political interest for himself on the east sideits something inexpressible  i should think so said miss vance with such lofty disapproval that beaton felt himself included in it for having merely told what caused it he could not help saying in natural rebellion well the man of one idea is always a little ridiculous  when his idea is right she demanded a right idea cant be ridiculous  oh i only said the man that held it was hes flat he has no relief no projection  she seemed unable to answer and he perceived that he had silenced her to his own disadvantage it appeared to beaton that she was becoming a little too exacting for comfort in her idealism he put down the cup of tea he had been tasting and said in his solemn staccato i must go goodbye and got instantly away from her with an effect he had of having suddenly thought of something imperative  he went up to mrs horn for a moments hail and farewell and felt himself subtly detained by her through fugitive passages of conversation with half a dozen other people he fancied that at crises of this strange interview mrs horn was about to become confidential with him and confidential of all things about her niece she ended by not having palpably been so in fact the concern in her mind would have been difficult to impart to a young man and after several experiments mrs horn found it impossible to say that she wished margaret could somehow be interested in lower things than those which occupied her she had watched with growing anxiety the girls tendency to various kinds of selfdevotion she had dark hours in which she even feared her entire withdrawal from the world in a life of good works before now girls had entered the protestant sisterhoods which appeal so potently to the young and generous imagination and margaret was of just the temperament to be influenced by them during the past summer she had been unhappy at her separation from the cares that had engrossed her more and more as their stay in the city drew to an end in the spring and she had hurried her aunt back to town earlier in the fall than she would have chosen to come margaret had her correspondents among the workingwomen whom she befriended mrs horn was at one time alarmed to find that margaret was actually promoting a strike of the buttonhole workers this of course had its ludicrous side in connection with a young lady in good society and a person of even so little humor as mrs horn could not help seeing it at the same time she could not help foreboding the worst from it she was afraid that margarets health would give way under the strain and that if she did not go into a sisterhood she would at least go into a decline she began the winter with all such counteractive measures as she could employ at an age when such things weary she threw herself into the pleasures of society with the hope of dragging margaret after her and a sympathetic witness must have followed with compassion her course from ball to ball from reception to reception from parlorreading to parlorreading from musicale to musicale from play to play from opera to opera she tasted after she had practically renounced them the bitter and the insipid flavors of fashionable amusement in the hope that margaret might find them sweet and now at the end she had to own to herself that she had failed it was coming lent again and the girl had only grown thinner and more serious with the diversions that did not divert her from the baleful works of beneficence on which mrs horn felt that she was throwing her youth away margaret could have borne either alone but together they were wearing her out she felt it a duty to undergo the pleasures her aunt appointed for her but she could not forego the other duties in which she found her only pleasure  she kept up her music still because she could employ it at the meetings for the entertainment and as she hoped the elevation of her workingwomen but she neglected the other aesthetic interests which once occupied her and at sight of beaton talking with her mrs horn caught at the hope that he might somehow be turned to account in reviving margarets former interest in art she asked him if mr wetmore had his classes that winter as usual and she said she wished margaret could be induced to go again mr wetmore always said that she did not draw very well but that she had a great deal of feeling for it and her work was interesting she asked were the leightons in town again and she murmured a regret that she had not been able to see anything of them without explaining why she said she had a fancy that if margaret knew miss leighton and what she was doing it might stimulate her perhaps she supposed miss leighton was still going on with her art beaton said oh yes he believed so  but his manner did not encourage mrs horn to pursue her aims in that direction and she said with a sigh she wished he still had a class she always fancied that margaret got more good from his instruction than from any one elses  he said that she was very good but there was really nobody who knew half as much as wetmore or could make any one understand half as much mrs horn was afraid she said that mr wetmores terrible sincerity discouraged margaret he would not let her have any illusions about the outcome of what she was doing and did not mr beaton think that some illusion was necessary with young people of course it was very nice of mr wetmore to be so honest but it did not always seem to be the wisest thing she begged mr beaton to try to think of some one who would be a little less severe her tone assumed a deeper interest in the people who were coming up and going away and beaton perceived that he was dismissed  he went away with vanity flattered by the sense of having been appealed to concerning margaret and then he began to chafe at what she had said of wetmores honesty apropos of her wish that he still had a class himself did she mean confound her that he was insincere and would let miss vance suppose she had more talent than she really had the more beaton thought of this the more furious he became and the more he was convinced that something like it had been unconsciously if not consciously in her mind he framed some keen retorts to the general effect that with the atmosphere of illusion preserved so completely at home miss vance hardly needed it in her art studies having just determined never to go near mrs horns thursdays again he decided to go once more in order to plant this sting in her capacious but somewhat callous bosom and he planned how he would lead the talk up to the point from which he should launch it  in the mean time he felt the need of some present solace such as only unqualified worship could give him a cruel wish to feel his power in some direction where even if it were resisted it could not be overcome drove him on that a woman who was to beaton the embodiment of artificiality should intimate however innocentlythe innocence made it all the worsethat he was less honest than wetmore whom he knew to be so much more honest was something that must be retaliated somewhere before his selfrespect could be restored it was only five oclock and he went on uptown to the dryfooses though he had been there only the night before last he asked for the ladies and mrs mandel received him  the young ladies are downtown shopping she said but i am very glad of the opportunity of seeing you alone mr beaton you know i lived several years in europe  yes said beaton wondering what that could have to do with her pleasure in seeing him alone i believe so he involuntarily gave his words the questioning inflection  you have lived abroad too and so you wont find what i am going to ask so strange mr beaton why do you come so much to this house mrs mandel bent forward with an aspect of ladylike interest and smiled  beaton frowned why do i come so much  yes  why do iexcuse me mrs mandel but will you allow me to ask why you ask  oh certainly theres no reason why i shouldnt say for i wish you to be very frank with me i ask because there are two young ladies in this house and in a certain way i have to take the place of a mother to them i neednt explain why you know all the people here and you understand i have nothing to say about them but i should not be speaking to you now if they were not all rather helpless people they do not know the world they have come to live in here and they cannot help themselves or one another but you do know it mr beaton and i am sure you know just how much or how little you mean by coming here you are either interested in one of these young girls or you are not if you are i have nothing more to say if you are not mrs mandel continued to smile but the smile had grown more perfunctory and it had an icy gleam  beaton looked at her with surprise that he gravely kept to himself he had always regarded her as a social nullity with a kind of pity to be sure as a civilized person living among such people as the dryfooses but not without a humorous contempt he had thought of her as mandel and sometimes as old mandel though she was not half a score of years his senior and was still well on the sunny side of forty he reddened and then turned an angry pallor excuse me again mrs mandel do you ask this from the young ladies  certainly not she said with the best temper and with something in her tone that convicted beaton of vulgarity in putting his question of her authority in the form of a sneer as i have suggested they would hardly know how to help themselves at all in such a matter i have no objection to saying that i ask it from the father of the young ladies of course in and for myself i should have no right to know anything about your affairs i assure you the duty of knowing isnt very pleasant the little tremor in her clear voice struck beaton as something rather nice  i can very well believe that mrs mandel he said with a dreamy sadness in his own he lifted his eyes and looked into hers if i told you that i cared nothing about them in the way you intimate  then i should prefer to let you characterize your own conduct in continuing to come here for the year past as you have done and tacitly leading them on to infer differently they both mechanically kept up the fiction of plurality in speaking of christine but there was no doubt in the mind of either which of the young ladies the other meant a good many thoughts went through beatons mind and none of them were flattering he had not been unconscious that the part he had played toward this girl was ignoble and that it had grown meaner as the fancy which her beauty had at first kindled in him had grown cooler he was aware that of late he had been amusing himself with her passion in a way that was not less than cruel not because he wished to do so but because he was listless and wished nothing he rose in saying i might be a little more lenient than you think mrs mandel but i wont trouble you with any palliating theory i will not come any more  he bowed and mrs mandel said of course its only your action that i am concerned with  she seemed to him merely triumphant and he could not conceive what it had cost her to nerve herself up to her too easy victory he left mrs mandel to a far harder lot than had fallen to him and he went away hating her as an enemy who had humiliated him at a moment when he particularly needed exalting it was really very simple for him to stop going to see christine dryfoos but it was not at all simple for mrs mandel to deal with the consequences of his not coming he only thought how lightly she had stopped him and the poor woman whom he had left trembling for what she had been obliged to do embodied for him the conscience that accused him of unpleasant things  by heavens this is piling it up he said to himself through his set teeth realizing how it had happened right on top of that stupid insult from mrs horn now he should have to give up his place on every other week he could not keep that under the circumstances even if some pretence were not made to get rid of him he must hurry and anticipate any such pretence he must see fulkerson at once he wondered where he should find him at that hour he thought with bitterness so real that it gave him a kind of tragical satisfaction how certainly he could find him a little later at mrs leightons and fulkersons happiness became an added injury  the thing had of course come about just at the wrong time there never had been a time when beaton needed money more when he had spent what he had and what he expected to have so recklessly he was in debt to fulkerson personally and officially for advance payments of salary the thought of sending money home made him break into a scoffing laugh which he turned into a cough in order to deceive the passers what sort of face should he go with to fulkerson and tell him that he renounced his employment on every other week and what should he do when he had renounced it take pupils perhaps open a class a lurid conception of a class conducted on those principles of shameless flattery at which mrs horn had hintedhe believed now she had meant to insult himpresented itself why should not he act upon the suggestion he thought with loathing for the whole race of womendabblers in art how easy the thing would be as easy as to turn back now and tell that old fools girl that he loved her and rake in half his millions why should not he do that no one else cared for him and at a years end probably one woman would be like another as far as the love was concerned and probably he should not be more tired if the woman were christine dryfoos than if she were margaret vance he kept alma leighton out of the question because at the bottom of his heart he believed that she must be forever unlike every other woman to him  the tide of his confused and aimless reverie had carried him far downtown he thought but when he looked up from it to see where he was he found himself on sixth avenue only a little below thirtyninth street very hot and blown that idiotic fur overcoat was stifling he could not possibly walk down to eleventh he did not want to walk even to the elevated station at thirtyfourth he stopped at the corner to wait for a surfacecar and fell again into his bitter fancies after a while he roused himself and looked up the track but there was no car coming he found himself beside a policeman who was lazily swinging his club by its thong from his wrist  when do you suppose a car will be along he asked rather in a general sarcasm of the absence of the cars than in any special belief that the policeman could tell him  the policeman waited to discharge his tobaccojuice into the gutter in about a week he said nonchalantly  whats the matter asked beaton wondering what the joke could be  strike said the policeman his interest in beatons ignorance seemed to overcome his contempt of it knocked off everywhere this morning except third avenue and one or two crosstown lines he spat again and kept his bulk at its incline over the gutter to glance at a group of men on the corner below they were neatly dressed and looked like something better than workingmen and they had a holiday air of being in their best clothes  some of the strikers asked beaton  the policeman nodded  any trouble yet  there wont be any trouble till we begin to move the cars said the policeman  beaton felt a sudden turn of his rage toward the men whose action would now force him to walk five blocks and mount the stairs of the elevated station if youd take out eight or ten of those fellows he said ferociously and set them up against a wall and shoot them youd save a great deal of bother  i guess we shant have to shoot much said the policeman still swinging his locust anyway we shant begin it if it comes to a fight though he said with a look at the men under the scooping rim of his helmet we can drive the whole six thousand of em into the east river without pullin a trigger  are there six thousand in it  about  what do the infernal fools expect to live on  the interest of their money i suppose said the officer with a grin of satisfaction in his irony its got to run its course then theyll come back with their heads tied up and their tails between their legs and plead to be taken on again  if i was a manager of the roads said beaton thinking of how much he was already inconvenienced by the strike and obscurely connecting it as one of the series with the wrongs he had suffered at the hands of mrs horn and mrs mandel i would see them starve before id take them backevery one of them  well said the policeman impartially as a man might whom the companies allowed to ride free but who had made friends with a good many drivers and conductors in the course of his free riding i guess thats what the roads would like to do if they could but the men are too many for them and there aint enough other men to take their places  no matter said beaton severely they can bring in men from other places  oh theyll do that fast enough said the policeman  a man came out of the saloon on the corner where the strikers were standing noisy drunk and they began as they would have said to have some fun with him the policeman left beaton and sauntered slowly down toward the group as if in the natural course of an afternoon ramble on the other side of the street beaton could see another officer sauntering up from the block below looking up and down the avenue so silent of its horsecar bells he saw a policeman at every corner it was rather impressive     iii  the strike made a good deal of talk in it he office of every other week that is it made fulkerson talk a good deal he congratulated himself that he was not personally incommoded by it like some of the fellows who lived uptown and had not everything under one roof as it were he enjoyed the excitement of it and he kept the office boy running out to buy the extras which the newsmen came crying through the street almost every hour with a lamentable unintelligible noise he read not only the latest intelligence of the strike but the editorial comments on it which praised the firm attitude of both parties and the admirable measures taken by the police to preserve order fulkerson enjoyed the interviews with the police captains and the leaders of the strike he equally enjoyed the attempts of the reporters to interview the road managers which were so graphically detailed and with such a fine feeling for the right use of scareheads as to have almost the value of direct expression from them though it seemed that they had resolutely refused to speak he said at secondhand from the papers that if the men behaved themselves and respected the rights of property they would have public sympathy with them every time but just as soon as they began to interfere with the roads right to manage their own affairs in their own way they must be put down with an iron hand the phrase iron hand did fulkerson almost as much good as if it had never been used before news began to come of fighting between the police and the strikers when the roads tried to move their cars with men imported from philadelphia and then fulkerson rejoiced at the splendid courage of the police at the same time he believed what the strikers said and that the trouble was not made by them but by gangs of roughs acting without their approval in this juncture he was relieved by the arrival of the state board of arbitration which took up its quarters with a great many scareheads at one of the principal hotels and invited the roads and the strikers to lay the matter in dispute before them he said that now we should see the working of the greatest piece of social machinery in modern times but it appeared to work only in the alacrity of the strikers to submit their grievance the road were as one road in declaring that there was nothing to arbitrate and that they were merely asserting their right to manage their own affairs in their own way one of the presidents was reported to have told a member of the board who personally summoned him to get out and to go about his business then to fulkersons extreme disappointment the august tribunal acting on behalf of the sovereign people in the interest of peace declared itself powerless and got out and would no doubt have gone about its business if it had had any fulkerson did not know what to say perhaps because the extras did not but march laughed at this result  its a good deal like the military manoeuvre of the king of france and his forty thousand men i suppose somebody told him at the top of the hill that there was nothing to arbitrate and to get out and go about his business and that was the reason he marched down after he had marched up with all that ceremony what amuses me is to find that in an affair of this kind the roads have rights and the strikers have rights but the public has no rights at all the roads and the strikers are allowed to fight out a private war in our midst as thoroughly and precisely a private war as any we despise the middle ages for having toleratedas any street war in florence or veronaand to fight it out at our pains and expense and we stand by like sheep and wait till they get tired its a funny attitude for a city of fifteen hundred thousand inhabitants  what would you do asked fulkerson a good deal daunted by this view of the case  do nothing hasnt the state board of arbitration declared itself powerless we have no hold upon the strikers and were so used to being snubbed and disobliged by common carriers that we have forgotten our hold on the roads and always allow them to manage their own affairs in their own way quite as if we had nothing to do with them and they owed us no services in return for their privileges  thats a good deal so said fulkerson disordering his hair well its nuts for the colonel nowadays he says if he was boss of this town he would seize the roads on behalf of the people and man em with policemen and run em till the managers had come to terms with the strikers and hed do that every time there was a strike  doesnt that rather savor of the paternalism he condemned in lindau asked march  i dont know it savors of horse sense  you are pretty far gone fulkerson i thought you were the most engaged man i ever saw but i guess youre more fatherinlawed and before youre married too  well the colonels a glorious old fellow march i wish he had the power to do that thing just for the fun of looking on while he waltzed in hes on the keen jump from morning till night and hes up late and early to see the row im afraid hell get shot at some of the fights he sees them all i cant get any show at them havent seen a brickbat shied or a club swung yet have you  no i find i can philosophize the situation about as well from the papers and thats what i really want to do i suppose besides im solemnly pledged by mrs march not to go near any sort of crowd under penalty of having her bring the children and go with me her theory is that we must all die together the children havent been at school since the strike began theres no precaution that mrs march hasnt used she watches me whenever i go out and sees that i start straight for this office  fulkerson laughed and said well its probably the only thing thats saved your life have you seen anything of beaton lately  no you dont mean to say hes killed  not if he knows it but i dont knowwhat do you say march whats the reason you couldnt get us up a paper on the strike  i knew it would fetch round to every other week somehow  no but seriously there ll be plenty of news paper accounts but you could treat it in the historical spiritlike something that happened several centuries ago de foes plague of london style heigh what made me think of it was beaton if i could get hold of him you two could go round together and take down its aesthetic aspects its a big thing march this strike is i tell you its imposing to have a private war as you say fought out this way in the heart of new york and new york not minding it a bit see might take that view of it with your descriptions and beatons sketcheswell it would just be the greatest card come what do you say  will you undertake to make it right with mrs march if im killed and she and the children are not killed with me  well it would be difficult i wonder how it would do to get kendricks to do the literary part  ive no doubt hed jump at the chance ive yet to see the form of literature that kendricks wouldnt lay down his life for  say march perceived that fulkerson was about to vent another inspiration and smiled patiently look here whats the reason we couldnt get one of the strikers to write it up for us  might have a symposium of strikers and presidents march suggested  no im in earnest they say some of those fellowsespecially the foreignersare educated men i know one fellowa bohemianthat used to edit a bohemian newspaper here he could write it out in his kind of dutch and we could get lindau to translate it  i guess not said march dryly  why not hed do it for the cause wouldnt he suppose you put it up on him the next time you see him  i dont see lindau any more said march he added i guess hes renounced me along with mr dryfooss money  pshaw you dont mean he hasnt been round since  he came for a while but hes left off coming now i dont feel particularly gay about it march said with some resentment of fulkersons grin hes left me in debt to him for lessons to the children  fulkerson laughed out well he is the greatest old fool whod a thought hed a been in earnest with those brincibles of his but i suppose there have to be just such cranks it takes all kinds to make a world  there has to be one such crank it seems march partially assented ones enough for me  i reckon this thing is nuts for lindau too said fulkerson why it must act like a schooner of beer on him all the while to see gabidal embarrassed like it is by this strike it must make old lindau feel like he was back behind those barricades at berlin well hes a splendid old fellow pity he drinks as i remarked once before  when march left the office he did not go home so directly as he came perhaps because mrs marchs eye was not on him he was very curious about some aspects of the strike whose importance as a great social convulsion he felt people did not recognize and with his temperance in everything he found its negative expressions as significant as its more violent phases he had promised his wife solemnly that he would keep away from these and he had a natural inclination to keep his promise he had no wish to be that peaceful spectator who always gets shot when there is any firing on a mob he interested himself in the apparent indifference of the mighty city which kept on about its business as tranquilly as if the private war being fought out in its midst were a vague rumor of indian troubles on the frontier and he realized how there might once have been a street feud of forty years in florence without interfering materially with the industry and prosperity of the city on broadway there was a silence where a jangle and clatter of horsecar bells and hoofs had been but it was not very noticeable and on the avenues roofed by the elevated roads this silence of the surface tracks was not noticeable at all in the roar of the trains overhead some of the crosstown cars were beginning to run again with a policeman on the rear of each on the third avenge line operated by nonunion men who had not struck there were two policemen beside the driver of every car and two beside the conductor to protect them from the strikers but there were no strikers in sight and on second avenue they stood quietly about in groups on the corners while march watched them at a safe distance a car laden with policemen came down the track but none of the strikers offered to molest it in their simple sunday best march thought them very quiet decentlooking people and he could well believe that they had nothing to do with the riotous outbreaks in other parts of the city he could hardly believe that there were any such outbreaks he began more and more to think them mere newspaper exaggerations in the absence of any disturbance or the disposition to it that he could see he walked on to the east river  avenues a b and c presented the same quiet aspect as second avenue groups of men stood on the corners and now and then a policeladen car was brought unmolested down the tracks before them they looked at it and talked together and some laughed but there was no trouble  march got a crosstown car and came back to the west side a policeman looking very sleepy and tired lounged on the platform  i suppose youll be glad when this cruel war is over march suggested as he got in  the officer gave him a surly glance and made him no answer  his behavior from a man born to the joking give and take of our life impressed march it gave him a fine sense of the ferocity which he had read of the french troops putting on toward the populace just before the coup detat he began to feel like the populace but he struggled with himself and regained his character of philosophical observer in this character he remained in the car and let it carry him by the corner where he ought to have got out and gone home and let it keep on with him to one of the farthermost tracks westward where so much of the fighting was reported to have taken place but everything on the way was as quiet as on the east side  suddenly the car stopped with so quick a turn of the brake that he was half thrown from his seat and the policeman jumped down from the platform and ran forward     iv  dryfoos sat at breakfast that morning with mrs mandel as usual to pour out his coffee conrad had gone downtown the two girls lay abed much later than their father breakfasted and their mother had gradually grown too feeble to come down till lunch suddenly christine appeared at the door her face was white to the edges of her lips and her eyes were blazing  look here father have you been saying anything to mr beaton  the old man looked up at her across his coffeecup through his frowning brows no  mrs mandel dropped her eyes and the spoon shook in her hand  then whats the reason he dont come here any more demanded the girl and her glance darted from her father to mrs mandel oh its you is it id like to know who told you to meddle in other peoples business  i did said dryfoos savagely i told her to ask him what he wanted here and he said he didnt want anything and he stopped coming thats all i did it myself  oh you did did you said the girl scarcely less insolently than she had spoken to mrs mandel i should like to know what you did it for id like to know what made you think i wasnt able to take care of myself i just knew somebody had been meddling but i didnt suppose it was you i can manage my own affairs in my own way if you please and ill thank you after this to leave me to myself in what dont concern you  dont concern me you impudent jade her father began  christine advanced from the doorway toward the table she had her hands closed upon what seemed trinkets some of which glittered and dangled from them she said will you go to him and tell him that this meddlesome minx here had no business to say anything about me to him and you take it all back  no shouted the old man and if  thats all i want of you the girl shouted in her turn here are your presents with both hands she flung the jewelspins and rings and earrings and braceletsamong the breakfastdishes from which some of them sprang to the floor she stood a moment to pull the intaglio ring from the finger where beaton put it a year ago and dashed that at her fathers plate then she whirled out of the room and they heard her running upstairs  the old man made a start toward her but he fell back in his chair before she was gone and with a fierce grinding movement of his jaws controlled himself taketake those things up he gasped to mrs mandel he seemed unable to rise again from his chair but when she asked him if he were unwell he said no with an air of offence and got quickly to his feet he mechanically picked up the intaglio ring from the table while he stood there and put it on his little finger his hand was not much bigger than christines how do you suppose she found it out he asked after a moment  she seems to have merely suspected it said mrs mandel in a tremor and with the fright in her eyes which christines violence had brought there  well it dont make any difference she had to know somehow and now she knows he started toward the door of the library as if to go into the hall where his hat and coat hung  mr dryfoos palpitated mrs mandel i cant remain here after the language your daughter has used to mei cant let you leave meiim afraid of her  lock yourself up then said the old man rudely he added from the hall before he went out i reckon shell quiet down now  he took the elevated road the strike seemed a vary faroff thing though the paper he bought to look up the stockmarket was full of noisy typography about yesterdays troubles on the surface lines among the millions in wall street there was some joking and some swearing but not much thinking about the six thousand men who had taken such chances in their attempt to better their condition dryfoos heard nothing of the strike in the lobby of the stock exchange where he spent two or three hours watching a favorite stock of his go up and go down under the betting by the time the exchange closed it had risen eight points and on this and some other investments he was five thousand dollars richer than he had been in the morning but he had expected to be richer still and he was by no means satisfied with his luck all through the excitement of his winning and losing had played the dull murderous rage he felt toward they child who had defied him and when the game was over and he started home his rage mounted into a sort of frenzy he would teach her he would break her he walked a long way without thinking and then waited for a car none came and he hailed a passing coupe  what has got all the cars he demanded of the driver who jumped down from his box to open the door for him and get his direction  been away asked the driver hasnt been any car along for a week strike  oh yes said dryfoos he felt suddenly giddy and he remained staring at the driver after he had taken his seat  the man asked where to  dryfoos could not think of his street or number and he said with uncontrollable fury i told you once go up to west eleventh and drive along slow on the south side ill show you the place  he could not remember the number of every other week office where he suddenly decided to stop before he went home he wished to see fulkerson and ask him something about beaton whether he had been about lately and whether he had dropped any hint of what had happened concerning christine dryfoos believed that fulkerson was in the fellows confidence  there was nobody but conrad in the countingroom whither dryfoos returned after glancing into fulkersons empty office wheres fulkerson he asked sitting down with his hat on  he went out a few moments ago said conrad glancing at the clock im afraid he isnt coming back again today if you wanted to see him  dryfoos twisted his head sidewise and upward to indicate marchs room that other fellow out too  he went just before mr fulkerson answered conrad  do you generally knock off here in the middle of the afternoon asked the old man  no said conrad as patiently as if his father had not been there a score of times and found the whole staff of every other week at work between four and five mr march you know always takes a good deal of his work home with him and i suppose mr fulkerson went out so early because there isnt much doing today perhaps its the strike that makes it dull  the strikeyes its a pretty piece of business to have everything thrown out because a parcel of lazy hounds want a chance to lay off and get drunk dryfoos seemed to think conrad would make some answer to this but the young mans mild face merely saddened and he said nothing ive got a coupe out there now that i had to take because i couldnt get a car if i had my way id have a lot of those vagabonds hung theyre waiting to get the city into a snarl and then rob the housespack of dirty worthless whelps they ought to call out the militia and fire into em clubbing is too good for them conrad was still silent and his father sneered but i reckon you dont think so  i think the strike is useless said conrad  oh you do do you comin to your senses a little gettin tired walkin so much i should like to know what your gentlemen over there on the east side think about the strike anyway  the young fellow dropped his eyes i am not authorized to speak for them  oh indeed and perhaps youre not authorized to speak for yourself  father you know we dont agree about these things id rather not talk  but im goin to make you talk this time cried dryfoos striking the arm of the chair he sat in with the side of his fist a maddening thought of christine came over him as long as you eat my bread you have got to do as i say i wont have my children telling me what i shall do and shant do or take on airs of being holier than me now you just speak up do you think those loafers are right or dont you come  conrad apparently judged it best to speak i think they were very foolish to strikeat this time when the elevated roads can do the work  oh at this time heigh and i suppose they think over there on the east side that it d been wise to strike before we got the elevated conrad again refused to answer and his father roared what do you think  i think a strike is always bad business its war but sometimes there dont seem any other way for the workingmen to get justice they say that sometimes strikes do raise the wages after a while  those lazy devils were paid enough already shrieked the old man  they got two dollars a day how much do you think they ought to a got twenty  conrad hesitated with a beseeching look at his father but he decided to answer the men say that with partial work and fines and other things they get sometimes a dollar and sometimes ninety cents a day  they lie and you know they lie said his father rising and coming toward him and what do you think the upshot of it all will be after theyve ruined business for another week and made people hire hacks and stolen the money of honest men how is it going to end  they will have to give in  oh give in heigh and what will you say then i should like to know how will you feel about it then speak  i shall feel as i do now i know you dont think that way and i dont blame youor anybody but if i have got to say how i shall feel why i shall feel sorry they didnt succeed for i believe they have a righteous cause though they go the wrong way to help themselves  his father came close to him his eyes blazing his teeth set do you dare so say that to me  yes i cant help it i pity them my whole heart is with those poor men  you impudent puppy shouted the old man he lifted his hand and struck his son in the face conrad caught his hand with his own left and while the blood began to trickle from a wound that christines intaglio ring had made in his temple he looked at him with a kind of grieving wonder and said father  the old man wrenched his fist away and ran out of the house he remembered his address now and he gave it as he plunged into the coupe he trembled with his evil passion and glared out of the windows at the passers as he drove home he only saw conrads mild grieving wondering eyes and the blood slowly trickling from the wound in his temple  conrad went to the neatset bowl in fulkersons comfortable room and washed the blood away and kept bathing the wound with the cold water till it stopped bleeding the cut was not deep and he thought he would not put anything on it after a while he locked up the office and started out he hardly knew where but he walked on in the direction he had taken till he found himself in union square on the pavement in front of brentanos it seemed to him that he heard some one calling gently to him mr dryfoos     v  conrad looked confusedly around and the same voice said again mr dryfoos and he saw that it was a lady speaking to him from a coupe beside the curbing and then he saw that it was miss vance  she smiled when he gave signs of having discovered her and came up to the door of her carriage i am so glad to meet you i have been longing to talk to somebody nobody seems to feel about it as i do oh isnt it horrible must they fail i saw cars running on all the lines as i came across it made me sick at heart must those brave fellows give in and everybody seems to hate them soi cant bear it her face was estranged with excitement and there were traces of tears on it you must think me almost crazy to stop you in the street this way but when i caught sight of you i had to speak i knew you would sympathizei knew you would feel as i do oh how can anybody help honoring those poor men for standing by one another as they do they are risking all they have in the world for the sake of justice oh they are true heroes they are staking the bread of their wives and children on the dreadful chance theyve taken but no one seems to understand it no one seems to see that they are willing to suffer more now that other poor men may suffer less hereafter and those wretched creatures that are coming in to take their placesthose traitors  we cant blame them for wanting to earn a living miss vance said conrad  no no i dont blame them who am i to do such a thing its wepeople like me of my classwho make the poor betray one another but this dreadful fightingthis hideous paper is full of it she held up an extra crumpled with her nervous reading cant something be done to stop it dont you think that if some one went among them and tried to make them see how perfectly hopeless it was to resist the companies and drive off the new men he might do some good i have wanted to go and try but i am a woman and i mustnt i shouldnt be afraid of the strikers but im afraid of what people would say conrad kept pressing his handkerchief to the cut in his temple which he thought might be bleeding and now she noticed this are you hurt mr dryfoos you look so pale  no its nothinga little scratch ive got  indeed you look pale have you a carriage how will you get home will you get in here with me and let me drive you  no no said conrad smiling at her excitement im perfectly well  and you dont think im foolish and wicked for stopping you here and talking in this way but i know you feel as i do  yes i feel as you do you are rightright in every wayi mustnt keep yougoodbye he stepped back to bow but she put her beautiful hand out of the window and when he took it she wrung his hand hard  thank you thank you you are good and you are just but no one can do anything its useless  the type of irreproachable coachman on the box whose respectability had suffered through the strange behavior of his mistress in this interview drove quickly off at her signal and conrad stood a moment looking after the carriage his heart was full of joy it leaped he thought it would burst as he turned to walk away it seemed to him as if he mounted upon the air the trust she had shown him the praise she had given him that crush of the hand he hoped nothing he formed no idea from it but it all filled him with love that cast out the pain and shame he had been suffering he believed that he could never be unhappy any more the hardness that was in his mind toward his father went out of it he saw how sorely he had tried him he grieved that he had done it but the means the difference of his feeling about the cause of their quarrel he was solemnly glad of that since she shared it he was only sorry for his father poor father he said under his breath as he went along he explained to her about his father in his reverie and she pitied his father too  he was walking over toward the west side aimlessly at first and then at times with the longing to do something to save those mistaken men from themselves forming itself into a purpose was not that what she meant when she bewailed her womans helplessness she must have wished him to try if he being a man could not do something or if she did not still he would try and if she heard of it she would recall what she had said and would be glad he had understood her so thinking of her pleasure in what he was going to do he forgot almost what it was but when he came to a streetcar track he remembered it and looked up and down to see if there were any turbulent gathering of men whom he might mingle with and help to keep from violence he saw none anywhere and then suddenly as if at the same moment for in his exalted mood all events had a dreamlike simultaneity he stood at the corner of an avenue and in the middle of it a little way off was a streetcar and around the car a tumult of shouting cursing struggling men the driver was lashing his horses forward and a policeman was at their heads with the conductor pulling them stones clubs brickbats hailed upon the car the horses the men trying to move them the mob closed upon them in a body and then a patrolwagon whirled up from the other side and a squad of policemen leaped out and began to club the rioters conrad could see how they struck them under the rims of their hats the blows on their skulls sounded as if they had fallen on stone the rioters ran in all directions  one of the officers rushed up toward the corner where conrad stood and then he saw at his side a tall old man with a long white beard who was calling out at the policemen ah yes glup the strikerssgif it to them why dont you co and glup the bresidents that insoalt your lawss and gick your boart of arpidration outoftoors glup the strikerssthey cot no friendts they cot no money to pribe you to dreat you  the officer lifted his club and the old man threw his left arm up to shield his head conrad recognized zindau and now he saw the empty sleeve dangle in the air over the stump of his wrist he heard a shot in that turmoil beside the car and something seemed to strike him in the breast he was going to say to the policeman dont strike him hes an old soldier you see he has no hand but he could not speak he could not move his tongue the policeman stood there he saw his face it was not bad not cruel it was like the face of a statue fixed perdurablea mere image of irresponsible and involuntary authority then conrad fell forward pierced through the heart by that shot fired from the car  march heard the shot as he scrambled out of his car and at the same moment he saw lindau drop under the club of the policeman who left him where he fell and joined the rest of the squad in pursuing the rioters the fighting round the car in the avenue ceased the driver whipped his horses into a gallop and the place was left empty  march would have liked to run he thought how his wife had implored him to keep away from the rioting but he could not have left lindau lying there if he would something stronger than his will drew him to the spot and there he saw conrad dead beside the old man     vi  in the cares which mrs march shared with her husband that night she was supported partly by principle but mainly by the potent excitement which bewildered conrads family and took all reality from what had happened it was nearly midnight when the marches left them and walked away toward the elevated station with fulkerson everything had been done by that time that could be done and fulkerson was not without that satisfaction in the businesslike despatch of all the details which attends each step in such an affair and helps to make death tolerable even to the most sorely stricken we are creatures of the moment we live from one little space to another and only one interest at a time fills these fulkerson was cheerful when they got into the street almost gay and mrs march experienced a rebound from her depression which she felt that she ought not to have experienced but she condoned the offence a little in herself because her husband remained so constant in his gravity and pending the final accounting he must make her for having been where he could be of so much use from the first instant of the calamity she was tenderly gratefully proud of all the use he had been to conrads family and especially his miserable old father to her mind march was the principal actor in the whole affair and much more important in having seen it than those who had suffered in it in fact he had suffered incomparably  well well said fulkerson theyll get along now weve done all we could and theres nothing left but for them to bear it of course its awful but i guess it ll come out all right i mean he added theyll pull through now  i suppose said march that nothing is put on us that we cant bear but i should think he went on musingly that when god sees what we poor finite creatures can bear hemmed round with this eternal darkness of death he must respect us  basil said his wife but in her heart she drew nearer to him for the words she thought she ought to rebuke him for  oh i know he said we school ourselves to despise human nature but god did not make us despicable and i say whatever end he meant us for he must have some such thrill of joy in our adequacy to fate as a father feels when his son shows himself a man when i think what we can be if we must i cant believe the least of us shall finally perish  oh i reckon the almighty wont scoop any of us said fulkerson with a piety of his own  that poor boys father sighed mrs march i cant get his face out of my sight he looked so much worse than death  oh death doesnt look bad said march its life that looks so in its presence death is peace and pardon i only wish poor old lindau was as well out of it as conrad there  ah lindau he has done harm enough said mrs march i hope he will be careful after this  march did not try to defend lindau against her theory of the case which inexorably held him responsible for conrads death  lindaus going to come out all right i guess said fulkerson he was firstrate when i saw him at the hospital tonight he whispered in marchs ear at a chance he got in mounting the station stairs i didnt like to tell you there at the house but i guess youd better know they had to take lindaus arm off near the shoulder smashed all to pieces by the clubbing  in the house vainly rich and foolishly unfit for them the bereaved family whom the marches had just left lingered together and tried to get strength to part for the night they were all spent with the fatigue that comes from heaven to such misery as theirs and they sat in a torpor in which each waited for the other to move to speak  christine moved and mela spoke christine rose and went out of the room without saying a word and they heard her going upstairs then mela said  i reckon the rest of us better be goun too father here lets git mother started  she put her arm round her mother to lift her from her chair but the old man did not stir and mela called mrs mandel from the next room between them they raised her to her feet  aint there anybody agoin to set up with it she asked in her hoarse pipe it appears like folks haint got any feelins in new york woont some o the neighbors come and offer to set up without waitin to be asked  oh thats all right mother the men ll attend to that dont you bother any mela coaxed and she kept her arm round her mother with tender patience  why mely child i cant feel right to have it left to hirelins so but there aint anybody any more to see things done as they ought if coonrod was ony here  well mother you are pretty mixed said mela with a strong tendency to break into her large guffaw but she checked herself and said i know just how you feel though it keeps acomun and agoun and its so and it aint so all at once thats the plague of it well father aint you goun to come  im goin to stay mela said the old man gently without moving get your mother to bed thats a good girl  you goin to set up with him jacob asked the old woman  yes lizbeth ill set up you go to bed  well i will jacob and i believe it ll do you good to set up i wished i could set up with you but i dont seem to have the strenth i did when the twins died i must git my sleep sos toi dont like very well to have you broke of your rest jacob but there dont appear to be anybody else you wouldnt have to do it if coonrod was here there i go agin mercy mercy  well do come along then mother said mela and she got her out of the room with mrs mandels help and up the stairs  from the top the old woman called down you tell coonrod she stopped and he heard her groan out my lord my lord  he sat one silence in the diningroom where they had all lingered together and in the library beyond the hireling watcher sat another silence the time passed but neither moved and the last noise in the house ceased so that they heard each other breathe and the vague remote rumor of the city invaded the inner stillness it grew louder toward morning and then dryfoos knew from the watchers deeper breathing that he had fallen into a doze  he crept by him to the drawingroom where his son was the place was full of the awful sweetness of the flowers that fulkerson had brought and that lay above the pulseless breast the old man turned up a burner in the chandelier and stood looking on the majestic serenity of the dead face  he could not move when he saw his wife coming down the stairway in the hall she was in her long white flannel bed gown and the candle she carried shook with her nervous tremor he thought she might be walking in her sleep but she said quite simply i woke up and i couldnt git to sleep agin without comin to have a look she stood beside their dead son with him well hes beautiful jacob he was the prettiest baby and he was always good coonrod was ill say that for him i dont believe he ever give me a minutes care in his whole life i reckon i liked him about the best of all the children but i dont know as i ever done much to show it but you was always good to him jacob you always done the best for him ever since he was a little feller i used to be afraid youd spoil him sometimes in them days but i guess youre glad now for every time you didnt cross him i dont suppose since the twins died you ever hit him a lick she stooped and peered closer at the face why jacob whats that there by his pore eye dryfoos saw it too the wound that he had feared to look for and that now seemed to redden on his sight he broke into a low wavering cry like a childs in despair like an animals in terror like a souls in the anguish of remorse     vii  the evening after the funeral while the marches sat together talking it over and making approaches through its shadow to the question of their own future which it involved they were startled by the twitter of the electric bell at their apartment door it was really not so late as the childrens having gone to bed made it seem but at nine oclock it was too late for any probable visitor except fulkerson it might be he and march was glad to postpone the impending question to his curiosity concerning the immediate business fulkerson might have with him he went himself to the door and confronted there a lady deeply veiled in black and attended by a very decorous servingwoman  are you alone mr marchyou and mrs march asked the lady behind her veil and as he hesitated she said you dont know me miss vance and she threw back her veil showing her face wan and agitated in the dark folds i am very anxious to see youto speak with you both may i come in  why certainly miss vance he answered still too much stupefied by her presence to realize it  she promptly entered and saying with a glance at the hall chair by the door my maid can sit here followed him to the room where he had left his wife  mrs march showed herself more capable of coping with the fact she welcomed miss vance with the liking they both felt for the girl and with the sympathy which her troubled face inspired  i wont tire you with excuses for coming mrs march she said for it was the only thing left for me to do and i come at my aunts suggestion she added this as if it would help to account for her more on the conventional plane and she had the instinctive good taste to address herself throughout to mrs march as much as possible though what she had to say was mainly for march i dont know how to begini dont know how to speak of this terrible affair but you know what i mean i feel as if i had lived a whole lifetime since it happened i dont want you to pity me for it she said forestalling a politeness from mrs march im the last one to be thought of and you mustnt mind me if i try to make you i came to find out all of the truth that i can and when i know just what that is i shall know what to do i have read the inquest its all burned into my brain but i dont care for thatfor myself you must let me say such things without minding me i know that your husbandthat mr march was there i read his testimony and i wished to ask himto ask him she stopped and looked distractedly about but what folly he must have said everything he knewhe had to her eyes wandered to him from his wife on whom she had kept them with instinctive tact  i said everythingyes he replied but if you would like to know  perhaps i had better tell you something first i had just parted with himit couldnt have been more than half an hourin front of brentanos he must have gone straight to his death we were talking and ii said why didnt some one go among the strikers and plead with them to be peaceable and keep them from attacking the new men i knew that he felt as i did about the strikers that he was their friend did you seedo you know anything that makes you think he had been trying to do that  i am sorry march began i didnt see him at all tilltill i saw him lying dead  my husband was there purely by accident mrs march put in i had begged and entreated him not to go near the striking anywhere and he had just got out of the car and saw the policeman strike that wretched lindauhes been such an anxiety to me ever since we have had anything to do with him here my husband knew him when he was a boy in the west mr march came home from it all perfectly prostrated it made us all sick nothing so horrible ever came into our lives before i assure you it was the most shocking experience  miss vance listened to her with that look of patience which those who have seen much of the real suffering of the worldthe daily portion of the poorhave for the nervous woes of comfortable people march hung his head he knew it would be useless to protest that his share of the calamity was by comparison infinitesimally small  after she had heard mrs march to the end even of her repetitions miss vance said as if it were a mere matter of course that she should have looked the affair up yes i have seen mr lindau at the hospital  my husband goes every day to see him mrs march interrupted to give a final touch to the conception of marchs magnanimity throughout  the poor man seems to have been in the wrong at the time said miss vance  i could almost say he had earned the right to be wrong hes a man of the most generous instincts and a high ideal of justice of equitytoo high to be considered by a policeman with a club in his hand said march with a bold defiance of his wifes different opinion of lindau its the policemans business i suppose to club the ideal when he finds it inciting a riot  oh i dont blame mr lindau i dont blame the policeman he was as much a mere instrument as his club was i am only trying to find out how much i am to blame myself i had no thought of mr dryfooss going thereof his attempting to talk with the strikers and keep them quiet i was only thinking as women do of what i should try to do if i were a man  but perhaps he understood me to ask him to goperhaps my words sent him to his death  she had a sort of calm in her courage to know the worst truth as to her responsibility that forbade any wish to flatter her out of it im afraid said march that is what can never be known now after a moment he added but why should you wish to know if he went there as a peacemaker he died in a good cause in such a way as he would wish to die i believe  yes said the girl i have thought of that but death is awful we must not think patiently forgivingly of sending any one to their death in the best causei fancy life was an awful thing to conrad dryfoos march replied he was thwarted and disappointed without even pleasing the ambition that thwarted and disappointed him that poor old man his father warped him from his simple lifelong wish to be a minister and was trying to make a business man of him if it will be any consolation to you to know it miss vance i can assure you that he was very unhappy and i dont see how he could ever have been happy here  it wont said the girl steadily if people are born into this world its because they were meant to live in it it isnt a question of being happy here no one is happy in that old selfish way or can be but he could have been of great use  perhaps he was of use in dying who knows he may have been trying to silence lindau  oh lindau wasnt worth it cried mrs march  miss vance looked at her as if she did not quite understand then she turned to march he might have been unhappy as we all are but i know that his life here would have had a higher happiness than we wish for or aim for the tears began to run silently down her cheeks  he looked strangely happy that day when he left me he had hurt himself somehow and his face was bleeding from a scratch he kept his handkerchief up he was pale but such a light came into his face when he shook handsah i know he went to try and do what i said they were all silent while she dried her eyes and then put her handkerchief back into the pocket from which she had suddenly pulled it with a series of vivid youngladyish gestures which struck march by their incongruity with the occasion of their talk and yet by their harmony with the rest of her elegance i am sorry miss vance he began that i cant really tell you anything more  you are very kind she said controlling herself and rising quickly i thank youthank you both very much she turned to mrs march and shook hands with her and then with him i might have knowni did know that there wasnt anything more for you to tell but at least ive found out from you that there was nothing and now i can begin to bear what i must how are those poor creatureshis mother and father his sisters some day i hope i shall be ashamed to have postponed them to the thought of myself but i cant pretend to be yet i could not come to the funeral i wanted to  she addressed her question to mrs march who answered i can understand but they were pleased with the flowers you sent people are at such times and they havent many friends  would you go to see them asked the girl would you tell them what ive told you  mrs march looked at her husband  i dont see what good it would do they wouldnt understand but if it would relieve you  ill wait till it isnt a question of selfrelief said the girl goodbye  she left them to long debate of the event at the end mrs march said she is a strange being such a mixture of the society girl and the saint  her husband answered shes the potentiality of several kinds of fanatic shes very unhappy and i dont see how shes to be happier about that poor fellow i shouldnt be surprised if she did inspire him to attempt something of that kind  well you got out of it very well basil i admired the way you managed i was afraid youd say something awkward  oh with a plain line of truth before me as the only possible thing i can get on pretty well when it comes to anything decorative id rather leave it to you isabel  she seemed insensible of his jest of course he was in love with her that was the light that came into his face when he was going to do what he thought she wanted him to do  and shedo you think that she was  what an idea it would have been perfectly grotesque     viii  their affliction brought the dryfooses into humaner relations with the marches who had hitherto regarded them as a necessary evil as the odious means of their own prosperity mrs march found that the women of the family seemed glad of her coming and in the sense of her usefulness to them all she began to feel a kindness even for christine but she could not help seeing that between the girl and her father there was an unsettled account somehow and that it was christine and not the old man who was holding out she thought that their sorrow had tended to refine the others mela was much more subdued and except when she abandoned herself to a childish interest in her mourning she did nothing to shock mrs marchs taste or to seem unworthy of her grief she was very good to her mother whom the blow had left unchanged and to her father whom it had apparently fallen upon with crushing weight once after visiting their house mrs march described to march a little scene between dryfoos and mela when he came home from wall street and the girl met him at the door with a kind of country simpleness and took his hat and stick and brought him into the room where mrs march sat looking tired and broken she found this look of dryfooss pathetic and dwelt on the sort of stupefaction there was in it he must have loved his son more than they ever realized yes said march i suspect he did hes never been about the place since that day he was always dropping in before on his way uptown he seems to go down to wall street every day just as before but i suppose thats mechanical he wouldnt know what else to do i dare say its best for him the sanguine fulkerson is getting a little anxious about the future of every other week now conrads gone he isnt sure the old man will want to keep on with it or whether hell have to look up another angel he wants to get married i imagine and he cant venture till this point is settled  its a very material point to us too basil said mrs march  well of course i hadnt overlooked that you may be sure one of the things that fulkerson and i have discussed is a scheme for buying the magazine its success is pretty well assured now and i shouldnt be afraid to put money into itif i had the money  i couldnt let you sell the house in boston basil  and i dont want to i wish we could go back and live in it and get the rent too it would be quite a support but i suppose if dryfoos wont keep on it must come to another angel i hope it wont be a literary one with a fancy for running my department  oh i guess whoever takes the magazine will be glad enough to keep you  do you think so well perhaps but i dont believe fulkerson would let me stand long between him and an angel of the right description  well then i believe he would and youve never seen anything basil to make you really think that mr fulkerson didnt appreciate you to the utmost  i think i came pretty near an undervaluation in that lindau trouble i shall always wonder what put a backbone into fulkerson just at that crisis fulkerson doesnt strike me as the stuff of a moral hero  at any rate he was one said mrs march and thats quite enough for me  march did not answer what a noble thing life is anyway here i am well on the way to fifty after twentyfive years of hard work looking forward to the potential poorhouse as confidently as i did in youth we might have saved a little more than we have saved but the little more wouldnt avail if i were turned out of my place now and we should have lived sordidly to no purpose some one always has you by the throat unless you have some one else in your grip i wonder if thats the attitude the almighty intended his respectable creatures to take toward one another i wonder if he meant our civilization the battle we fight in the game we trick in i wonder if he considers it final and if the kingdom of heaven on earth which we pray for  have you seen lindau today mrs march asked  you inferred it from the quality of my piety march laughed and then suddenly sobered yes i saw him its going rather hard with him im afraid the amputation doesnt heal very well the shock was very great and hes old it ll take time theres so much pain that they have to keep him under opiates and i dont think he fully knew me at any rate i didnt get my piety from him today  its horrible horrible said mrs march i cant get over it after losing his hand in the war to lose his whole arm now in this way it does seem too cruel of course he oughtnt to have been there we can say that but you oughtnt to have been there either basil  well i wasnt exactly advising the police to go and club the railroad presidents  neither was poor conrad dryfoos  i dont deny it all that was distinctly the chance of life and death that belonged to god and no doubt it was law though it seems chance but what i object to is this economic chanceworld in which we live and which we men seem to have created it ought to be law as inflexible in human affairs as the order of day and night in the physical world that if a man will work he shall both rest and eat and shall not be harassed with any question as to how his repose and his provision shall come nothing less ideal than this satisfies the reason but in our state of things no one is secure of this no one is sure of finding work no one is sure of not losing it i may have my work taken away from me at any moment by the caprice the mood the indigestion of a man who has not the qualification for knowing whether i do it well or ill at my time of lifeat every time of lifea man ought to feel that if he will keep on doing his duty he shall not suffer in himself or in those who are dear to him except through natural causes but no man can feel this as things are now and so we go on pushing and pulling climbing and crawling thrusting aside and trampling underfoot lying cheating stealing and then we get to the end covered with blood and dirt and sin and shame and look back over the way weve come to a palace of our own or the poorhouse which is about the only possession we can claim in common with our brothermen i dont think the retrospect can be pleasing  i know i know said his wife i think of those things too basil life isnt what it seems when you look forward to it but i think people would suffer less and wouldnt have to work so hard and could make all reasonable provision for the future if they were not so greedy and so foolish  oh without doubt we cant put it all on the conditions we must put some of the blame on character but conditions make character and people are greedy and foolish and wish to have and to shine because having and shining are held up to them by civilization as the chief good of life we all know they are not the chief good perhaps not good at all but if some one ventures to say so all the rest of us call him a fraud and a crank and go moiling and toiling on to the palace or the poorhouse we cant help it if one were less greedy or less foolish some one else would have and would shine at his expense we dont moil and toil to ourselves alone the palace or the poorhouse is not merely for ourselves but for our children whom weve brought up in the superstition that having and shining is the chief good we dare not teach them otherwise for fear they may falter in the fight when it comes their turn and the children of others will crowd them out of the palace into the poorhouse if we felt sure that honest work shared by all would bring them honest food shared by all some heroic few of us who did not wish our children to rise above their fellowsthough we could not bear to have them fall belowmight trust them with the truth but we have no such assurance and so we go on trembling before dryfooses and living in gimcrackeries  basil basil i was always willing to live more simply than you you know i was  i know you always said so my dear but how many bellratchets and speakingtubes would you be willing to have at the street door below i remember that when we were looking for a flat you rejected every building that had a bellratchet or a speakingtube and would have nothing to do with any that had more than an electric button you wanted a hallboy with electric buttons all over him i dont blame you i find such things quite as necessary as you do  and do you mean to say basil she asked abandoning this unprofitable branch of the inquiry that you are really uneasy about your place that you are afraid mr dryfoos may give up being an angel and mr fulkerson may play you false  play me false oh it wouldnt be playing me false it would be merely looking out for himself if the new angel had editorial tastes and wanted my place its what any one would do  you wouldnt do it basil  wouldnt i well if any one offered me more salary than every other week payssay twice as muchwhat do you think my duty to my suffering family would be its give and take in the business world isabel especially take but as to being uneasy im not in the least ive the spirit of a lion when it comes to such a chance as that when i see how readily the sensibilities of the passing stranger can be worked in new york i think of taking up the role of that desperate man on third avenue who went along looking for garbage in the gutter to eat i think i could pick up at least twenty or thirty cents a day by that little game and maintain my family in the affluence its been accustomed to  basil cried his wife you dont mean to say that man was an impostor and ive gone about ever since feeling that one such case in a million the bare possibility of it was enough to justify all that lindau said about the rich and the poor  march laughed teasingly oh i dont say he was an impostor perhaps he really was hungry but if he wasnt what do you think of a civilization that makes the opportunity of such a fraud that gives us all such a bad conscience for the need which is that we weaken to the need that isnt suppose that poor fellow wasnt personally founded on fact nevertheless he represented the truth he was the ideal of the suffering which would be less effective if realistically treated that man is a great comfort to me he probably rioted for days on that quarter i gave him made a dinner very likely or a champagne supper and if every other week wants to get rid of me i intend to work that racket you can hang round the corner with bella and tom can come up to me in tears at stated intervals and ask me if ive found anything yet to be sure we might be arrested and sent up somewhere but even in that extreme case we should be provided for oh no im not afraid of losing my place ive merely a sort of psychological curiosity to know how men like dryfoos and fulkerson will work out the problem before them     ix  it was a curiosity which fulkerson himself shared at least concerning dryfoos i dont know what the old mans going to do he said to march the day after the marches had talked their future over said anything to you yet  no not a word  youre anxious i suppose same as i am fact is said fulkerson blushing a little i cant ask to have a day named till i know where i am in connection with the old man i cant tell whether ive got to look out for something else or somebody else of course its full soon yet  yes march said much sooner than it seems to us were so anxious about the future that we dont remember how very recent the past is  thats something so the old mans hardly had time yet to pull himself together well im glad you feel that way about it march i guess its more of a blow to him than we realize he was a good deal bound up in coonrod though he didnt always use him very well well i reckon its apt to happen so oftentimes curious how cruel love can be heigh were an awful mixture march  yes thats the marvel and the curse as browning says  why that poor boy himself pursued fulkerson had streaks of the mule in him that could give odds to beaton and he must have tried the old man by the way he would give in to his will and hold out against his judgment i dont believe he ever budged a hairsbreadth from his original position about wanting to be a preacher and not wanting to be a business man well of course i dont think business is all in all but it must have made the old man mad to find that without saying anything or doing anything to show it and after seeming to come over to his ground and really coming practically coonrod was just exactly where he first planted himself every time  yes people that have convictions are difficult fortunately theyre rare  do you think so it seems to me that everybodys got convictions beaton himself who hasnt a principle to throw at a dog has got convictions the size of a barn they aint always the same ones i know but theyre always to the same effect as far as beatons being number one is concerned the old mans got convictions or did have unless this thing lately has shaken him all upand he believes that money will do everything colonel woodburns got convictions that he wouldnt part with for untold millions why march you got convictions yourself  have i said march i dont know what they are  well neither do i but i know you were ready to kick the trough over for them when the old man wanted us to bounce lindau that time  oh yes said march he remembered the fact but he was still uncertain just what the convictions were that he had been so stanch for  i suppose we could have got along without you fulkerson mused aloud its astonishing how you always can get along in this world without the man that is simply indispensable makes a fellow realize that he could take a day off now and then without deranging the solar system a great deal now heres coonrodor rather he isnt but that boy managed his part of the schooner so well that i used to tremble when i thought of his getting the better of the old man and going into a convent or something of that kind and now here he is snuffed out in half a second and i dont believe but what we shall be sailing along just as chipper as usual inside of thirty days i reckon it will bring the old man to the point when i come to talk with him about whos to be put in coonrods place i dont like very well to start the subject with him but its got to be done some time  yes march admitted its terrible to think how unnecessary even the best and wisest of us is to the purposes of providence when i looked at that poor young fellows face sometimesso gentle and true and purei used to think the world was appreciably richer for his being in it but are we appreciably poorer for his being out of it now  no i dont reckon we are said fulkerson and what a lot of the raw material of all kinds the almighty must have to waste us the way he seems to do think of throwing away a precious creature like coonrod dryfoos on one chance in a thousand of getting that old fool of a lindau out of the way of being clubbed for i suppose that was what coonrod was up to say have you been round to see lindau today  something in the tone or the manner of fulkerson startled march no i havent seen him since yesterday  well i dont know said fulkerson i guess i saw him a little while after you did and that young doctor there seemed to feel kind of worried about him  or not worried exactly they cant afford to let such things worry them i suppose but  hes worse asked march  oh he didnt say so but i just wondered if youd seen him today  i think ill go now said march with a pang at heart he had gone every day to see lindau but this day he had thought he would not go and that was why his heart smote him he knew that if he were in lindaus place lindau would never have left his side if he could have helped it march tried to believe that the case was the same as it stood now it seemed to him that he was always going to or from the hospital he said to himself that it must do lindau harm to be visited so much but he knew that this was not true when he was met at the door of the ward where lindau lay by the young doctor who had come to feel a personal interest in marchs interest in lindau  he smiled without gayety and said hes just going  what discharged  oh no he has been failing very fast since you saw him yesterday and now they had been walking softly and talking softly down the aisle between the long rows of beds would you care to see him  the doctor made a slight gesture toward the white canvas screen which in such places forms the deathchamber of the poor and friendless come round this wayhe wont know you ive got rather fond of the poor old fellow he wouldnt have a clergymansort of agnostic isnt he a good many of these germans arebut the young lady whos been coming to see him  they both stopped lindaus grand patriarchal head foreshortened to their view lay white upon the pillow and his broad white beard flowed upon the sheet which heaved with those long last breaths beside his bed margaret vance was kneeling her veil was thrown back and her face was lifted she held clasped between her hands the hand of the dying man she moved her lips inaudibly     x  in spite of the experience of the whole race from time immemorial when death comes to any one we know we helplessly regard it as an incident of life which will presently go on as before perhaps this is an instinctive perception of the truth that it does go on somewhere but we have a sense of death as absolutely the end even for earth only if it relates to some one remote or indifferent to us march tried to project lindau to the necessary distance from himself in order to realize the fact in his case but he could not though the man with whom his youth had been associated in a poetic friendship had not actually reentered the region of his affection to the same degree or in any like degree the changed conditions forbade that he had a soreness of heart concerning him but he could not make sure whether this soreness was grief for his death or remorse for his own uncandor with him about dryfoos or a foreboding of that accounting with his conscience which he knew his wife would now exact of him down to the last minutest particular of their joint and several behavior toward lindau ever since they had met him in new york  he felt something knock against his shoulder and he looked up to have his hat struck from his head by a horses nose he saw the horse put his foot on the hat and he reflected now it will always look like an accordion and he heard the horses driver address him some sarcasms before he could fully awaken to the situation he was standing bareheaded in the middle of fifth avenue and blocking the tide of carriages flowing in either direction among the faces put out of the carriage windows he saw that of dryfoos looking from a coupe the old man knew him and said jump in here mr march and march who had mechanically picked up his hat and was thinking now i shall have to tell isabel about this at once and she will never trust me on the street again without her mechanically obeyed her confidence in him had been undermined by his being so near conrad when he was shot and it went through his mind that he would get dryfoos to drive him to a hatters where he could buy a new hat and not be obliged to confess his narrow escape to his wife till the incident was some days old and she could bear it better it quite drove lindaus death out of his mind for the moment and when dryfoos said if he was going home he would drive up to the first crossstreet and turn back with him march said he would be glad if he would take him to a hatstore the old man put his head out again and told the driver to take them to the fifth avenue hotel theres a hatstore around there somewhere seems to me he said and they talked of marchs accident as well as they could in the rattle and clatter of the street till they reached the place march got his hat passing a joke with the hatter about the impossibility of pressing his old hat over again and came out to thank dryfoos and take leave of him  if you aint in any great hurry the old man said i wish youd get in here a minute id like to have a little talk with you  oh certainly said march and he thought its coming now about what he intends to do with every other week well i might as well have all the misery at once and have it over  dryfoos called up to his driver who bent his head down sidewise to listen go over there on madison avenue onto that asphalt and keep drivin up and down till i stop you i cant hear myself think on these pavements he said to march but after they got upon the asphalt and began smoothly rolling over it he seemed in no haste to begin at last he said i wanted to talk with you about thatthat dutchman that was at my dinnerlindau and marchs heart gave a jump with wonder whether he could already have heard of lindaus death but in an instant he perceived that this was impossible i been talkin with fulkerson about him and he says they had to take the balance of his arm off  march nodded it seemed to him he could not speak he could not make out from the close face of the old man anything of his motive it was set but set as a piece of broken mechanism is when it has lost the power to relax itself there was no other history in it of what the man had passed through in his sons death  i dont know dryfoos resumed looking aside at the cloth windowstrap which he kept fingering as you quite understood what made me the maddest i didnt tell him i could talk dutch because i cant keep it up with a regular german but my father was pennsylvany dutch and i could understand what he was saying to you about me i know i had no business to understood it after i let him think i couldnt but i did and i didnt like very well to have a man callin me a traitor and a tyrant at my own table well i look at it differently now and i reckon i had better have tried to put up with it and i would if i could have known he stopped with a quivering lip and then went on then again i didnt like his talkin that paternalism of his i always heard it was the worst kind of thing for the country i was brought up to think the best government was the one that governs the least and i didnt want to hear that kind of talk from a man that was livin on my money i couldnt bear it from him or i thought i couldnt beforebefore he stopped again and gulped i reckon now there aint anything i couldnt bear march was moved by the blunt words and the mute stare forward with which they ended mr dryfoos i didnt know that you understood lindaus german or i shouldnt have allowed him he wouldnt have allowed himselfto go on he wouldnt have knowingly abused his position of guest to censure you no matter how much he condemned you i dont care for it now said dryfoos its all past and gone as far as im concerned but i wanted you to see that i wasnt tryin to punish him for his opinions as you said  no i see now march assented though he thought his position still justified i wish  i dont know as i understand much about his opinions anyway but i aint ready to say i want the men dependent on me to manage my business for me i always tried to do the square thing by my hands and in that particular case out there i took on all the old hands just as fast as they left their union as for the game i came on them it was dog eat dog anyway  march could have laughed to think how far this old man was from even conceiving of lindaus pointof view and how he was saying the worst of himself that lindau could have said of him no one could have characterized the kind of thing he had done more severely than he when he called it dog eat dog  theres a great deal to be said on both sides march began hoping to lead up through this generality to the fact of lindaus death but the old man went on  well all i wanted him to know is that i wasnt trying to punish him for what he said about things in general you naturally got that idea i reckon but i always went in for lettin people say what they please and think what they please its the only way in a free country  im afraid mr dryfoos that it would make little difference to lindau now  i dont suppose he bears malice for it said dryfoos but what i want to do is to have him told so he could understand just why i didnt want to be called hard names and yet i didnt object to his thinkin whatever he pleased id like him to know  no one can speak to him no one can tell him march began again but again dryfoos prevented him from going on  i understand its a delicate thing and im not askin you to do it what i would really like to doif you think he could be prepared for it some way and could stand itwould be to go to him myself and tell him just what the trouble was im in hopes if i done that he could see how i felt about it  a picture of dryfoos going to the dead lindau with his vain regrets presented itself to march and he tried once more to make the old man understand mr dryfoos he said lindau is past all that forever and he felt the ghastly comedy of it when dryfoos continued without heeding him  i got a particular reason why i want him to believe it wasnt his ideas i objected tothem ideas of his about the government carryin everything on and givin work i dont understand em exactly but i found a writinamongmy sonsthings he seemed to force the words through his teeth and i reckon hethoughtthat way kind of a diarywhere heput downhis thoughts my son and mewe differed about a goodmany things his chin shook and from time to time he stopped i wasnt very good to him i reckon i crossed him where i guess i got no business to cross him but i thought everything ofcoonrod he was the best boy from a baby that ever was just so patient and mild and done whatever he was told i ought to a let him been a preacher oh my son my son the sobs could not be kept back any longer they shook the old man with a violence that made march afraid for him but he controlled himself at last with a series of hoarse sounds like barks well its all past and gone but as i understand you from what you saw when coonrod waskilled he was tryin to save that old man from trouble  yes yes it seemed so to me  that ll do then i want you to have him come back and write for the book when he gets well i want you to find out and let me know if theres anything i can do for him ill feel as if i done itfor myson ill take him into my own house and do for him there if you say so when he gets so he can be moved ill wait on him myself its what coonrod d do if he was here i dont feel any hardness to him because it was him that got coonrod killed as you might say in one sense of the term but ive tried to think it out and i feel like i was all the more beholden to him because my son died tryin to save him whatever i do ill be doin it for coonrod and thats enough for me he seemed to have finished and he turned to march as if to hear what he had to say  march hesitated im afraid mr dryfoosdidnt fulkerson tell you that lindau was very sick  yes of course but hes all right he said  now it had to come though the fact had been latterly playing fast and loose with marchs consciousness something almost made him smile the willingness he had once felt to give this old man pain then he consoled himself by thinking that at least he was not obliged to meet dryfooss wish to make atonement with the fact that lindau had renounced him and would on no terms work for such a man as he or suffer any kindness from him in this light lindau seemed the harder of the two and march had the momentary force to say  mr dryfoosit cant be lindaui have just come from himis dead     xi  how did he take it how could he bear it oh basil i wonder you could have the heart to say it to him it was cruel  yes cruel enough my dear march owned to his wife when they talked the matter over on his return home he could not wait till the children were out of the way and afterward neither he nor his wife was sorry that he had spoken of it before them the girl cried plentifully for her old friend who was dead and said she hated mr dryfoos and then was sorry for him too and the boy listened to all and spoke with a serious sense that pleased his father but as to how he took it march went on to answer his wifes question about dryfooshow do any of us take a thing that hurts some of us cry out and some of us dont dryfoos drew a kind of long quivering breath as a child does when it grievestheres something curiously simple and primitive about himand didnt say anything after a while he asked me how he could see the people at the hospital about the remains i gave him my card to the young doctor there that had charge of lindau i suppose he was still carrying forward his plan of reparation in his mindto the dead for the dead but how useless if he could have taken the living lindau home with him and cared for him all his days what would it have profited the gentle creature whose life his worldly ambition vexed and thwarted here he might as well offer a sacrifice at conrads grave children said march turning to them death is an exile that no remorse and no love can reach remember that and be good to every one here on earth for your longing to retrieve any harshness or unkindness to the dead will be the very ecstasy of anguish to you i wonder he mused if one of the reasons why were shut up to our ignorance of what is to be hereafter isnt because if we were sure of another world we might be still more brutal to one another here in the hope of making reparation somewhere else perhaps if we ever come to obey the law of love on earth the mystery of death will be taken away  wellthe ancestral puritanism spoke in mrs marchthese two old men have been terribly punished they have both been violent and wilful and they have both been punished no one need ever tell me there is not a moral government of the universe  march always disliked to hear her talk in this way which did both her head and heart injustice and conrad he said what was he punished for  heshe answered in an exaltationhe suffered for the sins of others  ah well if you put it in that way yes that goes on continually thats another mystery  he fell to brooding on it and presently he heard his son saying i suppose papa that mr lindau died in a bad cause  march was startled he had always been so sorry for lindau and admired his courage and generosity so much that he had never fairly considered this question why yes he answered he died in the cause of disorder he was trying to obstruct the law no doubt there was a wrong there an inconsistency and an injustice that he felt keenly but it could not be reached in his way without greater wrong  yes thats what i thought said the boy and whats the use of our ever fighting about anything in america i always thought we could vote anything we wanted  we can if were honest and dont buy and sell one anothers votes said his father and men like lindau who renounce the american means as hopeless and let their love of justice hurry them into sympathy with violenceyes they are wrong and poor lindau did die in a bad cause as you say tom  i think conrad had no business there or you either basil said his wife  oh i dont defend myself said march i was there in the cause of literary curiosity and of conjugal disobedience but conradyes he had some business there it was his business to suffer there for the sins of others isabel we cant throw aside that old doctrine of the atonement yet the life of christ it wasnt only in healing the sick and going about to do good it was suffering for the sins of others thats as great a mystery as the mystery of death why should there be such a principle in the world but its been felt and more or less dumbly blindly recognized ever since calvary if we love mankind pity them we even wish to suffer for them thats what has created the religious orders in all timesthe brotherhoods and sisterhoods that belong to our day as much as to the mediaeval past thats what is driving a girl like margaret vance who has everything that the world can offer her young beauty on to the work of a sister of charity among the poor and the dying  yes yes cried mrs march howhow did she look there basil she had her feminine misgivings she was not sure but the girl was something of a poseuse and enjoyed the picturesqueness as well as the pain and she wished to be convinced that it was not so  well she said when march had told again the little there was to tell i suppose it must be a great trial to a woman like mrs horn to have her niece going that way  the way of christ asked march with a smile  oh christ came into the world to teach us how to live rightly in it too if we were all to spend our time in hospitals it would be rather dismal for the homes but perhaps you dont think the homes are worth minding she suggested with a certain note in her voice that he knew  he got up and kissed her i think the gimcrackeries are he took the hat he had set down on the parlor table on coming in and started to put it in the hall and that made her notice it  youve been getting a new hat  yes he hesitated the old one had gotwas decidedly shabby  well thats right i dont like you to wear them too long did you leave the old one to be pressed  well the hatter seemed to think it was hardly worth pressing said march he decided that for the present his wifes nerves had quite all they could bear     xii  it was in a manner grotesque but to march it was all the more natural for that reason that dryfoos should have lindaus funeral from his house he knew the old man to be darkly groping through the payment of these vain honors to the dead for some atonement to his son and he imagined him finding in them such comfort as comes from doing all one can even when all is useless  no one knew what lindaus religion was and in default they had had the anglican burial service read over him it seems so often the refuge of the homeless dead mrs dryfoos came down for the ceremony she understood that it was for coonrods sake that his father wished the funeral to be there and she confided to mrs march that she believed coonrod would have been pleased coonrod was a member of the piscopal church and fawthers doin the whole thing for coonrod as much as for anybody he thought the world of coonrod fawther did mela she kind of thought it would look queer to have two funerals from the same house handrunnin as you might call it and one of em no relation either but when she saw how fawther was bent on it she give in seems as if she was tryin to make up to fawther for coonrod as much as she could mela always was a good child but nobody can ever come up to coonrod  march felt all the grotesqueness the hopeless absurdity of dryfooss endeavor at atonement in these vain obsequies to the man for whom he believed his son to have died but the effort had its magnanimity its pathos and there was a poetry that appealed to him in the reconciliation through death of men of ideas of conditions that could only have gone warring on in life he thought as the priest went on with the solemn liturgy how all the world must come together in that peace which struggle and strive as we may shall claim us at last he looked at dryfoos and wondered whether he would consider these rites a sufficient tribute or whether there was enough in him to make him realize their futility except as a mere sign of his wish to retrieve the past he thought how we never can atone for the wrong we do the heart we have grieved and wounded cannot kindle with pity for us when once it is stilled and yet we can put our evil from us with penitence and somehow somewhere the order of loving kindness which our passion or our wilfulness has disturbed will be restored  dryfoos through fulkerson had asked all the more intimate contributors of every other week to come beaton was absent but fulkerson had brought miss woodburn with her father and mrs leighton and alma to fill up as he said mela was much present and was official with the arrangement of the flowers and the welcome of the guests she imparted this impersonality to her reception of kendricks whom fulkerson met in the outer hall with his party and whom he presented in whisper to them all kendricks smiled under his breath as it were and was then mutely and seriously polite to the leightons alma brought a little bunch of flowers which were lost in those which dryfoos had ordered to be unsparingly provided  it was a kind of satisfaction to mela to have miss vance come and reassuring as to how it would look to have the funeral there miss vance would certainly not have come unless it had been all right she had come and had sent some easter lilies  aint christine coming down fulkerson asked mela  no she aint a bit well and she aint been ever since coonrod died i dont know whats got over her said mela she added well i should a thought mr beaton would a made out to a come  beatons peculiar said fulkerson if he thinks you want him he takes a pleasure in not letting you have him  well goodness knows i dont want him said the girl  christine kept her room and for the most part kept her bed but there seemed nothing definitely the matter with her and she would not let them call a doctor her mother said she reckoned she was beginning to feel the spring weather that always perfectly pulled a body down in new york and mela said if being as cross as two sticks was any sign of springfever christine had it bad she was faithfully kind to her and submitted to all her humors but she recompensed herself by the freest criticism of christine when not in actual attendance on her christine would not suffer mrs mandel to approach her and she had with her father a sullen submission which was not resignation for her apparently conrad had not died or had died in vain  pshaw said mela one morning when she came to breakfast i reckon if we was to send up an old card of mr beatons shed rattle downstairs fast enough if shes sick shes lovesick it makes me sick to see her  mela was talking to mrs mandel but her father looked up from his plate and listened mela went on i dont know whats made the fellow quit comun but he was an aggravatun thing and no more dependable than water its just like air fulkerson said if he thinks you want him hell take a pleasure in not lettun you have him i reckon thats whats the matter with christine i believe in my heart the girl ll die if she dont git him  mela went on to eat her breakfast with her own good appetite she now always came down to keep her father company as she said and she did her best to cheer and comfort him at least she kept the talk going and she had it nearly all to herself for mrs mandel was now merely staying on provisionally and in the absence of any regrets or excuses from christine was looking ruefully forward to the moment when she must leave even this ungentle home for the chances of the ruder world outside  the old man said nothing at table but when mela went up to see if she could do anything for christine he asked mrs mandel again about all the facts of her last interview with beaton  she gave them as fully as she could remember them and the old man made no comment on them but he went out directly after and at the every other week office he climbed the stairs to fulkersons room and asked for beatons address no one yet had taken charge of conrads work and fulkerson was running the thing himself as he said till he could talk with dryfoos about it the old man would not look into the empty room where he had last seen his son alive he turned his face away and hurried by the door     xiii  the course of public events carried beatons private affairs beyond the reach of his simple first intention to renounce his connection with every other week in fact this was not perhaps so simple as it seemed and long before it could be put in effect it appeared still simpler to do nothing about the matterto remain passive and leave the initiative to dryfoos to maintain the dignity of unconsciousness and let recognition of any change in the situation come from those who had caused the change after all it was rather absurd to propose making a purely personal question the pivot on which his relations with every other week turned he took a hint from marchs position and decided that he did not know dryfoos in these relations he knew only fulkerson who had certainly had nothing to do with mrs mandels asking his intentions as he reflected upon this he became less eager to look fulkerson up and make the magazine a partner of his own sufferings this was the soberer mood to which beaton trusted that night even before he slept and he awoke fully confirmed in it as he examined the offence done him in the cold light of day he perceived that it had not come either from mrs mandel who was visibly the faltering and unwilling instrument of it or from christine who was altogether ignorant of it but from dryfoos whom he could not hurt by giving up his place he could only punish fulkerson by that and fulkerson was innocent justice and interest alike dictated the passive course to which beaton inclined and he reflected that he might safely leave the punishment of dryfoos to christine who would find out what had happened and would be able to take care of herself in any encounter of tempers with her father  beaton did not go to the office during the week that followed upon this conclusion but they were used there to these sudden absences of his and as his work for the time was in train nothing was made of his staying away except the sarcastic comment which the thought of him was apt to excite in the literary department he no longer came so much to the leightons and fulkerson was in no state of mind to miss any one there except miss woodburn whom he never missed beaton was left then unmolestedly awaiting the course of destiny when he read in the morning paper over his coffee at maronis the deeply scareheaded story of conrads death and the clubbing of lindau he probably cared as little for either of them as any man that ever saw them but he felt a shock if not a pang at conrads fate so out of keeping with his life and character he did not know what to do and he did nothing he was not asked to the funeral but he had not expected that and when fulkerson brought him notice that lindau was also to be buried from dryfooss house it was without his usual sullen vindictiveness that he kept away in his sort and as much as a man could who was necessarily so much taken up with himself he was sorry for conrads father beaton had a peculiar tenderness for his own father and he imagined how his father would feel if it were he who had been killed in conrads place as it might very well have been he sympathized with himself in view of the possibility and for once they were mistaken who thought him indifferent and merely brutal in his failure to appear at lindaus obsequies  he would really have gone if he had known how to reconcile his presence in that house with the terms of his effective banishment from it and he was rather forgivingly finding himself wronged in the situation when dryfoos knocked at the studio door the morning after lindaus funeral beaton roared out come in as he always did to a knock if he had not a model if he had a model he set the door slightly ajar and with his palette on his thumb frowned at his visitor and told him he could not come in dryfoos fumbled about for the knob in the dim passageway outside and beaton who had experience of peoples difficulties with it suddenly jerked the door open the two men stood confronted and at first sight of each other their quiescent dislike revived each would have been willing to turn away from the other but that was not possible beaton snorted some sort of inarticulate salutation which dryfoos did not try to return he asked if he could see him alone for a minute or two and beaton bade him come in and swept some paintblotched rags from the chair which he told him to take he noticed as the old man sank tremulously into it that his movement was like that of his own father and also that he looked very much like christine dryfoos folded his hands tremulously on the top of his hornhandled stick and he was rather finely haggard with the dark hollows round his black eyes and the fall of the muscles on either side of his chin he had forgotten to take his soft widebrimmed hat off and beaton felt a desire to sketch him just as he sat  dryfoos suddenly pulled himself together from the dreary absence into which he fell at first young man he began maybe ive come here on a fools errand and beaton rather fancied that beginning  but it embarrassed him a little and he said with a shy glance aside i dont know what you mean i reckon dryfoos answered quietly you got your notion though i set that woman on to speak to you the way she done but if there was anything wrong in the way she spoke or if you didnt feel like she had any right to question you up as if we suspected you of anything mean i want you to say so  beaton said nothing and the old man went on  i aint very well up in the ways of the world and i dont pretend to be all i want is to be fair and square with everybody ive made mistakes though in my time he stopped and beaton was not proof against the misery of his face which was twisted as with some strong physical ache i dont know as i want to make any more if i can help it i dont know but what you had a right to keep on comin and if you had i want you to say so dont you be afraid but what ill take it in the right way i dont want to take advantage of anybody and i dont ask you to say any more than that  beaton did not find the humiliation of the man who had humiliated him so sweet as he could have fancied it might be he knew how it had come about and that it was an effect of love for his child it did not matter by what ungracious means she had brought him to know that he loved her better than his own will that his wish for her happiness was stronger than his pride it was enough that he was now somehow brought to give proof of it beaton could not be aware of all that dark coil of circumstance through which dryfooss present action evolved itself the worst of this was buried in the secret of the old mans heart a worm of perpetual torment what was apparent to another was that he was broken by the sorrow that had fallen upon him and it was this that beaton respected and pitied in his impulse to be frank and kind in his answer  no i had no right to keep coming to your house in the way i did unlessunless i meant more than i ever said beaton added i dont say that what you did was usualin this country at any rate but i cant say you were wrong since you speak to me about the matter its only fair to myself to say that a good deal goes on in life without much thinking of consequences thats the way i excuse myself  and you say mrs mandel done right asked dryfoos as if he wished simply to be assured of a point of etiquette  yes she did right ive nothing to complain of  thats all i wanted to know said dryfoos but apparently he had not finished and he did not go though the silence that beaton now kept gave him a chance to do so he began a series of questions which had no relation to the matter in hand though they were strictly personal to beaton what countryman are you he asked after a moment  what countryman beaton frowned back at him  yes are you an american by birth  yes i was born in syracuse  protestant  my father is a scotch seceder  what business is your father in  beaton faltered and blushed then he answered  hes in the monument business as he calls it hes a tombstone cutter now that he was launched beaton saw no reason for not declaring my fathers always been a poor man and worked with his own hands for his living he had too slight esteem socially for dryfoos to conceal a fact from him that he might have wished to blink with others  well thats right said dryfoos i used to farm it myself ive got a good pile of money together now at first it didnt come easy but now its got started it pours in and pours in it seems like there was no end to it ive got well on to three million but it couldnt keep me from losin my son it cant buy me back a minute of his life not all the money in the world can do it  he grieved this out as if to himself rather than to beaton who scarcely ventured to say i knowi am very sorry  how did you come dryfoos interrupted to take up paintin  well i dont know said beaton a little scornfully you dont take a thing of that kind up i fancy i always wanted to paint  father try to stop you  no it wouldnt have been of any use why  my son he wanted to be a preacher and i did stop him or i thought i did but i reckon he was a preacher all the same every minute of his life as you say it aint any use to try to stop a thing like that i reckon if a child has got any particular bent it was given to it and its goin against the grain its goin against the law to try to bend it some other way theres lots of good business men mr beaton twenty of em to every good preacher  i imagine more than twenty said beaton amused and touched through his curiosity as to what the old man was driving at by the quaint simplicity of his speculations  father ever come to the city  no he never has the time and my mothers an invalid  oh brothers and sisters  yes were a large family  i lost two little fellerstwins said dryfoos sadly but we haint ever had but just the five ever take portraits  yes said beaton meeting this zigzag in the queries as seriously as the rest i dont think i am good at it  dryfoos got to his feet i wish youd paint a likeness of my son youve seen him plenty of times we wont fight about the price dont you be afraid of that  beaton was astonished and in a mistaken way he was disgusted he saw that dryfoos was trying to undo mrs mandels work practically and get him to come again to his house that he now conceived of the offence given him as condoned and wished to restore the former situation he knew that he was attempting this for christines sake but he was not the man to imagine that dryfoos was trying not only to tolerate him but to like him and in fact dryfoos was not wholly conscious himself of this end what they both understood was that dryfoos was endeavoring to get at beaton through conrads memory but with one this was its dedication to a purpose of self sacrifice and with the other a vulgar and shameless use of it  i couldnt do it said beaton i couldnt think of attempting it  why not dryfoos persisted we got some photographs of him he didnt like to sit very well but his mother got him to and you know how he looked  i couldnt do iti couldnt i cant even consider it im very sorry i would if it were possible but it isnt possible  i reckon if you see the photographs once  it isnt that mr dryfoos but im not in the way of that kind of thing any more  id give any price youve a mind to name  oh it isnt the money cried beaton beginning to lose control of himself  the old man did not notice him he sat with his head fallen forward and his chin resting on his folded hands thinking of the portrait he saw conrads face before him reproachful astonished but all gentle as it looked when conrad caught his hand that day after he struck him he heard him say father and the sweat gathered on his forehead oh my god he groaned no there aint anything i can do now  beaton did not know whether dryfoos was speaking to him or not he started toward him are you ill  no there aint anything the matter said the old man but i guess ill lay down on your settee a minute he tottered with beatons help to the aesthetic couch covered with a tigerskin on which beaton had once thought of painting a cleopatra but he could never get the right model as the old man stretched himself out on it pale and suffering he did not look much like a cleopatra but beaton was struck with his effectiveness and the likeness between him and his daughter she would make a very good cleopatra in some ways all the time while these thoughts passed through his mind he was afraid dryfoos would die the old man fetched his breath in gasps which presently smoothed and lengthened into his normal breathing beaton got him a glass of wine and after tasting it he sat up  youve got to excuse me he said getting back to his characteristic grimness with surprising suddenness when once he began to recover himself ive been through a good deal lately and sometimes it ketches me round the heart like a pain  in his life of selfish immunity from grief beaton could not understand this experience that poignant sorrow brings he said to himself that dryfoos was going the way of angina pectoris as he began shuffling off the tigerskin he said had you better get up wouldnt you like me to call a doctor  im all right young man dryfoos took his hat and stick from him but he made for the door so uncertainly that beaton put his hand under his elbow and helped him out and down the stairs to his coupe  hadnt you better let me drive home with you he asked  what said dryfoos suspiciously  beaton repeated his question  i guess im able to go home alone said dryfoos in a surly tone and he put his head out of the window and called up home to the driver who immediately started off and left beaton standing beside the curbstone     xiv  beaton wasted the rest of the day in the emotions and speculations which dryfooss call inspired it was not that they continuously occupied him but they broke up the train of other thoughts and spoiled him for work a very little spoiled beaton for work he required just the right mood for work he comprehended perfectly well that dryfoos had made him that extraordinary embassy because he wished him to renew his visits and he easily imagined the means that had brought him to this pass from what he knew of that girl he did not envy her father his meeting with her when he must tell her his mission had failed but had it failed when beaton came to ask himself this question he could only perceive that he and dryfoos had failed to find any ground of sympathy and had parted in the same dislike with which they had met but as to any other failure it was certainly tacit and it still rested with him to give it effect he could go back to dryfooss house as freely as before and it was clear that he was very much desired to come back but if he went back it was also clear that he must go back with intentions more explicit than before and now he had to ask himself just how much or how little he had meant by going there his liking for christine had certainly not increased but the charm on the other hand of holding a leopardess in leash had not yet palled upon him in his life of inconstancies it was a pleasure to rest upon something fixed and the man who had no control over himself liked logically enough to feel his control of some one else the fact cannot other wise be put in terms and the attraction which christine dryfoos had for him apart from this escapes from all terms as anything purely and merely passional must he had seen from the first that she was a cat and so far as youth forecasts such things he felt that she would be a shrew but he had a perverse sense of her beauty and he knew a sort of life in which her power to molest him with her temper could be reduced to the smallest proportions and even broken to pieces then the consciousness of her money entered it was evident that the old man had mentioned his millions in the way of a hint to him of what he might reasonably expect if he would turn and be his soninlaw beaton did not put it to himself in those words and in fact his cogitations were not in words at all it was the play of cognitions of sensations formlessly tending to the effect which can only be very clumsily interpreted in language but when he got to this point in them beaton rose to magnanimity and in a flash of dramatic reverie disposed of a part of dryfooss riches in placing his father and mother and his brothers and sisters beyond all pecuniary anxiety forever he had no shame no scruple in this for he had been a pensioner upon others ever since a syracusan amateur of the arts had detected his talent and given him the money to go and study abroad beaton had always considered the money a loan to be repaid out of his future success but he now never dreamt of repaying it as the man was rich he had even a contempt for the notion of repaying him but this did not prevent him from feeling very keenly the hardships he put his father to in borrowing money from him though he never repaid his father either in this reverie he saw himself sacrificed in marriage with christine dryfoos in a kind of admiring selfpity and he was melted by the spectacle of the dignity with which he suffered all the lifelong trials ensuing from his unselfishness the fancy that alma leighton came bitterly to regret him contributed to soothe and flatter him and he was not sure that margaret vance did not suffer a like loss in him  there had been times when as he believed that beautiful girls high thoughts had tended toward him there had been looks gestures even words that had this effect to him or that seemed to have had it and beaton saw that he might easily construe mrs horns confidential appeal to him to get margaret interested in art again as something by no means necessarily offensive even though it had been made to him as to a master of illusion if mrs horn had to choose between him and the life of good works to which her niece was visibly abandoning herself beaton could not doubt which she would choose the only question was how real the danger of a life of good works was  as he thought of these two girls one so charming and the other so divine it became indefinitely difficult to renounce them for christine dryfoos with her sultry temper and her earthbound ideals life had been so flattering to beaton hitherto that he could not believe them both finally indifferent and if they were not indifferent perhaps he did not wish either of them to be very definite what he really longed for was their sympathy for a man who is able to walk round quite ruthlessly on the feelings of others often has very tender feelings of his own easily lacerated and eagerly responsive to the caresses of compassion in this frame beaton determined to go that afternoon though it was not mrs horns day and call upon her in the hope of possibly seeing miss vance alone as he continued in it he took this for a sign and actually went it did not fall out at once as he wished but he got mrs horn to talking again about her niece and mrs horn again regretted that nothing could be done by the fine arts to reclaim margaret from good works  is she at home will you let me see her asked beacon with something of the scientific interest of a physician inquiring for a patient whose symptoms have been rehearsed to him he had not asked for her before  yes certainly said mrs horn and she went herself to call margaret and she did not return with her the girl entered with the gentle grace peculiar to her and beaton bent as he was on his own consolation could not help being struck with the spiritual exaltation of her look at sight of her the vague hope he had never quite relinquished that they might be something more than aesthetic friends died in his heart she wore black as she often did but in spite of its fashion her dress received a nunlike effect from the pensive absence of her face decidedly thought beaton she is far gone in good works  but he rose all the same to meet her on the old level and he began at once to talk to her of the subject he had been discussing with her aunt he said frankly that they both felt she had unjustifiably turned her back upon possibilities which she ought not to neglect  you know very well she answered that i couldnt do anything in that way worth the time i should waste on it dont talk of it please i suppose my aunt has been asking you to say this but its no use im sorry its no use she wishes it so much but im not sorry otherwise you can find the pleasure at least of doing good work in it but i couldnt find anything in it but a barren amusement mr wetmore is right for me its like enjoying an opera or a ball  thats one of wetmores phrases hed sacrifice anything to them  she put aside the whole subject with a look you were not at mr dryfooss the other day have you seen them any of them lately  i havent been there for some time no said beaton evasively but he thought if he was to get on to anything he had better be candid mr dryfoos was at my studio this morning hes got a queer notion he wants me to paint his sons portrait  she started and will you  no i couldnt do such a thing it isnt in my way i told him so his son had a beautiful face an antique profile a sort of early christian type but im too much of a pagan for that sort of thing  yes  yes beaton continued not quite liking her assent after he had invited it he had his pride in being a pagan a greek but it failed him in her presence now and he wished that she had protested he was none he was a singular creature a kind of survival an exile in our time and place i dont know we dont quite expect a saint to be rustic but with all his goodness conrad dryfoos was a country person if he were not dying for a cause you could imagine him milking beaton intended a contempt that came from the bitterness of having himself once milked the family cow  his contempt did not reach miss vance he died for a cause she said the holiest  of labor  of peace he was there to persuade the strikers to be quiet and go home  i havent been quite sure said beaton but in any case he had no business there the police were on hand to do the persuading  i cant let you talk so cried the girl its shocking oh i know its the way people talk and the worst is that in the sight of the world its the right way but the blessing on the peacemakers is not for the policemen with their clubs  beaton saw that she was nervous he made his reflection that she was altogether too far gone in good works for the fine arts to reach her he began to think how he could turn her primitive christianity to the account of his modern heathenism he had no deeper design than to get flattered back into his own favor far enough to find courage for some sort of decisive step in his heart he was trying to will whether he should or should not go back to dryfooss house it could not be from the caprice that had formerly taken him it must be from a definite purpose again he realized this of course you are right he said i wish i could have answered that old man differently i fancy he was bound up in his son though he quarrelled with him and crossed him but i couldnt do it it wasnt possible he said to himself that if she said no now he would be ruled by her agreement with him and if she disagreed with him he would be ruled still by the chance and would go no more to the dryfooses he found himself embarrassed to the point of blushing when she said nothing and left him as it were on his own hands i should like to have given him that comfort i fancy he hasnt much comfort in life but there seems no comfort in me  he dropped his head in a fit attitude for compassion but she poured no pity upon it  there is no comfort for us in ourselves she said its hard to get outside but theres only despair within when we think we have done something for others by some great effort we find its all for our own vanity  yes said beaton if i could paint pictures for righteousness sake i should have been glad to do conrad dryfoos for his father i felt sorry for him did the rest seem very much broken up you saw them all  not all miss dryfoos was ill her sister said its hard to tell how much people suffer his mother seemed bewildered the younger sister is a simple creature she looks like him i think she must have something of his spirit  not much spirit of any kind i imagine said beaton but shes amiably material did they say miss dryfoos was seriously ill  no i supposed she might be prostrated by her brothers death  does she seem that kind of person to you miss vance asked beaton  i dont know i havent tried to see so much of them as i might the past winter i was not sure about her when i met her ive never seen much of people except in my own set and thevery poor i have been afraid i didnt understand her she may have a kind of pride that would not let her do herself justice  beaton felt the unconscious dislike in the endeavor of praise then she seems to you like a person whose lifeits trials its chanceswould make more of than she is now  i didnt say that i cant judge of her at all but where we dont know dont you think we ought to imagine the best  oh yes said beaton i didnt know but what i once said of them might have prejudiced you against them i have accused myself of it he always took a tone of conscientiousness of selfcensure in talking with miss vance he could not help it  oh no and i never allowed myself to form any judgment of her she is very pretty dont you think in a kind of way  very  she has a beautiful brunette coloring that floury white and the delicate pink in it her eyes are beautiful  shes graceful too said beaton ive tried her in color but i didnt make it out  ive wondered sometimes said miss vance whether that elusive quality you find in some people you try to paint doesnt characterize them all through miss dryfoos might be ever so much finer and better than we would find out in the society way that seems the only way  perhaps said beaton gloomily and he went away profoundly discouraged by this last analysis of christines character the angelic imperviousness of miss vance to properties of which his own wickedness was so keenly aware in christine might have made him laugh if it had not been such a serious affair with him as it was he smiled to think how very differently alma leighton would have judged her from miss vances premises he liked that clear vision of almas even when it pierced his own disguises yes that was the light he had let die out and it might have shone upon his path through life beaton never felt so poignantly the disadvantage of having on any given occasion been wanting to his own interests through his selflove as in this he had no one to blame but himself for what had happened but he blamed alma for what might happen in the future because she shut out the way of retrieval and return when be thought of the attitude she had taken toward him it seemed incredible and he was always longing to give her a final chance to reverse her final judgment it appeared to him that the time had come for this now if ever     xv  while we are still young we feel a kind of pride a sort of fierce pleasure in any important experience such as we have read of or heard of in the lives of others no matter how painful it was this pride this pleasure which beaton now felt in realizing that the toils of fate were about him that between him and a future of which christine dryfoos must be the genius there was nothing but the will the mood the fancy of a girl who had not given him the hope that either could ever again be in his favor he had nothing to trust to in fact but his knowledge that he had once had them all she did not deny that but neither did she conceal that he had flung away his power over them and she had told him that they never could be his again a man knows that he can love and wholly cease to love not once merely but several times he recognizes the fact in regard to himself both theoretically and practically but in regard to women he cherishes the superstition of the romances that love is once for all and forever it was because beaton would not believe that alma leighton being a woman could put him out of her heart after suffering him to steal into it that he now hoped anything from her and she had been so explicit when they last spoke of that affair that he did not hope much he said to himself that he was going to cast himself on her mercy to take whatever chance of life love and work there was in her having the smallest pity on him if she would have none then there was but one thing he could do marry christine and go abroad he did not see how he could bring this alternative to bear upon alma even if she knew what he would do in case of a final rejection he had grounds for fearing she would not care but he brought it to bear upon himself and it nerved him to a desperate courage he could hardly wait for evening to come before he went to see her when it came it seemed to have come too soon he had wrought himself thoroughly into the conviction that he was in earnest and that everything depended upon her answer to him but it was not till he found himself in her presence and alone with her that he realized the truth of his conviction then the influences of her grace her gayety her arch beauty above all her good sense penetrated his soul like a subtle intoxication and he said to himself that he was right he could not live without her these attributes of hers were what he needed to win him to cheer him to charm him to guide him he longed so to please her to ingratiate himself with her that he attempted to be light like her in his talk but lapsed into abysmal absences and gloomy recesses of introspection  what are you laughing at he asked suddenly starting from one of these  what you are thinking of  its nothing to laugh at do you know what im thinking of  dont tell if its dreadful  oh i dare say you wouldnt think its dreadful he said with bitterness its simply the case of a man who has made a fool of himself and sees no help of retrieval in himself  can any one else help a man unmake a fool of himself she asked with a smile  yes in a case like this  dear me this is very interesting  she did not ask him what the case was but he was launched now and he pressed on i am the man who has made a fool of himself  oh  and you can help me out if you will alma i wish you could see me as i really am  do you mr beacon perhaps i do  no you dont you formulated me in a certain way and you wont allow for the change that takes place in every one you have changed why shouldnt i  has this to do with your having made a fool of yourself  yes  oh then i dont see how you have changed  she laughed and he too ruefully youre cruel not but what i deserve your mockery but the change was not from the capacity of making a fool of myself i suppose i shall always do that more or lessunless you help me alma why cant you have a little compassion you know that i must always love you  nothing makes me doubt that like your saying it mr beaton but now youve broken your word  you are to blame for that you knew i couldnt keep it  yes im to blame i was wrong to let you comeafter that and so i forgive you for speaking to me in that way again but its perfectly impossible and perfectly useless for me to hear you any more on that subject and sogoodbye  she rose and he perforce with her and do you mean it he asked forever  forever this is truly the last time i will ever see you if i can help it oh i feel sorry enough for you she said with a glance at his face i do believe you are in earnest but its too late now dont let us talk about it any more but we shall if we meet and so  and so goodbye well ive nothing more to say and i might as well say that i think youve been very good to me it seems to me as if you had beenshall i say ittrying to give me a chance is that so she dropped her eyes and did not answer  you found it was no use well i thank you for trying its curious to think that i once had your trust your regard and now i havent it you dont mind my remembering that i had itll be some little consolation and i believe it will be some help i know i cant retrieve the past now it is too late it seems too preposterousperfectly luridthat i could have been going to tell you what a tangle id got myself in and to ask you to help untangle me i must choke in the infernal coil but id like to have the sweetness of your pity in itwhatever it is  she put out her hand whatever it is i do pity you i said that  thank you he kissed the band she gave him and went  he had gone on some such terms before was it now for the last time she believed it was she felt in herself a satiety a fatigue in which his good looks his invented airs and poses his real trouble were all alike repulsive she did not acquit herself of the wrong of having let him think she might yet have liked him as she once did but she had been honestly willing to see whether she could it had mystified her to find that when they first met in new york after their summer in st barnaby she cared nothing for him she had expected to punish him for his neglect and then fancy him as before but she did not more and more she saw him selfish and mean weakwilled narrowminded and hardhearted and aimless with all his talent she admired his talent in proportion as she learned more of artists and perceived how uncommon it was but she said to herself that if she were going to devote herself to art she would do it at firsthand she was perfectly serene and happy in her final rejection of beaton he had worn out not only her fancy but her sympathy too  this was what her mother would not believe when alma reported the interview to her she would not believe it was the last time they should meet death itself can hardly convince us that it is the last time of anything of everything between ourselves and the dead well alma she said i hope youll never regret what youve done  you may be sure i shall not regret it if ever im lowspirited about anything ill think of giving mr beaton his freedom and that will cheer me up  and dont you expect to get married do you intend to be an old maid demanded her mother in the bonds of the superstition women have so long been under to the effect that every woman must wish to get married if for no other purpose than to avoid being an old maid  well mamma said alma i intend being a young one for a few years yet and then ill see if i meet the right person all well and good if not not but i shall pick and choose as a man does i wont merely be picked and chosen  you cant help yourself you may be very glad if you are picked and chosen  what nonsense mamma a girl can get any man she wants if she goes about it the right way and when my fated fairy prince comes along i shall just simply make furious love to him and grab him of course i shall make a decent pretence of talking in my sleep i believe its done that way more than half the time the fated fairy prince wouldnt see the princess in nine cases out of ten if she didnt say something he would go mooning along after the maids of honor  mrs leighton tried to look unspeakable horror but she broke down and laughed well you are a strange girl alma  i dont know about that but one thing i do know mamma and that is that prince beaton isnt the f f p for me how strange you are mamma dont you think it would be perfectly disgusting to accept a person you didnt care for and let him go on and love you and marry you its sickening  why certainly alma its only because i know you did care for him once  and now i dont and he didnt care for me once and now he does and so were quits  if i could believe  you had better brace up and try mamma for as mr fulkerson says its as sure as guns from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot hes loathsome to me and he keeps getting loathsomer ugh goodnight     xvi  well i guess shes given him the grand bounce at last said fulkerson to march in one of their moments of confidence at the office thats mads inference from appearancesand disappearances and some little hints from alma leighton  well i dont know that i have any criticisms to offer said march it may be bad for beaton but its a very good thing for miss leighton upon the whole i believe i congratulate her  well i dont know i always kind of hoped it would turn out the other way you know i always had a sneaking fondness for the fellow  miss leighton seems not to have had  its a pity she hadnt i tell you march it aint so easy for a girl to get married here in the east that she can afford to despise any chance  isnt that rather a low view of it  its a commonsense view beaton has the making of a firstrate fellow in him hes the raw material of a great artist and a good citizen all he wants is somebody to take him in hand and keep him from makin an ass of himself and kickin over the traces generally and ridin two or three horses bareback at once  it seems a simple problem though the metaphor is rather complicated said march but talk to miss leighton about it i havent given beaton the grand bounce  he began to turn over the manuscripts on his table and fulkerson went away but march found himself thinking of the matter from time to time during the day and he spoke to his wife about it when he went home she surprised him by taking fulkersons view of it  yes its a pity she couldnt have made up her mind to have him its better for a woman to be married  i thought paul only went so far as to say it was well but what would become of miss leightons artistic career if she married  oh her artistic career said mrs march with matronly contempt of it  but look here cried her husband suppose she doesnt like him  how can a girl of that age tell whether she likes any one or not  it seems to me you were able to tell at that age isabel but lets examine this thing this thing i believe fulkerson is characterizing my whole parlance as well as your morals why shouldnt we rejoice as much at a nonmarriage as a marriage when we consider the enormous risks people take in linking their lives together after not half so much thought as goes to an ordinary horse trade i think we ought to be glad whenever they dont do it i believe that this popular demand for the matrimony of others comes from our novelreading we get to thinking that there is no other happiness or goodfortune in life except marriage and its offered in fiction as the highest premium for virtue courage beauty learning and saving human life we all know it isnt we know that in reality marriage is dog cheap and anybody can have it for the askingif he keeps asking enough people byandby some fellow will wake up and see that a firstclass story can be written from the antimarriage point of view and hell begin with an engaged couple and devote his novel to disengaging them and rendering them separately happy ever after in the denouement it will make his everlasting fortune  why dont you write it basil she asked its a delightful idea you could do it splendidly  he became fascinated with the notion he developed it in detail but at the end he sighed and said with this every other week work on my hands of course i cant attempt a novel but perhaps i shant have it long  she was instantly anxious to know what he meant and the novel and miss leightons affair were both dropped out of their thoughts what do you mean has mr fulkerson said anything yet  not a word he knows no more about it than i do dryfoos hasnt spoken and were both afraid to ask him of course i couldnt ask him  no  but its pretty uncomfortable to be kept hanging by the gills so as fulkerson says  yes we dont know what to do  march and fulkerson said the same to each other and fulkerson said that if the old man pulled out he did not know what would happen he had no capital to carry the thing on and the very fact that the old man had pulled out would damage it so that it would be hard to get anybody else to put it in the mean time fulkerson was running conrads officework when he ought to be looking after the outside interests of the thing and he could not see the day when he could get married  i dont know which its worse for march you or me i dont know under the circumstances whether its worse to have a family or to want to have one of courseof course we cant hurry the old man up it wouldnt be decent and it would be dangerous we got to wait  he almost decided to draw upon dryfoos for some money he did not need any but he said maybe the demand would act as a hint upon him one day about a week after almas final rejection of beaton dryfoos came into marchs office fulkerson was out but the old man seemed not to have tried to see him  he put his hat on the floor by his chair after he sat down and looked at march awhile with his old eyes which had the vitreous glitter of old eyes stimulated to sleeplessness then he said abruptly mr march how would you like to take this thing off my hands  i dont understand exactly march began but of course he understood that dryfoos was offering to let him have every other week on some terms or other and his heart leaped with hope  the old man knew he understood and so he did not explain he said i am going to europe to take my family there the doctor thinks it might do my wife some good and i aint very well myself and my girls both want to go and so were goin if you want to take this thing off my hands i reckon i can let you have it in most any shape you say youre all settled here in new york and i dont suppose you want to break up much at your time of life and ive been thinkin whether you wouldnt like to take the thing  the word which dryfoos had now used three times made march at last think of fulkerson he had been filled too full of himself to think of any one else till he had mastered the notion of such wonderful good fortune as seemed about falling to him but now he did think of fulkerson and with some shame and confusion for he remembered how when dryfoos had last approached him there on the business of his connection with every other week he had been very haughty with him and told him that he did not know him in this connection he blushed to find how far his thoughts had now run without encountering this obstacle of etiquette  have you spoken to mr fulkerson he asked  no i haint it aint a question of management its a question of buying and selling i offer the thing to you first i reckon fulkerson couldnt get on very well without you  march saw the real difference in the two cases and he was glad to see it because he could act more decisively if not hampered by an obligation to consistency i am gratified of course mr dryfoos extremely gratified and its no use pretending that i shouldnt be happy beyond bounds to get possession of every other week but i dont feel quite free to talk about it apart from mr fulkerson  oh all right said the old man with quick offence  march hastened to say i feel bound to mr fulkerson in every way he got me to come here and i couldnt even seem to act without him  he put it questioningly and the old man answered  yes i can see that when ll he be in i can wait but he looked impatient  very soon now said march looking at his watch he was only to be gone a moment and while he went on to talk with dryfoos he wondered why the old man should have come first to speak with him and whether it was from some obscure wish to make him reparation for displeasures in the past or from a distrust or dislike of fulkerson whichever light he looked at it in it was flattering  do you think of going abroad soon he asked  what yesi dont knowi reckon we got our passage engaged its on one of them french boats were goin to paris  oh that will be interesting to the young ladies  yes i reckon were goin for them taint likely my wife and me would want to pull up stakes at our age said the old man sorrowfully  but you may find it do you good mr dryfoos said march with a kindness that was real mixed as it was with the selfish interest he now had in the intended voyage  well maybe maybe sighed the old man and he dropped his head forward it dont make a great deal of difference what we do or we dont do for the few years left  i hope mrs dryfoos is as well as usual said march finding the ground delicate and difficult  middlin middlin said the old man my daughter christine she aint very well  oh said march it was quite impossible for him to affect a more explicit interest in the fact he and dryfoos sat silent for a few moments and he was vainly casting about in his thought for something else which would tide them over the interval till fulkerson came when he heard his step on the stairs  hello hello he said meeting of the clans it was always a meeting of the clans with fulkerson or a field day or an extra session or a regular conclave whenever he saw people of any common interest together haint seen you here for a good while mr dryfoos did think some of running away with every other week one while but couldnt seem to work march up to the point  he gave dryfoos his hand and pushed aside the papers on the corner of marchs desk and sat down there and went on briskly with the nonsense he could always talk while he was waiting for another to develop any matter of business he told march afterward that he scented business in the air as soon as he came into the room where he and dryfoos were sitting  dryfoos seemed determined to leave the word to march who said after an inquiring look at him mr dryfoos has been proposing to let us have every other week fulkerson  well thats good that suits yours truly march  fulkerson publishers and proprietors wont pretend it dont if the terms are all right  the terms said the old man are whatever you want em i havent got any more use for the concern he gulped and stopped they knew what he was thinking of and they looked down in pity he went on i wont put any more money in it but what ive put in aready can stay and you can pay me four per cent  he got upon his feet and march and fulkerson stood too  well i call that pretty white said fulkerson its a bargain as far as im concerned i suppose youll want to talk it over with your wife march  yes i shall said march i can see that its a great chance but i want to talk it over with my wife  well thats right said the old man let me hear from you tomorrow  he went out and fulkerson began to dance round the room he caught march about his stalwart girth and tried to make him waltz the officeboy came to the door and looked on with approval  come come you idiot said march rooting himself to the carpet  its just throwing the thing into our mouths said fulkerson the wedding will be this day week no cards teedlelumptydiddle teedlelumptydee what do you suppose he means by it march he asked bringing himself soberly up of a sudden what is his little game or is he crazy it dont seem like the dryfoos of my previous acquaintance  i suppose march suggested that hes got money enough so that he dont care for this  pshaw youre a poet dont you know that the more money that kind of man has got the more he cares for money its some fancy of hislike having lindaus funeral at his houseby jings march i believe youre his fancy  oh now dont you be a poet fulkerson  i do he seemed to take a kind of shine to you from the day you wouldnt turn off old lindau he did indeed it kind of shook him up it made him think you had something in you he was deceived by appearances look here im going round to see mrs march with you and explain the thing to her i know mrs march she wouldnt believe you knew what you were going in for she has a great respect for your mind but she dont think youve got any sense heigh  all right said march glad of the notion and it was really a comfort to have fulkerson with him to develop all the points and it was delightful to see how clearly and quickly she seized them it made march proud of her she was only angry that they had lost any time in coming to submit so plain a case to her  mr dryfoos might change his mind in the night and then everything would be lost they must go to him instantly and tell him that they accepted they must telegraph him  might as well send a district messenger hed get there next week said fulkerson no no it ll all keep till tomorrow and be the better for it if hes got this fancy for march as i say he aint agoing to change it in a single night people dont change their fancies for march in a lifetime heigh  when fulkerson turned up very early at the office next morning as march did he was less strenuous about dryfooss fancy for march it was as if miss woodburn might have blown cold upon that theory as something unjust to his own merit for which she would naturally be more jealous than he  march told him what he had forgotten to tell him the day before though he had been trying all through their excited talk to get it in that the dryfooses were going abroad  oh ho cried fulkerson thats the milk in the cocoanut is it well i thought there must be something  but this fact had not changed mrs march at all in her conviction that it was mr dryfooss fancy for her husband which had moved him to make him this extraordinary offer and she reminded him that it had first been made to him without regard to fulkerson and perhaps she went on mr dryfoos has been changedsoftened and doesnt find money all in all any more hes had enough to change him poor old man  does anything from without change us her husband mused aloud were brought up to think so by the novelists who really have the charge of peoples thinking nowadays but i doubt it especially if the thing outside is some great event something cataclysmal like this tremendous sorrow of dryfooss  then what is it that changes us demanded his wife almost angry with him for his heresy  well it wont do to say the holy spirit indwelling that would sound like cant at this day but the old fellows that used to say that had some glimpses of the truth they knew that it is the still small voice that the soul heeds not the deafening blasts of doom i suppose i should have to say that we didnt change at all we develop theres the making of several characters in each of us we are each several characters and sometimes this character has the lead in us and sometimes that from what fulkerson has told me of dryfoos i should say he had always had the potentiality of better things in him than he has ever been yet and perhaps the time has come for the good to have its chance the growth in one direction has stopped its begun in another thats all the man hasnt been changed by his sons death it stunned it benumbed him but it couldnt change him it was an event like any other and it had to happen as much as his being born it was forecast from the beginning of time and was as entirely an effect of his coming into the world  basil basil cried his wife this is fatalism  then you think he said that a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of god and he laughed provokingly but he went on more soberly i dont know what it all means isabel though i believe it means good what did christ himself say that if one rose from the dead it would not avail and yet we are always looking for the miraculous i believe that unhappy old man truly grieves for his son whom he treated cruelly without the final intention of cruelty for he loved him and wished to be proud of him but i dont think his death has changed him any more than the smallest event in the chain of events remotely working through his nature from the beginning but why do you think hes changed at all because he offers to sell me every other week on easy terms he says himself that he has no further use for the thing and he knows perfectly well that he couldnt get his money out of it now without an enormous shrinkage he couldnt appear at this late day as the owner and sell it to anybody but fulkerson and me for a fifth of what its cost him he can sell it to us for all its cost him and four per cent is no bad interest on his money till we can pay it back its a good thing for us but we have to ask whether dryfoos has done us the good or whether its the blessing of heaven if its merely the blessing of heaven i dont propose being grateful for it  march laughed again and his wife said its disgusting  its business he assented business is business but i dont say it isnt disgusting lindau had a low opinion of it  i think that with all his faults mr dryfoos is a better man than lindau she proclaimed  well hes certainly able to offer us a better thing in every other week said march  she knew he was enamoured of the literary finish of his cynicism and that at heart he was as humbly and truly grateful as she was for the goodfortune opening to them     xvii  beaton was at his best when he parted for the last time with alma leighton for he saw then that what had happened to him was the necessary consequence of what he had been if not what he had done afterward he lost this clear vision he began to deny the fact he drew upon his knowledge of life and in arguing himself into a different frame of mind he alleged the case of different people who had done and been much worse things than he and yet no such disagreeable consequence had befallen them then he saw that it was all the work of blind chance and he said to himself that it was this that made him desperate and willing to call evil his good and to take his own wherever he could find it there was a great deal that was literary and factitious and tawdry in the mood in which he went to see christine dryfoos the night when the marches sat talking their prospects over and nothing that was decided in his purpose he knew what the drift of his mind was but he had always preferred to let chance determine his events and now since chance had played him such an ill turn with alma he left it the whole responsibility not in terms but in effect this was his thought as he walked on uptown to pay the first of the visits which dryfoos had practically invited him to resume he had an insolent satisfaction in having delayed it so long if he was going back he was going back on his own conditions and these were to be as hard and humiliating as he could make them but this intention again was inchoate floating the stuff of an intention rather than intention an expression of temperament chiefly  he had been expected before that christine had got out of mela that her father had been at beatons studio and then she had gone at the old man and got from him every smallest fact of the interview there she had flung back in his teeth the goodwill toward herself with which he had gone to beaton she was furious with shame and resentment she told him he had made bad worse that he had made a fool of himself to no end she spared neither his age nor his griefbroken spirit in which his will could not rise against hers she filled the house with her rage screaming it out upon him but when her fury was once spent she began to have some hopes from what her father had done she no longer kept her bed every evening she dressed herself in the dress beaton admired the most and sat up till a certain hour to receive him she had fixed a day in her own mind before which if he came she would forgive him all he had made her suffer the mortification the suspense the despair beyond this she had the purpose of making her father go to europe she felt that she could no longer live in america with the double disgrace that had been put upon her  beaton rang and while the servant was coming the insolent caprice seized him to ask for the young ladies instead of the old man as he had supposed of course he should do the maid who answered the bell in the place of the reluctant irishman of other days had all his hesitation in admitting that the young ladies were at home  he found mela in the drawingroom at sight of him she looked scared but she seemed to be reassured by his calm he asked if he was not to have the pleasure of seeing miss dryfoos too and mela said she reckoned the girl had gone upstairs to tell her mela was in black and beaton noted how well the solid sable became her rich redblonde beauty he wondered what the effect would be with christine  but she when she appeared was not in mourning he fancied that she wore the lustrous black silk with the breadths of white venetian lace about the neck which he had praised because he praised it her cheeks burned with a jacqueminot crimson what should be white in her face was chalky white she carried a plumed ostrich fan black and soft and after giving him her hand sat down and waved it to and fro slowly as he remembered her doing the night they first met she had no ideas except such as related intimately to herself and she had no gabble like mela and she let him talk it was past the day when she promised herself she would forgive him but as he talked on she felt all her passion for him revive and the conflict of desires the desire to hate the desire to love made a dizzying whirl in her brain she looked at him half doubting whether he was really there or not he had never looked so handsome with his dreamy eyes floating under his heavy overhanging hair and his pointed brown beard defined against his lustrous shirtfront his mellowly modulated mysterious voice lulled her when mela made an errand out of the room and beaton crossed to her and sat down by her she shivered  are you cold he asked and she felt the cruel mockery and exultant consciousness of power in his tone as perhaps a wild thing feels captivity in the voice of its keeper but now she said she would still forgive him if he asked her  mela came back and the talk fell again to the former level but beaton had not said anything that really meant what she wished and she saw that he intended to say nothing her heart began to burn like a fire in her breast  you been tellun him about our goun to europe mela asked  no said christine briefly and looking at the fan spread out on her lap  beaton asked when and then he rose and said if it was so soon he supposed he should not see them again unless he saw them in paris he might very likely run over during the summer he said to himself that he had given it a fair trial with christine and he could not make it go  christine rose with a kind of gasp and mechanically followed him to the door of the drawingroom mela came too and while he was putting on his overcoat she gurgled and bubbled in goodhumor with all the world christine stood looking at him and thinking how still handsomer he was in his overcoat and that fire burned fiercer in her she felt him more than life to her and knew him lost and the frenzy that makes a woman kill the man she loves or fling vitriol to destroy the beauty she cannot have for all hers possessed her lawless soul he gave his hand to mela and said in his windharp stop goodbye  as he put out his hand to christine she pushed it aside with a scream of rage she flashed at him and with both hands made a feline pass at the face he bent toward her he sprang back and after an instant of stupefaction he pulled open the door behind him and ran out into the street  well christine dryfoos said mela sprang at him like a wildcat  i dont care christine shrieked ill tear his eyes out she flew upstairs to her own room and left the burden of the explanation to mela who did it justice  beaton found himself he did not know how in his studio reeking with perspiration and breathless he must almost have run he struck a match with a shaking hand and looked at his face in the glass he expected to see the bleeding marks of her nails on his cheeks but he could see nothing he grovelled inwardly it was all so low and coarse and vulgar it was all so just and apt to his deserts  there was a pistol among the dusty bricabrac on the mantel which he had kept loaded to fire at a cat in the area he took it and sat looking into the muzzle wishing it might go off by accident and kill him it slipped through his hand and struck the floor and there was a report he sprang into the air feeling that he had been shot but he found himself still alive with only a burning line along his cheek such as one of christines fingernails might have left  he laughed with cynical recognition of the fact that he had got his punishment in the right way and that his case was not to be dignified into tragedy     xviii  the marches with fulkerson went to see the dryfooses off on the french steamer there was no longer any business obligation on them to be civil and there was greater kindness for that reason in the attention they offered every other week had been made over to the joint ownership of march and fulkerson and the details arranged with a hardness on dryfooss side which certainly left mrs march with a sense of his incomplete regeneration yet when she saw him there on the steamer she pitied him he looked wearied and bewildered even his wife with her twitching head and her prophecies of evil croaked hoarsely out while she clung to mrs marchs hand where they sat together till the leavetakers were ordered ashore was less pathetic mela was looking after both of them and trying to cheer them in a joyful excitement i tell em its goun to add ten years to both their lives she said the voyage ll do their healths good and then were gittun away from that miserble pack o servants that was eatun us up there in new york i hate the place she said as if they had already left it yes mrs mandels goun too she added following the direction of mrs marchs eyes where they noted mrs mandel speaking to christine on the other side of the cabin her and christine had a kind of a spat and she was goun to leave but here only the other day christine offered to make it up with her and now theyre as thick as thieves well i reckon we couldnt very well a got along without her shes about the only one that speaks french in this family  mrs marchs eyes still dwelt upon christines face it was full of a furtive wildness she seemed to be keeping a watch to prevent herself from looking as if she were looking for some one do you know mrs march said to her husband as they jingled along homeward in the christopher street bobtail car i thought she was in love with that detestable mr beaton of yours at one time and that he was amusing himself with her  i can bear a good deal isabel said march but i wish you wouldnt attribute beaton to me hes the invention of that mr fulkerson of yours  well at any rate i hope now youll both get rid of him in the reforms youre going to carry out  these reforms were for a greater economy in the management of every other week but in their very nature they could not include the suppression of beaton he had always shown himself capable and loyal to the interests of the magazine and both the new owners were glad to keep him he was glad to stay though he made a gruff pretence of indifference when they came to look over the new arrangement with him in his heart he knew that he was a fraud but at least he could say to himself with truth that he had not now the shame of taking dryfooss money  march and fulkerson retrenched at several points where it had seemed indispensable to spend as long as they were not spending their own that was only human fulkerson absorbed conrads department into his and march found that he could dispense with kendricks in the place of assistant which he had lately filled since fulkerson had decided that march was overworked they reduced the number of illustrated articles and they systematized the payment of contributors strictly according to the sales of each number on their original plan of cooperation they had got to paying rather lavishly for material without reference to the sales  fulkerson took a little time to get married and went on his wedding journey out to niagara and down the st lawrence to quebec over the line of travel that the marches had taken on their wedding journey he had the pleasure of going from montreal to quebec on the same boat on which he first met march  they have continued very good friends and their wives are almost without the rivalry that usually embitters the wives of partners at first mrs march did not like mrs fulkersons speaking of her husband as the ownah and march as the edito but it appeared that this was only a convenient method of recognizing the predominant quality in each and was meant neither to affirm nor to deny anything colonel woodburn offered as his contribution to the celebration of the copartnership which fulkerson could not be prevented from dedicating with a little dinner the story of fulkersons magnanimous behavior in regard to dryfoos at that crucial moment when it was a question whether he should give up dryfoos or give up march fulkerson winced at it but mrs march told her husband that now whatever happened she should never have any misgivings of fulkerson again and she asked him if he did not think he ought to apologize to him for the doubts with which he had once inspired her march said that he did not think so  the fulkersons spent the summer at a seaside hotel in easy reach of the city but they returned early to mrs leightons with whom they are to board till spring when they are going to fit up fulkersons bachelor apartment for housekeeping mrs march with her boston scruple thinks it will be odd living over the every other week offices but there will be a separate street entrance to the apartment and besides in new york you may do anything  the future of the leightons promises no immediate change kendricks goes there a good deal to see the fulkersons and mrs fulkerson says he comes to see alma he has seemed taken with her ever since he first met her at dryfooss the day of lindaus funeral and though fulkerson objects to dating a fancy of that kind from an occasion of that kind he justly argues with march that there can be no harm in it and that we are liable to be struck by lightning any time in the mean while there is no proof that alma returns kendrickss interest if he feels any she has got a little bit of color into the fall exhibition but the fall exhibition is never so good as the spring exhibition wetmore is rather sorry she has succeeded in this though he promoted her success he says her real hope is in black and white and it is a pity for her to lose sight of her original aim of drawing for illustration  news has come from paris of the engagement of christine dryfoos there the dryfooses met with the success denied them in new york many american plutocrats must await their apotheosis in europe where society has them as it were in a translation shortly after their arrival they were celebrated in the news papers as the first millionaire american family of naturalgas extraction who had arrived in the capital of civilization and at a french wateringplace christine encountered her fatea nobleman full of present debts and of duels in the past fulkerson says the old man can manage the debtor and christine can look out for the duellist they say those fellows generally whip their wives hed better not try it with christine i reckon unless hes practised with a panther  one day shortly after their return to town in the autumn from the brief summer outing they permitted themselves the marches met margaret vance at first they did not know her in the dress of the sisterhood which she wore but she smiled joyfully almost gayly on seeing them and though she hurried by with the sister who accompanied her and did not stay to speak they felt that the peace that passeth understanding had looked at them from her eyes  well she is at rest there cant be any doubt of that he said as he glanced round at the drifting black robe which followed her free nunlike walk  yes now she can do all the good she likes sighed his wife i wonderi wonder if she ever told his father about her talk with poor conrad that day he was shot  i dont know i dont care in any event it would be right she did nothing wrong if she unwittingly sent him to his death she sent him to die for gods sake for mans sake  yesyes but still  well we must trust that look of hers     pg editors bookmarks      affected absence of mind     be good sweet man and let who will be clever     comfort of the critical
