65927455	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                         buds and bird voices    balmy springweeks later than we expected and months later than we longed for hercomes at last to revive the moss on the roof and walls of our old mansion  she peeps brightly into my studywindow inviting me to throw it open and create a summer atmosphere by the intermixture of her genial breath with the black and cheerless comfort of the stove  as the casement ascends forth into infinite space fly the innumerable forms of thought or fancy that have kept me company in the retirement of this little chamber during the sluggish lapse of wintry weather visions gay grotesque and sad pictures of real life tinted with natures homely gray and russet scenes in dreamland bedizened with rainbow hues which faded before they were well laid onall these may vanish now and leave me to mould a fresh existence out of sunshine brooding meditation may flap her dusky wings and take her owllike right blinking amid the cheerfulness of noontide  such companions befit the season of frosted windowpanes and crackling fires when the blast howls through the blackash trees of our avenue and the drifting snowstorm chokes up the woodpaths and fills the highway from stone wall to stone wall  in the spring and summer time all sombre thoughts should follow the winter northward with the sombre and thoughtful crows the old paradisiacal economy of life is again in force we live not to think or to labor but for the simple end of being happy nothing for the present hour is worthy of mans infinite capacity save to imbibe the warm smile of heaven and sympathize with the reviving earth  the present spring comes onward with fleeter footsteps because winter lingered so unconscionably long that with her best diligence she can hardly retrieve half the allotted period of her reign  it is but a fortnight since i stood on the brink of our swollen river and beheld the accumulated ice of four frozen months go down the stream  except in streaks here and there upon the hillsides the whole visible universe was then covered with deep snow the nethermost layer of which had been deposited by an early december storm  it was a sight to make the beholder torpid in the impossibility of imagining how this vast white napkin was to be removed from the face of the corpselike world in less time than had been required to spread it there  but who can estimate the power of gentle influences whether amid material desolation or the moral winter of mans heart  there have been no tempestuous rains even no sultry days but a constant breath of southern winds with now a day of kindly sunshine and now a no less kindly mist or a soft descent of showers in which a smile and a blessing seemed to have been steeped  the snow has vanished as if by magic whatever heaps may be hidden in the woods and deep gorges of the hills only two solitary specks remain in the landscape and those i shall almost regret to miss when tomorrow i look for them in vain  never before methinks has spring pressed so closely on the footsteps of retreating winter  along the roadside the green blades of grass have sprouted on the very edge of the snowdrifts  the pastures and mowingfields have not vet assumed a general aspect of verdure but neither have they the cheerlessbrown tint which they wear in latter autumn when vegetation has entirely ceased there is now a faint shadow of life gradually brightening into the warm reality  some tracts in a happy exposureas for instance yonder southwestern slope of an orchard in front of that old red farmhouse beyond the riversuch patches of land already wear a beautiful and tender green to which no future luxuriance can add a charm  it looks unreal a prophecy a hope a transitory effect of sonic peculiar light which will vanish with the slightest motion of the eye  but beauty is never a delusion not these verdant tracts but the dark and barren landscape all around them is a shadow and a dream  each moment wins seine portion of the earth from death to life a sudden gleam of verdure brightens along the sunny slope of a bank which an instant ago was brown and bare  you look again and behold an apparition of green grass  the trees in our orchard and elsewhere are as yet naked but already appear full of life and vegetable blood  it seems as if by one magic touch they might instantaneously burst into full foliage and that the wind which now sighs through their naked branches might make sudden music amid innumerable leaves  the mossgrown willowtree which for forty years past has overshadowed these western windows will be among the first to put on its green attire  there are some objections to the willow it is not a dry and cleanly tree and impresses the beholder with an association of sliminess  no trees i think are perfectly agreeable as companions unless they have glossy leaves dry bark and a firm and hard texture of trunk and branches  but the willow is almost the earliest to gladden us with the promise and reality of beauty in its graceful and delicate foliage and the last to scatter its yellow yet scarcely withered leaves upon the ground  all through the winter too its yellow twigs give it a sunny aspect which is not without a cheering influence even in the grayest and gloomiest day  beneath a clouded sky it faithfully remembers the sunshine  our old house would lose a charm were the willow to be cut down with its golden crown over the snowcovered roof and its heap of summer verdure  the lilacshrubs under my studywindows are likewise almost in leaf in two or three days more i may put forth my hand and pluck the topmost bough in its freshest green  these lilacs are very aged and have lost the luxuriant foliage of their prime  the heart or the judgment or the moral sense or the taste is dissatisfied with their present aspect  old age is not venerable when it embodies itself in lilacs rosebushes or any other ornamental shrub it seems as if such plants as they grow only for beauty ought to flourish always in immortal youth or at least to die before their sad decrepitude  trees of beauty are trees of paradise and therefore not subject to decay by their original nature though they have lost that precious birthright by being transplanted to an earthly soil  there is a kind of ludicrous unfitness in the idea of a timestricken and grandfatherly lilacbush  the analogy holds good in human life persons who can only be graceful and ornamentalwho can give the world nothing but flowersshould die young and never be seen with gray hair and wrinkles any more than the flowershrubs with mossy bark and blighted foliage like the lilacs under my window not that beauty is worthy of less than immortality no the beautiful should live foreverand thence perhaps the sense of impropriety when we see it triumphed over by time  appletrees on the other hand grow old without reproach  let them live as long as they may and contort themselves into whatever perversity of shape they please and deck their withered limbs with a springtime gaudiness of pink blossoms still they are respectable even if they afford us only an apple or two in a season  those few applesor at all events the remembrance of apples in bygone yearsare the atonement which utilitarianism inexorably demands for the privilege of lengthened life  human flowershrubs if they will grow old on earth should besides their lovely blossoms bear some kind of fruit that will satisfy earthly appetites else neither man nor the decorum of nature will deem it fit that the moss should gather on them  one of the first things that strikes the attention when the white sheet of winter is withdrawn is the neglect and disarray that lay hidden beneath it  nature is not cleanly according to our prejudices  the beauty of preceding years now transformed to brown and blighted deformity obstructs the brightening loveliness of the present hour  our avenue is strewn with the whole crop of autumns withered leaves  there are quantities of decayed branches which one tempest after another has flung down black and rotten and one or two with the ruin of a birdsnest clinging to them  in the garden are the dried beanvines the brown stalks of the asparagusbed and melancholy old cabbages which were frozen into the soil before their unthrifty cultivator could find time to gather them  how invariably throughout all the forms of life do we find these intermingled memorials of death  on the soil of thought and in the garden of the heart as well as in the sensual world he withered leavesthe ideas and feelings that we have done with  there is no wind strong enough to sweep them away infinite space will not garner then from our sight  what mean they  why may we not be permitted to live and enjoy as if this were the first life and our own the primal enjoyment instead of treading always on these dry hones and mouldering relics from the aged accumulation of which springs all that now appears so young and new  sweet must have been the springtime of eden when no earlier year had strewn its decay upon the virgin turf and no former experience had ripened into summer and faded into autumn in the hearts of its inhabitants that was a world worth living in  o then murmurer it is out of the very wantonness of such a life that then feignest these idle lamentations  there is no decay  each human soul is the firstcreated inhabitant of its own eden  we dwell in an old mosscovered mansion and tread in the worn footprints of the past and have a gray clergymans ghost for our daily and nightly inmate yet all these outward circumstances are made less than visionary by the renewing power of the spirit  should the spirit ever lose this powershould the withered leaves and the rotten branches and the mosscovered house and the ghost of the gray past ever become its realities and the verdure and the freshness merely its faint dreamthen let it pray to be released from earth  it will need the air of heaven to revive its pristine energies  what an unlookedfor flight was this from our shadowy avenue of blackash and balm of gilead trees into the infinite  now we have our feet again upon the turf  nowhere does the grass spring up so industriously as in this homely yard along the base of the stone wall and in the sheltered nooks of the buildings and especially around the southern doorstepa locality which seems particularly favorable to its growth for it is already tall enough to bend over and wave in the wind  i observe that several weedsand most frequently a plant that stains the fingers with its yellow juicehave survived and retained their freshness and sap throughout the winter  one knows not how they have deserved such an exception from the common lot of their race  they are now the patriarchs of the departed year and may preach mortality to the present generation of flowers and weeds  among the delights of spring how is it possible to forget the birds  even the crows were welcome as the sable harbingers of a brighter and livelier race  they visited us before the snow was off but seem mostly to have betaken themselves to remote depths of the woods which they haunt all summer long  many a time shall i disturb them there and feel as if i had intruded among a company of silent worshippers as they sit in sabbath stillness among the treetops  their voices when they speak are in admirable accordance with the tranquil solitude of a summer afternoon and resounding so far above the head their loud clamor increases the religious quiet of the scene instead of breaking it  a crow however has no real pretensions to religion in spite of his gravity of mien and black attire he is certainly a thief and probably an infidel  the gulls are far more respectable in a moral point of view  these denizens of seabeaten rocks and haunters of the lonely beach come up our inland river at this season and soar high overhead flapping their broad wings in the upper sunshine  they are among the most picturesque of birds because they so float and rest upon the air as to become almost stationary parts of the landscape  the imagination has time to grow acquainted with them they have not flitted away in a moment  you go up among the clouds and greet these loftyflighted gulls and repose confidently with them upon the sustaining atmosphere  ducks have their haunts along the solitary places of the river and alight in flocks upon the broad bosom of the overflowed meadows  their flight is too rapid and determined for the eye to catch enjoyment from it although it never fails to stir up the heart with the sportsmans ineradicable instinct  they have now gone farther northward but will visit us again in autumn  the smaller birdsthe little songsters of the woods and those that haunt mans dwellings and claim human friendship by building their nests under the sheltering eaves or among the orchard treesthese require a touch more delicate and a gentler heart than mine to do them justice  their outburst of melody is like a brook let loose from wintry chains  we need not deem it a too high and solemn word to call it a hymn of praise to the creator since nature who pictures the reviving year in so many sights of beauty has expressed the sentiment of renewed life in no other sound save the notes of these blessed birds  their music however just now seems to be incidental and not the result of a set purpose  they are discussing the economy of life and love and the site and architecture of their summer residences and have no time to sit on a twig and pour forth solemn hymns or overtures operas symphonies and waltzes  anxious questions are asked grave subjects are settled in quick and animated debate and only by occasional accident as from pure ecstasy does a rich warble roll its tiny waves of golden sound through the atmosphere  their little bodies are as busy as their voices they are all a constant flutter and restlessness  even when two or three retreat to a treetop to hold council they wag their tails and heads all the time with the irrepressible activity of their nature which perhaps renders their brief span of life in reality as long as the patriarchal age of sluggish man  the blackbirds three species of which consort together are the noisiest of all our feathered citizens  great companies of themmore than the famous fourandtwenty whom mother goose has immortalizedcongregate in contiguous treetops and vociferate with all the clamor and confusion of a turbulent political meeting  politics certainly must be the occasion of such tumultuous debates but still unlike all other politicians they instil melody into their individual utterances and produce harmony as a general effect  of all bird voices none are more sweet and cheerful to my ear than those of swallows in the dim sunstreaked interior of a lofty barn they address the heart with even a closer sympathy than robinredbreast  but indeed all these winged people that dwell in the vicinity of homesteads seem to partake of human nature and possess the germ if not the development of immortal souls  we hear them saying their melodious prayers at mornings blush and eventide  a little while ago in the deep of night there came the lively thrill of a birds note from a neighboring treea real song such as greets the purple dawn or mingles with the yellow sunshine  what could the little bird mean by pouring it forth at midnight probably the music gushed out of the midst of a dream in which he fancied himself in paradise with his mate but suddenly awoke on a cold leafless bough with a new england mist penetrating through his feathers  that was a sad exchange of imagination for reality  insects are among the earliest births of sprung  multitudes of i know not what species appeared long ago on the surface of the snow clouds of them almost too minute for sight hover in a beam of sunshine and vanish as if annihilated when they pass into the shade  a mosquito has already been heard to sound the small horror of his buglehorn  wasps infest the sunny windows of the house  a bee entered one of the chambers with a prophecy of flowers  rare butterflies came before the snow was off flaunting in the chill breeze and looking forlorn and all astray in spite of the magnificence of their dark velvet cloaks with golden borders  the fields and woodpaths have as yet few charms to entice the wanderer  in a walk the other day i found no violets nor anemones nor anything in the likeness of a flower  it was worth while however to ascend our opposite hill for the sake of gaining a general idea of the advance of spring which i had hitherto been studying in its minute developments  the river lay around me in a semicircle overflowing all the meadows which give it its indian name and offering a noble breadth to sparkle in the sunbeams along the hither shore a row of trees stood up to their knees in water and afar off on the surface of the stream tufts of bushes thrust up their heads as it were to breathe the most striking objects were great solitary trees here and there with a milewide waste of water all around them  the curtailment of the trunk by its immersion in the river quite destroys the fair proportions of the tree and thus makes us sensible of a regularity and propriety in the usual forms of nature  the flood of the present seasonthough it never amounts to a freshet on our quiet streamhas encroached farther upon the land than any previous one for at least a score of years  it has overflowed stone fences and even rendered a portion of the highway navigable for boats  the waters however are now gradually subsiding islands become annexed to the mainland and other islands emerge like new creations from the watery waste  the scene supplies an admirable image of the receding of the nile except that there is no deposit of black slime or of noahs flood only that there is a freshness and novelty in these recovered portions of the continent which give the impression of a world just made rather than of one so polluted that a deluge had been requisite to purify it  these upspringing islands are the greenest spots in the landscape the first gleam of sunlight suffices to cover them with verdure  thank providence for spring  the earthand man himself by sympathy with his birthplace would be far other than we find them if life toiled wearily onward without this periodical infusion of the primal spirit  will the world ever be so decayed that spring may not renew its greenness  can man be so dismally age stricken that no faintest sunshine of his youth may revisit him once a year  it is impossible  the moss on our timeworn mansion brightens into beauty the good old pastor who once dwelt here renewed his prime regained his boyhood in the genial breezes of his ninetieth spring alas for the worn and heavy soul if whether in youth or age it have outlived its privilege of springtime sprightliness  from such a soul the world must hope no reformation of its evil no sympathy with the lofty faith and gallant struggles of those who contend in its behalf  summer works in the present and thinks not of the future autumn is a rich conservative winter has utterly lost its faith and clings tremulously to the remembrance of what has been but spring with its outgushing life is the true type of the movement
