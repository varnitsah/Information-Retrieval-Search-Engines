 turjun the panthan   xiv  kulan tiths sacrifice        glossary of names and terms     thuvia maid of mars   chapter i  carthoris and thuvia   upon a massive bench of polished ersite beneath the gorgeous blooms of a giant pimalia a woman sat  her shapely sandalled foot tapped impatiently upon the jewelstrewn walk that wound beneath the stately sorapus trees across the scarlet sward of the royal gardens of thuvan dihn jeddak of ptarth as a darkhaired redskinned warrior bent low toward her whispering heated words close to her ear  ah thuvia of ptarth he cried you are cold even before the fiery blasts of my consuming love  no harder than your heart nor colder is the hard cold ersite of this thrice happy bench which supports your divine and fadeless form  tell me o thuvia of ptarth that i may still hopethat though you do not love me now yet some day some day my princess i  the girl sprang to her feet with an exclamation of surprise and displeasure  her queenly head was poised haughtily upon her smooth red shoulders  her dark eyes looked angrily into those of the man  you forget yourself and the customs of barsoom astok she said i have given you no right thus to address the daughter of thuvan dihn nor have you won such a right  the man reached suddenly forth and grasped her by the arm  you shall be my princess he cried  by the breast of issus thou shalt nor shall any other come between astok prince of dusar and his hearts desire  tell me that there is another and i shall cut out his foul heart and fling it to the wild calots of the dead seabottoms  at touch of the mans hand upon her flesh the girl went pallid beneath her coppery skin for the persons of the royal women of the courts of mars are held but little less than sacred  the act of astok prince of dusar was profanation  there was no terror in the eyes of thuvia of ptarthonly horror for the thing the man had done and for its possible consequences  release me  her voice was levelfrigid  the man muttered incoherently and drew her roughly toward him  release me she repeated sharply or i call the guard and the prince of dusar knows what that will mean  quickly he threw his right arm about her shoulders and strove to draw her face to his lips  with a little cry she struck him full in the mouth with the massive bracelets that circled her free arm  calot she exclaimed and then  the guard  the guard  hasten in protection of the princess of ptarth  in answer to her call a dozen guardsmen came racing across the scarlet sward their gleaming longswords naked in the sun the metal of their accoutrements clanking against that of their leathern harness and in their throats hoarse shouts of rage at the sight which met their eyes  but before they had passed half across the royal garden to where astok of dusar still held the struggling girl in his grasp another figure sprang from a cluster of dense foliage that half hid a golden fountain close at hand  a tall straight youth he was with black hair and keen grey eyes broad of shoulder and narrow of hip a cleanlimbed fighting man  his skin was but faintly tinged with the copper colour that marks the red men of mars from the other races of the dying planethe was like them and yet there was a subtle difference greater even than that which lay in his lighter skin and his grey eyes  there was a difference too in his movements  he came on in great leaps that carried him so swiftly over the ground that the speed of the guardsmen was as nothing by comparison  astok still clutched thuvias wrist as the young warrior confronted him  the newcomer wasted no time and he spoke but a single word  calot he snapped and then his clenched fist landed beneath the others chin lifting him high into the air and depositing him in a crumpled heap within the centre of the pimalia bush beside the ersite bench  her champion turned toward the girl  kaor thuvia of ptarth he cried  it seems that fate timed my visit well  kaor carthoris of helium the princess returned the young mans greeting and what less could one expect of the son of such a sire  he bowed his acknowledgment of the compliment to his father john carter warlord of mars  and then the guardsmen panting from their charge came up just as the prince of dusar bleeding at the mouth and with drawn sword crawled from the entanglement of the pimalia  astok would have leaped to mortal combat with the son of dejah thoris but the guardsmen pressed about him preventing though it was clearly evident that naught would have better pleased carthoris of helium  but say the word thuvia of ptarth he begged and naught will give me greater pleasure than meting to this fellow the punishment he has earned  it cannot be carthoris she replied  even though he has forfeited all claim upon my consideration yet is he the guest of the jeddak my father and to him alone may he account for the unpardonable act he has committed  as you say thuvia replied the heliumite  but afterward he shall account to carthoris prince of helium for this affront to the daughter of my fathers friend as he spoke though there burned in his eyes a fire that proclaimed a nearer dearer cause for his championship of this glorious daughter of barsoom  the maids cheek darkened beneath the satin of her transparent skin and the eyes of astok prince of dusar darkened too as he read that which passed unspoken between the two in the royal gardens of the jeddak  and thou to me he snapped at carthoris answering the young mans challenge  the guard still surrounded astok  it was a difficult position for the young officer who commanded it  his prisoner was the son of a mighty jeddak he was the guest of thuvan dihnuntil but now an honoured guest upon whom every royal dignity had been showered to arrest him forcibly could mean naught else than war and yet he had done that which in the eyes of the ptarth warrior merited death  the young man hesitated  he looked toward his princess  she too guessed all that hung upon the action of the coming moment  for many years dusar and ptarth had been at peace with each other their great merchant ships plied back and forth between the larger cities of the two nations  even now far above the goldshot scarlet dome of the jeddaks palace she could see the huge bulk of a giant freighter taking its majestic way through the thin barsoomian air toward the west and dusar  by a word she might plunge these two mighty nations into a bloody conflict that would drain them of their bravest blood and their incalculable riches leaving them all helpless against the inroads of their envious and less powerful neighbors and at last a prey to the savage green hordes of the dead seabottoms  no sense of fear influenced her decision for fear is seldom known to the children of mars  it was rather a sense of the responsibility that she the daughter of their jeddak felt for the welfare of her fathers people  i called you padwar she said to the lieutenant of the guard to protect the person of your princess and to keep the peace that must not be violated within the royal gardens of the jeddak that is all  you will escort me to the palace and the prince of helium will accompany me  without another glance in the direction of astok she turned and taking carthoris proffered hand moved slowly toward the massive marble pile that housed the ruler of ptarth and his glittering court  on either side marched a file of guardsmen  thus thuvia of ptarth found a way out of a dilemma escaping the necessity of placing her fathers royal guest under forcible restraint and at the same time separating the two princes who otherwise would have been at each others throat the moment she and the guard had departed  beside the pimalia stood astok his dark eyes narrowed to mere slits of hate beneath his lowering brows as he watched the retreating forms of the woman who had aroused the fiercest passions of his nature and the man whom he now believed to be the one who stood between his love and its consummation  as they disappeared within the structure astok shrugged his shoulders and with a murmured oath crossed the gardens toward another wing of the building where he and his retinue were housed  that night he took formal leave of thuvan dihn and though no mention was made of the happening within the garden it was plain to see through the cold mask of the jeddaks courtesy that only the customs of royal hospitality restrained him from voicing the contempt he felt for the prince of dusar  carthoris was not present at the leavetaking nor was thuvia  the ceremony was as stiff and formal as court etiquette could make it and when the last of the dusarians clambered over the rail of the battleship that had brought them upon this fateful visit to the court of ptarth and the mighty engine of destruction had risen slowly from the ways of the landingstage a note of relief was apparent in the voice of thuvan dihn as he turned to one of his officers with a word of comment upon a subject foreign to that which had been uppermost in the minds of all for hours  but after all was it so foreign  inform prince sovan he directed that it is our wish that the fleet which departed for kaol this morning be recalled to cruise to the west of ptarth  as the warship bearing astok back to the court of his father turned toward the west thuvia of ptarth sitting upon the same bench where the prince of dusar had affronted her watched the twinkling lights of the craft growing smaller in the distance beside her in the brilliant light of the nearer moon sat carthoris his eyes were not upon the dim bulk of the battleship but on the profile of the girls upturned face  thuvia he whispered  the girl turned her eyes toward his  his hand stole out to find hers but she drew her own gently away  thuvia of ptarth i love you cried the young warrior  tell me that it does not offend  she shook her head sadly  the love of carthoris of helium she said simply could be naught but an honour to any woman but you must not speak my friend of bestowing upon me that which i may not reciprocate  the young man got slowly to his feet  his eyes were wide in astonishment  it never had occurred to the prince of helium that thuvia of ptarth might love another  but at kadabra he exclaimed  and later here at your fathers court what did you do thuvia of ptarth that might have warned me that you could not return my love  and what did i do carthoris of helium she returned that might lead you to believe that i did return it  he paused in thought and then shook his head  nothing thuvia that is true yet i could have sworn you loved me  indeed you well knew how near to worship has been my love for you  and how might i know it carthoris she asked innocently  did you ever tell me as much  ever before have words of love for me fallen from your lips  but you must have known it he exclaimed  i am like my fatherwitless in matters of the heart and of a poor way with women yet the jewels that strew these royal garden pathsthe trees the flowers the swardall must have read the love that has filled my heart since first my eyes were made new by imaging your perfect face and form so how could you alone have been blind to it  do the maids of helium pay court to their men asked thuvia  you are playing with me exclaimed carthoris  say that you are but playing and that after all you love me thuvia  i cannot tell you that carthoris for i am promised to another  her tone was level but was there not within it the hint of an infinite depth of sadness  who may say  promised to another  carthoris scarcely breathed the words  his face went almost white and then his head came up as befitted him in whose veins flowed the blood of the overlord of a world  carthoris of helium wishes you every happiness with the man of your choice he said  with and then he hesitated waiting for her to fill in the name  kulan tith jeddak of kaol she replied  my fathers friend and ptarths most puissant ally  the young man looked at her intently for a moment before he spoke again  you love him thuvia of ptarth he asked  i am promised to him she replied simply  he did not press her  he is of barsooms noblest blood and mightiest fighters mused carthoris  my fathers friend and minewould that it might have been another he muttered almost savagely  what the girl thought was hidden by the mask of her expression which was tinged only by a little shadow of sadness that might have been for carthoris herself or for them both  carthoris of helium did not ask though he noted it for his loyalty to kulan tith was the loyalty of the blood of john carter of virginia for a friend greater than which could be no loyalty  he raised a jewelencrusted bit of the girls magnificent trappings to his lips  to the honour and happiness of kulan tith and the priceless jewel that has been bestowed upon him he said and though his voice was husky there was the true ring of sincerity in it  i told you that i loved you thuvia before i knew that you were promised to another  i may not tell you it again but i am glad that you know it for there is no dishonour in it either to you or to kulan tith or to myself  my love is such that it may embrace as well kulan tithif you love him  there was almost a question in the statement  i am promised to him she replied  carthoris backed slowly away  he laid one hand upon his heart the other upon the pommel of his longsword  these are yoursalways he said  a moment later he had entered the palace and was gone from the girls sight  had he returned at once he would have found her prone upon the ersite bench her face buried in her arms  was she weeping  there was none to see   carthoris of helium had come all unannounced to the court of his fathers friend that day  he had come alone in a small flier sure of the same welcome that always awaited him at ptarth  as there had been no formality in his coming there was no need of formality in his going  to thuvan dihn he explained that he had been but testing an invention of his own with which his flier was equippeda clever improvement of the ordinary martian air compass which when set for a certain destination will remain constantly fixed thereon making it only necessary to keep a vessels prow always in the direction of the compass needle to reach any given point upon barsoom by the shortest route  carthoris improvement upon this consisted of an auxiliary device which steered the craft mechanically in the direction of the compass and upon arrival directly over the point for which the compass was set brought the craft to a standstill and lowered it also automatically to the ground  you readily discern the advantages of this invention he was saying to thuvan dihn who had accompanied him to the landingstage upon the palace roof to inspect the compass and bid his young friend farewell  a dozen officers of the court with several body servants were grouped behind the jeddak and his guest eager listeners to the conversationso eager on the part of one of the servants that he was twice rebuked by a noble for his forwardness in pushing himself ahead of his betters to view the intricate mechanism of the wonderful controlling destination compass as the thing was called  for example continued carthoris i have an allnight trip before me as tonight  i set the pointer here upon the righthand dial which represents the eastern hemisphere of barsoom so that the point rests upon the exact latitude and longitude of helium  then i start the engine roll up in my sleeping silks and furs and with lights burning race through the air toward helium confident that at the appointed hour i shall drop gently toward the landingstage upon my own palace whether i am still asleep or no  provided suggested thuvan dihn you do not chance to collide with some other night wanderer in the meanwhile  carthoris smiled  no danger of that he replied  see here and he indicated a device at the right of the destination compass this is my obstruction evader as i call it  this visible device is the switch which throws the mechanism on or off  the instrument itself is below deck geared both to the steering apparatus and the control levers  it is quite simple being nothing more than a radium generator diffusing radioactivity in all directions to a distance of a hundred yards or so from the flier  should this enveloping force be interrupted in any direction a delicate instrument immediately apprehends the irregularity at the same time imparting an impulse to a magnetic device which in turn actuates the steering mechanism diverting the bow of the flier away from the obstacle until the crafts radioactivity sphere is no longer in contact with the obstruction then she falls once more into her normal course  should the disturbance approach from the rear as in case of a fastermoving craft overhauling me the mechanism actuates the speed control as well as the steering gear and the flier shoots ahead and either up or down as the oncoming vessel is upon a lower or higher plane than herself  in aggravated cases that is when the obstructions are many or of such a nature as to deflect the bow more than fortyfive degrees in any direction or when the craft has reached its destination and dropped to within a hundred yards of the ground the mechanism brings her to a full stop at the same time sounding a loud alarm which will instantly awaken the pilot  you see i have anticipated almost every contingency  thuvan dihn smiled his appreciation of the marvellous device  the forward servant pushed almost to the fliers side  his eyes were narrowed to slits  all but one he said  the nobles looked at him in astonishment and one of them grasped the fellow none too gently by the shoulder to push him back to his proper place  carthoris raised his hand  wait he urged  let us hear what the man has to sayno creation of mortal mind is perfect  perchance he has detected a weakness that it will be well to know at once  come my good fellow and what may be the one contingency i have overlooked  as he spoke carthoris observed the servant closely for the first time  he saw a man of giant stature and handsome as are all those of the race of martian red men but the fellows lips were thin and cruel and across one cheek was the faint white line of a swordcut from the right temple to the corner of the mouth  come urged the prince of helium  speak  the man hesitated  it was evident that he regretted the temerity that had made him the centre of interested observation  but at last seeing no alternative he spoke  it might be tampered with he said by an enemy  carthoris drew a small key from his leathern pocketpouch  look at this he said handing it to the man  if you know aught of locks you will know that the mechanism which this unlooses is beyond the cunning of a picker of locks  it guards the vitals of the instrument from crafty tampering  without it an enemy must half wreck the device to reach its heart leaving his handiwork apparent to the most casual observer  the servant took the key glanced at it shrewdly and then as he made to return it to carthoris dropped it upon the marble flagging turning to look for it he planted the sole of his sandal full upon the glittering object  for an instant he bore all his weight upon the foot that covered the key then he stepped back and with an exclamation as of pleasure that he had found it stooped recovered it and returned it to the heliumite  then he dropped back to his station behind the nobles and was forgotten  a moment later carthoris had made his adieux to thuvan dihn and his nobles and with lights twinkling had risen into the starshot void of the martian night     chapter ii  slavery   as the ruler of ptarth followed by his courtiers descended from the landingstage above the palace the servants dropped into their places in the rear of their royal or noble masters and behind the others one lingered to the last  then quickly stooping he snatched the sandal from his right foot slipping it into his pocketpouch  when the party had come to the lower levels and the jeddak had dispersed them by a sign none noticed that the forward fellow who had drawn so much attention to himself before the prince of helium departed was no longer among the other servants  to whose retinue he had been attached none had thought to inquire for the followers of a martian noble are many coming and going at the whim of their master so that a new face is scarcely ever questioned as the fact that a man has passed within the palace walls is considered proof positive that his loyalty to the jeddak is beyond question so rigid is the examination of each who seeks service with the nobles of the court  a good rule that and only relaxed by courtesy in favour of the retinue of visiting royalty from a friendly foreign power  it was late in the morning of the next day that a giant serving man in the harness of the house of a great ptarth noble passed out into the city from the palace gates  along one broad avenue and then another he strode briskly until he had passed beyond the district of the nobles and had come to the place of shops  here he sought a pretentious building that rose spirelike toward the heavens its outer walls elaborately wrought with delicate carvings and intricate mosaics  it was the palace of peace in which were housed the representatives of the foreign powers or rather in which were located their embassies for the ministers themselves dwelt in gorgeous palaces within the district occupied by the nobles  here the man sought the embassy of dusar  a clerk arose questioningly as he entered and at his request to have a word with the minister asked his credentials  the visitor slipped a plain metal armlet from above his elbow and pointing to an inscription upon its inner surface whispered a word or two to the clerk  the latters eyes went wide and his attitude turned at once to one of deference  he bowed the stranger to a seat and hastened to an inner room with the armlet in his hand  a moment later he reappeared and conducted the caller into the presence of the minister  for a long time the two were closeted together and when at last the giant serving man emerged from the inner office his expression was cast in a smile of sinister satisfaction  from the palace of peace he hurried directly to the palace of the dusarian minister  that night two swift fliers left the same palace top  one sped its rapid course toward helium the other   thuvia of ptarth strolled in the gardens of her fathers palace as was her nightly custom before retiring  her silks and furs were drawn about her for the air of mars is chill after the sun has taken his quick plunge beneath the planets western verge  the girls thoughts wandered from her impending nuptials that would make her empress of kaol to the person of the trim young heliumite who had laid his heart at her feet the preceding day  whether it was pity or regret that saddened her expression as she gazed toward the southern heavens where she had watched the lights of his flier disappear the previous night it would be difficult to say  so too is it impossible to conjecture just what her emotions may have been as she discerned the lights of a flier speeding rapidly out of the distance from that very direction as though impelled toward her garden by the very intensity of the princess thoughts  she saw it circle lower above the palace until she was positive that it but hovered in preparation for a landing  presently the powerful rays of its searchlight shot downward from the bow  they fell upon the landingstage for a brief instant revealing the figures of the ptarthian guard picking into brilliant points of fire the gems upon their gorgeous harnesses  then the blazing eye swept onward across the burnished domes and graceful minarets down into court and park and garden to pause at last upon the ersite bench and the girl standing there beside it her face upturned full toward the flier  for but an instant the searchlight halted upon thuvia of ptarth then it was extinguished as suddenly as it had come to life  the flier passed on above her to disappear beyond a grove of lofty skeel trees that grew within the palace grounds  the girl stood for some time as it had left her except that her head was bent and her eyes downcast in thought  who but carthoris could it have been  she tried to feel anger that he should have returned thus spying upon her but she found it difficult to be angry with the young prince of helium  what mad caprice could have induced him so to transgress the etiquette of nations  for lesser things great powers had gone to war  the princess in her was shocked and angeredbut what of the girl  and the guardwhat of them  evidently they too had been so much surprised by the unprecedented action of the stranger that they had not even challenged but that they had no thought to let the thing go unnoticed was quickly evidenced by the skirring of motors upon the landingstage and the quick shooting airward of a longlined patrol boat  thuvia watched it dart swiftly eastward  so too did other eyes watch  within the dense shadows of the skeel grove in a wide avenue beneath oerspreading foliage a flier hung a dozen feet above the ground  from its deck keen eyes watched the farfanning searchlight of the patrol boat  no light shone from the enshadowed craft  upon its deck was the silence of the tomb  its crew of a halfdozen red warriors watched the lights of the patrol boat diminishing in the distance  the intellects of our ancestors are with us tonight said one in a low tone  no plan ever carried better returned another  they did precisely as the prince foretold  he who had first spoken turned toward the man who squatted before the control board  now he whispered  there was no other order given  every man upon the craft had evidently been well schooled in each detail of that nights work  silently the dark hull crept beneath the cathedral arches of the dark and silent grove  thuvia of ptarth gazing toward the east saw the blacker blot against the blackness of the trees as the craft topped the buttressed garden wall  she saw the dim bulk incline gently downward toward the scarlet sward of the garden  she knew that men came not thus with honourable intent  yet she did not cry aloud to alarm the nearby guardsmen nor did she flee to the safety of the palace  why  i can see her shrug her shapely shoulders in reply as she voices the ageold universal answer of the woman  because  scarce had the flier touched the ground when four men leaped from its deck  they ran forward toward the girl  still she made no sign of alarm standing as though hypnotized or could it have been as one who awaited a welcome visitor  not until they were quite close to her did she move  then the nearer moon rising above the surrounding foliage touched their faces lighting all with the brilliancy of her silver rays  thuvia of ptarth saw only strangerswarriors in the harness of dusar  now she took fright but too late  before she could voice but a single cry rough hands seized her a heavy silken scarf was wound about her head  she was lifted in strong arms and borne to the deck of the flier  there was the sudden whirl of propellers the rushing of air against her body and from far beneath the shouting and the challenge from the guard  racing toward the south another flier sped toward helium  in its cabin a tall red man bent over the soft sole of an upturned sandal with delicate instruments he measured the faint imprint of a small object which appeared there  upon a pad beside him was the outline of a key and here he noted the results of his measurements  a smile played upon his lips as he completed his task and turned to one who waited at the opposite side of the table  the man is a genius he remarked  only a genius could have evolved such a lock as this is designed to spring  here take the sketch larok and give all thine own genius full and unfettered freedom in reproducing it in metal  the warriorartificer bowed  man builds naught he said that man may not destroy  then he left the cabin with the sketch  as dawn broke upon the lofty towers which mark the twin cities of heliumthe scarlet tower of one and the yellow tower of its sistera flier floated lazily out of the north  upon its bow was emblazoned the signia of a lesser noble of a far city of the empire of helium  its leisurely approach and the evident confidence with which it moved across the city aroused no suspicion in the minds of the sleepy guard  their round of duty nearly done they had little thought beyond the coming of those who were to relieve them  peace reigned throughout helium  stagnant emasculating peace helium had no enemies  there was naught to fear  without haste the nearest air patrol swung sluggishly about and approached the stranger  at easy speaking distance the officer upon her deck hailed the incoming craft  the cheery kaor and the plausible explanation that the owner had come from distant parts for a few days of pleasure in gay helium sufficed  the airpatrol boat sheered off passing again upon its way  the stranger continued toward a public landingstage where she dropped into the ways and came to rest  at about the same time a warrior entered her cabin  it is done vas kor he said handing a small metal key to the tall noble who had just risen from his sleeping silks and furs  good exclaimed the latter  you must have worked upon it all during the night larok  the warrior nodded  now fetch me the heliumetic metal you wrought some days since commanded vas kor  this done the warrior assisted his master to replace the handsome jewelled metal of his harness with the plainer ornaments of an ordinary fighting man of helium and with the insignia of the same house that appeared upon the bow of the flier  vas kor breakfasted on board  then he emerged upon the aerial dock entered an elevator and was borne quickly to the street below where he was soon engulfed by the early morning throng of workers hastening to their daily duties  among them his warrior trappings were no more remarkable than is a pair of trousers upon broadway  all martian men are warriors save those physically unable to bear arms  the tradesman and his clerk clank with their martial trappings as they pursue their vocations  the schoolboy coming into the world as he does almost adult from the snowy shell that has encompassed his development for five long years knows so little of life without a sword at his hip that he would feel the same discomfiture at going abroad unarmed that an earth boy would experience in walking the streets knickerbockerless  vas kors destination lay in greater helium which lies some seventyfive miles across the level plain from lesser helium  he had landed at the latter city because the air patrol is less suspicious and alert than that above the larger metropolis where lies the palace of the jeddak  as he moved with the throng in the parklike canyon of the thoroughfare the life of an awakening martian city was in evidence about him houses raised high upon their slender metal columns for the night were dropping gently toward the ground  among the flowers upon the scarlet sward which lies about the buildings children were already playing and comely women laughing and chatting with their neighbours as they culled gorgeous blossoms for the vases within doors  the pleasant kaor of the barsoomian greeting fell continually upon the ears of the stranger as friends and neighbours took up the duties of a new day  the district in which he had landed was residentiala district of merchants of the more prosperous sort  everywhere were evidences of luxury and wealth  slaves appeared upon every housetop with gorgeous silks and costly furs laying them in the sun for airing jewelencrusted women lolled even thus early upon the carven balconies before their sleeping apartments  later in the day they would repair to the roofs when the slaves had arranged couches and pitched silken canopies to shade them from the sun  strains of inspiring music broke pleasantly from open windows for the martians have solved the problem of attuning the nerves pleasantly to the sudden transition from sleep to waking that proves so difficult a thing for most earth folk  above him raced the long light passenger fliers plying each in its proper plane between the numerous landingstages for internal passenger traffic  landingstages that tower high into the heavens are for the great international passenger liners  freighters have other landingstages at various lower levels to within a couple of hundred feet of the ground nor dare any flier rise or drop from one plane to another except in certain restricted districts where horizontal traffic is forbidden  along the closecropped sward which paves the avenue ground fliers were moving in continuous lines in opposite directions  for the greater part they skimmed along the surface of the sward soaring gracefully into the air at times to pass over a slowergoing driver ahead or at intersections where the north and south traffic has the right of way and the east and west must rise above it  from private hangars upon many a roof top fliers were darting into the line of traffic  gay farewells and parting admonitions mingled with the whirring of motors and the subdued noises of the city  yet with all the swift movement and the countless thousands rushing hither and thither the predominant suggestion was that of luxurious ease and soft noiselessness  martians dislike harsh discordant clamour  the only loud noises they can abide are the martial sounds of war the clash of arms the collision of two mighty dreadnoughts of the air  to them there is no sweeter music than this  at the intersection of two broad avenues vas kor descended from the street level to one of the great pneumatic stations of the city here he paid before a little wicket the fare to his destination with a couple of the dull oval coins of helium  beyond the gatekeeper he came to a slowly moving line of what to earthly eyes would have appeared to be conicalnosed eightfoot projectiles for some giant gun  in slow procession the things moved in single file along a grooved track  a half dozen attendants assisted passengers to enter or directed these carriers to their proper destination  vas kor approached one that was empty  upon its nose was a dial and a pointer  he set the pointer for a certain station in greater helium raised the arched lid of the thing stepped in and lay down upon the upholstered bottom  an attendant closed the lid which locked with a little click and the carrier continued its slow way  presently it switched itself automatically to another track to enter a moment later one of the series of darkmouthed tubes  the instant that its entire length was within the black aperture it sprang forward with the speed of a rifle ball  there was an instant of whizzinga soft though sudden stop and slowly the carrier emerged upon another platform another attendant raised the lid and vas kor stepped out at the station beneath the centre of greater helium seventyfive miles from the point at which he had embarked  here he sought the street level stepping immediately into a waiting ground flier  he spoke no word to the slave sitting in the drivers seat  it was evident that he had been expected and that the fellow had received his instructions before his coming  scarcely had vas kor taken his seat when the flier went quickly into the fastmoving procession turning presently from the broad and crowded avenue into a less congested street  presently it left the thronged district behind to enter a section of small shops where it stopped before the entrance to one which bore the sign of a dealer in foreign silks  vas kor entered the lowceiling room  a man at the far end motioned him toward an inner apartment giving no further sign of recognition until he had passed in after the caller and closed the door  then he faced his visitor saluting deferentially  most noble he commenced but vas kor silenced him with a gesture  no formalities he said  we must forget that i am aught other than your slave  if all has been as carefully carried out as it has been planned we have no time to waste  instead we should be upon our way to the slave market  are you ready  the merchant nodded and turning to a great chest produced the unemblazoned trappings of a slave  these vas kor immediately donned  then the two passed from the shop through a rear door traversed a winding alley to an avenue beyond where they entered a flier which awaited them  five minutes later the merchant was leading his slave to the public market where a great concourse of people filled the great open space in the centre of which stood the slave block  the crowds were enormous today for carthoris prince of helium was to be the principal bidder  one by one the masters mounted the rostrum beside the slave block upon which stood their chattels  briefly and clearly each recounted the virtues of his particular offering  when all were done the majordomo of the prince of helium recalled to the block such as had favourably impressed him  for such he had made a fair offer  there was little haggling as to price and none at all when vas kor was placed upon the block  his merchantmaster accepted the first offer that was made for him and thus a dusarian noble entered the household of carthoris     chapter iii  treachery   the day following the coming of vas kor to the palace of the prince of helium great excitement reigned throughout the twin cities reaching its climax in the palace of carthoris  word had come of the abduction of thuvia of ptarth from her fathers court and with it the veiled hint that the prince of helium might be suspected of considerable knowledge of the act and the whereabouts of the princess  in the council chamber of john carter warlord of mars was tardos mors jeddak of helium mors kajak his son jed of lesser helium carthoris and a score of the great nobles of the empire  there must be no war between ptarth and helium my son said john carter  that you are innocent of the charge that has been placed against you by insinuation we well know but thuvan dihn must know it well too  there is but one who may convince him and that one be you  you must hasten at once to the court of ptarth and by your presence there as well as by your words assure him that his suspicions are groundless  bear with you the authority of the warlord of barsoom and of the jeddak of helium to offer every resource of the allied powers to assist thuvan dihn to recover his daughter and punish her abductors whomsoever they may be  go  i know that i do not need to urge upon you the necessity for haste  carthoris left the council chamber and hastened to his palace  here slaves were busy in a moment setting things to rights for the departure of their master  several worked about the swift flier that would bear the prince of helium rapidly toward ptarth  at last all was done  but two armed slaves remained on guard the setting sun hung low above the horizon  in a moment darkness would envelop all  one of the guardsmen a giant of a fellow across whose right cheek there ran a thin scar from temple to mouth approached his companion his gaze was directed beyond and above his comrade  when he had come quite close he spoke  what strange craft is that he asked  the other turned about quickly to gaze heavenward  scarce was his back turned toward the giant than the shortsword of the latter was plunged beneath his left shoulder blade straight through his heart  voiceless the soldier sank in his tracksstone dead  quickly the murderer dragged the corpse into the black shadows within the hangar  then he returned to the flier  drawing a cunningly wrought key from his pocketpouch he removed the cover of the righthand dial of the controlling destination compass  for a moment he studied the construction of the mechanism beneath  then he returned the dial to its place set the pointer and removed it again to note the resultant change in the position of the parts affected by the act  a smile crossed his lips  with a pair of cutters he snipped off the projection which extended through the dial from the external pointernow the latter might be moved to any point upon the dial without affecting the mechanism below  in other words the eastern hemisphere dial was useless  now he turned his attention to the western dial  this he set upon a certain point  afterward he removed the cover of this dial also and with keen tool cut the steel finger from the under side of the pointer  as quickly as possible he replaced the second dial cover and resumed his place on guard  to all intents and purposes the compass was as efficient as before but as a matter of fact the moving of the pointers upon the dials resulted now in no corresponding shift of the mechanism beneathand the device was set immovably upon a destination of the slaves own choosing  presently came carthoris accompanied by but a handful of his gentlemen  he cast but a casual glance upon the single slave who stood guard  the fellows thin cruel lips and the swordcut that ran from temple to mouth aroused the suggestion of an unpleasant memory within him  he wondered where saran tal had found the man then the matter faded from his thoughts and in another moment the prince of helium was laughing and chatting with his companions though below the surface his heart was cold with dread for what contingencies confronted thuvia of ptarth he could not even guess  first to his mind naturally had sprung the thought that astok of dusar had stolen the fair ptarthian but almost simultaneously with the report of the abduction had come news of the great fetes at dusar in honour of the return of the jeddaks son to the court of his father  it could not have been he thought carthoris for on the very night that thuvia was taken astok had been in dusar and yet  he entered the flier exchanging casual remarks with his companions as he unlocked the mechanism of the compass and set the pointer upon the capital city of ptarth  with a word of farewell he touched the button which controlled the repulsive rays and as the flier rose lightly into the air the engine purred in answer to the touch of his finger upon a second button the propellers whirred as his hand drew back the speed lever and carthoris prince of helium was off into the gorgeous martian night beneath the hurtling moons and the million stars  scarce had the flier found its speed ere the man wrapping his sleeping silks and furs about him stretched at full length upon the narrow deck to sleep  but sleep did not come at once at his bidding  instead his thoughts ran riot in his brain driving sleep away he recalled the words of thuvia of ptarth words that had half assured him that she loved him for when he had asked her if she loved kulan tith she had answered only that she was promised to him  now he saw that her reply was open to more than a single construction it might of course mean that she did not love kulan tith and so by inference be taken to mean that she loved another  but what assurance was there that the other was carthoris of helium  the more he thought upon it the more positive he became that not only was there no assurance in her words that she loved him but none either in any act of hers  no the fact was she did not love him  she loved another  she had not been abductedshe had fled willingly with her lover  with such pleasant thoughts filling him alternately with despair and rage carthoris at last dropped into the sleep of utter mental exhaustion  the breaking of the sudden dawn found him still asleep  his flier was rushing swiftly above a barren ochre plainthe worldold bottom of a longdead martian sea  in the distance rose low hills  toward these the craft was headed as it approached them a great promontory might have been seen from its deck stretching out into what had once been a mighty ocean and circling back once more to enclose the forgotten harbour of a forgotten city which still stretched back from its deserted quays an imposing pile of wondrous architecture of a longdead past  the countless dismal windows vacant and forlorn stared sightless from their marble walls the whole sad city taking on the semblance of scattered mounds of dead mens sunbleached skullsthe casements having the appearance of eyeless sockets the portals grinning jaws  closer came the flier but now its speed was diminishingyet this was not ptarth  above the central plaza it stopped slowly settling marsward within a hundred yards of the ground it came to rest floating gently in the light air and at the same instant an alarm sounded at the sleepers ear  carthoris sprang to his feet  below him he looked to see the teeming metropolis of ptarth  beside him already there should have been an air patrol  he gazed about in bewildered astonishment  there indeed was a great city but it was not ptarth  no multitudes surged through its broad avenues  no signs of life broke the dead monotony of its deserted roof tops  no gorgeous silks no priceless furs lent life and colour to the cold marble and the gleaming ersite  no patrol boat lay ready with its familiar challenge  silent and empty lay the great cityempty and silent the surrounding air  what had happened  carthoris examined the dial of his compass  the pointer was set upon ptarth  could the creature of his genius have thus betrayed him  he would not believe it  quickly he unlocked the cover turning it back upon its hinge  a single glance showed him the truth or at least a part of itthe steel projection that communicated the movement of the pointer upon the dial to the heart of the mechanism beneath had been severed  who could have done the thingand why  carthoris could not hazard even a faint guess  but the thing now was to learn in what portion of the world he was and then take up his interrupted journey once more  if it had been the purpose of some enemy to delay him he had succeeded well thought carthoris as he unlocked the cover of the second dial the first having shown that its pointer had not been set at all  beneath the second dial he found the steel pin severed as in the other but the controlling mechanism had first been set for a point upon the western hemisphere  he had just time to judge his location roughly at some place southwest of helium and at a considerable distance from the twin cities when he was startled by a womans scream beneath him  leaning over the side of the flier he saw what appeared to be a red woman being dragged across the plaza by a huge green warriorone of those fierce cruel denizens of the dead seabottoms and deserted cities of dying mars  carthoris waited to see no more  reaching for the control board he sent his craft racing plummetlike toward the ground  the green man was hurrying his captive toward a huge thoat that browsed upon the ochre vegetation of the once scarletgorgeous plaza  at the same instant a dozen red warriors leaped from the entrance of a nearby ersite palace pursuing the abductor with naked swords and shouts of rageful warning  once the woman turned her face upward toward the falling flier and in the single swift glance carthoris saw that it was thuvia of ptarth     chapter iv  a green mans captive   when the light of day broke upon the little craft to whose deck the princess of ptarth had been snatched from her fathers garden thuvia saw that the night had wrought a change in her abductors  no longer did their trappings gleam with the metal of dusar but instead there was emblazoned there the insignia of the prince of helium  the girl felt renewed hope for she could not believe that in the heart of carthoris could lie intent to harm her  she spoke to the warrior squatting before the control board  last night you wore the trappings of a dusarian she said  now your metal is that of helium  what means it  the man looked at her with a grin  the prince of helium is no fool he said  just then an officer emerged from the tiny cabin  he reprimanded the warrior for conversing with the prisoner nor would he himself reply to any of her inquiries  no harm was offered her during the journey and so they came at last to their destination with the girl no wiser as to her abductors or their purpose than at first  here the flier settled slowly into the plaza of one of those mute monuments of mars dead and forgotten pastthe deserted cities that fringe the sad ochre seabottoms where once rolled the mighty floods upon whose bosoms moved the maritime commerce of the peoples that are gone for ever  thuvia of ptarth was no stranger to such places  during her wanderings in search of the river iss that time she had set out upon what for countless ages had been the last long pilgrimage of martians toward the valley dor where lies the lost sea of korus she had encountered several of these sad reminders of the greatness and the glory of ancient barsoom  and again during her flight from the temples of the holy therns with tars tarkas jeddak of thark she had seen them with their weird and ghostly inmates the great white apes of barsoom  she knew too that many of them were used now by the nomadic tribes of green men but that among them all was no city that the red men did not shun for without exception they stood amidst vast waterless tracts unsuited for the continued sustenance of the dominant race of martians  why then should they be bringing her to such a place  there was but a single answer  such was the nature of their work that they must needs seek the seclusion that a dead city afforded  the girl trembled at thought of her plight  for two days her captors kept her within a huge palace that even in decay reflected the splendour of the age which its youth had known  just before dawn on the third day she had been aroused by the voices of two of her abductors  he should be here by dawn one was saying  have her in readiness upon the plazaelse he will never land  the moment he finds that he is in a strange country he will turn aboutmethinks the princes plan is weak in this one spot  there was no other way replied the other  it is wondrous work to get them both here at all and even if we do not succeed in luring him to the ground we shall have accomplished much  just then the speaker caught the eyes of thuvia upon him revealed by the quickmoving patch of light cast by thuria in her mad race through the heavens  with a quick sign to the other he ceased speaking and advancing toward the girl motioned her to rise  then he led her out into the night toward the centre of the great plaza  stand here he commanded until we come for you  we shall be watching and should you attempt to escape it will go ill with youmuch worse than death  such are the princes orders  then he turned and retraced his steps toward the palace leaving her alone in the midst of the unseen terrors of the haunted city for in truth these places are haunted in the belief of many martians who still cling to an ancient superstition which teaches that the spirits of holy therns who die before their allotted one thousand years pass on occasions into the bodies of the great white apes  to thuvia however the real danger of attack by one of these ferocious manlike beasts was quite sufficient  she no longer believed in the weird soul transmigration that the therns had taught her before she was rescued from their clutches by john carter but she well knew the horrid fate that awaited her should one of the terrible beasts chance to spy her during its nocturnal prowlings  what was that  surely she could not be mistaken  something had moved stealthily in the shadow of one of the great monoliths that line the avenue where it entered the plaza opposite her  thar ban jed among the hordes of torquas rode swiftly across the ochre vegetation of the dead seabottom toward the ruins of ancient aaanthor  he had ridden far that night and fast for he had but come from the despoiling of the incubator of a neighbouring green horde with which the hordes of torquas were perpetually warring  his giant thoat was far from jaded yet it would be well thought thar ban to permit him to graze upon the ochre moss which grows to greater height within the protected courtyards of deserted cities where the soil is richer than on the seabottoms and the plants partly shaded from the sun during the cloudless martian day  within the tiny stems of this dryseeming plant is sufficient moisture for the needs of the huge bodies of the mighty thoats which can exist for months without water and for days without even the slight moisture which the ochre moss contains  as thar ban rode noiselessly up the broad avenue which leads from the quays of aaanthor to the great central plaza he and his mount might have been mistaken for spectres from a world of dreams so grotesque the man and beast so soundless the great thoats padded nailless feet upon the mossgrown flagging of the ancient pavement  the man was a splendid specimen of his race  fully fifteen feet towered his great height from sole to pate  the moonlight glistened against his glossy green hide sparkling the jewels of his heavy harness and the ornaments that weighted his four muscular arms while the upcurving tusks that protruded from his lower jaw gleamed white and terrible  at the side of his thoat were slung his long radium rifle and his great fortyfoot metalshod spear while from his own harness depended his longsword and his shortsword as well as his lesser weapons  his protruding eyes and antennaelike ears were turning constantly hither and thither for thar ban was yet in the country of the enemy and too there was always the menace of the great white apes which john carter was wont to say are the only creatures that can arouse in the breasts of these fierce denizens of the dead seabottoms even the remotest semblance of fear  as the rider neared the plaza he reined suddenly in  his slender tubular ears pointed rigidly forward  an unwonted sound had reached them  voices  and where there were voices outside of torquas there too were enemies  all the world of wide barsoom contained naught but enemies for the fierce torquasians  thar ban dismounted  keeping in the shadows of the great monoliths that line the avenue of quays of sleeping aaanthor he approached the plaza  directly behind him as a hound at heel came the slategrey thoat his white belly shadowed by his barrel his vivid yellow feet merging into the yellow of the moss beneath them  in the centre of the plaza thar ban saw the figure of a red woman a red warrior was conversing with her  now the man turned and retraced his steps toward the palace at the opposite side of the plaza  thar ban watched until he had disappeared within the yawning portal  here was a captive worth having  seldom did a female of their hereditary enemies fall to the lot of a green man  thar ban licked his thin lips  thuvia of ptarth watched the shadow behind the monolith at the opening to the avenue opposite her  she hoped that it might be but the figment of an overwrought imagination  but no  now clearly and distinctly she saw it move  it came from behind the screening shelter of the ersite shaft  the sudden light of the rising sun fell upon it  the girl trembled the thing was a huge green warrior  swiftly it sprang toward her  she screamed and tried to flee but she had scarce turned toward the palace when a giant hand fell upon her arm she was whirled about and half dragged half carried toward a huge thoat that was slowly grazing out of the avenues mouth on to the ochre moss of the plaza  at the same instant she turned her face upward toward the whirring sound of something above her and there she saw a swift flier dropping toward her the head and shoulders of a man leaning far over the side but the mans features were deeply shadowed so that she did not recognize them  now from behind her came the shouts of her red abductors  they were racing madly after him who dared to steal what they already had stolen  as thar ban reached the side of his mount he snatched his long radium rifle from its boot and wheeling poured three shots into the oncoming red men  such is the uncanny marksmanship of these martian savages that three red warriors dropped in their tracks as three projectiles exploded in their vitals  the others halted nor did they dare return the fire for fear of wounding the girl  then thar ban vaulted to the back of his thoat thuvia of ptarth still in his arms and with a savage cry of triumph disappeared down the black canyon of the avenue of quays between the sullen palaces of forgotten aaanthor  carthoris flier had not touched the ground before he had sprung from its deck to race after the swift thoat whose eight long legs were sending it down the avenue at the rate of an express train but the men of dusar who still remained alive had no mind to permit so valuable a capture to escape them  they had lost the girl  that would be a difficult thing to explain to astok but some leniency might be expected could they carry the prince of helium to their master instead  so the three who remained set upon carthoris with their longswords crying to him to surrender but they might as successfully have cried aloud to thuria to cease her mad hurtling through the barsoomian sky for carthoris of helium was a true son of the warlord of mars and his incomparable dejah thoris  carthoris longsword had been already in his hand as he leaped from the deck of the flier so the instant that he realized the menace of the three red warriors he wheeled to face them meeting their onslaught as only john carter himself might have done  so swift his sword so mighty and agile his halfearthly muscles that one of his opponents was down crimsoning the ochre moss with his lifeblood when he had scarce made a single pass at carthoris  now the two remaining dusarians rushed simultaneously upon the heliumite  three longswords clashed and sparkled in the moonlight until the great white apes roused from their slumbers crept to the lowering windows of the dead city to view the bloody scene beneath them  thrice was carthoris touched so that the red blood ran down his face blinding him and dyeing his broad chest  with his free hand he wiped the gore from his eyes and with the fighting smile of his father touching his lips leaped upon his antagonists with renewed fury  a single cut of his heavy sword severed the head of one of them and then the other backing away clear of that point of death turned and fled toward the palace at his back  carthoris made no step to pursue  he had other concern than the meting of even welldeserved punishment to strange men who masqueraded in the metal of his own house for he had seen that these men were tricked out in the insignia that marked his personal followers  turning quickly toward his flier he was soon rising from the plaza in pursuit of thar ban  the red warrior whom he had put to flight turned in the entrance to the palace and seeing carthoris intent snatched a rifle from those that he and his fellows had left leaning against the wall as they had rushed out with drawn swords to prevent the theft of their prisoner  few red men are good shots for the sword is their chosen weapon so now as the dusarian drew bead upon the rising flier and touched the button upon his rifles stock it was more to chance than proficiency that he owed the partial success of his aim  the projectile grazed the fliers side the opaque coating breaking sufficiently to permit daylight to strike in upon the powder phial within the bullets nose  there was a sharp explosion  carthoris felt his craft reel drunkenly beneath him and the engine stopped  the momentum the air boat had gained carried her on over the city toward the seabottom beyond  the red warrior in the plaza fired several more shots none of which scored  then a lofty minaret shut the drifting quarry from his view  in the distance before him carthoris could see the green warrior bearing thuvia of ptarth away upon his mighty thoat  the direction of his flight was toward the northwest of aaanthor where lay a mountainous country little known to red men  the heliumite now gave his attention to his injured craft  a close examination revealed the fact that one of the buoyancy tanks had been punctured but the engine itself was uninjured  a splinter from the projectile had damaged one of the control levers beyond the possibility of repair outside a machine shop but after considerable tinkering carthoris was able to propel his wounded flier at low speed a rate which could not approach the rapid gait of the thoat whose eight long powerful legs carried it over the ochre vegetation of the dead seabottom at terrific speed  the prince of helium chafed and fretted at the slowness of his pursuit yet he was thankful that the damage was no worse for now he could at least move more rapidly than on foot  but even this meagre satisfaction was soon to be denied him for presently the flier commenced to sag toward the port and by the bow the damage to the buoyancy tanks had evidently been more grievous than he had at first believed  all the balance of that long day carthoris crawled erratically through the still air the bow of the flier sinking lower and lower and the list to port becoming more and more alarming until at last near dark he was floating almost bowdown his harness buckled to a heavy deck ring to keep him from being precipitated to the ground below  his forward movement was now confined to a slow drifting with the gentle breeze that blew out of the southeast and when this died down with the setting of the sun he let the flier sink gently to the mossy carpet beneath  far before him loomed the mountains toward which the green man had been fleeing when last he had seen him and with dogged resolution the son of john carter endowed with the indomitable will of his mighty sire took up the pursuit on foot  all that night he forged ahead until with the dawning of a new day he entered the low foothills that guard the approach to the fastness of the mountains of torquas  rugged granitic walls towered before him  nowhere could he discern an opening through the formidable barrier yet somewhere into this inhospitable world of stone the green warrior had borne the woman of the red mans hearts desire  across the yielding moss of the seabottom there had been no spoor to follow for the soft pads of the thoat but pressed down in his swift passage the resilient vegetation which sprang up again behind his fleeting feet leaving no sign  but here in the hills where loose rock occasionally strewed the way where black loam and wild flowers partially replaced the sombre monotony of the waste places of the lowlands carthoris hoped to find some sign that would lead him in the right direction  yet search as he would the baffling mystery of the trail seemed likely to remain for ever unsolved  it was drawing toward the days close once more when the keen eyes of the heliumite discerned the tawny yellow of a sleek hide moving among the boulders several hundred yards to his left  crouching quickly behind a large rock carthoris watched the thing before him  it was a huge banth one of those savage barsoomian lions that roam the desolate hills of the dying planet  the creatures nose was close to the ground  it was evident that he was following the spoor of meat by scent  as carthoris watched him a great hope leaped into the mans heart here possibly might lie the solution to the mystery he had been endeavouring to solve  this hungry carnivore keen always for the flesh of man might even now be trailing the two whom carthoris sought  cautiously the youth crept out upon the trail of the maneater along the foot of the perpendicular cliff the creature moved sniffing at the invisible spoor and now and then emitting the low moan of the hunting banth  carthoris had followed the creature for but a few minutes when it disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as though dissolved into thin air  the man leaped to his feet  not again was he to be cheated as the man had cheated him  he sprang forward at a reckless pace to the spot at which he last had seen the great skulking brute  before him loomed the sheer cliff its face unbroken by any aperture into which the huge banth might have wormed its great carcass beside him was a small flat boulder not larger than the deck of a tenman flier nor standing to a greater height than twice his own stature  perhaps the banth was in hiding behind this  the brute might have discovered the man upon his trail and even now be lying in wait for his easy prey  cautiously with drawn longsword carthoris crept around the corner of the rock  there was no banth there but something which surprised him infinitely more than would the presence of twenty banths  before him yawned the mouth of a dark cave leading downward into the ground  through this the banth must have disappeared  was it his lair  within its dark and forbidding interior might there not lurk not one but many of the fearsome creatures  carthoris did not know nor with the thought that had been spurring him onward upon the trail of the creature uppermost in his mind did he much care for into this gloomy cavern he was sure the banth had trailed the green man and his captive and into it he too would follow content to give his life in the service of the woman he loved  not an instant did he hesitate nor yet did he advance rashly but with ready sword and cautious steps for the way was dark he stole on  as he advanced the obscurity became impenetrable blackness     chapter v  the fair race   downward along a smooth broad floor led the strange tunnel for such carthoris was now convinced was the nature of the shaft he at first had thought but a cave  before him he could hear the occasional low moans of the banth and presently from behind came a similar uncanny note  another banth had entered the passageway on his trail  his position was anything but pleasant  his eyes could not penetrate the darkness even to the distinguishing of his hand before his face while the banths he knew could see quite well though absence of light were utter  no other sounds came to his ears than the dismal bloodthirsty moanings of the beast ahead and the beast behind  the tunnel had led straight from where he had entered it beneath the side of the rock furthest from the unscaleable cliffs toward the mighty barrier that had baffled him so long  now it was running almost level and presently he noted a gradual ascent  the beast behind him was gaining upon him crowding him perilously close upon the heels of the beast in front  presently he should have to do battle with one or both  more firmly he gripped his weapon  now he could hear the breathing of the banth at his heels  not for much longer could he delay the encounter  long since he had become assured that the tunnel led beneath the cliffs to the opposite side of the barrier and he had hoped that he might reach the moonlit open before being compelled to grapple with either of the monsters  the sun had been setting as he entered the tunnel and the way had been sufficiently long to assure him that darkness now reigned upon the world without  he glanced behind him  blazing out of the darkness seemingly not ten paces behind glared two flaming points of fire  as the savage eyes met his the beast emitted a frightful roar and then he charged  to face that savage mountain of onrushing ferocity to stand unshaken before the hideous fangs that he knew were bared in slavering bloodthirstiness though he could not see them required nerves of steel but of such were the nerves of carthoris of helium  he had the brutes eyes to guide his point and as true as the sword hand of his mighty sire his guided the keen point to one of those blazing orbs even as he leaped lightly to one side  with a hideous scream of pain and rage the wounded banth hurtled clawing past him  then it turned to charge once more but this time carthoris saw but a single gleaming point of fiery hate directed upon him  again the needle point met its flashing target  again the horrid cry of the stricken beast reverberated through the rocky tunnel shocking in its tortureladen shrillness deafening in its terrific volume  but now as it turned to charge again the man had no guide whereby to direct his point  he heard the scraping of the padded feet upon the rocky floor  he knew the thing was charging down upon him once again but he could see nothing  yet if he could not see his antagonist neither could his antagonist now see him  leaping as he thought to the exact centre of the tunnel he held his sword point ready on a line with the beasts chest  it was all that he could do hoping that chance might send the point into the savage heart as he went down beneath the great body  so quickly was the thing over that carthoris could scarce believe his senses as the mighty body rushed madly past him  either he had not placed himself in the centre of the tunnel or else the blinded banth had erred in its calculations  however the huge body missed him by a foot and the creature continued on down the tunnel as though in pursuit of the prey that had eluded him  carthoris too followed the same direction nor was it long before his heart was gladdened by the sight of the moonlit exit from the long dark passage  before him lay a deep hollow entirely surrounded by gigantic cliffs  the surface of the valley was dotted with enormous trees a strange sight so far from a martian waterway  the ground itself was clothed in brilliant scarlet sward picked out with innumerable patches of gorgeous wild flowers  beneath the glorious effulgence of the two moons the scene was one of indescribable loveliness tinged with the weirdness of strange enchantment  for only an instant however did his gaze rest upon the natural beauties outspread before him  almost immediately they were riveted upon the figure of a great banth standing across the carcass of a newkilled thoat  the huge beast his tawny mane bristling around his hideous head kept his eyes fixed upon another banth that charged erratically hither and thither with shrill screams of pain and horrid roars of hate and rage  carthoris quickly guessed that the second brute was the one he had blinded during the fight in the tunnel but it was the dead thoat that centred his interest more than either of the savage carnivores  the harness was still upon the body of the huge martian mount and carthoris could not doubt but that this was the very animal upon which the green warrior had borne away thuvia of ptarth  but where were the rider and his prisoner  the prince of helium shuddered as he thought upon the probability of the fate that had overtaken them  human flesh is the food most craved by the fierce barsoomian lion whose great carcass and giant thews require enormous quantities of meat to sustain them  two human bodies would have but whetted the creatures appetite and that he had killed and eaten the green man and the red girl seemed only too likely to carthoris  he had left the carcass of the mighty thoat to be devoured after having consumed the more toothsome portion of his banquet  now the sightless banth in its savage aimless charging and countercharging had passed beyond the kill of its fellow and there the light breeze that was blowing wafted the scent of new blood to its nostrils  no longer were its movements erratic  with outstretched tail and foaming jaws it charged straight as an arrow for the body of the thoat and the mighty creature of destruction that stood with forepaws upon the slategrey side waiting to defend its meat  when the charging banth was twenty paces from the dead thoat the killer gave vent to its hideous challenge and with a mighty spring leaped forward to meet it  the battle that ensued awed even the warlike barsoomian  the mad rending the hideous and deafening roaring the implacable savagery of the bloodstained beasts held him in the paralysis of fascination and when it was over and the two creatures their heads and shoulders torn to ribbons lay with their dead jaws still buried in each others bodies carthoris tore himself from the spell only by an effort of the will  hurrying to the side of the dead thoat he searched for traces of the girl he feared had shared the thoats fate but nowhere could he discover anything to confirm his fears  with slightly lightened heart he started out to explore the valley but scarce a dozen steps had he taken when the glistening of a jewelled bauble lying on the sward caught his eye  as he picked it up his first glance showed him that it was a womans hair ornament and emblazoned upon it was the insignia of the royal house of ptarth  but sinister discovery blood still wet splotched the magnificent jewels of the setting  carthoris half choked as the dire possibilities which the thing suggested presented themselves to his imagination  yet he could not would not believe it  it was impossible that that radiant creature could have met so hideous an end  it was incredible that the glorious thuvia should ever cease to be  upon his already jewelencrusted harness to the strap that crossed his great chest beneath which beat his loyal heart carthoris prince of helium fastened the gleaming thing that thuvia of ptarth had worn and wearing had made holy to the heliumite  then he proceeded upon his way into the heart of the unknown valley  for the most part the giant trees shut off his view to any but the most limited distances  occasionally he caught glimpses of the towering hills that bounded the valley upon every side and though they stood out clear beneath the light of the two moons he knew that they were far off and that the extent of the valley was immense  for half the night he continued his search until presently he was brought to a sudden halt by the distant sound of squealing thoats  guided by the noise of these habitually angry beasts he stole forward through the trees until at last he came upon a level treeless plain in the centre of which a mighty city reared its burnished domes and vividly coloured towers  about the walled city the red man saw a huge encampment of the green warriors of the dead seabottoms and as he let his eyes rove carefully over the city he realized that here was no deserted metropolis of a dead past  but what city could it be  his studies had taught him that in this littleexplored portion of barsoom the fierce tribe of torquasian green men ruled supreme and that as yet no red man had succeeded in piercing to the heart of their domain to return again to the world of civilization  the men of torquas had perfected huge guns with which their uncanny marksmanship had permitted them to repulse the few determined efforts that nearby red nations had made to explore their country by means of battle fleets of airships  that he was within the boundary of torquas carthoris was sure but that there existed there such a wondrous city he never had dreamed nor had the chronicles of the past even hinted at such a possibility for the torquasians were known to live as did the other green men of mars within the deserted cities that dotted the dying planet nor ever had any green horde built so much as a single edifice other than the lowwalled incubators where their young are hatched by the suns heat  the encircling camp of green warriors lay about five hundred yards from the citys walls  between it and the city was no semblance of breastwork or other protection against rifle or cannon fire yet distinctly now in the light of the rising sun carthoris could see many figures moving along the summit of the high wall and upon the roof tops beyond  that they were beings like himself he was sure though they were at too great distance from him for him to be positive that they were red men  almost immediately after sunrise the green warriors commenced firing upon the little figures upon the wall  to carthoris surprise the fire was not returned but presently the last of the citys inhabitants had sought shelter from the weird marksmanship of the green men and no further sign of life was visible beyond the wall  then carthoris keeping within the shelter of the trees that fringed the plain began circling the rear of the besiegers line hoping against hope that somewhere he would obtain sight of thuvia of ptarth for even now he could not believe that she was dead  that he was not discovered was a miracle for mounted warriors were constantly riding back and forth from the camp into the forest but the long day wore on and still he continued his seemingly fruitless quest until near sunset he came opposite a mighty gate in the citys western wall  here seemed to be the principal force of the attacking horde here a great platform had been erected whereon carthoris could see squatting a huge green warrior surrounded by others of his kind  this then must be the notorious hortan gur jeddak of torquas the fierce old ogre of the southwestern hemisphere as only for a jeddak are platforms raised in temporary camps or upon the march by the green hordes of barsoom  as the heliumite watched he saw another green warrior push his way forward toward the rostrum  beside him he dragged a captive and as the surrounding warriors parted to let the two pass carthoris caught a fleeting glimpse of the prisoner  his heart leaped in rejoicing  thuvia of ptarth still lived  it was with difficulty that carthoris restrained the impulse to rush forward to the side of the ptarthian princess but in the end his better judgment prevailed for in the face of such odds he knew that he should have been but throwing away uselessly any future opportunity he might have to succour her  he saw her dragged to the foot of the rostrum  he saw hortan gur address her  he could not hear the creatures words nor thuvias reply but it must have angered the green monster for carthoris saw him leap toward the prisoner striking her a cruel blow across the face with his metalbanded arm  then the son of john carter jeddak of jeddaks warlord of barsoom went mad  the old bloodred haze through which his sire had glared at countless foes floated before his eyes  his halfearthly muscles responding quickly to his will sent him in enormous leaps and bounds toward the green monster that had struck the woman he loved  the torquasians were not looking in the direction of the forest all eyes had been upon the figures of the girl and their jeddak and loud was the hideous laughter that rang out in appreciation of the wit of the green emperors reply to his prisoners appeal for liberty  carthoris had covered about half the distance between the forest and the green warriors when a new factor succeeded in still further directing the attention of the latter from him  upon a high tower within the beleaguered city a man appeared  from his upturned mouth there issued a series of frightful shrieks uncanny shrieks that swept shrill and terrifying across the citys walls over the heads of the besiegers and out across the forest to the uttermost confines of the valley  once twice thrice the fearsome sound smote upon the ears of the listening green men and then far far off across the broad woods came sharp and clear from the distance an answering shriek  it was but the first  from every point rose similar savage cries until the world seemed to tremble to their reverberations  the green warriors looked nervously this way and that  they knew not fear as earth men may know it but in the face of the unusual their wonted selfassurance deserted them  and then the great gate in the city wall opposite the platform of hortan gur swung suddenly wide  from it issued as strange a sight as carthoris ever had witnessed though at the moment he had time to cast but a single fleeting glance at the tall bowmen emerging through the portal behind their long oval shields to note their flowing auburn hair and to realize that the growling things at their side were fierce barsoomian lions  then he was in the midst of the astonished torquasians  with drawn longsword he was among them and to thuvia of ptarth whose startled eyes were the first to fall upon him it seemed that she was looking upon john carter himself so strangely similar to the fighting of the father was that of the son  even to the famous fighting smile of the virginian was the resemblance true  and the sword arm  ah the subtleness of it and the speed  all about was turmoil and confusion  green warriors were leaping to the backs of their restive squealing thoats  calots were growling out their savage gutturals whining to be at the throats of the oncoming foemen  thar ban and another by the side of the rostrum had been the first to note the coming of carthoris and it was with them he battled for possession of the red girl while the others hastened to meet the host advancing from the beleaguered city  carthoris sought both to defend thuvia of ptarth and reach the side of the hideous hortan gur that he might avenge the blow the creature had struck the girl  he succeeded in reaching the rostrum over the dead bodies of two warriors who had turned to join thar ban and his companion in repulsing this adventurous red man just as hortan gur was about to leap from it to the back of his thoat  the attention of the green warriors turned principally upon the bowmen advancing upon them from the city and upon the savage banths that paced beside themcruel beasts of war infinitely more terrible than their own savage calots  as carthoris leaped to the rostrum he drew thuvia up beside him and then he turned upon the departing jeddak with an angry challenge and a sword thrust  as the heliumites point pricked his green hide hortan gur turned upon his adversary with a snarl but at the same instant two of his chieftains called to him to hasten for the charge of the fairskinned inhabitants of the city was developing into a more serious matter than the torquasians had anticipated  instead of remaining to battle with the red man hortan gur promised him his attention after he had disposed of the presumptuous citizens of the walled city and leaping astride his thoat galloped off to meet the rapidly advancing bowmen  the other warriors quickly followed their jeddak leaving thuvia and carthoris alone upon the platform  between them and the city raged a terrific battle  the fairskinned warriors armed only with their long bows and a kind of shorthandled waraxe were almost helpless beneath the savage mounted green men at close quarters but at a distance their sharp arrows did fully as much execution as the radium projectiles of the green men  but if the warriors themselves were outclassed not so their savage companions the fierce banths  scarce had the two lines come together when hundreds of these appalling creatures had leaped among the torquasians dragging warriors from their thoatsdragging down the huge thoats themselves and bringing consternation to all before them  the numbers of the citizenry too was to their advantage for it seemed that scarce a warrior fell but his place was taken by a score more in such a constant stream did they pour from the citys great gate  and so it came what with the ferocity of the banths and the numbers of the bowmen that at last the torquasians fell back until presently the platform upon which stood carthoris and thuvia lay directly in the centre of the fight  that neither was struck by a bullet or an arrow seemed a miracle to both but at last the tide had rolled completely past them so that they were alone between the fighters and the city except for the dying and the dead and a score or so of growling banths less well trained than their fellows who prowled among the corpses seeking meat  to carthoris the strangest part of the battle had been the terrific toll taken by the bowmen with their relatively puny weapons  nowhere that he could see was there a single wounded green man but the corpses of their dead lay thick upon the field of battle  death seemed to follow instantly the slightest pinprick of a bowmans arrow nor apparently did one ever miss its goal  there could be but one explanation the missiles were poisontipped  presently the sounds of conflict died in the distant forest quiet reigned broken only by the growling of the devouring banths carthoris turned toward thuvia of ptarth  as yet neither had spoken  where are we thuvia he asked  the girl looked at him questioningly  his very presence had seemed to proclaim a guilty knowledge of her abduction  how else might he have known the destination of the flier that brought her  who should know better than the prince of helium she asked in return  did he not come hither of his own free will  from aaanthor i came voluntarily upon the trail of the green man who had stolen you thuvia he replied but from the time i left helium until i awoke above aaanthor i thought myself bound for ptarth  it had been intimated that i had guilty knowledge of your abduction he explained simply and i was hastening to the jeddak your father to convince him of the falsity of the charge and to give my service to your recovery  before i left helium some one tampered with my compass so that it bore me to aaanthor instead of to ptarth  that is all  you believe me  but the warriors who stole me from the garden she exclaimed after we arrived at aaanthor they wore the metal of the prince of helium  when they took me they were trapped in dusarian harness there seemed but a single explanation  whoever dared the outrage wished to put the onus upon another should he be detected in the act but once safely away from ptarth he felt safe in having his minions return to their own harness  you believe that i did this thing thuvia he asked  ah carthoris she replied sadly i did not wish to believe it but when everything pointed to youeven then i would not believe it  i did not do it thuvia he said  but let me be entirely honest with you  as much as i love your father as much as i respect kulan tith to whom you are betrothed as well as i know the frightful consequences that must have followed such an act of mine hurling into war as it would three of the greatest nations of barsoomyet notwithstanding all this i should not have hesitated to take you thus thuvia of ptarth had you even hinted that it would not have displeased you  but you did nothing of the kind and so i am here not in my own service but in yours and in the service of the man to whom you are promised to save you for him if it lies within the power of man to do so he concluded almost bitterly  thuvia of ptarth looked into his face for several moments  her breast was rising and falling as though to some resistless emotion she half took a step toward him  her lips parted as though to speakswiftly and impetuously  and then she conquered whatever had moved her  the future acts of the prince of helium she said coldly must constitute the proof of his past honesty of purpose  carthoris was hurt by the girls tone as much as by the doubt as to his integrity which her words implied  he had half hoped that she might hint that his love would be acceptablecertainly there was due him at least a little gratitude for his recent acts in her behalf but the best he received was cold skepticism  the prince of helium shrugged his broad shoulders  the girl noted it and the little smile that touched his lips so that it became her turn to be hurt  of course she had not meant to hurt him  he might have known that after what he had said she could not do anything to encourage him but he need not have made his indifference quite so palpable  the men of helium were noted for their gallantrynot for boorishness possibly it was the earth blood that flowed in his veins  how could she know that the shrug was but carthoris way of attempting by physical effort to cast blighting sorrow from his heart or that the smile upon his lips was the fighting smile of his father with which the son gave outward evidence of the determination he had reached to submerge his own great love in his efforts to save thuvia of ptarth for another because he believed that she loved this other  he reverted to his original question  where are we he asked  i do not know  nor i replied the girl  those who stole me from ptarth spoke among themselves of aaanthor so that i thought it possible that the ancient city to which they took me was that famous ruin but where we may be now i have no idea  when the bowmen return we shall doubtless learn all that there is to know said carthoris  let us hope that they prove friendly what race may they be  only in the most ancient of our legends and in the mural paintings of the deserted cities of the dead seabottoms are depicted such a race of auburnhaired fairskinned people  can it be that we have stumbled upon a surviving city of the past which all barsoom believes buried beneath the ages  thuvia was looking toward the forest into which the green men and the pursuing bowmen had disappeared  from a great distance came the hideous cries of banths and an occasional shot  it is strange that they do not return said the girl  one would expect to see the wounded limping or being carried back to the city replied carthoris with a puzzled frown  but how about the wounded nearer the city  have they carried them within  both turned their eyes toward the field between them and the walled city where the fighting had been most furious  there were the banths still growling about their hideous feast  carthoris looked at thuvia in astonishment  then he pointed toward the field  where are they he whispered  what has become of their dead and wounded     chapter vi  the jeddak of lothar   the girl looked her incredulity  they lay in piles she murmured  there were thousands of them but a minute ago  and now continued carthoris there remain but the banths and the carcasses of the green men  they must have sent forth and carried the dead bowmen away while we were talking said the girl  it is impossible replied carthoris  thousands of dead lay there upon the field but a moment since  it would have required many hours to have removed them  the thing is uncanny  i had hoped said thuvia that we might find an asylum with these fairskinned people  notwithstanding their valour upon the field of battle they did not strike me as a ferocious or warlike people  i had been about to suggest that we seek entrance to the city but now i scarce know if i care to venture among people whose dead vanish into thin air  let us chance it replied carthoris  we can be no worse off within their walls than without  here we may fall prey to the banths or the no less fierce torquasians  there at least we shall find beings moulded after our own images  all that causes me to hesitate he added is the danger of taking you past so many banths  a single sword would scarce prevail were even a couple of them to charge simultaneously  do not fear on that score replied the girl smiling  the banths will not harm us  as she spoke she descended from the platform and with carthoris at her side stepped fearlessly out upon the bloody field in the direction of the walled city of mystery  they had advanced but a short distance when a banth looking up from its gory feast descried them  with an angry roar the beast walked quickly in their direction and at the sound of its voice a score of others followed its example  carthoris drew his longsword  the girl stole a quick glance at his face  she saw the smile upon his lips and it was as wine to sick nerves for even upon warlike barsoom where all men are brave woman reacts quickly to quiet indifference to dangerto daredeviltry that is without bombast  you may return your sword she said  i told you that the banths would not harm us  look and as she spoke she stepped quickly toward the nearest animal  carthoris would have leaped after her to protect her but with a gesture she motioned him back  he heard her calling to the banths in a low singsong voice that was half purr  instantly the great heads went up and all the wicked eyes were riveted upon the figure of the girl  then stealthily they commenced moving toward her  she had stopped now and was standing waiting them  one closer to her than the others hesitated  she spoke to him imperiously as a master might speak to a refractory hound  the great carnivore let its head droop and with tail between its legs came slinking to the girls feet and after it came the others until she was entirely surrounded by the savage maneaters  turning she led them to where carthoris stood  they growled a little as they neared the man but a few sharp words of command put them in their places  how do you do it exclaimed carthoris  your father once asked me that same question in the galleries of the golden cliffs within the otz mountains beneath the temples of the therns  i could not answer him nor can i answer you  i do not know whence comes my power over them but ever since the day that sator throg threw me among them in the banth pit of the holy therns and the great creatures fawned upon instead of devouring me i ever have had the same strange power over them  they come at my call and do my bidding even as the faithful woola does the bidding of your mighty sire  with a word the girl dispersed the fierce pack  roaring they returned to their interrupted feast while carthoris and thuvia passed among them toward the walled city  as they advanced the man looked with wonder upon the dead bodies of those of the green men that had not been devoured or mauled by the banths  he called the girls attention to them  no arrows protruded from the great carcasses  nowhere upon any of them was the sign of mortal wound nor even slightest scratch or abrasion  before the bowmens dead had disappeared the corpses of the torquasians had bristled with the deadly arrows of their foes  where had the slender messengers of death departed  what unseen hand had plucked them from the bodies of the slain  despite himself carthoris could scarce repress a shudder of apprehension as he glanced toward the silent city before them  no longer was sign of life visible upon wall or roof top  all was quietbrooding ominous quiet  yet he was sure that eyes watched them from somewhere behind that blank wall  he glanced at thuvia  she was advancing with wide eyes fixed upon the city gate  he looked in the direction of her gaze but saw nothing  his gaze upon her seemed to arouse her as from a lethargy  she glanced up at him a quick brave smile touching her lips and then as though the act was involuntary she came close to his side and placed one of her hands in his  he guessed that something within her that was beyond her conscious control was appealing to him for protection  he threw an arm about her and thus they crossed the field  she did not draw away from him  it is doubtful that she realized that his arm was there so engrossed was she in the mystery of the strange city before them  they stopped before the gate  it was a mighty thing  from its construction carthoris could but dimly speculate upon its unthinkable antiquity  it was circular closing a circular aperture and the heliumite knew from his study of ancient barsoomian architecture that it rolled to one side like a huge wheel into an aperture in the wall  even such worldold cities as ancient aaanthor were as yet undreamed of when the races lived that built such gates as these  as he stood speculating upon the identity of this forgotten city a voice spoke to them from above  both looked up  there leaning over the edge of the high wall was a man  his hair was auburn his skin fairfairer even than that of john carter the virginian  his forehead was high his eyes large and intelligent  the language that he used was intelligible to the two below yet there was a marked difference between it and their barsoomian tongue  who are you he asked  and what do you here before the gate of lothar  we are friends replied carthoris  this be the princess thuvia of ptarth who was captured by the torquasian horde  i am carthoris of helium prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium and son of john carter warlord of mars and of his wife dejah thoris  ptarth repeated the man  helium  he shook his head  i never have heard of these places nor did i know that there dwelt upon barsoom a race of thy strange colour  where may these cities lie of which you speak  from our loftiest tower we have never seen another city than lothar  carthoris pointed toward the northeast  in that direction lie helium and ptarth he said  helium is over eight thousand haads from lothar while ptarth lies nine thousand five hundred haads northeast of helium1   1on barsoom the ad is the basis of linear measurement  it is the equivalent of an earthly foot measuring about 11694 earth inches  as has been my custom in the past i have generally translated barsoomian symbols of time distance etc into their earthly equivalent as being more easily understood by earth readers for those of a more studious turn of mind it may be interesting to know the martian table of linear measurement and so i give it here       10 sofads  1 ad     200 ads     1 haad     100 haads   1 karad     360 karads  1 circumference of mars at equator  a haad or barsoomian mile contains about 2339 earth feet  a karad is one degree  a sofad about 117 earth inches   still the man shook his head  i know of nothing beyond the lotharian hills he said  naught may live there beside the hideous green hordes of torquas  they have conquered all barsoom except this single valley and the city of lothar  here we have defied them for countless ages though periodically they renew their attempts to destroy us  from whence you come i cannot guess unless you be descended from the slaves the torquasians captured in early times when they reduced the outer world to their vassalage but we had heard that they destroyed all other races but their own  carthoris tried to explain that the torquasians ruled but a relatively tiny part of the surface of barsoom and even this only because their domain held nothing to attract the red race but the lotharian could not seem to conceive of anything beyond the valley of lothar other than a trackless waste peopled by the ferocious green hordes of torquas  after considerable parleying he consented to admit them to the city and a moment later the wheellike gate rolled back within its niche and thuvia and carthoris entered the city of lothar  all about them were evidences of fabulous wealth  the facades of the buildings fronting upon the avenue within the wall were richly carven and about the windows and doors were ofttimes set footwide borders of precious stones intricate mosaics or tablets of beaten gold bearing basreliefs depicting what may have been bits of the history of this forgotten people  he with whom they had conversed across the wall was in the avenue to receive them  about him were a hundred or more men of the same race  all were clothed in flowing robes and all were beardless  their attitude was more of fearful suspicion than antagonism  they followed the newcomers with their eyes but spoke no word to them  carthoris could not but notice the fact that though the city had been but a short time before surrounded by a horde of bloodthirsty demons yet none of the citizens appeared to be armed nor was there sign of soldiery about  he wondered if all the fighting men had sallied forth in one supreme effort to rout the foe leaving the city all unguarded  he asked their host  the man smiled  no creature other than a score or so of our sacred banths has left lothar today he replied  but the soldiersthe bowmen exclaimed carthoris  we saw thousands emerge from this very gate overwhelming the hordes of torquas and putting them to rout with their deadly arrows and their fierce banths  still the man smiled his knowing smile  look he cried and pointed down a broad avenue before him  carthoris and thuvia followed the direction indicated and there marching bravely in the sunlight they saw advancing toward them a great army of bowmen  ah exclaimed thuvia  they have returned through another gate or perchance these be the troops that remained to defend the city  again the fellow smiled his uncanny smile  there are no soldiers in lothar he said  look  both carthoris and thuvia had turned toward him while he spoke and now as they turned back again toward the advancing regiments their eyes went wide in astonishment for the broad avenue before them was as deserted as the tomb  and those who marched out upon the hordes today whispered carthoris  they too were unreal  the man nodded  but their arrows slew the green warriors insisted thuvia  let us go before tario replied the lotharian  he will tell you that which he deems it best you know  i might tell you too much  who is tario asked carthoris  jeddak of lothar replied the guide leading them up the broad avenue down which they had but a moment since seen the phantom army marching  for half an hour they walked along lovely avenues between the most gorgeous buildings that the two had ever seen  few people were in evidence  carthoris could not but note the deserted appearance of the mighty city  at last they came to the royal palace  carthoris saw it from a distance and guessing the nature of the magnificent pile wondered that even here there should be so little sign of activity and life  not even a single guard was visible before the great entrance gate nor in the gardens beyond into which he could see was there sign of the myriad life that pulses within the precincts of the royal estates of the red jeddaks  here said their guide is the palace of tario  as he spoke carthoris again let his gaze rest upon the wondrous palace  with a startled exclamation he rubbed his eyes and looked again  no  he could not be mistaken  before the massive gate stood a score of sentries  within the avenue leading to the main building was lined on either side by ranks of bowmen  the gardens were dotted with officers and soldiers moving quickly to and fro as though bent upon the duties of the minute  what manner of people were these who could conjure an army out of thin air  he glanced toward thuvia  she too evidently had witnessed the transformation  with a little shudder she pressed more closely toward him  what do you make of it she whispered  it is most uncanny  i cannot account for it replied carthoris unless we have gone mad  carthoris turned quickly toward the lotharian  the fellow was smiling broadly  i thought that you just said that there were no soldiers in lothar said the heliumite with a gesture toward the guardsmen what are these  ask tario replied the other  we shall soon be before him  nor was it long before they entered a lofty chamber at one end of which a man reclined upon a rich couch that stood upon a high dais  as the trio approached the man turned dreamy eyes sleepily upon them  twenty feet from the dais their conductor halted and whispering to thuvia and carthoris to follow his example threw himself headlong to the floor  then rising to hands and knees he commenced crawling toward the foot of the throne swinging his head to and fro and wiggling his body as you have seen a hound do when approaching its master  thuvia glanced quickly toward carthoris  he was standing erect with highheld head and arms folded across his broad chest  a haughty smile curved his lips  the man upon the dais was eyeing him intently and carthoris of helium was looking straight in the others face  who be these jav asked the man of him who crawled upon his belly along the floor  o tario most glorious jeddak replied jav these be strangers who came with the hordes of torquas to our gates saying that they were prisoners of the green men  they tell strange tales of cities far beyond lothar  arise jav commanded tario and ask these two why they show not to tario the respect that is his due  jav arose and faced the strangers  at sight of their erect positions his face went livid  he leaped toward them  creatures he screamed  down  down upon your bellies before the last of the jeddaks of barsoom     chapter vii  the phantom bowmen   as jav leaped toward him carthoris laid his hand upon the hilt of his longsword  the lotharian halted  the great apartment was empty save for the four at the dais yet as jav stepped back from the menace of the heliumites threatening attitude the latter found himself surrounded by a score of bowmen  from whence had they sprung  both carthoris and thuvia looked their astonishment  now the formers sword leaped from its scabbard and at the same instant the bowmen drew back their slim shafts  tario had half raised himself upon one elbow  for the first time he saw the full figure of thuvia who had been concealed behind the person of carthoris  enough cried the jeddak raising a protesting hand but at that very instant the sword of the heliumite cut viciously at its nearest antagonist  as the keen edge reached its goal carthoris let the point fall to the floor as with wide eyes he stepped backward in consternation throwing the back of his left hand across his brow  his steel had cut but empty airhis antagonist had vanishedthere were no bowmen in the room  it is evident that these are strangers said tario to jav  let us first determine that they knowingly affronted us before we take measures for punishment  then he turned to carthoris but ever his gaze wandered to the perfect lines of thuvias glorious figure which the harness of a barsoomian princess accentuated rather than concealed  who are you he asked who knows not the etiquette of the court of the last of jeddaks  i am carthoris prince of helium replied the heliumite  and this is thuvia princess of ptarth  in the courts of our fathers men do not prostrate themselves before royalty  not since the first born tore their immortal goddess limb from limb have men crawled upon their bellies to any throne upon barsoom  now think you that the daughter of one mighty jeddak and the son of another would so humiliate themselves  tario looked at carthoris for a long time  at last he spoke  there is no other jeddak upon barsoom than tario he said  there is no other race than that of lothar unless the hordes of torquas may be dignified by such an appellation  lotharians are white your skins are red  there are no women left upon barsoom  your companion is a woman  he half rose from the couch leaning far forward and pointing an accusing finger at carthoris  you are a lie he shrieked  you are both lies and you dare to come before tario last and mightiest of the jeddaks of barsoom and assert your reality  some one shall pay well for this jav and unless i mistake it is yourself who has dared thus flippantly to trifle with the good nature of your jeddak  remove the man  leave the woman  we shall see if both be lies and later jav you shall suffer for your temerity  there be few of us left butkomal must be fed  go  carthoris could see that jav trembled as he prostrated himself once more before his ruler and then rising turned toward the prince of helium  come he said  and leave the princess of ptarth here alone cried carthoris  jav brushed closely past him whispering  follow mehe cannot harm her except to kill and that he can do whether you remain or not  we had best go nowtrust me  carthoris did not understand but something in the urgency of the others tone assured him and so he turned away but not without a glance toward thuvia in which he attempted to make her understand that it was in her own interest that he left her  for answer she turned her back full upon him but not without first throwing him such a look of contempt that brought the scarlet to his cheek  then he hesitated but jav seized him by the wrist  come he whispered  or he will have the bowmen upon you and this time there will be no escape  did you not see how futile is your steel against thin air  carthoris turned unwillingly to follow  as the two left the room he turned to his companion  if i may not kill thin air he asked how then shall i fear that thin air may kill me  you saw the torquasians fall before the bowmen asked jav  carthoris nodded  so would you fall before them and without one single chance for selfdefence or revenge  as they talked jav led carthoris to a small room in one of the numerous towers of the palace  here were couches and jav bid the heliumite be seated  for several minutes the lotharian eyed his prisoner for such carthoris now realized himself to be  i am half convinced that you are real he said at last  carthoris laughed  of course i am real he said  what caused you to doubt it  can you not see me feel me  so may i see and feel the bowmen replied jav and yet we all know that they at least are not real  carthoris showed by the expression of his face his puzzlement at each new reference to the mysterious bowmenthe vanishing soldiery of lothar  what then may they be he asked  you really do not know asked jav  carthoris shook his head negatively  i can almost believe that you have told us the truth and that you are really from another part of barsoom or from another world  but tell me in your own country have you no bowmen to strike terror to the hearts of the green hordesmen as they slay in company with the fierce banths of war  we have soldiers replied carthoris  we of the red race are all soldiers but we have no bowmen to defend us such as yours we defend ourselves  you go out and get killed by your enemies cried jav incredulously  certainly replied carthoris  how do the lotharians  you have seen replied the other  we send out our deathless archersdeathless because they are lifeless existing only in the imaginations of our enemies  it is really our giant minds that defend us sending out legions of imaginary warriors to materialize before the minds eye of the foe  they see themthey see their bows drawn backthey see their slender arrows speed with unerring precision toward their hearts and they diekilled by the power of suggestion  but the archers that are slain exclaimed carthoris  you call them deathless and yet i saw their dead bodies piled high upon the battlefield  how may that be  it is but to lend reality to the scene replied jav  we picture many of our own defenders killed that the torquasians may not guess that there are really no flesh and blood creatures opposing them  once that truth became implanted in their minds it is the theory of many of us no longer would they fall prey to the suggestion of the deadly arrows for greater would be the suggestion of the truth and the more powerful suggestion would prevailit is law  and the banths questioned carthoris  they too were but creatures of suggestion  some of them were real replied jav  those that accompanied the archers in pursuit of the torquasians were unreal  like the archers they never returned but having served their purpose vanished with the bowmen when the rout of the enemy was assured  those that remained about the field were real  those we loosed as scavengers to devour the bodies of the dead of torquas  this thing is demanded by the realists among us  i am a realist  tario is an etherealist  the etherealists maintain that there is no such thing as matterthat all is mind  they say that none of us exists except in the imagination of his fellows other than as an intangible invisible mentality  according to tario it is but necessary that we all unite in imagining that there are no dead torquasians beneath our walls and there will be none nor any need of scavenging banths  you then do not hold tarios beliefs asked carthoris  in part only replied the lotharian  i believe in fact i know that there are some truly ethereal creatures  tario is one i am convinced  he has no existence except in the imaginations of his people  of course it is the contention of all us realists that all etherealists are but figments of the imagination  they contend that no food is necessary nor do they eat but any one of the most rudimentary intelligence must realize that food is a necessity to creatures having actual existence  yes agreed carthoris not having eaten today i can readily agree with you  ah pardon me exclaimed jav  pray be seated and satisfy your hunger and with a wave of his hand he indicated a bountifully laden table that had not been there an instant before he spoke  of that carthoris was positive for he had searched the room diligently with his eyes several times  it is well continued jav that you did not fall into the hands of an etherealist  then indeed would you have gone hungry  but exclaimed carthoris this is not real foodit was not here an instant since and real food does not materialize out of thin air  jav looked hurt  there is no real food or water in lothar he said nor has there been for countless ages  upon such as you now see before you have we existed since the dawn of history  upon such then may you exist  but i thought you were a realist exclaimed carthoris  indeed cried jav what more realistic than this bounteous feast it is just here that we differ most from the etherealists  they claim that it is unnecessary to imagine food but we have found that for the maintenance of life we must thrice daily sit down to hearty meals  the food that one eats is supposed to undergo certain chemical changes during the process of digestion and assimilation the result of course being the rebuilding of wasted tissue  now we all know that mind is all though we may differ in the interpretation of its various manifestations  tario maintains that there is no such thing as substance all being created from the substanceless matter of the brain  we realists however know better  we know that mind has the power to maintain substance even though it may not be able to create substancethe latter is still an open question  and so we know that in order to maintain our physical bodies we must cause all our organs properly to function  this we accomplish by materializing foodthoughts and by partaking of the food thus created  we chew we swallow we digest  all our organs function precisely as if we had partaken of material food and what is the result  what must be the result  the chemical changes take place through both direct and indirect suggestion and we live and thrive  carthoris eyed the food before him  it seemed real enough  he lifted a morsel to his lips  there was substance indeed  and flavour as well  yes even his palate was deceived  jav watched him smiling as he ate  is it not entirely satisfying he asked  i must admit that it is replied carthoris  but tell me how does tario live and the other etherealists who maintain that food is unnecessary  jav scratched his head  that is a question we often discuss he replied  it is the strongest evidence we have of the nonexistence of the etherealists but who may know other than komal  who is komal asked carthoris  i heard your jeddak speak of him  jav bent low toward the ear of the heliumite looking fearfully about before he spoke  komal is the essence he whispered  even the etherealists admit that mind itself must have substance in order to transmit to imaginings the appearance of substance  for if there really was no such thing as substance it could not be suggestedwhat never has been cannot be imagined  do you follow me  i am groping replied carthoris dryly  so the essence must be substance continued jav  komal is the essence of the all as it were  he is maintained by substance he eats  he eats the real  to be explicit he eats the realists that is tarios work  he says that inasmuch as we maintain that we alone are real we should to be consistent admit that we alone are proper food for komal  sometimes as today we find other food for him  he is very fond of torquasians  and komal is a man asked carthoris  he is all i told you replied jav  i know not how to explain him in words that you will understand  he is the beginning and the end  all life emanates from komal since the substance which feeds the brain with imaginings radiates from the body of komal  should komal cease to eat all life upon barsoom would cease to be he cannot die but he might cease to eat and thus to radiate  and he feeds upon the men and women of your belief cried carthoris  women exclaimed jav  there are no women in lothar  the last of the lotharian females perished ages since upon that cruel and terrible journey across the muddy plains that fringed the halfdried seas when the green hordes scourged us across the world to this our last hidingplaceour impregnable fortress of lothar  scarce twenty thousand men of all the countless millions of our race lived to reach lothar  among us were no women and no children all these had perished by the way  as time went on we too were dying and the race fast approaching extinction when the great truth was revealed to us that mind is all  many more died before we perfected our powers but at last we were able to defy death when we fully understood that death was merely a state of mind  then came the creation of mindpeople or rather the materialization of imaginings  we first put these to practical use when the torquasians discovered our retreat and fortunate for us it was that it required ages of search upon their part before they found the single tiny entrance to the valley of lothar  that day we threw our first bowmen against them  the intention was purely to frighten them away by the vast numbers of bowmen which we could muster upon our walls  all lothar bristled with the bows and arrows of our ethereal host  but the torquasians did not frighten  they are lower than the beaststhey know no fear  they rushed upon our walls and standing upon the shoulders of others they built human approaches to the wall tops and were on the very point of surging in upon us and overwhelming us  not an arrow had been discharged by our bowmenwe did but cause them to run to and fro along the wall top screaming taunts and threats at the enemy  presently i thought to attempt the thingthe great thing  i centred all my mighty intellect upon the bowmen of my own creationeach of us produces and directs as many bowmen as his mentality and imagination is capable of  i caused them to fit arrows to their bows for the first time  i made them take aim at the hearts of the green men  i made the green men see all this and then i made them see the arrows fly and i made them think that the points pierced their hearts  it was all that was necessary  by hundreds they toppled from our walls and when my fellows saw what i had done they were quick to follow my example so that presently the hordes of torquas had retreated beyond the range of our arrows  we might have killed them at any distance but one rule of war we have maintained from the firstthe rule of realism  we do nothing or rather we cause our bowmen to do nothing within sight of the enemy that is beyond the understanding of the foe  otherwise they might guess the truth and that would be the end of us  but after the torquasians had retreated beyond bowshot they turned upon us with their terrible rifles and by constant popping at us made life miserable within our walls  so then i bethought the scheme to hurl our bowmen through the gates upon them  you have seen this day how well it works  for ages they have come down upon us at intervals but always with the same results  and all this is due to your intellect jav asked carthoris  i should think that you would be high in the councils of your people  i am replied jav proudly  i am next to tario  but why then your cringing manner of approaching the throne  tario demands it  he is jealous of me  he only awaits the slightest excuse to feed me to komal  he fears that i may some day usurp his power  carthoris suddenly sprang from the table  jav he exclaimed  i am a beast  here i have been eating my fill while the princess of ptarth may perchance be still without food  let us return and find some means of furnishing her with nourishment  the lotharian shook his head  tario would not permit it he said  he will doubtless make an etherealist of her  but i must go to her insisted carthoris  you say that there are no women in lothar  then she must be among men and if this be so i intend to be near where i may defend her if the need arises  tario will have his way insisted jav  he sent you away and you may not return until he sends for you  then i shall go without waiting to be sent for  do not forget the bowmen cautioned jav  i do not forget them replied carthoris but he did not tell jav that he remembered something else that the lotharian had let dropsomething that was but a conjecture possibly and yet one well worth pinning a forlorn hope to should necessity arise  carthoris started to leave the room  jav stepped before him barring his way  i have learned to like you red man he said but do not forget that tario is still my jeddak and that tario has commanded that you remain here  carthoris was about to reply when there came faintly to the ears of both a womans cry for help  with a sweep of his arm the prince of helium brushed the lotharian aside and with drawn sword sprang into the corridor without     chapter viii  the hall of doom   as thuvia of ptarth saw carthoris depart from the presence of tario leaving her alone with the man a sudden qualm of terror seized her  there was an air of mystery pervading the stately chamber  its furnishings and appointments bespoke wealth and culture and carried the suggestion that the room was often the scene of royal functions which filled it to its capacity  and yet nowhere about her in antechamber or corridor was there sign of any other being than herself and the recumbent figure of tario the jeddak who watched her through halfclosed eyes from the gorgeous trappings of his regal couch  for a time after the departure of jav and carthoris the man eyed her intently  then he spoke  come nearer he said and as she approached whose creature are you  who has dared materialize his imaginings of woman  it is contrary to the customs and the royal edicts of lothar  tell me woman from whose brain have you sprung  javs  no do not deny it  i know that it could be no other than that envious realist  he seeks to tempt me  he would see me fall beneath the spell of your charms and then he your master would direct my destiny andmy end  i see it all  i see it all  the blood of indignation and anger had been rising to thuvias face  her chin was up a haughty curve upon her perfect lips  i know naught she cried of what you are prating  i am thuvia princess of ptarth  i am no mans creature  never before today did i lay eyes upon him you call jav nor upon your ridiculous city of which even the greatest nations of barsoom have never dreamed  my charms are not for you nor such as you  they are not for sale or barter even though the price were a real throne  and as for using them to win your worse than futile power  she ended her sentence with a shrug of her shapely shoulders and a little scornful laugh  when she had finished tario was sitting upon the edge of his couch his feet upon the floor  he was leaning forward with eyes no longer half closed but wide with a startled expression in them  he did not seem to note the lese majeste of her words and manner there was evidently something more startling and compelling about her speech than that  slowly he came to his feet  by the fangs of komal he muttered  but you are real  a real woman  no dream  no vain and foolish figment of the mind  he took a step toward her with hands outstretched  come he whispered  come woman  for countless ages have i dreamed that some day you would come  and now that you are here i can scarce believe the testimony of my eyes  even now knowing that you are real i still half dread that you may be a lie  thuvia shrank back  she thought the man mad  her hand stole to the jewelled hilt of her dagger  the man saw the move and stopped a cunning expression entered his eyes  then they became at once dreamy and penetrating as they fairly bored into the girls brain  thuvia suddenly felt a change coming over her  what the cause of it she did not guess but somehow the man before her began to assume a new relationship within her heart  no longer was he a strange and mysterious enemy but an old and trusted friend  her hand slipped from the daggers hilt  tario came closer  he spoke gentle friendly words and she answered him in a voice that seemed hers and yet anothers  he was beside her now  his hand was up her shoulder  his eyes were downbent toward hers  she looked up into his face  his gaze seemed to bore straight through her to some hidden spring of sentiment within her  her lips parted in sudden awe and wonder at the strange revealment of her inner self that was being laid bare before her consciousness she had known tario for ever  he was more than friend to her she moved a little closer to him  in one swift flood of light she knew the truth  she loved tario jeddak of lothar  she had always loved him  the man seeing the success of his strategy could not restrain a faint smile of satisfaction  whether there was something in the expression of his face or whether from carthoris of helium in a far chamber of the palace came a more powerful suggestion who may say  but something there was that suddenly dispelled the strange hypnotic influence of the man  as though a mask had been torn from her eyes thuvia suddenly saw tario as she had formerly seen him and accustomed as she was to the strange manifestations of highly developed mentality which are common upon barsoom she quickly guessed enough of the truth to know that she was in grave danger  quickly she took a step backward tearing herself from his grasp but the momentary contact had aroused within tario all the longburied passions of his loveless existence  with a muffled cry he sprang upon her throwing his arms about her and attempting to drag her lips to his  woman he cried  lovely woman  tario would make you queen of lothar  listen to me  listen to the love of the last jeddaks of barsoom  thuvia struggled to free herself from his embrace  stop creature she cried  stop  i do not love you  stop or i shall scream for help  tario laughed in her face  scream for help he mimicked  and who within the halls of lothar is there who might come in answer to your call  who would dare enter the presence of tario unsummoned  there is one she replied who would come and coming dare to cut you down upon your own throne if he thought that you had offered affront to thuvia of ptarth  who jav asked tario  not jav nor any other softskinned lotharian she replied but a real man a real warriorcarthoris of helium  again the man laughed at her  you forget the bowmen he reminded her  what could your red warrior accomplish against my fearless legions  again he caught her roughly to him dragging her towards his couch  if you will not be my queen he said you shall be my slave  neither cried the girl  as she spoke the single word there was a quick move of her right hand tario releasing her staggered back both hands pressed to his side  at the same instant the room filled with bowmen and then the jeddak of lothar sank senseless to the marble floor  at the instant that he lost consciousness the bowmen were about to release their arrows into thuvias heart  involuntarily she gave a single cry for help though she knew that not even carthoris of helium could save her now  then she closed her eyes and waited for the end  no slender shafts pierced her tender side  she raised her lids to see what stayed the hand of her executioners  the room was empty save for herself and the still form of the jeddak of lothar lying at her feet a little pool of crimson staining the white marble of the floor beside him  tario was unconscious  thuvia was amazed  where were the bowmen  why had they not loosed their shafts  what could it all mean  an instant before the room had been mysteriously filled with armed men evidently called to protect their jeddak yet now with the evidence of her deed plain before them they had vanished as mysteriously as they had come leaving her alone with the body of their ruler into whose side she had slipped her long keen blade  the girl glanced apprehensively about first for signs of the return of the bowmen and then for some means of escape  the wall behind the dais was pierced by two small doorways hidden by heavy hangings  thuvia was running quickly towards one of these when she heard the clank of a warriors metal at the end of the apartment behind her  ah if she had but an instant more of time she could have reached that screening arras and perchance have found some avenue of escape behind it but now it was too lateshe had been discovered  with a feeling that was akin to apathy she turned to meet her fate and there before her running swiftly across the broad chamber to her side was carthoris his naked longsword gleaming in his hand  for days she had doubted his intentions of the heliumite  she had thought him a party to her abduction  since fate had thrown them together she had scarce favoured him with more than the most perfunctory replies to his remarks unless at such times as the weird and uncanny happenings at lothar had surprised her out of her reserve  she knew that carthoris of helium would fight for her but whether to save her for himself or another she was in doubt  he knew that she was promised to kulan tith jeddak of kaol but if he had been instrumental in her abduction his motives could not be prompted by loyalty to his friend or regard for her honour  and yet as she saw him coming across the marble floor of the audience chamber of tario of lothar his fine eyes filled with apprehension for her safety his splendid figure personifying all that is finest in the fighting men of martial mars she could not believe that any faintest trace of perfidy lurked beneath so glorious an exterior  never she thought in all her life had the sight of any man been so welcome to her  it was with difficulty that she refrained from rushing forward to meet him  she knew that he loved her but in time she recalled that she was promised to kulan tith  not even might she trust herself to show too great gratitude to the heliumite lest he misunderstand  carthoris was by her side now  his quick glance had taken in the scene within the roomthe still figure of the jeddak sprawled upon the floorthe girl hastening toward a shrouded exit  did he harm you thuvia he asked  she held up her crimsoned blade that he might see it  no she said he did not harm me  a grim smile lighted carthoris face  praised be our first ancestor he murmured  and now let us see if we may not make good our escape from this accursed city before the lotharians discover that their jeddak is no more  with the firm authority that sat so well upon him in whose veins flowed the blood of john carter of virginia and dejah thoris of helium he grasped her hand and turning back across the hall strode toward the great doorway through which jav had brought them into the presence of the jeddak earlier in the day  they had almost reached the threshold when a figure sprang into the apartment through another entrance  it was jav  he too took in the scene within at a glance  carthoris turned to face him his sword ready in his hand and his great body shielding the slender figure of the girl  come jav of lothar he cried  let us face the issue at once for only one of us may leave this chamber alive with thuvia of ptarth  then seeing that the man wore no sword he exclaimed bring on your bowmen then or come with us as my prisoner until we have safely passed the outer portals of thy ghostly city  you have killed tario exclaimed jav ignoring the others challenge  you have killed tario  i see his blood upon the floorreal bloodreal death  tario was after all as real as i yet he was an etherealist  he would not materialize his sustenance can it be that they are right  well we too are right  and all these ages we have been quarrellingeach saying that the other was wrong  however he is dead now  of that i am glad  now shall jav come into his own  now shall jav be jeddak of lothar  as he finished tario opened his eyes and then quickly sat up  traitor  assassin he screamed and then  kadar  kadar which is the barsoomian for guard  jav went sickly white  he fell upon his belly wriggling toward tario  oh my jeddak my jeddak he whimpered  jav had no hand in this  jav your faithful jav but just this instant entered the apartment to find you lying prone upon the floor and these two strangers about to leave how it happened i know not  believe me most glorious jeddak  cease knave cried tario  i heard your words however he is dead now  of that i am glad  now shall jav come into his own now shall jav be jeddak of lothar  at last traitor i have found you out  your own words have condemned you as surely as the acts of these red creatures have sealed their fatesunless he paused  unless the woman  but he got no further  carthoris guessed what he would have said and before the words could be uttered he had sprung forward and struck the man across the mouth with his open palm  tario frothed in rage and mortification  and should you again affront the princess of ptarth warned the heliumite i shall forget that you wear no swordnot for ever may i control my itching sword hand  tario shrank back toward the little doorways behind the dais  he was trying to speak but so hideously were the muscles of his face working that he could utter no word for several minutes  at last he managed to articulate intelligibly  die he shrieked  die and then he turned toward the exit at his back  jav leaped forward screaming in terror  have pity tario  have pity  remember the long ages that i have served you faithfully  remember all that i have done for lothar do not condemn me now to the death hideous  save me  save me  but tario only laughed a mocking laugh and continued to back toward the hangings that hid the little doorway  jav turned toward carthoris  stop him he screamed  stop him  if you love life let him not leave this room and as he spoke he leaped in pursuit of his jeddak  carthoris followed javs example but the last of the jeddaks of barsoom was too quick for them  by the time they reached the arras behind which he had disappeared they found a heavy stone door blocking their further progress  jav sank to the floor in a spasm of terror  come man cried carthoris  we are not dead yet  let us hasten to the avenues and make an attempt to leave the city  we are still alive and while we live we may yet endeavour to direct our own destinies  of what avail to sink spineless to the floor come be a man  jav but shook his head  did you not hear him call the guards he moaned  ah if we could have but intercepted him  then there might have been hope but alas he was too quick for us  well well exclaimed carthoris impatiently  what if he did call the guards  there will be time enough to worry about that after they comeat present i see no indication that they have any idea of overexerting themselves to obey their jeddaks summons  jav shook his head mournfully  you do not understand he said  the guards have already comeand gone  they have done their work and we are lost  look to the various exits  carthoris and thuvia turned their eyes in the direction of the several doorways which pierced the walls of the great chamber each was tightly closed by huge stone doors  well asked carthoris  we are to die the death whispered jav faintly  further than that he would not say  he just sat upon the edge of the jeddaks couch and waited  carthoris moved to thuvias side and standing there with naked sword he let his brave eyes roam ceaselessly about the great chamber that no foe might spring upon them unseen  for what seemed hours no sound broke the silence of their living tomb  no sign gave their executioners of the time or manner of their death  the suspense was terrible  even carthoris of helium began to feel the terrible strain upon his nerves  if he could but know how and whence the hand of death was to strike he could meet it unafraid but to suffer longer the hideous tension of this blighting ignorance of the plans of their assassins was telling upon him grievously  thuvia of ptarth drew quite close to him  she felt safer with the feel of his arm against hers and with the contact of her the man took a new grip upon himself  with his oldtime smile he turned toward her  it would seem that they are trying to frighten us to death he said laughing and shame be upon me that i should confess it i think they were close to accomplishing their designs upon me  she was about to make some reply when a fearful shriek broke from the lips of the lotharian  the end is coming he cried  the end is coming  the floor the floor  oh komal be merciful  thuvia and carthoris did not need to look at the floor to be aware of the strange movement that was taking place  slowly the marble flagging was sinking in all directions toward the centre  at first the movement being gradual was scarce noticeable but presently the angle of the floor became such that one might stand easily only by bending one knee considerably  jav was shrieking still and clawing at the royal couch that had already commenced to slide toward the centre of the room where both thuvia and carthoris suddenly noted a small orifice which grew in diameter as the floor assumed more closely a funnellike contour  now it became more and more difficult to cling to the dizzy inclination of the smooth and polished marble  carthoris tried to support thuvia but himself commenced to slide and slip toward the everenlarging aperture  better to cling to the smooth stone he kicked off his sandals of zitidar hide and with his bare feet braced himself against the sickening tilt at the same time throwing his arms supportingly about the girl  in her terror her own hands clasped about the mans neck  her cheek was close to his  death unseen and of unknown form seemed close upon them and because unseen and unknowable infinitely more terrifying  courage my princess he whispered  she looked up into his face to see smiling lips above hers and brave eyes untouched by terror drinking deeply of her own  then the floor sagged and tilted more swiftly  there was a sudden slipping rush as they were precipitated toward the aperture  javs screams rose weird and horrible in their ears and then the three found themselves piled upon the royal couch of tario which had stuck within the aperture at the base of the marble funnel  for a moment they breathed more freely but presently they discovered that the aperture was continuing to enlarge  the couch slipped downward  jav shrieked again  there was a sickening sensation as they felt all let go beneath them as they fell through darkness to an unknown death     chapter ix  the battle in the plain   the distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber beneath it could not have been great for all three of the victims of tarios wrath alighted unscathed  carthoris still clasping thuvia tightly to his breast came to the ground catlike upon his feet breaking the shock for the girl scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use  but though the room was lighted there was no sign of enemy about  carthoris looked toward jav  the man was pasty white with fear  what is to be our fate asked the heliumite  tell me man shake off your terror long enough to tell me so i may be prepared to sell my life and that of the princess of ptarth as dearly as possible  komal whispered jav  we are to be devoured by komal  your deity asked carthoris  the lotharian nodded his head  then he pointed toward a low doorway at one end of the chamber  from thence will he come upon us  lay aside your puny sword fool it will but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse  carthoris smiled gripping his longsword the more firmly  presently jav gave a horrified moan at the same time pointing toward the door  he has come he whimpered  carthoris and thuvia looked in the direction the lotharian had indicated expecting to see some strange and fearful creature in human form but to their astonishment they saw the broad head and greatmaned shoulders of a huge banth the largest that either ever had seen  slowly and with dignity the mighty beast advanced into the room jav had fallen to the floor and was wriggling his body in the same servile manner that he had adopted toward tario  he spoke to the fierce beast as he would have spoken to a human being pleading with it for mercy  carthoris stepped between thuvia and the banth his sword ready to contest the beasts victory over them  thuvia turned toward jav  is this komal your god she asked  jav nodded affirmatively  the girl smiled and then brushing past carthoris she stepped swiftly toward the growling carnivore  in low firm tones she spoke to it as she had spoken to the banths of the golden cliffs and the scavengers before the walls of lothar  the beast ceased its growling  with lowered head and catlike purr it came slinking to the girls feet  thuvia turned toward carthoris  it is but a banth she said  we have nothing to fear from it  carthoris smiled  i did not fear it he replied for i too believed it to be only a banth and i have my longsword  jav sat up and gazed at the spectacle before himthe slender girl weaving her fingers in the tawny mane of the huge creature that he had thought divine while komal rubbed his hideous snout against her side  so this is your god laughed thuvia  jav looked bewildered  he scarce knew whether he dare chance offending komal or not for so strong is the power of superstition that even though we know that we have been reverencing a sham yet still we hesitate to admit the validity of our newfound convictions  yes he said this is komal  for ages the enemies of tario have been hurled to this pit to fill his maw for komal must be fed  is there any way out of this chamber to the avenues of the city asked carthoris  jav shrugged  i do not know he replied  never have i been here before nor ever have i cared to do so  come suggested thuvia let us explore  there must be a way out  together the three approached the doorway through which komal had entered the apartment that was to have witnessed their deaths beyond was a lowroofed lair with a small door at the far end  this to their delight opened to the lifting of an ordinary latch letting them into a circular arena surrounded by tiers of seats  here is where komal is fed in public explained jav  had tario dared it would have been here that our fates had been sealed but he feared too much thy keen blade red man and so he hurled us all downward to the pit  i did not know how closely connected were the two chambers  now we may easily reach the avenues and the city gates  only the bowmen may dispute the right of way and knowing their secret i doubt that they have power to harm us  another door led to a flight of steps that rose from the arena level upward through the seats to an exit at the back of the hall beyond this was a straight broad corridor running directly through the palace to the gardens at the side  no one appeared to question them as they advanced mighty komal pacing by the girls side  where are the people of the palacethe jeddaks retinue asked carthoris  even in the city streets as we came through i scarce saw sign of a human being yet all about are evidences of a mighty population  jav sighed  poor lothar he said  it is indeed a city of ghosts  there are scarce a thousand of us left who once were numbered in the millions our great city is peopled by the creatures of our own imaginings for our own needs we do not take the trouble to materialize these peoples of our brain yet they are apparent to us  even now i see great throngs lining the avenue hastening to and fro in the round of their duties  i see women and children laughing on the balconiesthese we are forbidden to materialize but yet i see themthey are here     but why not he mused  no longer need i fear tariohe has done his worst and failed  why not indeed  stay friends he continued  would you see lothar in all her glory  carthoris and thuvia nodded their assent more out of courtesy than because they fully grasped the import of his mutterings  jav gazed at them penetratingly for an instant then with a wave of his hand cried  look  the sight that met them was aweinspiring  where before there had been naught but deserted pavements and scarlet swards yawning windows and tenantless doors now swarmed a countless multitude of happy laughing people  it is the past said jav in a low voice  they do not see usthey but live the old dead past of ancient lotharthe dead and crumbled lothar of antiquity which stood upon the shore of throxus mightiest of the five oceans  see those fine upstanding men swinging along the broad avenue see the young girls and the women smile upon them  see the men greet them with love and respect  those be seafarers coming up from their ships which lie at the quays at the citys edge  brave men theyah but the glory of lothar has faded  see their weapons  they alone bore arms for they crossed the five seas to strange places where dangers were  with their passing passed the martial spirit of the lotharians leaving as the ages rolled by a race of spineless cowards  we hated war and so we trained not our youth in warlike ways thus followed our undoing for when the seas dried and the green hordes encroached upon us we could do naught but flee  but we remembered the seafaring bowmen of the days of our gloryit is the memory of these which we hurl upon our enemies  as jav ceased speaking the picture faded and once more the three took up their way toward the distant gates along deserted avenues  twice they sighted lotharians of flesh and blood  at sight of them and the huge banth which they must have recognized as komal the citizens turned and fled  they will carry word of our flight to tario cried jav and soon he will send his bowmen after us  let us hope that our theory is correct and that their shafts are powerless against minds cognizant of their unreality  otherwise we are doomed  explain red man to the woman the truths that i have explained to you that she may meet the arrows with a stronger countersuggestion of immunity  carthoris did as jav bid him but they came to the great gates without sign of pursuit developing  here jav set in motion the mechanism that rolled the huge wheellike gate aside and a moment later the three accompanied by the banth stepped out into the plain before lothar  scarce had they covered a hundred yards when the sound of many men shouting arose behind them  as they turned they saw a company of bowmen debouching upon the plain from the gate through which they had but just passed  upon the wall above the gate were a number of lotharians among whom jav recognized tario  the jeddak stood glaring at them evidently concentrating all the forces of his trained mind upon them  that he was making a supreme effort to render his imaginary creatures deadly was apparent  jav turned white and commenced to tremble  at the crucial moment he appeared to lose the courage of his conviction  the great banth turned back toward the advancing bowmen and growled  carthoris placed himself between thuvia and the enemy and facing them awaited the outcome of their charge  suddenly an inspiration came to carthoris  hurl your own bowmen against tarios he cried to jav  let us see a materialized battle between two mentalities  the suggestion seemed to hearten the lotharian and in another moment the three stood behind solid ranks of huge bowmen who hurled taunts and menaces at the advancing company emerging from the walled city  jav was a new man the moment his battalions stood between him and tario  one could almost have sworn the man believed these creatures of his strange hypnotic power to be real flesh and blood  with hoarse battle cries they charged the bowmen of tario  barbed shafts flew thick and fast  men fell and the ground was red with gore  carthoris and thuvia had difficulty in reconciling the reality of it all with their knowledge of the truth  they saw utan after utan march from the gate in perfect step to reinforce the outnumbered company which tario had first sent forth to arrest them  they saw javs forces grow correspondingly until all about them rolled a sea of fighting cursing warriors and the dead lay in heaps about the field  jav and tario seemed to have forgotten all else beside the struggling bowmen that surged to and fro filling the broad field between the forest and the city  the wood loomed close behind thuvia and carthoris  the latter cast a glance toward jav  come he whispered to the girl  let them fight out their empty battleneither evidently has power to harm the other  they are like two controversialists hurling words at one another  while they are engaged we may as well be devoting our energies to an attempt to find the passage through the cliffs to the plain beyond  as he spoke jav turning from the battle for an instant caught his words  he saw the girl move to accompany the heliumite  a cunning look leaped to the lotharians eyes  the thing that lay beyond that look had been deep in his heart since first he had laid eyes upon thuvia of ptarth  he had not recognized it however until now that she seemed about to pass out of his existence  he centred his mind upon the heliumite and the girl for an instant  carthoris saw thuvia of ptarth step forward with outstretched hand  he was surprised at this sudden softening toward him and it was with a full heart that he let his fingers close upon hers as together they turned away from forgotten lothar into the woods and bent their steps toward the distant mountains  as the lotharian had turned toward them thuvia had been surprised to hear carthoris suddenly voice a new plan  remain here with jav she had heard him say while i go to search for the passage through the cliffs  she had dropped back in surprise and disappointment for she knew that there was no reason why she should not have accompanied him certainly she should have been safer with him than left here alone with the lotharian  and jav watched the two and smiled his cunning smile  when carthoris had disappeared within the wood thuvia seated herself apathetically upon the scarlet sward to watch the seemingly interminable struggles of the bowmen  the long afternoon dragged its weary way toward darkness and still the imaginary legions charged and retreated  the sun was about to set when tario commenced to withdraw his troops slowly toward the city  his plan for cessation of hostilities through the night evidently met with javs entire approval for he caused his forces to form themselves in orderly utans and march just within the edge of the wood where they were soon busily engaged in preparing their evening meal and spreading down their sleeping silks and furs for the night  thuvia could scarce repress a smile as she noted the scrupulous care with which javs imaginary men attended to each tiny detail of deportment as truly as if they had been real flesh and blood  sentries were posted between the camp and the city  officers clanked hither and thither issuing commands and seeing to it that they were properly carried out  thuvia turned toward jav  why is it she asked that you observe such careful nicety in the regulation of your creatures when tario knows quite as well as you that they are but figments of your brain  why not permit them simply to dissolve into thin air until you again require their futile service  you do not understand them replied jav  while they exist they are real  i do but call them into being now and in a way direct their general actions  but thereafter until i dissolve them they are as actual as you or i  their officers command them under my guidance  i am the generalthat is all  and the psychological effect upon the enemy is far greater than were i to treat them merely as substanceless vagaries  then too continued the lotharian there is always the hope which with us is little short of belief that some day these materializations will merge into the realthat they will remain some of them after we have dissolved their fellows and that thus we shall have discovered a means for perpetuating our dying race  some there are who claim already to have accomplished the thing it is generally supposed that the etherealists have quite a few among their number who are permanent materializations  it is even said that such is tario but that cannot be for he existed before we had discovered the full possibilities of suggestion  there are others among us who insist that none of us is real  that we could not have existed all these ages without material food and water had we ourselves been material  although i am a realist i rather incline toward this belief myself  it seems well and sensibly based upon the belief that our ancient forbears developed before their extinction such wondrous mentalities that some of the stronger minds among them lived after the death of their bodiesthat we are but the deathless minds of individuals long dead  it would appear possible and yet in so far as i am concerned i have all the attributes of corporeal existence  i eat i sleephe paused casting a meaning look upon the girli love  thuvia could not mistake the palpable meaning of his words and expression  she turned away with a little shrug of disgust that was not lost upon the lotharian  he came close to her and seized her arm  why not jav he cried  who more honourable than the second of the worlds most ancient race  your heliumite  he has gone  he has deserted you to your fate to save himself  come be javs  thuvia of ptarth rose to her full height her lifted shoulder turned toward the man her haughty chin upraised a scornful twist to her lips  you lie she said quietly the heliumite knows less of disloyalty than he knows of fear and of fear he is as ignorant as the unhatched young  then where is he taunted the lotharian  i tell you he has fled the valley  he has left you to your fate  but jav will see that it is a pleasant one  tomorrow we shall return into lothar at the head of my victorious army and i shall be jeddak and you shall be my consort  come and he attempted to crush her to his breast  the girl struggled to free herself striking at the man with her metal armlets  yet still he drew her toward him until both were suddenly startled by a hideous growl that rumbled from the dark wood close behind them     chapter x  kar komak the bowman   as carthoris moved through the forest toward the distant cliffs with thuvias hand still tight pressed in his he wondered a little at the girls continued silence yet the contact of her cool palm against his was so pleasant that he feared to break the spell of her newfound reliance in him by speaking  onward through the dim wood they passed until the shadows of the quick coming martian night commenced to close down upon them  then it was that carthoris turned to speak to the girl at his side  they must plan together for the future  it was his idea to pass through the cliffs at once if they could locate the passage and he was quite positive that they were now close to it but he wanted her assent to the proposition  as his eyes rested upon her he was struck by her strangely ethereal appearance  she seemed suddenly to have dissolved into the tenuous substance of a dream and as he continued to gaze upon her she faded slowly from his sight  for an instant he was dumbfounded and then the whole truth flashed suddenly upon him  jav had caused him to believe that thuvia was accompanying him through the wood while as a matter of fact he had detained the girl for himself  carthoris was horrified  he cursed himself for his stupidity and yet he knew that the fiendish power which the lotharian had invoked to confuse him might have deceived any  scarce had he realized the truth than he had started to retrace his steps toward lothar but now he moved at a trot the earthly thews that he had inherited from his father carrying him swiftly over the soft carpet of fallen leaves and rank grass  thurias brilliant light flooded the plain before the walled city of lothar as carthoris broke from the wood opposite the great gate that had given the fugitives egress from the city earlier in the day  at first he saw no indication that there was another than himself anywhere about  the plain was deserted  no myriad bowmen camped now beneath the overhanging verdure of the giant trees  no gory heaps of tortured dead defaced the beauty of the scarlet sward all was silence all was peace  the heliumite scarce pausing at the forests verge pushed on across the plain toward the city when presently he descried a huddled form in the grass at his feet  it was the body of a man lying prone  carthoris turned the figure over upon its back  it was jav but torn and mangled almost beyond recognition  the prince bent low to note if any spark of life remained and as he did so the lids raised and dull suffering eyes looked up into his  the princess of ptarth cried carthoris  where is she  answer me man or i complete the work that another has so well begun  komal muttered jav  he sprang upon me    and would have devoured me but for the girl  then they went away together into the woodthe girl and the great banth    her fingers twined in his tawny mane  which way went they asked carthoris  there replied jav faintly toward the passage through the cliffs  the prince of helium waited to hear no more but springing to his feet raced back again into the forest  it was dawn when he reached the mouth of the dark tunnel that would lead him to the other world beyond this valley of ghostly memories and strange hypnotic influences and menaces  within the long dark passages he met with no accident or obstacle coming at last into the light of day beyond the mountains and no great distance from the southern verge of the domains of the torquasians not more than one hundred and fifty haad at the most  from the boundary of torquas to the city of aaanthor is a distance of some two hundred haads so that the heliumite had before him a journey of more than one hundred and fifty earth miles between him and aaanthor  he could at best but hazard a chance guess that toward aaanthor thuvia would take her flight  there lay the nearest water and there might be expected some day a rescuing party from her fathers empire for carthoris knew thuvan dihn well enough to know that he would leave no stone unturned until he had tracked down the truth as to his daughters abduction and learned all that there might be to learn of her whereabouts  he realized of course that the trick which had laid suspicion upon him would greatly delay the discovery of the truth but little did he guess to what vast proportions had the results of the villainy of astok of dusar already grown  even as he emerged from the mouth of the passage to look across the foothills in the direction of aaanthor a ptarth battle fleet was winging its majestic way slowly toward the twin cities of helium while from far distant kaol raced another mighty armada to join forces with its ally  he did not know that in the face of the circumstantial evidence against him even his own people had commenced to entertain suspicions that he might have stolen the ptarthian princess  he did not know of the lengths to which the dusarians had gone to disrupt the friendship and alliance which existed between the three great powers of the eastern hemispherehelium ptarth and kaol  how dusarian emissaries had found employment in important posts in the foreign offices of the three great nations and how through these men messages from one jeddak to another were altered and garbled until the patience and pride of the three rulers and former friends could no longer endure the humiliations and insults contained in these falsified papersnot any of this he knew  nor did he know how even to the last john carter warlord of mars had refused to permit the jeddak of helium to declare war against either ptarth or kaol because of his implicit belief in his son and that eventually all would be satisfactorily explained  and now two great fleets were moving upon helium while the dusarian spies at the court of tardos mors saw to it that the twin cities remained in ignorance of their danger  war had been declared by thuvan dihn but the messenger who had been dispatched with the proclamation had been a dusarian who had seen to it that no word of warning reached the twin cities of the approach of a hostile fleet  for several days diplomatic relations had been severed between helium and her two most powerful neighbors and with the departure of the ministers had come a total cessation of wireless communication between the disputants as is usual upon barsoom  but of all this carthoris was ignorant  all that interested him at present was the finding of thuvia of ptarth  her trail beside that of the huge banth had been well marked to the tunnel and was once more visible leading southward into the foothills  as he followed rapidly downward toward the dead seabottom where he knew he must lose the spoor in the resilient ochre vegetation he was suddenly surprised to see a naked man approaching him from the northeast  as the fellow drew closer carthoris halted to await his coming he knew that the man was unarmed and that he was apparently a lotharian for his skin was white and his hair auburn  he approached the heliumite without sign of fear and when quite close called out the cheery barsoomian kaor of greeting  who are you asked carthoris  i am kar komak odwar of the bowmen replied the other  a strange thing has happened to me  for ages tario has been bringing me into existence as he needed the services of the army of his mind  of all the bowmen it has been kar komak who has been oftenest materialized  for a long time tario has been concentrating his mind upon my permanent materialization  it has been an obsession with him that some day this thing could be accomplished and the future of lothar assured  he asserted that matter was nonexistent except in the imagination of manthat all was mental and so he believed that by persisting in his suggestion he could eventually make of me a permanent suggestion in the minds of all creatures  yesterday he succeeded but at such a time  it must have come all unknown to him as it came to me without my knowledge as with my horde of yelling bowmen i pursued the fleeing torquasians back to their ochre plains  as darkness settled and the time came for us to fade once more into thin air i suddenly found myself alone upon the edge of the great plain which lies yonder at the foot of the low hills  my men were gone back to the nothingness from which they had sprung but i remainednaked and unarmed  at first i could not understand but at last came a realization of what had occurred  tarios long suggestions had at last prevailed and kar komak had become a reality in the world of men but my harness and my weapons had faded away with my fellows leaving me naked and unarmed in a hostile country far from lothar  you wish to return to lothar asked carthoris  no replied kar komak quickly  i have no love for tario  being a creature of his mind i know him too well  he is cruel and tyrannicala master i have no desire to serve  now that he has succeeded in accomplishing my permanent materialization he will be unbearable and he will go on until he has filled lothar with his creatures  i wonder if he has succeeded as well with the maid of lothar  i thought there were no women there said carthoris  in a hidden apartment in the palace of tario replied kar komak the jeddak has maintained the suggestion of a beautiful girl hoping that some day she would become permanent  i have seen her there she is wonderful  but for her sake i hope that tario succeeds not so well with her as he has with me  now red man i have told you of myselfwhat of you  carthoris liked the face and manner of the bowman  there had been no sign of doubt or fear in his expression as he had approached the heavilyarmed heliumite and he had spoken directly and to the point  so the prince of helium told the bowman of lothar who he was and what adventure had brought him to this far country  good exclaimed the other when he had done  kar komak will accompany you  together we shall find the princess of ptarth and with you kar komak will return to the world of mensuch a world as he knew in the longgone past when the ships of mighty lothar ploughed angry throxus and the roaring surf beat against the barrier of these parched and dreary hills  what mean you asked carthoris  had you really a former actual existence  most assuredly replied kar komak  in my day i commanded the fleets of lotharmightiest of all the fleets that sailed the five salt seas  wherever men lived upon barsoom there was the name of kar komak known and respected  peaceful were the land races in those distant daysonly the seafarers were warriors but now has the glory of the past faded nor did i think until i met you that there remained upon barsoom a single person of our own mould who lived and loved and fought as did the ancient seafarers of my time  ah but it will seem good to see men once againreal men  never had i much respect for the landsmen of my day  they remained in their walled cities wasting their time in play depending for their protection entirely upon the sea race  and the poor creatures who remain the tarios and javs of lothar are even worse than their ancient forbears  carthoris was a trifle skeptical as to the wisdom of permitting the stranger to attach himself to him  there was always the chance that he was but the essence of some hypnotic treachery which tario or jav was attempting to exert upon the heliumite and yet so sincere had been the manner and the words of the bowman so much the fighting man did he seem but carthoris could not find it in his heart to doubt him  the outcome of the matter was that he gave the naked odwar leave to accompany him and together they set out upon the spoor of thuvia and komal  down to the ochre seabottom the trail led  there it disappeared as carthoris had known that it would but where it entered the plain its direction had been toward aaanthor and so toward aaanthor the two turned their faces  it was a long and tedious journey fraught with many dangers  the bowman could not travel at the pace set by carthoris whose muscles carried him with great rapidity over the face of the small planet the force of gravity of which exerts so much less retarding power than that of the earth  fifty miles a day is a fair average for a barsoomian but the son of john carter might easily have covered a hundred or more miles had he cared to desert his newfound comrade  all the way they were in constant danger of discovery by roving bands of torquasians and especially was this true before they reached the boundary of torquas  good fortune was with them however and although they sighted two detachments of the savage green men they were not themselves seen  and so they came upon the morning of the third day within sight of the glistening domes of distant aaanthor  throughout the journey carthoris had ever strained his eyes ahead in search of thuvia and the great banth but not till now had he seen aught to give him hope  this morning far ahead halfway between themselves and aaanthor the men saw two tiny figures moving toward the city  for a moment they watched them intently  then carthoris convinced leaped forward at a rapid run kar komak following as swiftly as he could  the heliumite shouted to attract the girls attention and presently he was rewarded by seeing her turn and stand looking toward him at her side the great banth stood with uppricked ears watching the approaching man  not yet could thuvia of ptarth have recognized carthoris though that it was he she must have been convinced for she waited there for him without sign of fear  presently he saw her point toward the northwest beyond him without slackening his pace he turned his eyes in the direction she indicated  racing silently over the thick vegetation not half a mile behind came a score of fierce green warriors charging him upon their mighty thoats  to their right was kar komak naked and unarmed yet running valiantly toward carthoris and shouting warning as though he too had but just discovered the silent menacing company that moved so swiftly forward with couched spears and ready longswords  carthoris shouted to the lotharian warning him back for he knew that he could but uselessly sacrifice his life by placing himself all unarmed in the path of the cruel and relentless savages  but kar komak never hesitated  with shouts of encouragement to his new friend he hurried onward toward the prince of helium  the red mans heart leaped in response to this exhibition of courage and selfsacrifice  he regretted now that he had not thought to give kar komak one of his swords but it was too late to attempt it for should he wait for the lotharian to overtake him or return to meet him the torquasians would reach thuvia of ptarth before he could do so  even as it was it would be nip and tuck as to who came first to her side  again he turned his face in her direction and now from aaanthor way he saw a new force hastening toward themtwo mediumsized war craftand even at the distance they still were from him he discerned the device of dusar upon their bows  now indeed seemed little hope for thuvia of ptarth  with savage warriors of the hordes of torquas charging toward her from one direction and no less implacable enemies in the form of the creatures of astok prince of dusar bearing down upon her from another while only a banth a red warrior and an unarmed bowman were near to defend her her plight was quite hopeless and her cause already lost ere ever it was contested  as thuvia saw carthoris approaching she felt again that unaccountable sensation of entire relief from responsibility and fear that she had experienced upon a former occasion  nor could she account for it while her mind still tried to convince her heart that the prince of helium had been instrumental in her abduction from her fathers court  she only knew that she was glad when he was by her side and that with him there all things seemed possibleeven such impossible things as escape from her present predicament  now had he stopped panting before her  a brave smile of encouragement lit his face  courage my princess he whispered  to the girls memory flashed the occasion upon which he had used those same wordsin the throneroom of tario of lothar as they had commenced to slip down the sinking marble floor toward an unknown fate  then she had not chidden him for the use of that familiar salutation nor did she chide him now though she was promised to another she wondered at herselfflushing at her own turpitude for upon barsoom it is a shameful thing for a woman to listen to those two words from another than her husband or her betrothed  carthoris saw her flush of mortification and in an instant regretted his words  there was but a moment before the green warriors would be upon them  forgive me said the man in a low voice  let my great love be my excusethat and the belief that i have but a moment more of life and with the words he turned to meet the foremost of the green warriors  the fellow was charging with couched spear but carthoris leaped to one side and as the great thoat and its rider hurtled harmlessly past him he swung his longsword in a mighty cut that clove the green carcass in twain  at the same moment kar komak leaped with bare hands clawing at the leg of another of the huge riders the balance of the horde raced in to close quarters dismounting the better to wield their favourite longswords the dusarian fliers touched the soft carpet of the ochreclad seabottom disgorging fifty fighting men from their bowels and into the swirling sea of cutting slashing swords sprang komal the great banth     chapter xi  green men and white apes   a torquasian sword smote a glancing blow across the forehead of carthoris  he had a fleeting vision of soft arms about his neck and warm lips close to his before he lost consciousness  how long he lay there senseless he could not guess but when he opened his eyes again he was alone except for the bodies of the dead green men and dusarians and the carcass of a great banth that lay half across his own  thuvia was gone nor was the body of kar komak among the dead  weak from loss of blood carthoris made his way slowly toward aaanthor reaching its outskirts at dark  he wanted water more than any other thing and so he kept on up a broad avenue toward the great central plaza where he knew the precious fluid was to be found in a halfruined building opposite the great palace of the ancient jeddak who once had ruled this mighty city  disheartened and discouraged by the strange sequence of events that seemed foreordained to thwart his every attempt to serve the princess of ptarth he paid little or no attention to his surroundings moving through the deserted city as though no great white apes lurked in the black shadows of the mysteryhaunted piles that flanked the broad avenues and the great plaza  but if carthoris was careless of his surroundings not so other eyes that watched his entrance into the plaza and followed his slow footsteps toward the marble pile that housed the tiny halfchoked spring whose water one might gain only by scratching a deep hole in the red sand that covered it  and as the heliumite entered the small building a dozen mighty grotesque figures emerged from the doorway of the palace to speed noiselessly across the plaza toward him  for half an hour carthoris remained in the building digging for water and gaining the few muchneeded drops which were the fruits of his labour  then he rose and slowly left the structure  scarce had he stepped beyond the threshold than twelve torquasian warriors leaped upon him  no time then to draw longsword but swift from his harness flew his long slim dagger and as he went down beneath them more than a single green heart ceased beating at the bite of that keen point  then they overpowered him and took his weapons away but only nine of the twelve warriors who had crossed the plaza returned with their prize  they dragged their prisoner roughly to the palace pits where in utter darkness they chained him with rusty links to the solid masonry of the wall  tomorrow thar ban will speak with you they said  now he sleeps  but great will be his pleasure when he learns who has wandered amongst usand great will be the pleasure of hortan gur when thar ban drags before him the mad fool who dared prick the great jeddak with his sword  then they left him to the silence and the darkness  for what seemed hours carthoris squatted upon the stone floor of his prison his back against the wall in which was sunk the heavy eyebolt that secured the chain which held him  then from out of the mysterious blackness before him there came to his ears the sound of naked feet moving stealthily upon stoneapproaching nearer and nearer to where he lay unarmed and defenceless  minutes passedminutes that seemed hoursduring which time periods of sepulchral silence would be followed by a repetition of the uncanny scraping of naked feet slinking warily upon him  at last he heard a sudden rush of unshod soles across the empty blackness and at a little distance a scuffling sound heavy breathing and once what he thought the muttered imprecation of a man battling against great odds  then the clanging of a chain and a noise as of the snapping back against stone of a broken link  again came silence  but for a moment only  now he heard once more the soft feet approaching him  he thought that he discerned wicked eyes gleaming fearfully at him through the darkness  he knew that he could hear the heavy breathing of powerful lungs  then came the rush of many feet toward him and the things were upon him  hands terminating in manlike fingers clutched at his throat and arms and legs  hairy bodies strained and struggled against his own smooth hide as he battled in grim silence against these horrid foemen in the darkness of the pits of ancient aaanthor  thewed like some giant god was carthoris of helium yet in the clutches of these unseen creatures of the pits stygian night he was helpless as a frail woman  yet he battled on striking futile blows against great hispid breasts he could not see feeling thick squat throats beneath his fingers the drool of saliva upon his cheek and hot foul breath in his nostrils  fangs too mighty fangs he knew were close and why they did not sink into his flesh he could not guess  at last he became aware of the mighty surging of a number of his antagonists back and forth upon the great chain that held him and presently came the same sound that he had heard at a little distance from him a short time before he had been attackedhis chain had parted and the broken end snapped back against the stone wall  now he was seized upon either side and dragged at a rapid pace through the dark corridorstoward what fate he could not even guess  at first he had thought his foes might be of the tribe of torquas but their hairy bodies belied that belief  now he was at last quite sure of their identity though why they had not killed and devoured him at once he could not imagine  after half an hour or more of rapid racing through the underground passages that are a distinguishing feature of all barsoomian cities modern as well as ancient his captors suddenly emerged into the moonlight of a courtyard far from the central plaza  immediately carthoris saw that he was in the power of a tribe of the great white apes of barsoom  all that had caused him doubt before as to the identity of his attackers was the hairiness of their breasts for the white apes are entirely hairless except for a great shock bristling from their heads  now he saw the cause of that which had deceived himacross the chest of each of them were strips of hairy hide usually of banth in imitation of the harness of the green warriors who so often camped at their deserted city  carthoris had read of the existence of tribes of apes that seemed to be progressing slowly toward higher standards of intelligence into the hands of such he realized he had fallen butwhat were their intentions toward him  as he glanced about the courtyard he saw fully fifty of the hideous beasts squatting on their haunches and at a little distance from him another human being closely guarded  as his eyes met those of his fellowcaptive a smile lit the others face and  kaor red man burst from his lips  it was kar komak the bowman  kaor cried carthoris in response  how came you here and what befell the princess  red men like yourself descended in mighty ships that sailed the air even as the great ships of my distant day sailed the five seas replied kar komak  they fought with the green men of torquas they slew komal god of lothar  i thought they were your friends and i was glad when finally those of them who survived the battle carried the red girl to one of the ships and sailed away with her into the safety of the high air  then the green men seized me and carried me to a great empty city where they chained me to a wall in a black pit  afterward came these and dragged me hither  and what of you red man  carthoris related all that had befallen him and as the two men talked the great apes squatted about them watching them intently  what are we to do now asked the bowman  our case looks rather hopeless replied carthoris ruefully these creatures are born maneaters  why they have not already devoured us i cannot imaginethere he whispered  see  the end is coming  kar komak looked in the direction carthoris indicated to see a huge ape advancing with a mighty bludgeon  it is thus they like best to kill their prey said carthoris  must we die without a struggle asked kar komak  not i replied carthoris though i know how futile our best defence must be against these mighty brutes  oh for a longsword  or a good bow added kar komak and a utan of bowmen  at the words carthoris half sprang to his feet only to be dragged roughly down by his guard  kar komak he cried  why cannot you do what tario and jav did they had no bowmen other than those of their own creation  you must know the secret of their power  call forth your own utan kar komak  the lotharian looked at carthoris in wideeyed astonishment as the full purport of the suggestion bore in upon his understanding  why not he murmured  the savage ape bearing the mighty bludgeon was slinking toward carthoris  the heliumites fingers were working as he kept his eyes upon his executioner  kar komak bent his gaze penetratingly upon the apes  the effort of his mind was evidenced in the sweat upon his contracted brows  the creature that was to slay the red man was almost within arms reach of his prey when carthoris heard a hoarse shout from the opposite side of the courtyard  in common with the squatting apes and the demon with the club he turned in the direction of the sound to see a company of sturdy bowmen rushing from the doorway of a nearby building  with screams of rage the apes leaped to their feet to meet the charge  a volley of arrows met them halfway sending a dozen rolling lifeless to the ground  then the apes closed with their adversaries  all their attention was occupied by the attackerseven the guard had deserted the prisoners to join in the battle  come whispered kar komak  now may we escape while their attention is diverted from us by my bowmen  and leave those brave fellows leaderless cried carthoris whose loyal nature revolted at the merest suggestion of such a thing  kar komak laughed  you forget he said that they are but thin airfigments of my brain  they will vanish unscathed when we have no further need for them  praised be your first ancestor redman that you thought of this chance in time  it would never have occurred to me to imagine that i might wield the same power that brought me into existence  you are right said carthoris  still i hate to leave them though there is naught else to do and so the two turned from the courtyard and making their way into one of the broad avenues crept stealthily in the shadows of the building toward the great central plaza upon which were the buildings occupied by the green warriors when they visited the deserted city  when they had come to the plazas edge carthoris halted  wait here he whispered  i go to fetch thoats since on foot we may never hope to escape the clutches of these green fiends  to reach the courtyard where the thoats were kept it was necessary for carthoris to pass through one of the buildings which surrounded the square  which were occupied and which not he could not even guess so he was compelled to take considerable chances to gain the enclosure in which he could hear the restless beasts squealing and quarrelling among themselves  chance carried him through a dark doorway into a large chamber in which lay a score or more green warriors wrapped in their sleeping silks and furs  scarce had carthoris passed through the short hallway that connected the door of the building and the great room beyond it than he became aware of the presence of something or some one in the hallway through which he had but just passed  he heard a man yawn and then behind him he saw the figure of a sentry rise from where the fellow had been dozing and stretching himself resume his wakeful watchfulness  carthoris realized that he must have passed within a foot of the warrior doubtless rousing him from his slumber  to retreat now would be impossible  yet to cross through that roomful of sleeping warriors seemed almost equally beyond the pale of possibility  carthoris shrugged his broad shoulders and chose the lesser evil warily he entered the room  at his right against the wall leaned several swords and rifles and spearsextra weapons which the warriors had stacked here ready to their hands should there be a night alarm calling them suddenly from slumber  beside each sleeper lay his weaponthese were never far from their owners from childhood to death  the sight of the swords made the young mans palm itch  he stepped quickly to them selecting two shortswordsone for kar komak the other for himself also some trappings for his naked comrade  then he started directly across the centre of the apartment among the sleeping torquasians  not a man of them moved until carthoris had completed more than half of the short though dangerous journey  then a fellow directly in his path turned restlessly upon his sleeping silks and furs  the heliumite paused above him one of the shortswords in readiness should the warrior awaken  for what seemed an eternity to the young prince the green man continued to move uneasily upon his couch then as though actuated by springs he leaped to his feet and faced the red man  instantly carthoris struck but not before a savage grunt escaped the others lips  in an instant the room was in turmoil  warriors leaped to their feet grasping their weapons as they rose and shouting to one another for an explanation of the disturbance  to carthoris all within the room was plainly visible in the dim light reflected from without for the further moon stood directly at zenith but to the eyes of the newlyawakened green men objects as yet had not taken on familiar formsthey but saw vaguely the figures of warriors moving about their apartment  now one stumbled against the corpse of him whom carthoris had slain  the fellow stooped and his hand came in contact with the cleft skull  he saw about him the giant figures of other green men and so he jumped to the only conclusion that was open to him  the thurds he cried  the thurds are upon us  rise warriors of torquas and drive home your swords within the hearts of torquas ancient enemies  instantly the green men began to fall upon one another with naked swords  their savage lust of battle was aroused  to fight to kill to die with cold steel buried in their vitals  ah that to them was nirvana  carthoris was quick to guess their error and take advantage of it he knew that in the pleasure of killing they might fight on long after they had discovered their mistake unless their attention was distracted by sight of the real cause of the altercation and so he lost no time in continuing across the room to the doorway upon the opposite side which opened into the inner court where the savage thoats were squealing and fighting among themselves  once here he had no easy task before him  to catch and mount one of these habitually rageful and intractable beasts was no childs play under the best of conditions but now when silence and time were such important considerations it might well have seemed quite hopeless to a less resourceful and optimistic man than the son of the great warlord  from his father he had learned much concerning the traits of these mighty beasts and from tars tarkas also when he had visited that great green jeddak among his horde at thark  so now he centred upon the work in hand all that he had ever learned about them from others and from his own experience for he too had ridden and handled them many times  the temper of the thoats of torquas appeared even shorter than their vicious cousins among the tharks and warhoons and for a time it seemed unlikely that he should escape a savage charge on the part of a couple of old bulls that circled squealing about him but at last he managed to get close enough to one of them to touch the beast  with the feel of his hand upon the sleek hide the creature quieted and in answer to the telepathic command of the red man sank to its knees  in a moment carthoris was upon its back guiding it toward the great gate that leads from the courtyard through a large building at one end into an avenue beyond  the other bull still squealing and enraged followed after his fellow  there was no bridle upon either for these strange creatures are controlled entirely by suggestionwhen they are controlled at all  even in the hands of the giant green men bridle reins would be hopelessly futile against the mad savagery and mastodonic strength of the thoat and so they are guided by that strange telepathic power with which the men of mars have learned to communicate in a crude way with the lower orders of their planet  with difficulty carthoris urged the two beasts to the gate where leaning down he raised the latch  then the thoat that he was riding placed his great shoulder to the skeelwood planking pushed through and a moment later the man and the two beasts were swinging silently down the avenue to the edge of the plaza where kar komak hid  here carthoris found considerable difficulty in subduing the second thoat and as kar komak had never before ridden one of the beasts it seemed a most hopeless job but at last the bowman managed to scramble to the sleek back and again the two beasts fled softly down the mossgrown avenues toward the open seabottom beyond the city  all that night and the following day and the second night they rode toward the northeast  no indication of pursuit developed and at dawn of the second day carthoris saw in the distance the waving ribbon of great trees that marked one of the long barsoomian waterways  immediately they abandoned their thoats and approached the cultivated district on foot  carthoris also discarded the metal from his harness or such of it as might serve to identify him as a heliumite or of royal blood for he did not know to what nation belonged this waterway and upon mars it is always well to assume every man and nation your enemy until you have learned the contrary  it was midforenoon when the two at last entered one of the roads that cut through the cultivated districts at regular intervals joining the arid wastes on either side with the great white central highway that follows through the centre from end to end of the farreaching threadlike farm lands  the high wall surrounding the fields served as a protection against surprise by raiding green hordes as well as keeping the savage banths and other carnivora from the domestic animals and the human beings upon the farms  carthoris stopped before the first gate he came to pounding for admission  the young man who answered his summons greeted the two hospitably though he looked with considerable wonder upon the white skin and auburn hair of the bowman  after he had listened for a moment to a partial narration of their escape from the torquasians he invited them within took them to his house and bade the servants there prepare food for them  as they waited in the lowceiled pleasant living room of the farmhouse until the meal should be ready carthoris drew his host into conversation that he might learn his nationality and thus the nation under whose dominion lay the waterway where circumstance had placed him  i am hal vas said the young man son of vas kor of dusar a noble in the retinue of astok prince of dusar  at present i am dwar of the road for this district  carthoris was very glad that he had not disclosed his identity for though he had no idea of anything that had transpired since he had left helium or that astok was at the bottom of all his misfortunes he well knew that the dusarian had no love for him and that he could hope for no assistance within the dominions of dusar  and who are you asked hal vas  by your appearance i take you for a fighting man but i see no insignia upon your harness  can it be that you are a panthan  now these wandering soldiers of fortune are common upon barsoom where most men love to fight  they sell their services wherever war exists and in the occasional brief intervals when there is no organized warfare between the red nations they join one of the numerous expeditions that are constantly being dispatched against the green men in protection of the waterways that traverse the wilder portions of the globe  when their service is over they discard the metal of the nation they have been serving until they shall have found a new master in the intervals they wear no insignia their warworn harness and grim weapons being sufficient to attest their calling  the suggestion was a happy one and carthoris embraced the chance it afforded to account satisfactorily for himself  there was however a single drawback  in times of war such panthans as happened to be within the domain of a belligerent nation were compelled to don the insignia of that nation and fight with her warriors  as far as carthoris knew dusar was not at war with any other nation but there was never any telling when one red nation would be flying at the throat of a neighbour even though the great and powerful alliance at the head of which was his father john carter had managed to maintain a long peace upon the greater portion of barsoom  a pleasant smile lighted hal vas face as carthoris admitted his vocation  it is well exclaimed the young man that you chanced to come hither for here you will find the means of obtaining service in short order  my father vas kor is even now with me having come hither to recruit a force for the new war against helium     chapter xii  to save dusar   thuvia of ptarth battling for more than life against the lust of jav cast a quick glance over her shoulder toward the forest from which had rumbled the fierce growl  jav looked too  what they saw filled each with apprehension  it was komal the banthgod rushing widejawed upon them  which had he chosen for his prey  or was it to be both  they had not long to wait for though the lotharian attempted to hold the girl between himself and the terrible fangs the great beast found him at last  then shrieking he attempted to fly toward lothar after pushing thuvia bodily into the face of the maneater  but his flight was of short duration  in a moment komal was upon him rending his throat and chest with demoniacal fury  the girl reached their side a moment later but it was with difficulty that she tore the mad beast from its prey  still growling and casting hungry glances back upon jav the banth at last permitted itself to be led away into the wood  with her giant protector by her side thuvia set forth to find the passage through the cliffs that she might attempt the seemingly impossible feat of reaching fardistant ptarth across the more than seventeen thousand haads of savage barsoom  she could not believe that carthoris had deliberately deserted her and so she kept a constant watch for him but as she bore too far to the north in her search for the tunnel she passed the heliumite as he was returning to lothar in search of her  thuvia of ptarth was having difficulty in determining the exact status of the prince of helium in her heart  she could not admit even to herself that she loved him and yet she had permitted him to apply to her that term of endearment and possession to which a barsoomian maid should turn deaf ears when voiced by other lips than those of her husband or fiancemy princess  kulan tith jeddak of kaol to whom she was affianced commanded her respect and admiration  had it been that she had surrendered to her fathers wishes because of pique that the handsome heliumite had not taken advantage of his visits to her fathers court to push the suit for her hand that she had been quite sure he had contemplated since that distant day the two had sat together upon the carved seat within the gorgeous garden of the jeddaks that graced the inner courtyard of the palace of salensus oll at kadabra  did she love kulan tith  bravely she tried to believe that she did but all the while her eyes wandered through the coming darkness for the figure of a cleanlimbed fighting manblackhaired and greyeyed  black was the hair of kulan tith but his eyes were brown  it was almost dark when she found the entrance to the tunnel  safely she passed through to the hills beyond and here under the bright light of mars two moons she halted to plan her future action  should she wait here in the hope that carthoris would return in search of her  or should she continue her way northeast toward ptarth  where first would carthoris have gone after leaving the valley of lothar  her parched throat and dry tongue gave her the answertoward aaanthor and water  well she too would go first to aaanthor where she might find more than the water she needed  with komal by her side she felt little fear for he would protect her from all other savage beasts  even the great white apes would flee the mighty banth in terror  men only need she fear but she must take this and many other chances before she could hope to reach her fathers court again  when at last carthoris found her only to be struck down by the longsword of a green man thuvia prayed that the same fate might overtake her  the sight of the red warriors leaping from their fliers had for a moment filled her with renewed hopehope that carthoris of helium might be only stunned and that they would rescue him but when she saw the dusarian metal upon their harness and that they sought only to escape with her alone from the charging torquasians she gave up  komal too was deaddead across the body of the heliumite  she was indeed alone now  there was none to protect her  the dusarian warriors dragged her to the deck of the nearest flier all about them the green warriors surged in an attempt to wrest her from the red  at last those who had not died in the conflict gained the decks of the two craft  the engines throbbed and purredthe propellers whirred  quickly the swift boats shot heavenward  thuvia of ptarth glanced about her  a man stood near smiling down into her face  with a gasp of recognition she looked full into his eyes and then with a little moan of terror and understanding she buried her face in her hands and sank to the polished skeelwood deck  it was astok prince of dusar who bent above her  swift were the fliers of astok of dusar and great the need for reaching his fathers court as quickly as possible for the fleets of war of helium and ptarth and kaol were scattered far and wide above barsoom  nor would it go well with astok or dusar should any one of them discover thuvia of ptarth a prisoner upon his own vessel  aaanthor lies in fifty south latitude and forty east of horz the deserted seat of ancient barsoomian culture and learning while dusar lies fifteen degrees north of the equator and twenty degrees east from horz  great though the distance is the fliers covered it without a stop long before they had reached their destination thuvia of ptarth had learned several things that cleared up the doubts that had assailed her mind for many days  scarce had they risen above aaanthor than she recognized one of the crew as a member of the crew of that other flier that had borne her from her fathers gardens to aaanthor the presence of astok upon the craft settled the whole question she had been stolen by emissaries of the dusarian princecarthoris of helium had had nothing to do with it  nor did astok deny the charge when she accused him  he only smiled and pleaded his love for her  i would sooner mate with a white ape she cried when he would have urged his suit  astok glowered sullenly upon her  you shall mate with me thuvia of ptarth he growled or by your first ancestor you shall have your preferenceand mate with a white ape  the girl made no reply nor could he draw her into conversation during the balance of the journey  as a matter of fact astok was a trifle awed by the proportions of the conflict which his abduction of the ptarthian princess had induced nor was he over comfortable with the weight of responsibility which the possession of such a prisoner entailed  his one thought was to get her to dusar and there let his father assume the responsibility  in the meantime he would be as careful as possible to do nothing to affront her lest they all might be captured and he have to account for his treatment of the girl to one of the great jeddaks whose interest centred in her  and so at last they came to dusar where astok hid his prisoner in a secret room high in the east tower of his own palace  he had sworn his men to silence in the matter of the identity of the girl for until he had seen his father nutus jeddak of dusar he dared not let any one know whom he had brought with him from the south  but when he appeared in the great audience chamber before the cruellipped man who was his sire he found his courage oozing and he dared not speak of the princess hid within his palace  it occurred to him to test his fathers sentiments upon the subject and so he told a tale of capturing one who claimed to know the whereabouts of thuvia of ptarth  and if you command it sire he said i will go and capture herfetching her here to dusar  nutus frowned and shook his head  you have done enough already to set ptarth and kaol and helium all three upon us at once should they learn your part in the theft of the ptarth princess  that you succeeded in shifting the guilt upon the prince of helium was fortunate and a masterly move of strategy but were the girl to know the truth and ever return to her fathers court all dusar would have to pay the penalty and to have her here a prisoner amongst us would be an admission of guilt from the consequences of which naught could save us  it would cost me my throne astok and that i have no mind to lose  if we had her here the elder man suddenly commenced to muse repeating the phrase again and again  if we had her here astok he exclaimed fiercely  ah if we but had her here and none knew that she was here  can you not guess man  the guilt of dusar might be for ever buried with her bones he concluded in a low savage whisper  astok prince of dusar shuddered  weak he was yes and wicked too but the suggestion that his fathers words implied turned him cold with horror  cruel to their enemies are the men of mars but the word enemies is commonly interpreted to mean men only  assassination runs riot in the great barsoomian cities yet to murder a woman is a crime so unthinkable that even the most hardened of the paid assassins would shrink from you in horror should you suggest such a thing to him  nutus was apparently oblivious to his sons alltoopatent terror at his suggestion  presently he continued  you say that you know where the girl lies hid since she was stolen from your people at aaanthor  should she be found by any one of the three powers her unsupported story would be sufficient to turn them all against us  there is but one way astok cried the older man  you must return at once to her hidingplace and fetch her hither in all secrecy and look you here  return not to dusar without her upon pain of death  astok prince of dusar well knew his royal fathers temper  he knew that in the tyrants heart there pulsed no single throb of love for any creature  astoks mother had been a slave woman  nutus had never loved her he had never loved another  in youth he had tried to find a bride at the courts of several of his powerful neighbours but their women would have none of him  after a dozen daughters of his own nobility had sought selfdestruction rather than wed him he had given up  and then it had been that he had legally wed one of his slaves that he might have a son to stand among the jeds when nutus died and a new jeddak was chosen  slowly astok withdrew from the presence of his father  with white face and shaking limbs he made his way to his own palace  as he crossed the courtyard his glance chanced to wander to the great east tower looming high against the azure of the sky  at sight of it beads of sweat broke out upon his brow  issus  no other hand than his could be trusted to do the horrid thing  with his own fingers he must crush the life from that perfect throat or plunge the silent blade into the red red heart  her heart  the heart that he had hoped would brim with love for him  but had it done so  he recalled the haughty contempt with which his protestations of love had been received  he went cold and then hot to the memory of it  his compunctions cooled as the selfsatisfaction of a near revenge crowded out the finer instincts that had for a moment asserted themselvesthe good that he had inherited from the slave woman was once again submerged in the bad blood that had come down to him from his royal sire as in the end it always was  a cold smile supplanted the terror that had dilated his eyes  he turned his steps toward the tower  he would see her before he set out upon the journey that was to blind his father to the fact that the girl was already in dusar  quietly he passed in through the secret way ascending a spiral runway to the apartment in which the princess of ptarth was immured  as he entered the room he saw the girl leaning upon the sill of the east casement gazing out across the roof tops of dusar toward distant ptarth  he hated ptarth  the thought of it filled him with rage  why not finish her now and have it done with  at the sound of his step she turned quickly toward him  ah how beautiful she was  his sudden determination faded beneath the glorious light of her wondrous beauty  he would wait until he had returned from his little journey of deceptionmaybe there might be some other way then  some other hand to strike the blowwith that face with those eyes before him he could never do it  of that he was positive  he had always gloried in the cruelty of his nature but issus he was not that cruel  no another must be foundone whom he could trust  he was still looking at her as she stood there before him meeting his gaze steadily and unafraid  he felt the hot passion of his love mounting higher and higher  why not sue once more  if she would relent all might yet be well  even if his father could not be persuaded they could fly to ptarth laying all the blame of the knavery and intrigue that had thrown four great nations into war upon the shoulders of nutus and who was there that would doubt the justice of the charge  thuvia he said i come once again for the last time to lay my heart at your feet  ptarth and kaol and dusar are battling with helium because of you  wed me thuvia and all may yet be as it should be  the girl shook her head  wait he commanded before she could speak  know the truth before you speak words that may seal not only your own fate but that of the thousands of warriors who battle because of you  refuse to wed me willingly and dusar would be laid waste should ever the truth be known to ptarth and kaol and helium  they would raze our cities leaving not one stone upon another  they would scatter our peoples across the face of barsoom from the frozen north to the frozen south hunting them down and slaying them until this great nation remained only as a hated memory in the minds of men  but while they are exterminating the dusarians countless thousands of their own warriors must perishand all because of the stubbornness of a single woman who would not wed the prince who loves her  refuse thuvia of ptarth and there remains but a single alternativeno man must ever know your fate  only a handful of loyal servitors besides my royal father and myself know that you were stolen from the gardens of thuvan dihn by astok prince of dusar or that today you be imprisoned in my palace  refuse thuvia of ptarth and you must die to save dusarthere is no other way  nutus the jeddak has so decreed  i have spoken  for a long moment the girl let her level gaze rest full upon the face of astok of dusar  then she spoke and though the words were few the unimpassioned tone carried unfathomable depths of cold contempt  better all that you have threatened she said than you  then she turned her back upon him and went to stand once more before the east window gazing with sad eyes toward distant ptarth  astok wheeled and left the room returning after a short interval of time with food and drink  here he said is sustenance until i return again  the next to enter this apartment will be your executioner  commend yourself to your ancestors thuvia of ptarth for within a few days you shall be with them  then he was gone  half an hour later he was interviewing an officer high in the navy of dusar  whither went vas kor he asked  he is not at his palace  south to the great waterway that skirts torquas replied the other  his son hal vas is dwar of the road there and thither has vas kor gone to enlist recruits among the workers on the farms  good said astok and a halfhour more found him rising above dusar in his swiftest flier     chapter xiii  turjun the panthan   the face of carthoris of helium gave no token of the emotions that convulsed him inwardly as he heard from the lips of hal vas that helium was at war with dusar and that fate had thrown him into the service of the enemy  that he might utilize this opportunity to the good of helium scarce sufficed to outweigh the chagrin he felt that he was not fighting in the open at the head of his own loyal troops  to escape the dusarians might prove an easy matter and then again it might not  should they suspect his loyalty and the loyalty of an impressed panthan was always open to suspicion he might not find an opportunity to elude their vigilance until after the termination of the war which might occur within days or again only after long and weary years of bloodshed  he recalled that history recorded wars in which actual military operations had been carried on without cessation for five or six hundred years and even now there were nations upon barsoom with which helium had made no peace within the history of man  the outlook was not cheering  he could not guess that within a few hours he would be blessing the fate that had thrown him into the service of dusar  ah exclaimed hal vas  here is my father now  kaor vas kor here is one you will be glad to meeta doughty panthan  he hesitated  turjun interjected carthoris seizing upon the first appellation that occurred to him  as he spoke his eyes crossed quickly to the tall warrior who was entering the room  where before had he seen that giant figure that taciturn countenance and the livid swordcut from temple to mouth  vas kor repeated carthoris mentally  vas kor where had he seen the man before  and then the noble spoke and like a flash it all came back to carthoristhe forward servant upon the landingstage at ptarth that time that he had been explaining the intricacies of his new compass to thuvan dihn the lone slave that had guarded his own hangar that night he had left upon his illfated journey for ptarththe journey that had brought him so mysteriously to far aaanthor  vas kor he repeated aloud blessed be your ancestors for this meeting nor did the dusarian guess the wealth of meaning that lay beneath that hackneyed phrase with which a barsoomian acknowledges an introduction  and blessed be yours turjun replied vas kor  now came the introduction of kar komak to vas kor and as carthoris went through the little ceremony there came to him the only explanation he might make to account for the white skin and auburn hair of the bowman for he feared that the truth might not be believed and thus suspicion be cast upon them both from the beginning  kar komak he explained is as you can see a thern  he has wandered far from his icebound southern temples in search of adventure  i came upon him in the pits of aaanthor but though i have known him so short a time i can vouch for his bravery and loyalty  since the destruction of the fabric of their false religion by john carter the majority of the therns had gladly accepted the new order of things so that it was now no longer uncommon to see them mingling with the multitudes of red men in any of the great cities of the outer world so vas kor neither felt nor expressed any great astonishment  all during the interview carthoris watched catlike for some indication that vas kor recognized in the battered panthan the erstwhile gorgeous prince of helium but the sleepless nights the long days of marching and fighting the wounds and the dried blood had evidently sufficed to obliterate the last remnant of his likeness to his former self and then vas kor had seen him but twice in all his life  little wonder that he did not know him  during the evening vas kor announced that on the morrow they should depart north toward dusar picking up recruits at various stations along the way  in a great field behind the house a flier laya fairsized cruisertransport that would accommodate many men yet swift and well armed also  here carthoris slept and kar komak too with the other recruits under guard of the regular dusarian warriors that manned the craft  toward midnight vas kor returned to the vessel from his sons house repairing at once to his cabin  carthoris with one of the dusarians was on watch  it was with difficulty that the heliumite repressed a cold smile as the noble passed within a foot of himwithin a foot of the long slim heliumitic blade that swung in his harness  how easy it would have been  how easy to avenge the cowardly trick that had been played upon himto avenge helium and ptarth and thuvia  but his hand moved not toward the daggers hilt for first vas kor must serve a better purposehe might know where thuvia of ptarth lay hidden now if it had truly been dusarians that had spirited her away during the fight before aaanthor  and then too there was the instigator of the entire foul plot he must pay the penalty and who better than vas kor could lead the prince of helium to astok of dusar  faintly out of the night there came to carthoriss ears the purring of a distant motor  he scanned the heavens  yes there it was far in the north dimly outlined against the dark void of space that stretched illimitably beyond it the faint suggestion of a flier passing unlighted through the barsoomian night  carthoris knowing not whether the craft might be friend or foe of dusar gave no sign that he had seen but turned his eyes in another direction leaving the matter to the dusarian who stood watch with him  presently the fellow discovered the oncoming craft and sounded the low alarm which brought the balance of the watch and an officer from their sleeping silks and furs upon the deck near by  the cruisertransport lay without lights and resting as she was upon the ground must have been entirely invisible to the oncoming flier which all presently recognized as a small craft  it soon became evident that the stranger intended making a landing for she was now spiraling slowly above them dropping lower and lower in each graceful curve  it is the thuria whispered one of the dusarian warriors  i would know her in the blackness of the pits among ten thousand other craft  right you are exclaimed vas kor who had come on deck  and then he hailed  kaor thuria  kaor came presently from above after a brief silence  then what ship  cruisertransport kalksus vas kor of dusar  good came from above  is there safe landing alongside  yes close in to starboard  wait we will show our lights and a moment later the smaller craft settled close beside the kalksus and the lights of the latter were immediately extinguished once more  several figures could be seen slipping over the side of the thuria and advancing toward the kalksus  ever suspicious the dusarians stood ready to receive the visitors as friends or foes as closer inspection might prove them  carthoris stood quite near the rail ready to take sides with the newcomers should chance have it that they were heliumites playing a bold stroke of strategy upon this lone dusarian ship  he had led like parties himself and knew that such a contingency was quite possible  but the face of the first man to cross the rail undeceived him with a shock that was not at all unpleasurableit was the face of astok prince of dusar  scarce noticing the others upon the deck of the kalksus astok strode forward to accept vas kors greeting then he summoned the noble below  the warriors and officers returned to their sleeping silks and furs and once more the deck was deserted except for the dusarian warrior and turjun the panthan who stood guard  the latter walked quietly to and fro  the former leaned across the rail wishing for the hour that would bring him relief  he did not see his companion approach the lights of the cabin of vas kor  he did not see him stoop with ear close pressed to a tiny ventilator  may the white apes take us all cried astok ruefully if we are not in as ugly a snarl as you have ever seen  nutus thinks that we have her in hiding far away from dusar  he has bidden me bring her here  he paused  no man should have heard from his lips the thing he was trying to tell  it should have been for ever the secret of nutus and astok for upon it rested the safety of a throne  with that knowledge any man could wrest from the jeddak of dusar whatever he listed  but astok was afraid and he wanted from this older man the suggestion of an alternative  he went on  i am to kill her he whispered looking fearfully around  nutus merely wishes to see the body that he may know his commands have been executed  i am now supposed to be gone to the spot where we have her hidden that i may fetch her in secrecy to dusar  none is to know that she has ever been in the keeping of a dusarian  i do not need to tell you what would befall dusar should ptarth and helium and kaol ever learn the truth  the jaws of the listener at the ventilator clicked together with a vicious snap  before he had but guessed at the identity of the subject of this conversation  now he knew  and they were to kill her  his muscular fingers clenched until the nails bit into the palms  and you wish me to go with you while you fetch her to dusar vas kor was saying  where is she  astok bent close and whispered into the others ear  the suggestion of a smile crossed the cruel features of vas kor  he realized the power that lay within his grasp  he should be a jed at least  and how may i help you my prince asked the older man suavely  i cannot kill her said astok  issus  i cannot do it  when she turns those eyes upon me my heart becomes water  vas kors eyes narrowed  and you wish  he paused the interrogation unfinished yet complete  astok nodded  you do not love her he said  but i love my lifethough i am only a lesser noble he concluded meaningly  you shall be a greater noblea noble of the first rank exclaimed astok  i would be a jed said vas kor bluntly  astok hesitated  a jed must die before there can be another jed he pleaded  jeds have died before snapped vas kor  it would doubtless be not difficult for you to find a jed you do not love astokthere are many who do not love you  already vas kor was commencing to presume upon his power over the young prince  astok was quick to note and appreciate the subtle change in his lieutenant  a cunning scheme entered his weak and wicked brain  as you say vas kor he exclaimed  you shall be a jed when the thing is done and then to himself  nor will it then be difficult for me to find a jed i do not love  when shall we return to dusar asked the noble  at once replied astok  let us get under way nowthere is naught to keep you here  i had intended sailing on the morrow picking up such recruits as the various dwars of the roads might have collected for me as we returned to dusar  let the recruits wait said astok  or better still come you to dusar upon the thuria leaving the kalksus to follow and pick up the recruits  yes acquiesced vas kor that is the better plan  come i am ready and he rose to accompany astok to the latters flier  the listener at the ventilator came to his feet slowly like an old man  his face was drawn and pinched and very white beneath the light copper of his skin  she was to die  and he helpless to avert the tragedy  he did not even know where she was imprisoned  the two men were ascending from the cabin to the deck  turjun the panthan crept close to the companionway his sinuous fingers closing tightly upon the hilt of his dagger  could he despatch them both before he was overpowered  he smiled  he could slay an entire utan of her enemies in his present state of mind  they were almost abreast of him now  astok was speaking  bring a couple of your men along vas kor he said  we are shorthanded upon the thuria so quickly did we depart  the panthans fingers dropped from the daggers hilt  his quick mind had grasped here a chance for succouring thuvia of ptarth he might be chosen as one to accompany the assassins and once he had learned where the captive lay he could dispatch astok and vas kor as well as now  to kill them before he knew where thuvia was hid was simply to leave her to death at the hands of others for sooner or later nutus would learn her whereabouts and nutus jeddak of dusar could not afford to let her live  turjun put himself in the path of vas kor that he might not be overlooked  the noble aroused the men sleeping upon the deck but always before him the strange panthan whom he had recruited that same day found means for keeping himself to the fore  vas kor turned to his lieutenant giving instruction for the bringing of the kalksus to dusar and the gathering up of the recruits then he signed to two warriors who stood close behind the padwar  you two accompany us to the thuria he said and put yourselves at the disposal of her dwar  it was dark upon the deck of the kalksus so vas kor had not a good look at the faces of the two he chose but that was of no moment for they were but common warriors to assist with the ordinary duties upon a flier and to fight if need be  one of the two was kar komak the bowman  the other was not carthoris  the heliumite was mad with disappointment  he snatched his dagger from his harness but already astok had left the deck of the kalksus and he knew that before he could overtake him should he dispatch vas kor he would be killed by the dusarian warriors who now were thick upon the deck  with either one of the two alive thuvia was in as great danger as though both livedit must be both  as vas kor descended to the ground carthoris boldly followed him nor did any attempt to halt him thinking doubtless that he was one of the party  after him came kar komak and the dusarian warrior who had been detailed to duty upon the thuria  carthoris walked close to the left side of the latter  now they came to the dense shadow under the side of the thuria  it was very dark there so that they had to grope for the ladder  kar komak preceded the dusarian  the latter reached upward for the swinging rounds and as he did so steel fingers closed upon his windpipe and a steel blade pierced the very centre of his heart  turjun the panthan was the last to clamber over the rail of the thuria drawing the rope ladder in after him  a moment later the flier was rising rapidly headed for the north  at the rail kar komak turned to speak to the warrior who had been detailed to accompany him  his eyes went wide as they rested upon the face of the young man whom he had met beside the granite cliffs that guard mysterious lothar  how had he come in place of the dusarian  a quick sign and kar komak turned once more to find the thurias dwar that he might report himself for duty  behind him followed the panthan  carthoris blessed the chance that had caused vas kor to choose the bowman of all others for had it been another dusarian there would have been questions to answer as to the whereabouts of the warrior who lay so quietly in the field beyond the residence of hal vas dwar of the southern road and carthoris had no answer to that question other than his sword point which alone was scarce adequate to convince the entire crew of the thuria  the journey to dusar seemed interminable to the impatient carthoris though as a matter of fact it was quickly accomplished  some time before they reached their destination they met and spoke with another dusarian war flier  from it they learned that a great battle was soon to be fought southeast of dusar  the combined navies of dusar ptarth and kaol had been intercepted in their advance toward helium by the mighty heliumitic navythe most formidable upon barsoom not alone in numbers and armament but in the training and courage of its officers and warriors and the zitidaric proportions of many of its monster battleships  not for many a day had there been the promise of such a battle four jeddaks were in direct command of their own fleetskulan tith of kaol thuvan dihn of ptarth and nutus of dusar upon one side while upon the other was tardos mors jeddak of helium  with the latter was john carter warlord of mars  from the far north another force was moving south across the barrier cliffsthe new navy of talu jeddak of okar coming in response to the call from the warlord  upon the decks of the sullen ships of war blackbearded yellow men looked over eagerly toward the south  gorgeous were they in their splendid cloaks of orluk and apt  fierce formidable fighters from the hothouse cities of the frozen north  and from the distant south from the sea of omean and the cliffs of gold from the temples of the therns and the garden of issus other thousands sailed into the north at the call of the great man they all had learned to respect and respecting love  pacing the flagship of this mighty fleet second only to the navy of helium was the ebon xodar jeddak of the first born his heart beating strong in anticipation of the coming moment when he should hurl his savage crews and the weight of his mighty ships upon the enemies of the warlord  but would these allies reach the theatre of war in time to be of avail to helium  or would helium need them  carthoris with the other members of the crew of the thuria heard the gossip and the rumours  none knew of the two fleets the one from the south and the other from the north that were coming to support the ships of helium and all of dusar were convinced that nothing now could save the ancient power of helium from being wiped for ever from the upper air of barsoom  carthoris too loyal son of helium that he was felt that even his beloved navy might not be able to cope successfully with the combined forces of three great powers  now the thuria touched the landingstage above the palace of astok hurriedly the prince and vas kor disembarked and entered the drop that would carry them to the lower levels of the palace  close beside it was another drop that was utilized by common warriors  carthoris touched kar komak upon the arm  come he whispered  you are my only friend among a nation of enemies  will you stand by me  to the death replied kar komak  the two approached the drop  a slave operated it  where are your passes he asked  carthoris fumbled in his pocket pouch as though in search of them at the same time entering the cage  kar komak followed him closing the door  the slave did not start the cage downward  every second counted  they must reach the lower level as soon as possible after astok and vas kor if they would know whither the two went  carthoris turned suddenly upon the slave hurling him to the opposite side of the cage  bind and gag him kar komak he cried  then he grasped the control lever and as the cage shot downward at sickening speed the bowman grappled with the slave  carthoris could not leave the control to assist his companion for should they touch the lowest level at the speed at which they were going all would be dashed to instant death  below him he could now see the top of astoks cage in the parallel shaft and he reduced the speed of his to that of the other  the slave commenced to scream  silence him cried carthoris  a moment later a limp form crumpled to the floor of the cage  he is silenced said kar komak  carthoris brought the cage to a sudden stop at one of the higher levels of the palace  opening the door he grasped the still form of the slave and pushed it out upon the floor  then he banged the gate and resumed the downward drop  once more he sighted the top of the cage that held astok and vas kor  an instant later it had stopped and as he brought his car to a halt he saw the two men disappear through one of the exits of the corridor beyond     chapter xiv  kulan tiths sacrifice   the morning of the second day of her incarceration in the east tower of the palace of astok prince of dusar found thuvia of ptarth waiting in dull apathy the coming of the assassin  she had exhausted every possibility of escape going over and over again the door and the windows the floor and the walls  the solid ersite slabs she could not even scratch the tough barsoomian glass of the windows would have shattered to nothing less than a heavy sledge in the hands of a strong man  the door and the lock were impregnable  there was no escape  and they had stripped her of her weapons so that she could not even anticipate the hour of her doom thus robbing them of the satisfaction of witnessing her last moments  when would they come  would astok do the deed with his own hands she doubted that he had the courage for it  at heart he was a cowardshe had known it since first she had heard him brag as a visitor at the court of her father he had sought to impress her with his valour  she could not help but compare him with another  and with whom would an affianced bride compare an unsuccessful suitor  with her betrothed  and did thuvia of ptarth now measure astok of dusar by the standards of kulan tith jeddak of kaol  she was about to die her thoughts were her own to do with as she pleased yet furthest from them was kulan tith  instead the figure of the tall and comely heliumite filled her mind crowding therefrom all other images  she dreamed of his noble face the quiet dignity of his bearing the smile that lit his eyes as he conversed with his friends and the smile that touched his lips as he fought with his enemiesthe fighting smile of his virginian sire  and thuvia of ptarth true daughter of barsoom found her breath quickening and heart leaping to the memory of this other smilethe smile that she would never see again  with a little halfsob the girl sank to the pile of silks and furs that were tumbled in confusion beneath the east windows burying her face in her arms  in the corridor outside her prisonroom two men had paused in heated argument  i tell you again astok one was saying that i shall not do this thing unless you be present in the room  there was little of the respect due royalty in the tone of the speakers voice  the other noting it flushed  do not impose too far upon my friendship for you vas kor he snapped  there is a limit to my patience  there is no question of royal prerogative here returned vas kor  you ask me to become an assassin in your stead and against your jeddaks strict injunctions  you are in no position astok to dictate to me but rather should you be glad to accede to my reasonable request that you be present thus sharing the guilt with me  why should i bear it all  the younger man scowled but he advanced toward the locked door and as it swung in upon its hinges he entered the room beyond at the side of vas kor  across the chamber the girl hearing them enter rose to her feet and faced them  under the soft copper of her skin she blanched just a trifle but her eyes were brave and level and the haughty tilt of her firm little chin was eloquent of loathing and contempt  you still prefer death asked astok  to you yes replied the girl coldly  the prince of dusar turned to vas kor and nodded  the noble drew his shortsword and crossed the room toward thuvia  kneel he commanded  i prefer to die standing she replied  as you will said vas kor feeling the point of his blade with his left thumb  in the name of nutus jeddak of dusar he cried and ran quickly toward her  in the name of carthoris prince of helium came in low tones from the doorway  vas kor turned to see the panthan he had recruited at his sons house leaping across the floor toward him the fellow brushed past astok with an  after him youcalot  vas kor wheeled to meet the charging man  what means this treason he cried  astok with bared sword leaped to vas kors assistance  the panthans sword clashed against that of the noble and in the first encounter vas kor knew that he faced a master swordsman  before he half realized the strangers purpose he found the man between himself and thuvia of ptarth at bay facing the two swords of the dusarians  but he fought not like a man at bay  ever was he the aggressor and though always he kept his flashing blade between the girl and her enemies yet he managed to force them hither and thither about the room calling to the girl to follow close behind him  until it was too late neither vas kor nor astok dreamed of that which lay in the panthans mind but at last as the fellow stood with his back toward the door both understoodthey were penned in their own prison and now the intruder could slay them at his will for thuvia of ptarth was bolting the door at the mans direction first taking the key from the opposite side where astok had left it when they had entered  astok as was his way finding that the enemy did not fall immediately before their swords was leaving the brunt of the fighting to vas kor and now as his eyes appraised the panthan carefully they presently went wider and wider for slowly he had come to recognize the features of the prince of helium  the heliumite was pressing close upon vas kor  the noble was bleeding from a dozen wounds  astok saw that he could not for long withstand the cunning craft of that terrible sword hand  courage vas kor he whispered in the others ear  i have a plan  hold him but a moment longer and all will be well but the balance of the sentence with astok prince of dusar he did not voice aloud  vas kor dreaming no treachery nodded his head and for a moment succeeded in holding carthoris at bay  then the heliumite and the girl saw the dusarian prince run swiftly to the opposite side of the chamber touch something in the wall that sent a great panel swinging inward and disappear into the black vault beyond  it was done so quickly that by no possibility could they have intercepted him  carthoris fearful lest vas kor might similarly elude him or astok return immediately with reinforcements sprang viciously in upon his antagonist and a moment later the headless body of the dusarian noble rolled upon the ersite floor  come cried carthoris  there is no time to be lost  astok will be back in a moment with enough warriors to overpower me  but astok had no such plan in mind for such a move would have meant the spreading of the fact among the palace gossips that the ptarthian princess was a prisoner in the east tower  quickly would the word have come to his father and no amount of falsifying could have explained away the facts that the jeddaks investigation would have brought to light  instead astok was racing madly through a long corridor to reach the door of the towerroom before carthoris and thuvia left the apartment  he had seen the girl remove the key and place it in her pocketpouch and he knew that a dagger point driven into the keyhole from the opposite side would imprison them in the secret chamber till eight dead worlds circled a cold dead sun  as fast as he could run astok entered the main corridor that led to the tower chamber  would he reach the door in time  what if the heliumite should have already emerged and he should run upon him in the passageway  astok felt a cold chill run up his spine he had no stomach to face that uncanny blade  he was almost at the door  around the next turn of the corridor it stood  no they had not left the apartment  evidently vas kor was still holding the heliumite  astok could scarce repress a grin at the clever manner in which he had outwitted the noble and disposed of him at the same time  and then he rounded the turn and came face to face with an auburnhaired white giant  the fellow did not wait to ask the reason for his coming instead he leaped upon him with a longsword so that astok had to parry a dozen vicious cuts before he could disengage himself and flee back down the runway  a moment later carthoris and thuvia entered the corridor from the secret chamber  well kar komak asked the heliumite  it is fortunate that you left me here red man said the bowman i but just now intercepted one who seemed overanxious to reach this doorit was he whom they call astok prince of dusar  carthoris smiled  where is he now he asked  he escaped my blade and ran down this corridor replied kar komak  we must lose no time then exclaimed carthoris  he will have the guard upon us yet  together the three hastened along the winding passages through which carthoris and kar komak had tracked the dusarians by the marks of the latters sandals in the thin dust that overspread the floors of these seldomused passageways  they had come to the chamber at the entrances to the lifts before they met with opposition  here they found a handful of guardsmen and an officer who seeing that they were strangers questioned their presence in the palace of astok  once more carthoris and kar komak had recourse to their blades and before they had won their way to one of the lifts the noise of the conflict must have aroused the entire palace for they heard men shouting and as they passed the many levels on their quick passage to the landingstage they saw armed men running hither and thither in search of the cause of the commotion  beside the stage lay the thuria with three warriors on guard again the heliumite and the lotharian fought shoulder to shoulder but the battle was soon over for the prince of helium alone would have been a match for any three that dusar could produce  scarce had the thuria risen from the ways ere a hundred or more fighting men leaped to view upon the landingstage  at their head was astok of dusar and as he saw the two he had thought so safely in his power slipping from his grasp he danced with rage and chagrin shaking his fists and hurling abuse and vile insults at them  with her bow inclined upward at a dizzy angle the thuria shot meteorlike into the sky  from a dozen points swift patrol boats darted after her for the scene upon the landingstage above the palace of the prince of dusar had not gone unnoticed  a dozen times shots grazed the thurias side and as carthoris could not leave the control levers thuvia of ptarth turned the muzzles of the crafts rapidfire guns upon the enemy as she clung to the steep and slippery surface of the deck  it was a noble race and a noble fight  one against a score now for other dusarian craft had joined in the pursuit but astok prince of dusar had built well when he built the thuria  none in the navy of his sire possessed a swifter flier no other craft so well armoured or so well armed  one by one the pursuers were distanced and as the last of them fell out of range behind carthoris dropped the thurias nose to a horizontal plane as with lever drawn to the last notch she tore through the thin air of dying mars toward the east and ptarth  thirteen and a half thousand haads away lay ptartha stiff thirtyhour journey for the swiftest of fliers and between dusar and ptarth might lie half the navy of dusar for in this direction was the reported seat of the great naval battle that even now might be in progress  could carthoris have known precisely where the great fleets of the contending nations lay he would have hastened to them without delay for in the return of thuvia to her sire lay the greatest hope of peace  half the distance they covered without sighting a single warship and then kar komak called carthoriss attention to a distant craft that rested upon the ochre vegetation of the great dead seabottom above which the thuria was speeding  about the vessel many figures could be seen swarming  with the aid of powerful glasses the heliumite saw that they were green warriors and that they were repeatedly charging down upon the crew of the stranded airship  the nationality of the latter he could not make out at so great a distance  it was not necessary to change the course of the thuria to permit of passing directly above the scene of battle but carthoris dropped his craft a few hundred feet that he might have a better and closer view  if the ship was of a friendly power he could do no less than stop and direct his guns upon her enemies though with the precious freight he carried he scarcely felt justified in landing for he could offer but two swords in reinforcementscarce enough to warrant jeopardizing the safety of the princess of ptarth  as they came close above the stricken ship they could see that it would be but a question of minutes before the green horde would swarm across the armoured bulwarks to glut the ferocity of their bloodlust upon the defenders  it would be futile to descend said carthoris to thuvia  the craft may even be of dusarshe shows no insignia  all that we may do is fire upon the hordesmen and as he spoke he stepped to one of the guns and deflected its muzzle toward the green warriors at the ships side  at the first shot from the thuria those upon the vessel below evidently discovered her for the first time  immediately a device fluttered from the bow of the warship on the ground  thuvia of ptarth caught her breath quickly glancing at carthoris  the device was that of kulan tith jeddak of kaolthe man to whom the princess of ptarth was betrothed  how easy for the heliumite to pass on leaving his rival to the fate that could not for long be averted  no man could accuse him of cowardice or treachery for kulan tith was in arms against helium and further upon the thuria were not enough swords to delay even temporarily the outcome that already was a foregone conclusion in the minds of the watchers  what would carthoris prince of helium do  scarce had the device broken to the faint breeze ere the bow of the thuria dropped at a sharp angle toward the ground  can you navigate her asked carthoris of thuvia  the girl nodded  i am going to try to take the survivors aboard he continued it will need both kar komak and myself to man the guns while the kaolians take to the boarding tackle  keep her bow depressed against the rifle fire  she can bear it better in her forward armour and at the same time the propellers will be protected  he hurried to the cabin as thuvia took the control  a moment later the boarding tackle dropped from the keel of the thuria and from a dozen points along either side stout knotted leathern lines trailed downward  at the same time a signal broke from her bow  prepare to board us  a shout arose from the deck of the kaolian warship  carthoris who by this time had returned from the cabin smiled sadly  he was about to snatch from the jaws of death the man who stood between himself and the woman he loved  take the port bow gun kar komak he called to the bowman and himself stepped to the gun upon the starboard bow  they could now feel the sharp shock of the green warriors projectiles at the sides of the staunch thuria this paragraph  needs to be verified from early editions  it was a forlorn hope at best  at any moment the repulsive ray tanks might be pierced  the men upon the kaolian ship were battling with renewed hope  in the bow stood kulan tith a brave figure fighting beside his brave warriors beating back the ferocious green men  the thuria came low above the other craft  the kaolians were forming under their officers in readiness to board and then a sudden fierce fusillade from the rifles of the green warriors vomited their hail of death and destruction into the side of the brave flier  like a wounded bird she dived suddenly marsward careening drunkenly thuvia turned the bow upward in an effort to avert the imminent tragedy but she succeeded only in lessening the shock of the fliers impact as she struck the ground beside the kaolian ship  when the green men saw only two warriors and a woman upon the deck of the thuria a savage shout of triumph arose from their ranks while an answering groan broke from the lips of the kaolians  the former now turned their attention upon the new arrival for they saw her defenders could soon be overcome and that from her deck they could command the deck of the bettermanned ship  as they charged a shout of warning came from kulan tith upon the bridge of his own ship and with it an appreciation of the valour of the act that had put the smaller vessel in these sore straits  who is it he cried that offers his life in the service of kulan tith  never was wrought a nobler deed of selfsacrifice upon barsoom  the green horde was scrambling over the thurias side as there broke from the bow the device of carthoris prince of helium in reply to the query of the jeddak of kaol  none upon the smaller flier had opportunity to note the effect of this announcement upon the kaolians for their attention was claimed slowly now by that which was transpiring upon their own deck  kar komak stood behind the gun he had been operating staring with wide eyes at the onrushing hideous green warriors  carthoris seeing him thus felt a pang of regret that after all this man that he had thought so valorous should prove in the hour of need as spineless as jav or tario  kar komakthe man he shouted  grip yourself  remember the days of the glory of the seafarers of lothar  fight  fight man fight as never man fought before  all that remains to us is to die fighting  kar komak turned toward the heliumite a grim smile upon his lips  why should we fight he asked  against such fearful odds there is another waya better way  look  he pointed toward the companionway that led below deck  the green men a handful of them had already reached the thurias deck as carthoris glanced in the direction the lotharian had indicated  the sight that met his eyes set his heart to thumping in joy and reliefthuvia of ptarth might yet be saved  for from below there poured a stream of giant bowmen grim and terrible not the bowmen of tario or jav but the bowmen of an odwar of bowmensavage fighting men eager for the fray  the green warriors paused in momentary surprise and consternation but only for a moment  then with horrid warcries they leaped forward to meet these strange new foemen  a volley of arrows stopped them in their tracks  in a moment the only green warriors upon the deck of the thuria were dead warriors and the bowmen of kar komak were leaping over the vessels sides to charge the hordesmen upon the ground  utan after utan tumbled from the bowels of the thuria to launch themselves upon the unfortunate green men  kulan tith and his kaolians stood wideeyed and speechless with amazement as they saw thousands of these strange fierce warriors emerge from the companionway of the small craft that could not comfortably have accommodated more than fifty  at last the green men could withstand the onslaught of overwhelming numbers no longer  slowly at first they fell back across the ochre plain  the bowmen pursued them  kar komak standing upon the deck of the thuria trembled with excitement  at the top of his lungs he voiced the savage warcry of his forgotten day  he roared encouragement and commands at his battling utans and then as they charged further and further from the thuria he could no longer withstand the lure of battle  leaping over the ships side to the ground he joined the last of his bowmen as they raced off over the dead seabottom in pursuit of the fleeing green horde  beyond a low promontory of what once had been an island the green men were disappearing toward the west  close upon their heels raced the fleet bowmen of a bygone day and forging steadily ahead among them carthoris and thuvia could see the mighty figure of kar komak brandishing aloft the torquasian shortsword with which he was armed as he urged his creatures after the retreating enemy  as the last of them disappeared behind the promontory carthoris turned toward thuvia of ptarth  they have taught me a lesson these vanishing bowmen of lothar he said  when they have served their purpose they remain not to embarrass their masters by their presence  kulan tith and his warriors are here to protect you  my acts have constituted the proof of my honesty of purpose  goodbye and he knelt at her feet raising a bit of her harness to his lips  the girl reached out a hand and laid it upon the thick black hair of the head bent before her  softly she asked  where are you going carthoris  with kar komak the bowman he replied  there will be fighting and forgetfulness  the girl put her hands before her eyes as though to shut out some mighty temptation from her sight  may my ancestors have mercy upon me she cried if i say the thing i have no right to say but i cannot see you cast your life away carthoris prince of helium  stay my chieftain  stayi love you  a cough behind them brought both about and there they saw standing not two paces from them kulan tith jeddak of kaol  for a long moment none spoke  then kulan tith cleared his throat  i could not help hearing all that passed he said  i am no fool to be blind to the love that lies between you  nor am i blind to the lofty honour that has caused you carthoris to risk your life and hers to save mine though you thought that that very act would rob you of the chance to keep her for your own  nor can i fail to appreciate the virtue that has kept your lips sealed against words of love for this heliumite thuvia for i know that i have but just heard the first declaration of your passion for him  i do not condemn you  rather should i have condemned you had you entered a loveless marriage with me  take back your liberty thuvia of ptarth he cried and bestow it where your heart already lies enchained and when the golden collars are clasped about your necks you will see
