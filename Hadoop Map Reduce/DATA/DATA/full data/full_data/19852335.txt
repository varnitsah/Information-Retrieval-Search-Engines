chapter i  caught by the camera   this is getting to be an amazing old world said a young girl still in her teens as she musingly leaned her chin on her hand  it has always been an amazing old world beth said another girl who was sitting on the porch railing and swinging her feet in the air  true patsy was the reply but the people are doing such peculiar things nowadays  yes yes exclaimed a little man who occupied a reclining chair within hearing distance that is the way with you young folksalways confounding the world with its people  dont the people make the world uncle john asked patricia doyle looking at him quizzically  no indeed the world could get along very well without its people but the people  to be sure they need the world laughed patsy her blue eyes twinkling so that they glorified her plain freckled face  nevertheless said beth de graf soberly i think the people have struck a rapid pace these days and are growing bold and impudent the law appears to allow them too much liberty after our experience of this morning i shall not be surprised at anything that happensespecially in this cranky state of california  to what experience do you allude beth asked uncle john sitting up straight and glancing from one to another of his two nieces he was a genial looking roundfaced man quite bald and inclined to be a trifle stout yet his fiftyodd years sat lightly upon him  why we had quite an adventure this morning said patsy laughing again at the recollection and answering her uncle because beth hesitated to for my part i think it was fun and harmless fun at that but beth was scared out of a years growth i admit feeling a little creepy at the time myself but it was all a joke and really we ought not to mind it at all  tell me all about it my dear said mr merrick earnestly for whatever affected his beloved nieces was of prime importance to him  we were taking our morning stroll along the streets began patsy when on turning a corner we came upon a crowd of people who seemed to be greatly excited most of them were workmen in flannel shirts their sleeves rolled up their hands grimy with toil these stood before a brick building that seemed like a factory while from its doors other crowds of workmen and some shopgirls were rushing into the street and several policemen were shaking their clubs and running here and there in a sort of panic at first beth and i stopped and hesitated to go on but as the sidewalk seemed open and fairly free i pulled beth along thinking we might discover what the row was about just as we got opposite the building a big workman rushed at us and shouted go backgo back the wall is falling  well uncle you can imagine our dismay we both screamed for we thought our time had come for sure my legs were so weak that beth had to drag me away and her face was white as a sheet and full of terror somehow we managed to stagger into the street where a dozen men caught us and hurried us away i hardly thought we were in a safe place when the big workman cried there young ladies that will do your expression was simply immense and if this doesnt turn out to be the best film of the year ill miss my guess your terrorstricken features will make a regular hit for the terror wasnt assumed you know thank you very much for happening along just then  patsy stopped her recital to laugh once more with genuine merriment but her cousin beth seemed annoyed and uncle john was frankly bewildered  butwhatwhatwas it all about he inquired  why they were taking a moving picture that was all and the workmen and shopgirls and policemen were all actors there must have been a hundred of them all told and when we recovered from our scare i could hear the machine beside me clicking away as it took the picture  did the wall fall asked uncle john  not just then they first got the picture of the rushout and the panic and then they stopped the camera and moved the people to a safe distance away we watched them set up some dummy figures of girls and workmen closer in and then in some way they toppled over the big brick wall it fell into the street with a thundering crash but only the dummies were buried under the debris  mr merrick drew a long breath  its wonderful he exclaimed why it must have cost a lot of money to ruin such a buildingand all for the sake of a picture  thats what i said to the manager replied patsy but he told us the building was going to be pulled down anyhow and a better one built in its place so he invented a picture story to fit the falling walls and it didnt cost him so much as one might think so you see uncle we are in that picturebig as life and scared stiffand id give a lot to see how we look when were positively terrorstricken  it will cost you just ten cents remarked beth with a shrug that is if the picture proves good enough to be displayed at one of those horrid little theatres  one said uncle john one thousand little theatres most likely will show the picture and perhaps millions of spectators will see you and patsy running from the falling wall  dear me wailed patsy thats more fame than i bargained for do millions go to see motion pictures uncle  i believe so the making of these pictures is getting to be an enormous industry i was introduced to otis werner the other day and he told me a good deal about it werner is with one of the big concerns herethe continental i thinkand hes a very nice and gentlemanly fellow ill introduce you to him some time and hell tell you all the wonders of the motion picture business  i havent witnessed one of those atrocious exhibitions for months announced beth nor have i any desire to see one again  not our own special picture asked patsy reproachfully  they had no right to force us into their dreadful drama protested beth motion pictures are dreadfully tiresome thingscomedies and tragedies alike they are wild and weird in conception quite unreal and wholly impossible of course the scenic pictures and those recording historical events are well enough in their way but i cannot understand how so many cheap little picture theatres thrive  they are the poor peoples solace and recreation declared mr merrick the picture theatre has become the laboring mans favorite resort it costs him but five or ten cents and its the sort of show he can appreciate im told the motion picture is considered the saloons worst enemy for many a man is taking his wife and children to a picture theatre evenings instead of joining a gang of his fellows before the bar as he formerly did  that is the best argument in their favor i have ever heard admitted beth who was strong on temperance but i hope uncle you are not defending the insolent methods of those picturemakers  not at all my dear i consider the trapping of innocent bystanders to beeherhighly reprehensible and perhaps worse if i can discover what picture manager was guilty of the act i shallshall  what uncle  i shall hint that he owes you an apology he concluded rather lamely  beth smiled scornfully  meantime said she two very respectable girls who are not actresses will be exhibited before the critical eyes of millions of stupid workmen reformed drunkards sadfaced women and wiggling childrennot in dignified attitudes mind you but scurrying from what they supposed was an imminent danger  i hope it will do the poor things good to see us retorted patsy to be strictly honest beth we were not trapped at all we were the victims of circumstances when i remember how quickwitted and alert that manager was to catch us unawares and so add to the value of his picture i can quite forgive the fellow his audacity  it wasnt audacity so much as downright impudence persisted beth  i quite agree with you said mr merrick do you wish me to buy that film and prevent the pictures being shown  oh no cried patsy in protest im dying to see how we look i wouldnt have that picture sidetracked for anything  and you beth  really uncle john the thing is not worth worrying over replied his niece i am naturally indignant at being drawn into such a thing against my will but i doubt if anyone who knows us or whose opinion we value will ever visit a moving picture theatre or see this film the common people will not recognize us of course  you must not think beth de graf was snobbish or aristocratic because of this speech which her cousin patsy promptly denounced as snippy beth was really a lovable and sunnytempered girl very democratic in her tastes in spite of the fact that she was the possessor of an unusual fortune she was out of sorts today resentful of the fright she had endured that morning and in the mood to say harsh things  even patricia doyle had been indignant at first but patsys judgment was clearer than her cousins and her nature more responsive she quickly saw the humorous side of their adventure and could enjoy the recollection of her momentary fear  these two girls were spending the winter months in the glorious climate of southern california chaperoned by their uncle and guardian john merrick they had recently established themselves at a cosy hotel in hollywood which is a typical california village yet a suburb of the great city of los angeles a third niece older and now marriedlouise merrick weldonlived on a ranch between los angeles and san diego which was one reason why uncle john and his wards had located in this pleasant neighborhood  to observe this triothe simple complacent little man and his two young niecesno stranger would suspect them to be other than ordinary tourists bent on escaping the severe eastern winter but in new york the name of john merrick was spoken with awe in financial circles where his many millions made him an important figure he had practically retired from active business and his large investments were managed by his brotherinlaw major gregory doyle who was miss patsys father and sole surviving parent all of mr merricks present interest in life centered in his three nieces and because louise was happily married and had now an establishment of her ownincluding a rather new but very remarkable babyuncle john was drawn closer to the two younger nieces and devoted himself wholly to their welfare  the girls had not been rich when their fairy godfather first found them indeed each of them had been energetically earning or preparing to earn a livelihood now when their uncles generosity had made them wealthy they almost regretted those former busy days of poverty being obliged to discover new interests in life in order to keep themselves occupied and contented all three were openhanded and openhearted sympathetic to the unfortunate and eager to assist those who needed money as many a poor girl and worthy young fellow could testify in all their charities they were strongly supported by mr merrick whose enormous income permitted him to indulge in many benevolences none gave ostentatiously for they were simple kindly folk who gave for the pure joy of giving and begrudged all knowledge of their acts to anyone outside their own little circle  there is no doubt that john merrick was eccentric it is generally conceded that a rich man may indulge in eccentricities provided he maintains a useful position in society and mr merricks peculiarities only served to render him the more interesting to those who knew him best he did astonishing things in a most matteroffact way and acted more on impulse than on calm reflection so it is not to be wondered at that the queer little mans nieces had imbibed some of his queerness being by nature lively and aggressive young women whose eager interest in life would not permit them to be idle they encountered many interesting experiences  they had just come from a long visit to louise at the ranch and after conferring gravely together had decided to hide themselves in hollywood where they might spend a quiet and happy winter in wandering over the hills in boating or bathing in the ocean or motoring over the hundreds of miles of splendid boulevards of this section  singularly enough their choice of a retreat was also the choice of a score or more of motion picture makers who had discovered hollywood before them and were utilizing the brilliant sunshine and clear atmosphere in the production of their films which were supplied to picture theatres throughout the united states and europe appreciating the value of such a monster industry the authorities permitted the cameras to be set up on the public streets or wherever there was an appropriate scene to serve for a background to the photoplays it was no unusual sight to see troops of cowboys and indians racing through the pretty village or to find the cameraman busy before the imposing residence of a millionaire or the vinecovered bungalow of a more modest citizen no one seemed to resent such action for californians admire the motion picture as enthusiastically as do the inhabitants of the eastern states so the girls adventure was really a common incident     chapter ii  an object lesson   it was the following afternoon when uncle john captured his casual acquaintance mr otis werner in the office of the hotel and dragged the motion picture man away to his rooms to be introduced to his nieces  here my dears is mr werner he began as he threw open the door of their apartment and escorted his companion in he is one of those picture makers youll remember andand  he paused abruptly for beth was staring at mr werner with a frown on her usually placid features while patsy was giggling hysterically mr werner a twinkle of amusement in his eye bowed with exaggerated deference  dear me said uncle john isis anything wrong  no its all right uncle declared patsy striving to control a fresh convulsion of laughter onlythis is the same dreadful manager who dragged us into his picture yesterday  i beg your pardon said mr werner im not a manager im merely what is called in our profession a producer or a stage director  well youre the man anyhow asserted patsy so what have you to say for yourself sir  if you were annoyed i humbly apologize he returned perhaps i was unintentionally rude to frighten you in that way but my excuse lies in our subservience to the demands of our art we seldom hesitate at anything which tends to give our pictures the semblance of reality  art did you say mr werner it was beth who asked this and there was a bit of a sneer in her tone  it is really artart of the highest character he replied warmly do you question it missmiss  miss de graf i suppose to be fair i must admit that the photography is art but the subjects of your pictures i have observed are far from artistic such a picture for instance as you made yesterday can have little value to anyone  little value why miss de graf you astonish me he exclaimed i consider that picture of the falling wall one of my greatest triumphsand ive been making pictures for years aside from its realism its emotional naturethrills we call itthis picture conveys a vivid lesson that ought to prove of great benefit to humanity  beth was looking at him curiously now patsy was serious and very attentive as uncle john asked his visitor to be seated his voice betrayed the interest he felt in the conversation  of course we saw only a bit of the picture said patsy doyle what was it all about mr werner  we try said he slowly and impressively as if in love with his theme to give to our pictures an educational value as well as to render them entertaining some of them contain a high moral lesson others a warning many an incentive to live purer and nobler lives all of our plots are conceived with far more thought than you may suppose underlying many of our romances and tragedies are moral injunctions which are involuntarily absorbed by the observers yet of so subtle a nature that they are not suspected we cannot preach except by suggestion for people go to our picture shows to be amused if we hurled righteousness at them they would soon desert us and we would be obliged to close up shop  i must confess that this is to me a most novel presentation of the subject said beth more graciously personally i care little for your pictures but i can understand how travel scenes and scientific or educational subjects might be of real benefit to the people  i cant understand anyones being indifferent to the charm of motion pictures he responded somewhat reproachfully  why at first they struck me as wonderful said the girl they were such a novel invention that i went to see them from pure curiosity but afterward the subjects presented in the pictures bored me the drama pictures were cheap and common the comedy scenes worse so i kept away from the picture theatres  educational pictures said mr werner musingly have proved a failure as i hinted except when liberally interspersed with scenes of action and human interest the only financial failures among the host of motion picture theatres so far as i have observed are those that have attempted to run travel scenes and educational films exclusively there are so few people with yourehculture andandelevated tastes you see when compared with the masses  but tell us about our picture pleaded patsy what lesson can that falling wall possibly convey  ill be glad to explain that he eagerly replied for i am quite proud of it i assure you there are many buildings throughout our larger cities that were erected as cheaply as possible and without a single thought for the safety of their tenants so many disasters have resulted from this that of late years building inspectors have been appointed in every locality to insist on proper materials and mechanical efficiency in the erection of all classes of buildings these inspectors however cannot tear the old buildings down to see if they are safe and paint and plaster cover a multitude of sins of unscrupulous builders usually the landlord or owner knows well the condition of his property and in many cases refuses to put it into such shape as to insure the safety of his tenants greed false economy and heartless indifference to the welfare of others are unfortunately too prevalent among the wealthy class no ordinary argument could induce owners to expend money in strengthening or rebuilding their incomeproducing properties but i get after them in my picture with a prod that ought to rouse them to action  the picture opens with a scene in the interior of a factory men girls and boys are employed the foreman observes a warning crack in the wall and calls the proprietors attention to it in this case the manufacturer is the owner of the building but he refuses to make repairs his argument is that the wall has stood for many years and so is likely to stand for many more it would be a waste of money to repair the old shell next day the foreman shows him that the crack has spread and extended along the wall in an alarming manner but still the owner will not act the workmen counsel together seriously they dare not desert their jobs for they must have money to live they send a petition to the owner who becomes angry and swears he wont be driven to a useless expense by his own employees in the next scene the manufacturers daughterhis only childhaving heard that the building was unsafe comes to her fathers office to plead with him to change his mind and make the needed repairs although he loves this daughter next to his money he resents her interference in a business matter and refuses her words however impress him so strongly that he calls her back from the door to kiss her and say that he will give the matter further thought for her sake  as she leaves the office there is a cry of terror from the factory and the working people come rushing out of the now tottering building that was when you two young ladies came walking up the street and were dragged out of danger by the foreman of the shopin other words by myself the owners daughter bewildered by the confusion hesitates what to do or which way to turn and as she stands upon the sidewalk she is crushed by the falling wall together with several of her fathers employees  how dreadful exclaimed patsy  of course no one was actually hurt he hastened to say for we used dummy figures for the wall to fall upon in the final scene the bereaved father suddenly realizes that he has been working and accumulating only for this beloved childthe child whose life he has sacrificed by his miserly refusal to protect his workmen his grief is so intense that no one who follows the story of this picture will ever hesitate to repair a building promptly if he learns it is unsafe do you now understand the lesson taught young ladies  mr werners dramatic recital had strongly impressed the two girls while uncle john was visibly affected  im very glad said the little man fervently that none of my money is in factories or other buildings that might prove unsafe it would make my life miserable if i thought i was in any way responsible for such a catastrophe as you have pictured  it seems to me observed patsy that your story is unnecessarily cruel mr werner  then you do not understand human nature he retorted or at least that phase of human nature i have aimed at those indifferent rich men are very hard to move and you must figuratively hit them squarely between the eyes to make them even wink  they were silent for a time considering this novel aspect of the picture business then beth asked  can you tell us sir when and where we shall be able to see this picture  it will be released next monday  what does that mean  it means that we as manufacturers supply certain agencies in all the large cities who in turn rent our films to the many picture theatres when a picture is ready we send copies to all our agencies and set a day when they may release it or give it to their customers to use in this way the picture will be shown in all parts of the united states on the same dayin this case next monday  isnt that very quick  yes the picture we took yesterday will tonight be shipped all complete and ready to run to fortyfour different centers  and will any picture theatre in hollywood or los angeles show it  certainly it will be at the globe theatre in los angeles and at the isis theatre in hollywood for the entire week  we shall certainly see it announced uncle john  when mr werner had gone they conversed for some time on the subject of motion pictures and the mans remarkable statement concerning them  i had no idea beth confessed that the industry of making pictures is so extensive and involves so much thought and detail  and money added uncle john it must be a great expense just to employ that army of actors  i suppose mr werner being a theatrical man has drawn the long bow in his effort to impress us said patsy ive been thinking over some of the pictures ive seen recently and i cant imagine a moral however intangible or illusive in connection with any of them but perhaps i wasnt observant enough the next time i go to a picture show i shall study the plays more carefully     chapter iii  an attractive girl   on saturday they were treated to a genuine surprise for when the omnibus drew up before the hotel entrance it brought arthur weldon and his girlwife louise who was uncle johns eldest niece it also brought the cherub a wee dimpled baby hugged closely in the arms of inez its mexican nurse  patsy and beth shrieked in ecstasy as they rushed forward to smother toodlums as they irreverently called the cherub with kisses inez a handsome darkeyed girl relinquished her burden cheerfully to the two adoring aunties while uncle john kissed louise and warmly shook the hand of her youthful husband  what in the world induced you to abandon your beloved ranch inquired mr merrick  dont ask me sir replied arthur laughing at the elder gentlemans astonishment he was a trim young fellow with a cleancut manly face and frank winning manners  its sort of between hay and grass with us you know he explained walnuts all marketed and oranges not ready for the pickers all our neighbors have migrated this way or that for their regular winter vacations and after you all left louise and i began to feel lonely so at breakfast this morning we decided to flit at ten oclock we caught the express and here we arein time for lunch i hope its ready uncle john  it was but they must get their rooms and settle the baby in her new quarters before venturing to enter the dining room so they were late for the midday meal and found themselves almost the only guests in the great dining hall  as they sat at table chatting merrily together arthur asked  what are you staring at patsy  a lovely girl said she one of the loveliest girls i have ever seen dont look around arthur it might attract their attention  how many girls are there  two and a lady who seems to be their mother the other girl is pretty too but much younger than her sisteror friend for they do not resemble one another much they came in a few minutes ago and are seated at the table in the opposite corner  new arrivals i suppose remarked uncle john who from his position could observe the group  no said patsy their waitress seems to know them well but ive never before seen them in the hotel  we are always early at meal time explained beth and today these people are certainly late but they are pretty girls patsy for once i concur in your judgment  you arouse my curiosity said arthur speaking quietly so as not to be overheard in the far corner if i hear more ecstatic praises of these girls i shall turn around and stare them out of countenance  dont said louise im glad your back is toward them arthur for it preserves you from the temptation to flirt  oh as for that i do not need to turn around in order to see pretty girls he replied  thank you arthur said patsy making a face at him look me over all you like and flirt if you want to im sure louise wont object  really patsy youre not bad to look at he retorted eyeing her critically aside from your red hair the pug nose and the freckles you have many excellent qualities if you didnt squint  squint  what do you call that affection of your eyes  that she said calmly eating her dessert was a glance of scornburning bitter scorn  i maintain it was a squint declared arthur  that isnt her only expression announced uncle john who loved these little exchanges of goodhumored banter on monday i will show you patsy as a terrorstricken damsel in distress  also beth still more distressful added patsy and then they told louise and arthur about the picture  fine he cried im deeply gratified that my own relatives  by marriage  i am gratified that my secondhand cousins have been so highly honored id rather see a good moving picture than the best play ever produced  youll see a good one this time asserted patsy for we are the stars  i think that unscrupulous mr werner deserves a reprimand said louise  oh he apologized explained beth but im sure hed take the same liberty again if he had the chance  he admits that his love of art destroys his sense of propriety said patsy  as they rose from the table arthur deliberately turned to view the party in the other corner and then to the amazement of his friends he coolly walked over and shook the elder ladys hand with evident pleasure next moment he was being introduced to the two girls the three cousins and their uncle john walked out of the dining hall and awaited arthur weldon in the lobby  it is some old acquaintance of course said louise arthur knows a tremendous lot of people and remembers everyone he ever has met  when he rejoined them he brought the lady and the two beautiful girls with him introducing mrs montrose as one of his former acquaintances in new york where she had been a near neighbor to the weldons the girls who proved to be her nieces instead of her daughters were named maud and florence stanton maud being about eighteen years of age and florence perhaps fifteen mauds beauty was striking as proved by patsys admiration at first sight florence was smaller and darker yet very dainty and witching like a dresden shepherdess  the sisters proved rather shy at this first meeting being content to exchange smiles with the other girls but their aunt was an easy conversationalist and rambled on about the delights of hollywood and southern california until they were all in a friendly mood among other things mrs montrose volunteered the statement that they had been at the hotel for several weeks but aside from that remark disclosed little of their personal affairs presently the three left the hotel and drove away in an automobile having expressed a wish to meet their new friends again and become better acquainted with them  i was almost startled at running across mrs montrose out here said arthur after fathers death when i gave up the old home i lost track of the montroses but i seem to remember that old montrose went to the happy hunting grounds and left a widow but no children i imagine these people are wealthy as montrose was considered a successful banker ill write to duggins and inquire about them  duggins seems to know everything remarked louise  he keeps pretty good track of new york people especially of the old families replied her husband  i cant see what their history matters to us observed patsy i like to take folks as i find them without regard to their antecedents or finances certainly those stanton girls are wonderfully attractive and ladylike  but now the baby claimed their attention and the rest of that day was passed in visiting and cuddling the wee toodlums who seemed to know her girl aunties and greeted them with friendly coos and dimpled smiles  on sunday they took a motor trip through the mountain boulevards and on their way home passed the extensive enclosure of the continental film company a thriving village has been built up at this place known as film city for many of those employed by the firm prefer to live close to their work another large plant of the same concern is located in the heart of hollywood  as they passed through film city uncle john remarked  we are invited to visit this place and witness the making of a motion picture i believe it would prove an interesting sight  let us go by all means replied arthur i am greatly interested in this new industry which seems to me to be still in its infancy the development of the moving picture is bound to lead to some remarkable things in the future i firmly believe  so do i said uncle john theyll combine the phonograph with the pictures for one thing so that the players instead of being silent will speak as clearly as in real life then well have the grand operas by all the most famous singers elaborately staged and well be able to see and hear them for ten cents instead of ten dollars it will be the same with the plays of the greatest actors  that would open up a curious complication asserted louise the operas would only be given once before the camera and the recorder then what would happen to all the highpriced opera singers  they would draw royalties on all their productions instead of salaries replied arthur  rather easy for the great artists observed patsy one performanceand the money rolling in for all time to come  well they deserve it declared beth and think of what the public would gain instead of having to suffer during the performances of incompetent actors and singers as we do today the whole world would be able to see and hear the best talent of the ages for an insignificant fee i hope your prediction will come true uncle john  its bound to he replied with confidence ive read somewhere that edison and others have been working on these lines for years and although they havent succeeded yet anything possible in mechanics is bound to be produced in time     chapter iv  aunt janes nieces   the picture which was entitled the sacrifice provedto use patsys wordsa howling success on monday afternoons the little theatres are seldom crowded so mr merricks party secured choice seats where they could observe every detail of the photography the girls could not wait for a later performance so eager were they to see themselves in a motion picture nor were they disappointed to find they were a mere incident in the long roll of film  the story of the photoplay was gripping in its intensity and since mr werner had clearly explained the lesson it conveyed they followed the plot with rapt attention in the last scene their entrance and exit was transitory but they were obliged to admit that their features were really expressive of fear the next instant the wall fell burying its victims and this rather bewildered them when they remembered that fully half an hour had elapsed while the dummies were being placed in position the real people removed from danger and preparations made to topple over the wall from the inside of the building but the camera had been inactive during that period and so cleverly had the parts of the picture been united that no pause whatever was observable to the spectators  my what a stuffy place exclaimed louise as they emerged into the light of day i cannot understand why it is necessary to have these moving picture theatres so gloomy and uncomfortable  it isnt necessary replied uncle john its merely a habit the builders have acquired there seemed to be a total lack of ventilation in that place  no one expects much for ten cents arthur reminded him if the pictures are good the public will stand for anything in the matter of discomfort  did you notice said patsy slowly how many children there were in that theatre  yes indeed answered beth the pictures seem to be an ideal amusement for children i do not suppose they can understand all the dramas and love stories but the pictures entertain them whatever the theme may be  they are not allowed to go unless accompanied by a parent or guardian arthur stated but i saw a group of eleven under the care of one cheerylooking old lady so i suppose the little ones evade the law in that way  on tuesday forenoon they drove to the office of the continental film manufacturing company and inquired for mr werner every approach to the interior of the big stockade was closely guarded in order to prevent the curious from intruding but werner at once hurried out to greet them and escorted them into the enclosure  you are just in time said he to witness one of the scenes in our great picture samson and delilah theyre getting it on now so you must hurry if you want to see the work its really the biggest thing our firm has ever turned out  they passed a group of low but extensive frame buildings threading their way between them until finally they emerged within a large open space where huge frames covered with canvas were propped up in broad daylight and apparently in great disorder huddled here and there were groups of people wearing oriental costumes of the bible days their skins stained brown the makeup on their faces showing hideously in the strong light a herd of meek donkeys bearing burdens of faggots was tethered near by  follow me closely cautioned their guide so you will not step over the dead line and get yourselves in the picture  what is the dead line inquired uncle john  the line that marks the limit of the cameras scope outside of that you are quite safe you will notice it is plainly marked in chalk  they passed around to the front and were amazed at the picture disclosed by the reverse of the gaunt skeletonlike framework for now was displayed solomons temple in all its magnificence with huge pillars supporting a roof that seemed as solid and substantial as stone and mortar could make it  the perspective was wonderful for they could follow a line of vision through the broad temple to a passage beyond along which was approaching a procession of priests headed by dancing girls and musicians beating tomtoms and playing upon reeds the entire scene was barbaric in its splendor and so impressive that they watched it spellbound awed and silent  yet here beside them was the motionpicture camera clicking steadily away and operated by a man in his shirtsleeves who watched the scene with sharp eyes now frowning and now nodding approval beside him at times but rushing from one point to another just outside the chalkmarks that indicated the dead line was the director of this production who shouted commands in a nervous excited manner and raged and tore his hair when anything went wrong  something went very wrong presently for the director blew a shrill blast on his whistle and suddenly everything stopped short the camera man threw a cloth over his lenses and calmly lighted a cigarette the procession halted in uncertainty and became a disordered rabble but the director sprang into the open space and shouted at his actors and actresses in evident ill temper  there it is again he cried five hundred feet of good film ruined by the stupidity of one person get out of that priests robe higgins and let jackson take your place wheres jackson anyhow  here answered a young man stepping out from a group of spectators  do you know the work can you lead that procession into the temple so they will leave room for delilah to enter and not crowd her off the platform asked the director  jackson merely nodded as he scrambled into the priests robe which the discomfited higgins resigned to him evidently the bungling actor was in disgrace for he was told to go to the office and get his pay and then clear out  so now the procession was sent back into the passage and rearranged in proper order the signal was given to begin and in an instant the camera renewed its clicking as the operator slowly revolved the handle that carried the long strip of film past the lenses the musicians played the girls danced the procession slowly emerged from the passage  this time it advanced properly and came to a halt just at the head of the staircase leading up to the entrance to the temple  delilah shouted the director and now appeared a beautiful girl who made a low obeisance to the chief priest  whygoodness me cried patsy itsits maud stanton  nonsense returned arthur sharply and then he looked again and drew a long breath for unless it were indeed the elder niece of mrs montrose there must be two girls in the world identically alike  mr werner settled the question by quietly remarking of course its maud stanton shes our bright particular star you know and the public would resent it if she didnt appear as the heroine of all our best pictures  an actress exclaimed arthur ii didnt know that  she and her sister flo are engaged by us regularly replied werner with an air of pride they cost us a lot of money as you may imagine but we cant afford to let any competitor have them  if arthur weldon felt any chagrin at this discovery it was not in the least shared by the others of his party beth was admiring the young girls grace and dignity patsy was delighted by her loveliness in the fleecy picturesque costume she wore louise felt pride in the fact that she had been introduced to a real actress while uncle john wondered what adverse fortune had driven this beautiful refined girl to pose before a motion picture camera  they soon discovered florence stanton in the picture too among the dancing girls so there could be no mistake of identity mrs montrose was not visible during the performance but afterward when samson had pulled down the pillars of the temple and it had fallen in ruins when the show was over and the actors trooping away to their dressingrooms then the visitors were ushered into the main office of the establishment to meet mr goldstein the manager and seated by the window was the aunt of the two girls placidly reading a book she looked up with a smile as they entered  did you see the play she asked and isnt it grand and impressive i hope you liked mauds delilah the poor child has worked so hard to create the character  they assured her the girl was perfect in her part after which mr merrick added im astonished you did not go out to see the play yourself  she laughed at his earnestness  its an old story to me she replied for i have watched maud rehearse her part many times also it is probable that someif not allof the scenes of samson and delilah will be taken over and over half a dozen times before the director is satisfied  the performance seemed quite perfect today said uncle john i suppose mrs montrose you do notereract yourself  oh i have helped out sometimes when a matronly personation is required but my regular duties keep me busily engaged in the office  may we ask what those duties are said louise  im the reader of scenarios  dear me exclaimed patsy im sure we dont know any more than we did before  a scenario said the lady is a description of the plot for a photoplay it is in manuscript form and hundreds of scenarios are submitted to us from every part of the country and by people in all walks of life  i shouldnt think you could use so many said beth  we cant my dear responded the lady laughing at her simplicity the majority of the scenarios we receive havent a single idea that is worth considering in most of the others the ideas are stolen or duplicated from some other pictureplay once in a while however we find a plot of real merit and then we accept it and pay the author for it  how much inquired arthur  so little that i am ashamed to tell you ideas are the foundation of our business and without them we could not make successful films but when mr goldstein buys an idea he pays as little for it as possible and the poor author usually accepts the pittance with gratitude  we were a little surprised uncle john ventured to say to find you connected with thiserinstitution i suppose its all right but those girlsyour nieces  yes they are motion picture actresses and i am a play reader it is our profession mr merrick and we earn our living in this way to be frank with you i am very proud of the fact that my girls are popular favorites with the picture theatre audiences  that they are mrs montrose said goldstein the manager a lean little man earnestly endorsing the statement and that makes them the highest priced stars in all our fourteen companies of players but theyre worth every cent we pay emand i hope evrybodys satisfied  mrs montrose paid little deference to the manager he is only a detail man she explained when goldstein had gone way but of course it is necessary to keep these vast and diverse interests running smoothly and the manager has enough details on his mind to drive an ordinary mortal crazy the successful scenario writers who conceive our best plays are the real heart of this business and the next to them in importance are the directors or producers who exercise marvelous cleverness in staging the work of the authors  i suppose remarked arthur weldon it is very like a theatre  not so like as you might imagine was the reply we employ scenery costumes and actors but not in ways theatrical for all our work is subservient to the cameras eye and the requirements of photography  while they were conversing the two stanton girls entered the office having exchanged their costumes for street clothes and washed the makeup from their faces which were now fresh and animated  oh aunt jane cried flo running to mrs montrose were dismissed for the day mr mcneil intends to develop the films before we do anything more and maud and i want to spend the afternoon at the beach  the lady smiled indulgently as maud quietly supported her sisters appeal the while greeting her acquaintances of yesterday with her sweet girlish charm of manner  a halfholiday is quite unusual with us she explained for it is the custom to hold us in readiness from sunrise to sunset in case our services are required an actress in a motion picture concern is the slave of her profession but we dont mind the work so much as we do waiting around for orders  suppose we all drive to the beach together suggested mr merrick we will try to help you enjoy your holiday and it will be a rich treat to us to have your society  yes indeed exclaimed patsy doyle im just crazy over this motion picture business and i want to ask you girls a thousand questions about it  they graciously agreed to the proposition and at once made preparations for the drive mrs montrose had her own automobile but the party divided the four young girls being driven by mr merricks chauffeur in his machine while uncle john arthur and louise rode with mrs montrose  it did not take the young people long to become acquainted and the air of restraint that naturally obtained in the first moments gradually wore away they were all in good spirits anticipating a jolly afternoon at the ocean resorts so when they discovered themselves to be congenial companions they lost no time in stilted phrases but were soon chattering away as if they had known one another for years     chapter v  a thrilling rescue   it must be fine to be an actress said patsy doyle with enthusiasm if i had the face or the figure or the abilityall of which i sadly lackid be an actress myself  i suppose replied maud stanton thoughtfully it is as good a profession for a girl as any other but the life is not one of play by any means we work very hard during the rehearsals and often i have become so weary that i feared i would drop to the ground in sheer exhaustion flo did faint once or twice during our first engagement with the pictograph company but we find our present employers more considerate and we have gained more importance than we had in the beginning  it is dreadfully confining though remarked florence with a sigh our hours are worse than those of shopgirls for the early morning sun is the best part of the day for our work often we are obliged to reach the studio at dawn to be sure we have the evenings to ourselves but we are then too tired to enjoy them  did you choose this profession for amusement or from necessity inquired beth wondering if the question sounded impertinent  stern necessity answered maud with a smile we had our living to earn  could not your aunt assist you asked patsy  aunt jane why she is as poor as we are  arthur weldon used to know the montroses said beth and be believed mr montrose left his widow a fortune  he didnt leave a penny asserted florence uncle was a stock gambler and when he died he was discovered to be bankrupt  i must explain to you said maud that our father and mother were both killed years ago in a dreadful automobile accident father left a small fortune to be divided between flo and me and appointed uncle george our guardian we were sent to a girls school and nicely provided for until uncles death when it was found he had squandered our little inheritance as well as his own money  that was hard luck said patsy sympathetically  i am not so sure of that returned the girl musingly perhaps we are happier now than if we had money our poverty gave us dear aunt jane for a companion and brought us into a field of endeavor that has proved delightful  but how in the world did you ever decide to become actresses when so many better occupations are open to women inquired beth  are other occupations so much better a motion picture actress is quite different from the stage variety you know our performances are all privately conducted and although the camera is recording our actions it is not like being stared at by a thousand critical eyes  a million eyes stare at the pictures asserted patsy  but we are not there to be embarrassed by them laughed flo  we have but one person to please continued maud and that is the director if at first the scene is not satisfactory we play it again and again until it is quite correct to us this striving for perfection is an art we actors are mere details of an artistic conception we have now been in hollywood for five months yet few people who casually notice us at the hotel or on the streets have any idea that we act for the movies sometimes we appear publicly in the streets in characteristic costume and proceed to enact our play where all may observe us but there are so many picture companies in this neighborhood that we are no longer looked upon as a novelty and the people passing by pay little attention to us  were you in that picture of the falling wall asked beth  no we were rehearsing for samson and delilah but sometimes we are called upon to do curious things one night not long ago a big residence burned down in the foothills back of our hotel at the first alarm of fire one of the directors wakened us and we jumped into our clothes and were whisked in an automobile to the scene of the conflagration the cameraman was already there and while we had to dodge the firefighters and the hose men both flo and i managed to be saved from the flames by some of our actorsnot once but several times  it must have been thrilling gasped patsy  it was exciting at the moment confessed maud one of the pictures proved very dramatic so an author wrote a story where at the climax a girl was rescued from the flames by her lover and we took our time to act the several scenes that led up to the fire the completed picture was a great success im told  those directors must be wonderfully enterprising fellows said beth  they are indeed constantly on the lookout for effects every incident that occurs in real life is promptly taken advantage of the cameramen are everywhere waiting for their chance often their pictures prove of no value and are destroyed but sometimes the scenes they catch are very useful to work into a picture play a few weeks ago i was shipwrecked on the ocean and saved by clinging to a raft that was not pleasant and i caught a severe cold by being in the water too long but i was chosen because i can swim such incidents are merely a part of our gamea game where personal comfort is frequently sacrificed to art once flo leaped over a thirtyfoot precipice and was caught in a net at the bottom the net was of course necessary but when the picture was displayed her terrible leap was followed by a view of her mangled body at the bottom of the canyon  how did they manage to do that asked patsy  stopped the camera cut off the piece of film showing her caught by the net and substituted a strip on which was recorded flos body lying among the jagged rocks where it had been carefully and comfortably arranged we do a lot of deceptive tricks of that sort and sometimes i myself marvel at the natural effects obtained  it must be more interesting than stage acting  i believe it is but weve never been on the stage said maud  how did you happen to get started in such a queer business inquired patsy  well after we found ourselves poor and without resources we began wondering what we could do to earn money a friend of aunt janes knew a motion picture maker who wanted fifty young girls for a certain picture and would pay each of them five dollars a day flo and i applied for the job and earned thirty dollars between us but then the manager thought he would like to employ us regularly and with auntie to chaperon us we accepted the engagement the first few weeks we merely appeared among the rabblesomething like chorus girls you seebut then we were given small parts and afterward more important ones when we discovered our own value to the film makers auntie managed to get us better engagements so weve acted for three different concerns during the past two years while aunt jane has become noted as a clever judge of the merits of scenarios  do both of you girls play star parts beth inquired  usually flo is considered the best child actress in the business but when there is no child part she makes herself useful in all sorts of ways today for instance you saw her among the dancing girls i do the ingenue or young girl parts which are very popular just now i did not want to act delilah for i thought i was not old enough but mr mcneil wanted me in the picture and so i made myself took as mature as possible  you were ideal cried patsy admiringly  the young girl blushed at this praise but said deprecatingly  i doubt if i could ever be a really great actress but then i do not intend to act for many more years our salary is very liberal at present as goldstein grudgingly informed you and we are saving money as soon as we think we have acquired enough to live on comfortably we shall abandon acting and live as other girls do  the fact is added flo no one will employ us when we have lost our youth so we are taking advantage of these few fleeting years to make hay while the sun shines  do many stage actresses go into the motion picture business asked beth  a few but all are not competent replied maud in the silent drama facial expression and the art of conveying information by a gesture is of paramount importance in other words action must do the talking and explain everything i am told that some comedians like bunny and sterling mace were failures on the stage yet in motion pictures they are great favorites on the other hand some famous stage actors can do nothing in motion pictures  on their arrival at santa monica mr merrick invited the party to be his guests at luncheon which was served in a cosy restaurant overlooking the ocean and then although at this season it was bleak winter back east all but uncle john and aunt jane took a bath in the surf of the blue pacific mingling with hundreds of other bathers who were enjoying the sport  mrs montrose and uncle john sat on the sands to watch the merry scene while the young people swam and splashed about and they seemedas miss patsy slyly observedto get on very well together  and that is very creditable to your aunt she observed to maud stanton who was beside her in the water for uncle john is rather shy in the society of ladies and they find him hard to entertain  he seems like a dear old gentleman said maud  he is indeed the dearest in all the world and if he likes your aunt jane that is evidence that she is all right too for uncle johns intuition never fails him in the selection of friends he  dear me cried maud theres someone in trouble im sure  she was looking out across the waves which were fairly high today and patsy saw her lean forward and strike out to sea with strokes of remarkable swiftness bathers were scattered thickly along the coast but only a few had ventured far out beyond the lifelines so patsy naturally sought an explanation by gazing at those farthest out at first she was puzzled for all the venturesome seemed to be swimming strongly and composedly but presently a dark form showed on the crest of a wavea struggling form that tossed up its arms despairingly and then disappeared  she looked for maud stanton and saw her swimming straight out but still a long way from the person in distress then patsy always quickwitted in emergencies made a dash for the shore where a small boat was drawn up on the beach  come arthur quick she cried to the young man who was calmly wading near the beach and he caught the note of terror in her voice and hastened to help push the little craft into the water  jump in she panted and row as hard as you ever rowed in all your life  young weldon was prompt to obey he asked no useless questions but realizing that someone was in danger he pulled a strong steady oar and let patsy steer the boat  the laughter and merry shouts of the bathers who were all unaware that a tragedy was developing close at hand rang in the girls ears as she peered eagerly ahead for a sign to guide her now she espied maud stanton far out beyond the others circling around and diving into this wave or that as it passed her  whoever it was she muttered half aloud is surely done for by this time hurry arthur im afraid maud has exhausted all her strength  but just then maud dived again and when she reappeared was holding fast to something dark and inanimate a moment later the boat swept to her side and she said  get him aboard if you can dont mind me im all right  arthur reached down and drew a slight boyish form over the gunwale while patsy clasped mauds hand and helped the girl over the side she was still strong but panted from her exertions to support the boy  who is it inquired patsy as arthur headed the boat for the shore  maud shook her head leaning forward to look at the face of the rescued one for the first time  ive never seen him before she said isnt it too bad that i reached him too late  patsy nodded gazing at the white delicate profile of the young fellow as he lay lifeless at her feet too late undoubtedly and he was a mere boy with all the interests of life just unfolding for him  their adventure had now been noticed by some of the bathers who crowded forward to meet the boat as it grounded on the beach uncle john always keeping an eye on his beloved nieces had noted every detail of the rescue and as a dozen strong men pulled the boat across the sands beyond the reach of the surf the merrick automobile rolled up beside it  now then cried the little man energetically and with the assistance of his chauffeur he lifted the lifeless form into the car  the hospital said patsy nodding approval  yes he answered no you girls cant come in your wet bathing suits ill do all that can be done  even as he spoke the machine whirled away and looking after it maud said shaking her head mildly i fear hes right little can be done for the poor fellow now  oh lots can be done returned patsy but perhaps it wont bring him back to life anyhow its right to make every attempt as promptly as possible and certainly uncle john didnt waste any time  beth and florence now joined them and louise came running up to ask eager questions  who was it patsy  we dont know some poor fellow who got too far out and had a cramp perhaps or his strength may have given out he didnt seem very rugged  he was struggling when first i saw him said maud it seemed dreadful to watch the poor boy drowning when hundreds of people were laughing and playing in the water within earshot of him  that was the trouble declared arthur weldon all those people were intent on themselves and made so much noise that his cries for help could not be heard  the tragedy now generally known had the effect of sobering the bathers and most of them left the water and trooped to the bathhouses to dress mrs montrose advised the girls to get their clothes on as all were shiveringpartly from nervousnessin their wet bathing suits  they were ready an hour before mr merrick returned and his long absence surprised them until they saw his smiling face as he drove up in his car it gave them a thrill of hope as in chorus they cried  welluncle john  i think he will live returned the little man with an air of great satisfaction anyway hes alive and breathing now and the doctors say theres every reason to expect a rapid recovery  who is he they asked crowding around him  a jones  awhat this from patsy in a doubtful tone  jones a jones  why he must have given you an assumed name  he didnt give us any name as soon as he recovered consciousness he fell asleep and i left him slumbering as peacefully as a baby but we went through his clothes hoping to get a trace of his friends so they could be notified his bathing suit is his own not rented and the name a jones is embroidered on tape and sewn to each piece also the key to bathhouse number twentysix was tied to his wrist the superintendent sent a man for his clothing and we examined that too the letters aj were stamped in gold on his pocketbook and in his cardcase were a number of cards engraved a jones sangoa but there were no letters or any other papers  where is sangoa inquired beth  no one seems to know confessed uncle john there was plenty of money in his pocketbook and he has a valuable watch but no other jewelry his clothes were made by a los angeles tailor but when they called him up by telephone he knew nothing about his customer except that he had ordered his suit and paid for it in advance he called for it three days ago and carried it away with him so we have no clue to the boys dwelling place  isnt that a little strangeperhaps a little suspicious asked mrs montrose  i think not maam answered mr merrick we made these investigations at the time we still feared he would die so as to communicate with any friends or relatives he might have but after he passed the crisis so well and fell asleep the hospital people stopped worrying about him he seems like any ordinary welltodo young fellow and a couple of days in the hospital ought to put him upon his feet again  but sangoa uncle is that a town or a country  some outoftheway village i suppose people are here from every crack and corner of america you know  it sounds a bit spanish commented arthur maybe he is from mexico  maybe agreed uncle john anyhow maud has saved his life and if its worth anything to him he ought to be grateful  never mind that said maud flushing prettily with embarrassment as all eyes turned upon her im glad i noticed him in time but now that he is all right he need never know who it was that rescued him and for that matter sir patsy doyle and mr weldon did as much for him as i perhaps they saved us both while your promptness in getting him to the hospital was the main factor in saving his life  well its all marked down in the hospital books remarked uncle john i had to tell the whole story you see as a matter of record and all our names are there so none can escape the credit due heror him  in truth said mrs montrose with a smile it really required four of you to save one slender boy  yes he needed a lot of saving laughed flo but her pretty face growing more serious i believe it was all fate and nothing else had we not come to the beach this afternoon the boy might have drowned so as i suggested the trip im going to take a little credit myself  looking at it in that light said patsy the moving picture man saved the boys life by giving you a halfholiday  this caused a laugh for their spirits were now restored to normal to celebrate the occasion mr merrick proposed to take them all into los angeles to dine at a swell restaurant before returning to hollywood  this little event in conjunction with the afternoons adventure made them all more intimate so that when they finally reached home and separated for the night they felt like old friends rather than recent acquaintances     chapter vi  a jones   there was work for the stanton girls at the film factory as they called it next morning so they had left the hotel before mr merricks party assembled at the breakfast table  i must telephone the santa monica hospital and find out how our patient is remarked uncle john when the meal was over but presently he returned from the telephone booth with a puzzled expression upon his face a jones has disappeared he announced  disappeared what do you mean uncle asked beth  he woke early and declared he was himself again paid his bill said good morning to the hospital superintendent and walked away he wouldnt answer questions but kept asking them the nurse showed him the book with the record of how he was saved but she couldnt induce him to say who he was where he came from nor where he was going seems a little queer doesnt it  they all confessed that it did  however said patsy doyle im glad he recovered and im sure maud will be when she hears the news the boy has a perfect right to keep his own counsel but he might have had the grace to tell us what that initial a stands for and where on earth sangoa is  ive been inquiring about sangoa announced arthur just then joining the group and no one seems wiser than we are theres no record of such a town or state in mexico or in the united statesso far as i can discover the clerk has sent for a map of alaska and perhaps well find sangoa there  what does it matter inquired louise  why we dont like to be stumped asserted patsy thats all here is a young man from sangoa and  really interrupted beth who was gazing through the window i believe here is the young man from sangoa  where they all cried crowding forward to look  coming up the walk see isnt that the same mysterious individual whose life maud saved  thats the identical mystery declared uncle john i suppose he has come here to look us up and thank us  then for heavens sake girls pump him and find out where sangoa is said arthur hastily and the next moment a bell boy approached their party with a card  they looked at the young fellow curiously as he came toward them he seemed not more than eighteen years of age and his thin features wore a tired expression that was not the result of his recent experience but proved to be habitual his manner was not languid however but rather composed at the same time he held himself alert as if constantly on his guard his dress was simple but in good taste and he displayed no embarrassment as he greeted the party with a low bow  ah said uncle john heartily shaking his hand i am delighted to find you so perfectly recovered  a slight smile sad and deprecating flickered for an instant over his lips it gave the boyish face a patient and rather sweet expression as he slowly replied  i am quite myself today sir and i have come to assure you of my gratitude for your rescue of me yesterday perhaps it wasnt worth all your bother but since you generously took the trouble to save me the least i can do is to tender you my thanks here he looked from one to another of the three girls and continued please tell me which young lady swam to my assistance  oh it was none of us said patsy miss stantonmaud stantonswam out to you when she noticed you were struggling and kept you afloat until weuntil help came  and miss stanton is not here  not at present although she is staying at this hotel  he gravely considered this information for a moment as he stood there swaying slightly he appeared so frail and delicate that uncle john seized his arm and made him sit down in a big easy chair the boy sighed took a memorandum from his pocket and glanced at it  miss doyle and mr weldon pulled out in a boat and rescued both miss stanton and me just as we were about to sink he said tell me please if either miss doyle or mr weldon is present  i am arthur weldon said that young gentleman but i was merely the boatman under command of miss doyle whom i beg to present to you  a jones looked earnestly into patsys face holding out his hand he said with his odd smile thank you then he turned to shake arthurs hand after which he continued i also am indebted to mr merrick for carrying me to the hospital the doctor told me that only this prompt action enabled them to resuscitate me at all and now i believe it would be courteous for me to tell you who i am and how i came to be in such dire peril  he paused to look around him questioningly and the interest on every face was clearly evident arthur took this opportunity to introduce jones to louise and beth and then they all sat down again said uncle john to the stranger in his frank and friendly way  tell us as much or as little as you like my boy we are not unduly inquisitive i assure you  thank you sir i am an american and my name is jones that is i may claim american parentage although i was born upon a scarcely known island in the pacific which my father purchased from the government of uruguay some thirty years ago  sangoa asked arthur  he seemed surprised at the question but readily answered  yes sangoa my father was a grandnephew of john paul jones and very proud of the connection but instead of being a sailor he was a scientist and he chose to pass his life in retirement from the world  your father is no longer living then said mr merrick  he passed away a year ago on his beloved island my mother died several years before him i began to feel lonely at sangoa and i was anxious to visit america of which my mother had so often told me so some months ago i reached san francisco since when i have been traveling over your countrymy country may i call itand studying your modern civilization in new york i remained fully three months it is only about ten days since i returned to this coast  he stopped abruptly as if he considered he had told enough the brief recital had interested his auditors but the ensuing pause was rather embarrassing  i suppose you have been visiting relatives of your parents remarked uncle john to ease the situation  theyhad no relatives that i know of he returned i am quite alone in the world you must not suppose i am unaccustomed to the water he hastened to add as if to retreat from an unpleasant subject at sangoa i have bathed in the sea ever since i can remember anything buti am not in good health i suffer from indigestion a chronic condition which is my incubus yesterday my strength suddenly deserted me and i became helpless  how fortunate it was that maud noticed you exclaimed patsy with generous sympathy  again the half sad smile softened his face as he looked at her  i am not sure it was wholly fortunate for me he said although i admit i have no wish to end my uninteresting life by drowning i am not a misanthrope in spite of my bad stomach the world is more useful to me than i am to the world but that is not my fault pardon me for talking so much about myself  oh we are intensely interested i assure you replied patsy if some of us were indeed the instruments that saved you yesterday it is a pleasure to us to know something of thethe manwe saved  she had almost said boy he was such a youthful person and he knew it as well as she did  i would like to meet miss stanton and thank her personally he presently resumed so if you have no objection i think i shall register at this hotel and take a room ii am not very strong yet but perhaps miss stanton will see me when i have rested a little  she wont return before five oclock explained mr merrick miss stanton iserconnected with a motion picture company you know and is busy during the day  he seemed both surprised and perplexed at first but after a moments thought he said  she is an actress then  yes she and her sister they have with them an aunt mrs montrose for companion  thank you then i will try to meet them this evening  as he spoke he rose with some difficulty and bade them adieu arthur went with him to the desk and proffered his assistance but the young man said he needed nothing but rest  and just think of it said patsy when he had gone we dont know yet what that a stands for  arthur suggested louise  albert said beth  or algernon added uncle john with a chuckle  but we havent seen the last of him yet declared miss doyle ive a romance all plotted of which a jones is to be the hero he will fall in love with maud and carry her away to his island  im not so sure of that result observed uncle john thoughtfully it wouldnt astonish me to have him fall in love with maud stanton weve all done that you know but could maudcould any girlbe attracted by a lean dismal boy with a weak stomach such as a jones  even with these drawbacks he is quite interesting asserted beth  he is sure to win her sympathy said louise  but above all declared patsy he has an island inherited from his royal daddy that island would count for a lot with any girl     chapter vii  the invalid   the girls intercepted maud stanton when she returned to the hotel that evening and told her all about a jones the tale was finished long before that dyspeptic youth had wakened from his slumbers then they all dressed for dinner and afterward met in the lobby where uncle john told them he had arranged to have a big round table prepared for the entire party including a seat for a jones who might like to join them  however the young man did not make his appearance and as they trooped into the dining room patsy said resentfully  i believe a jones is in a trance and needs rolling on a barrel again  he probably found himself too weak to appear in public replied flo stanton im sure if i had been all but drowned a few hours ago i would prefer bed to society  im astonished that he summoned energy to visit us at all declared mrs montrose he may be weak and ill but at least he is grateful  jones seems a vary gentlemanly young fellow said mr merrick he is a bit shy and retiring which is perhaps due to his lonely life on his island but i think he has been well brought up  as they came out from dinner they observed the porters wheeling several big trunks up the east corridor the end of each trunk was lettered a jones  well said beth with an amused smile he intends to stay a while anyhow youll have a chance to meet him yet maud  im glad of that answered maud for i am anxious to calculate the worth of the life i helped to save your reports are ambiguous and i am undecided whether you are taking the boy seriously or as a joke from your description of his personal appearance i incline to the belief that under ordinary circumstances i would not look twice at mr jones but having been partly instrumental in preserving him to the world i naturally feel a proprietary interest in him  of course said flo hes worth one look out of pure curiosity but it would be dreadful to have him tagging you around expressing his everlasting gratitude  i dont imagine hell do that observed patsy doyle a jones strikes me as having a fair intellect in a shipwrecked body and ill wager a hatpin against a glovebuttoner that he wont bore you at the same time he may not interest youor any of usfor long unless he develops talents we have not discovered i wonder why he doesnt use his whole name that mystic a puzzles me  its an english notion i suppose said mrs montrose  but he isnt english hes american  sangoese corrected beth  perhaps he doesnt like his name or is ashamed of it suggested uncle john  it may be absalom said flo we once knew an actor named absalom and he always called himself a judson keith he was a dignified chap and when we girls one day called him ab he nearly had hysterics  mr werner had hysterics today asserted maud gravely but i didnt blame him he sent out a party to ride down a steep hill on horseback as part of a film story and a bad accident resulted one of the horses stepped in a gopher hole and fell and a dozen others piled up on him including their riders  how dreadful was the general exclamation  several of the horses broke their legs and had to be shot continued maud but none of the riders was seriously injured except little sadie martin who was riding a bronco the poor thing was caught under one of the animals and the doctor says she wont be able to work again for months  goodness me and all for the sake of a picture cried patsy indignantly i hope you dont take such risks maud  no flo and i have graduated from what is called the bronco bunch and now do platform work entirely to be sure we assume some minor risks in that but nothing to compare with the other lines of business  i hope the little girl you mentioned will get well and has enough money to tide her over this trouble said uncle john anxiously  the manager will look after her returned mrs montrose our people are very good about that and probably sadie martins salary will continue regularly until she is able to work again  well said beth drawing a long breath i suppose we shall read all about it in the morning papers  oh no exclaimed maud and added these accidents never get into the papers they happen quite often around los angeles where ten thousand or more people make their living from motion pictures but the public is protected from all knowledge of such disasters which would detract from their pleasure in pictures and perhaps render all films unpopular  i thought the dear public loved the daredevil acts remarked arthur weldon  oh it does agreed mrs montrose yet those who attend the picture theatres seem not to consider the action taking place before their eyes to be real here are pictures onlya sort of amplified story bookand the spectators like them exciting but if they stopped to reflect that men and women in the flesh were required to do these dangerous feats for their entertainment many would be too horrified to enjoy the scenes of course the makers of the pictures guard their actors in all possible ways yet even so casualties are bound to occur  they had retired to a cosy corner of the public drawing room and were conversing on this interesting topic when they espied a jones walking toward them the youth was attired in immaculate evening dress but his step was slow and dragging and his face pallid  arthur and uncle john drew up an easy chair for him while patsy performed the introductions to mrs montrose and her nieces very earnestly the boy grasped the hand of the young girl who had been chiefly responsible for his rescue thanking her more by his manner than in his few carefully chosen words  as for maud she smilingly belittled her effort saying lightly i know i must not claim that it didnt amount to anything for your life is valuable mr jones im sure but i had almost nothing to do beyond calling patsy doyles attention to you and then swimming out to keep you afloat until help came im a good swimmer so it was not at all difficult  moreover he added you would have done the same thing for anyone in distress  certainly  i realize that i am quite a stranger to you nevertheless my gratitude is your due and i hope you will accept it as the least tribute i can pay you of all that throng of bathers only you noticed my peril and came to my assistance  fate whispered flo impressively  nonsense retorted her sister i happened to be the only one looking out to sea i think mr jones you owe us apologies more than gratitude for your folly was responsible for the incident you were altogether too venturesome such action on this coast where the surf rolls high and creates an undertow is nothing less than foolhardy  im sure you are right he admitted i did not know this coast and foolishly imagined the old pacific in which i have sported and played since babyhood was my friend wherever i found it  i hope you are feeling better and stronger this evening said mr merrick we expected you to join us at dinner  ii seldom dine in public he explained flushing slightly my billoffare is very limited you know owing to mymy condition and so i carry my foodtablets around with me wherever i go and eat them in my own room  foodtablets cried patsy horrified  yes they are really wafersvery harmlessand i am permitted to eat nothing else  no wonder your stomach is bad and youre a living skeleton asserted the girl with scorn  my dear said uncle john gently chiding her we must give mr jones the credit for knowing what is best for him  not me sir protested the boy in haste im very ignorant aboutabout health and medicine and the like but in new york i consulted a famous doctor and he told me what to do  thats right nodded the old gentleman who had never been ill in his life always take the advice of a doctor listen to the advice of a lawyer and refuse the advise of a banker thats worldly wisdom  were you ill when you left your home inquired mrs montrose looking at the young man with motherly sympathy  not when i left the island he said i was pretty well up to that time but during the long ocean voyage i was terribly sick and by the time we got to san francisco my stomach was a wreck then i tried to eat the rich food at your restaurants and hotelswe live very plainly in sangoa you knowand by the time i got to new york i was a confirmed dyspeptic and suffering tortures everything i ate disagreed with me so i went to a great specialist who has invented these food tablets for cases just like mine and he ordered me to eat nothing else  and are you better asked maud  he hesitated  sometimes i imagine i am i do not suffer so much pain but ii seem to grow weaker all the time  no wonder cried patsy if you starve yourself you cant grow strong  he looked at her with an expression of surprise then he asked abruptly  what would you advise me to do miss doyle  a chorus of laughter greeted this question patsy flushed a trifle but covered her confusion by demanding would you follow my advice  he made a little grimace there was humor in the boy despite his dyspepsia  i understand there is a law forbidding suicide he replied but i asked your advice in an attempt to discover what you thought of my absurd condition now that you call my attention to it i believe i am starving myself i need stronger and more nourishing food and yet the best specialist in your progressive country has regulated my diet  i dont believe much in specialists asserted patsy if you do go ahead and kill yourself in defiance of the law according to common sense you ought to eat plenty of good wholesome food but you may be so disorderedin your interiorthat even that would prove fatal so i wont recommend it  im doomed either way he said quietly i know that  how do you know it demanded maud in a tone of resentment  he was silent a moment then he replied  i cannot remember how we drifted into this very personal argument it seems wrong for me to be talking about myself to those who are practically strangers and you will realize how unused i am to the society of ladies by considering my rudeness in this interview  pshaw exclaimed uncle john we are merely considering you as a friend you must believe that we are really interested in you he continued laying a kindly hand on the young fellows shoulder you seem in a bad way its true but your condition is far from desperate patsys franknessits her one fault and her chief virtueled you to talk about yourself and im surprised to find you so despondent andandwhat do you call it beth  pessimistic  thats itpessimistic  but youre wrong sir said the boy with a smile i may not be elated over my fatal disease but neither am i despondent i force myself to keep going when i wonder how the miserable machine responds to my urging and i shall keep it going after a fashion until the final breakdown fate weaves the thread of our lives i truly believe and she didnt use very good material when she started mine but that doesnt matter he added quickly im trying to do a little good as i go along and not waste my opportunities im obeying my doctors orders and facing the future with all the philosophy i can summon so now if youwho have given me a new lease of lifethink i can use it to any better advantage i am willing to follow your counsel  his tone was more pathetic than his words maud as she looked at the boy and tried to realize that his days were numbered felt her eyes fill with tears patsy sniffed scornfully but said nothing it was beth who remarked with an air of unconcern that surprised those who knew her unsympathetic nature  it would be presumptuous for us to interfere either with fate or with nature youre probably dead wrong about your condition for a sick person has no judgment whatever but ive noticed the mind has a good deal to do with ones health if you firmly believe youre going to die why what can you expect  no one cared to contradict this and a pause followed that was growing awkward when they were all aroused by the sound of hasty footsteps approaching their corner     chapter viii  the magic of a name   the newcomer proved to be goldstein the manager of the continental his face was frowning and severe as he rudely marched up to the group and without the formality of a greeting pointedly addressed the stanton girls  what does it mean he demanded in evident excitement for his voice shook and the accusing finger he held out trembled how does it happen that my people under contract to work for the continental are working for other firms  maud paled and her eyes glistened with resentment as she rose and faced her manager florence pulled her sisters sleeve and said with a forced laugh sit down maud the man has probably been drinking  he turned on the young girl fiercely but now it was arthur weldon who seized the managers arm and whirled him around  sir you are intruding he said sternly if you have business with these ladies choose the proper time and place to address them  i have cried goldstein blusteringly they have treated me shamefullyunprofessionally they have played me a trick and ive the right to demand why they are working for a rival firm while in my pay  mrs montrose now arose and said with quiet dignity  mr goldstein you are intruding as mr weldon says but you have said so much to defame my nieces in the eyes of our friends here assembled that you must explain yourself more fully  the manager seemed astonished by his reception he looked from one to another and said more mildly  it is easy enough for me to explain but how can the stantons explain their conduct they are under contract to act exclusively for the continental film company and i pay them a liberal salary yet only yesterday when i was kind enough to give them a holiday they went down to the beach and posed for a picture for our rivals the corona company  you are mistaken sir retorted arthur the young ladies were in our company the entire afternoon and they did not pose for any picture whatever  dont tell me cried goldstein ive just seen the picture down town i was going by one of the theatres when i noticed a placard that read sensational film by maud stanton the queen of motion picture actresses entitled a gallant rescue first run tonight i went in and saw the picturewith my own eyesand i saw maud stanton in a sea scene rescuing a man who was drowning dont deny it miss he added turning upon maud fiercely i saw it with my own eyesnot an hour ago  after a moments amazed silence his hearers broke into a chorus of laughter led by flo who was almost hysterical even a jones smiled indulgently upon the irate manager who was now fairly bristling with indignation  the corona people remarked arthur weldon are quite enterprising i did not know they had a cameraman at the beach yesterday but he must have secured a very interesting picture it was not posed mr goldstein but taken from life  it was maud stanton asserted the manager  yes she and some others a man was really drowning and the brave girl swam to his rescue without a thought of posing  i dont believe it cried the man rudely  here a jones struggled to his feet  it is true he said i was the drowning man whom miss stanton saved  goldstein eyed him shrewdly  perhaps you were he admitted for the man in the picture was about your style of makeup but how can you prove it was not a putup job with the corona people how do i know you are not all in the employ of the corona people  i give you my word  pah i dont know you  i see you dont returned the youth stiffly  here is my card perhaps you will recognize the name  he fumbled in his pocket took out a card and handed it to the manager goldstein looked at it started turned red and then white and began bobbing his head with absurd deference to the youth  pardon mr jonespardon he gasped ii heard you were in our neighborhood but ii did not recognize you ii hope you will pardon me mr jones i was angry at what i supposed was the treachery of an employee you willwillunderstand that i am sure it is my duty to protect the interests of the continental you know sir but its all right now of course isnt it all right now mr jones  youd better go goldstein said the boy in a weary tone and sat down again  the manager hesitated then he bowed to maud stanton and to the others murmuring  all a mistake you see all a mistake ii beg everybodys pardon  with this he backed away still bowing and finally turned and beat a hasty retreat but no one was noticing him especially all eyes were regarding the boy with a new curiosity  that goldstein is an illbred boor remarked uncle john in an annoyed tone  i suppose said maud slowly he thought he was right in demanding an explanation there is great rivalry between the various film manufacturers and it was rather mean of the corona to put my name on that placard  its wonderful exclaimed patsy how did they get the picture do you suppose  they have cameramen everywhere looking for some picture worth while explained mrs montrose if theres a fire the chances are a cameraman is on the spot before the firemen arrive if theres an accident it is often caught by the camera before the victim realizes what has happened perhaps a cameraman has been at the beach for weeks waiting patiently for some tragedy to occur anyway he was on hand yesterday and quietly ran his film during the excitement of the rescue he was in rare luck to get maud because she is a favorite with the public but it was not fair to connect her name with the picture when they know she is employed by the continental  young jones rose from his chair with a gesture of weariness  if you will excuse me he said i will go to my room our little conversation has given me much pleasure im so alone in the world perhaps you will allow me to join you againsome other time  they hastened to assure him his presence would always be welcome patsy even added with her cheery smile that they felt a certain proprietorship in him since they had dragged him from a watery grave the boy showed as he walked away that he was not yet very steady on his feet but whether the weakness was the result of his malady or his recent trying experience they could not determine  what staggers me said maud looking after him is the effect his name had on goldstein who has little respect or consideration for anyone who do you suppose a jones is  why he has told us replied louise he is an islander on his first visit to this country  he must be rather more than that declared arthur do you remember what the manager said to him  yes said beth he had heard that a jones was in this neighborhood but had never met him a jones was a person of sufficient importance to make the general manager of the continental film company tremble in his boots  he really did tremble asserted patsy and he was abject in his apologies  showing added flo stanton that goldstein is afraid of him  i wonder why said maud  it is all very easy of solution remarked arthur goldstein believes that jones is in the market to buy films perhaps hes going to open a motion picture theatre on his island so the manager didnt want to antagonize a good customer  thats it said uncle john nodding approval theres no great mystery about young jones im sure     chapter ix  doctor patsy   next morning uncle john and the weldonsincluding the precious babywent for a ride into the mountains while beth and patsy took their embroidery into a sunny corner of the hotel lobby  it was nearly ten oclock when a jones discovered the two girls and came tottering toward them tottering is the right word he fairly swayed as he made his way to the secluded corner  i wish hed use a cane muttered beth in an undertone i have the feeling that hes liable to bump his nose any minute  patsy drew up a chair for him although he endeavored to prevent her  are you feeling better this morning she inquired  ii think so he answered doubtfully i dont seem to get back my strength you see  were you stronger before your accident asked beth  yes indeed i went swimming you remember but perhaps i was not strong enough to do that iim very careful of myself yet i seem to grow weaker all the time  there was a brief silence during which the girls plied their needles  are you going to stay in this hotel demanded patsy in her blunt way  for a time i think it is very pleasant here he said  have you had breakfast  i took a foodtablet at daybreak  huh a scornful exclamation then she glanced at the open door of the dininghall and laying aside her work she rose with a determined air and said  come with me  where  for answer she assisted him to rise then she took his hand and marched him across the lobby to the dining room  he seemed astonished at this proceeding but made no resistance seated at a small table she called a waitress and said  bring a cup of chocolate a softboiled egg and some toast  pardon me miss doyle he said i thought you had breakfasted  so i have she replied the breakfast ive ordered is for you and youre going to eat it if i have to ram it down your throat  butmiss doyle  youve told us you are doomed well youre going to die with a full stomach  but the doctor  bother the doctor im your doctor now and i wont send in a bill thank your stars  he looked at her with his sad little smile  isnt this a rather highhanded proceeding miss doyle  perhaps  i havent employed you as my physician you know  true but youve deliberately put yourself in my power  how  in the first place you tagged us here to this hotel  you dont mind do you  not in the least its a public hostelry in the second place you confided to us your disease and your treatment of itwhich was really none of our business  ii was wrong to do that but you led me on andim so lonelyand you all seemed so generous and sympatheticthat ii  that you unwittingly posted us concerning your real trouble do you realize what it is youre a hypohypowhat do they call ithypochondriac  i am not  and your doctoryour famous specialistis a fool  oh miss doyle  also you are aa chump to follow his fool advice you dont need sympathy mr a jones what you need is a slapstick  aa  a slapstick and thats what youre going to get if you dont obey orders  here the maid set down the breakfast ranging the dishes invitingly before the invalid his face had expressed all the emotions from amazement to terror during patsys tirade and now he gazed from her firm determined features to the eggs and toast in an uncertain helpless way that caused the girl a severe effort to curb a burst of laughter  now then she said get busy ill fix your egg do you want more sugar in your chocolate taste it and see and if you dont butter that toast before it gets cold it wont be fit to eat  he looked at her steadily now again smiling  youre not joking miss doyle  im in dead earnest  of course you realize this is thethe end  of your foolishness i hope so you used to eat like a sensible boy didnt you  when i was well  youre well now your only need is sustaining strengthening food i came near ordering you a beefsteak but ill reserve that for lunch  he sipped the chocolate  yes it needs more sugar he said quietly will you please butter my toast it seems to me such a breakfast is worth months of suffering how delicious this egg is it was the fragrance of the egg and toast that conquered me that and  and one sensible determined girl dont look at me as if i were a murderess im your best frienda friend in need and dont choke down your food eat slowly fletcherizechew your food you know i know youre nearly famished but you must gradually accustom yourself to a proper diet  he obeyed meekly patsys face was calm but her heart beat fast with a thrill of fear she could not repress acting on impulse as she had the girl now began to consider that she was personally responsible for whatever result might follow this radical treatment for dyspepsia had she been positive it was dyspepsia she would never have dared interfere with a doctors orders but she felt that the boy needed food and would die unless he had it he might die from the effect of this unusual repast in which case she would never forgive herself  meantime the boy had cast aside all fear he had protested indeed but his protests being overruled he accepted his food and its possible consequences with philosophic resignation and a growing satisfaction  patsy balked on the third slice of toast and took it away from him she also denied him a second cup of chocolate he leaned back in his chair with a sigh of content and said  bless the hen that laid that egg no dainty was ever more delicious and now he added rising let us go and inquire the address of a good undertaker i have made my will and id like to be crematedits so much nicer than the oldfashioned burial dont you think  ill attend to all that if you wish she replied trying to repress a shudder as she followed him from the room do you smoke  i used to but the doctor forbade it so i gave it up entirely  go over to that stand and buy a cigar then you may sit beside beth and me and smoke it  the girl did not wholly approve of smoking and had often chided uncle john and her father and arthur weldon for indulging in the habit but this advice to young jones was given in desperation because all the men of her family stoutly affirmed that a cigar after a meal assisted digestion she resumed her former seat beside beth and her cousin quickly read the anxiety on her face  what did you do patricia  i fed him  did he really eat  like a starved cat  hmmm said beth what next i wonder  patsy wondered too the cold shivers chasing one another up and down her back the boy was coming toward them coolly puffing a cigar he did not seem to totter quite so much as before but he was glad to sink into an easy chair  how do you feel asked beth regarding him curiously  like one of those criminals who are pampered with all the good things of life before being led to the scaffold  any pains  he shook his head  not yet ive asked the clerk whenever i signal him to send someone to carry me to my room if im not able to say goodbye to you please accept now my thanks for all your kindness to a stranger you see im not sure whether ill have a sudden seizure or the pains will come on gradually  what pains demanded patsy  i cant explain them dont you believe something is bound to happen he inquired nervously removing the ash from his cigar  to be sure youre going to get well  he made no reply but sat watching beths nimble fingers patsy was too excited to resume her embroidery  i wonder if you are old enough to smoke remarked beth  im over twentyone  indeed we decided you were about eighteen  but we are not spanish in sangoa  what are your people  formerly all americans the younger generation are like myself i suppose sangoans by birth but there isnt a black or yellow or brown man on our island  how many inhabitants has sangoa  about six hundred all told  there was silence for a while  any pains yet inquired beth  not yet but im feeling drowsy with your permission ill lie down and take a nap i slept very little last night  he threw away his cigar which he had smoked nearly to the end and rising without assistance bowed and walked away  will he ever waken i wonder said beth softly  of course declared patsy he has crossed the rubicon and is going to get well i feel it in my bones  let us hope responded beth that ajo also feels it in his bones rather than in his stomach     chapter x  still a mystery   the day advanced to luncheon time and uncle john and the weldons came back from their mountain trip hollywood is in the foothills and over the passes are superb automobile roads into the fruitful valleys of san fernando and la canada  seen anything of the boya jones inquired arthur  yes and perhaps weve seen the last of him answered beth  oh has he gone  no one knows patsy fed him and he went to sleep what has happened since we cannot tell  the girls then related the experiences of the morning at which both uncle john and arthur looked solemn and uncomfortable but louise said calmly  i think patsy was quite right i wouldnt have dared such a thing myself but im sure that boy needed a square meal more than anything if he dies that breakfast has merely hastened his end but if he doesnt die it will do him good  theres another possibility remarked uncle john he may be suffering agonies with no one to help him  patsys face was white as chalk the last hour or two had brought her considerable anxiety and her uncles horrible suggestion quite unnerved her she stole away to the office and inquired the number of mr jones room it was on the ground floor and easily reached by a passage the girl tiptoed up to the door and putting her ear to the panel listened intently a moment later a smile broke over her face she chuckled delightedly and then turned and ran buck to her friends  hes snoring like a walrus she cried triumphantly  are you sure they are not groans asked arthur  pah cant i recognize a snore when i hear it and ill bet its the first sound sleep hes had in a month  mr merrick and arthur went to the door of the boys room to satisfy themselves that patsy was not mistaken and the regularity of the sounds quickly convinced them the girl was right so they had a merry party at luncheon calling patsy doctor with grave deference and telling her she had probably saved the life of a jones for a second time  and now proposed uncle john when the repast was over let us drive down to the sea and have a look at that beautiful launch that came in yesterday everyone is talking about it and they say it belongs to some foreign prince  so they motored to santa monica and spent the afternoon on the sands watching the bathers and admiring the graceful outlines of the big yacht lying at anchor a half mile from the shore the boat was something of a mystery to everybody it was named the arabella and had come from hawaii via san francisco but what it was doing here and who the owner might be were questions no one seemed able to answer rumor had it that a japanese prince had come in it to inspect the coast line but newspaper reporters were forbidden to scale the side and no satisfaction was given their eager questioning by the bluff old captain who commanded the craft so the girls snapped a few kodak pictures of the handsome yacht and then lost interest in it  that evening they met mrs montrose and the stanton girls at dinner and told them about the boy who still remained invisible uncle john had listened at his door again but the snores had ceased and a deathlike silence seemed to pervade the apartment this rendered them all a trifle uneasy and when they left the dining room arthur went to the hotel clerk and asked  have you seen mr jones this evening  no was the reply do you know him  very slightly  well hes the queerest guest weve ever had the first day he ate nothing at all this morning i hear he had a late breakfast wasnt around to lunch but a little while ago we sent a meal to his room that would surprise you  indeed  yes a strange order it was broiled mushrooms pancakes with maple syrup and ice cream how is that for a mixupand at dinner time too said the clerk disgustedly  arthur went back and reported  all right said patsy much relieved weve got him started and now he can take care of himself come uncle lets all go down town and see the picture that drove mr goldstein crazy  he was very decent to us today asserted flo stanton  did he ask any explanation about mauds appearing in the picture of a rival company inquired arthur  no not a word  did he mention mr jones who conquered him so mysteriously asked beth  not at all goldstein confined himself strictly to business but he treated us with unusual courtesy explained maud  they were curious to see the films of the rescue and the entire party rode to the downtown theatre where the corona picture was being run outside the entrance they found the audacious placard worded just as goldstein had reported and they all agreed it was a mean trick to claim another firms star as their own  i do not think the corona company is responsible for this announcement said uncle john it is probably an idea of the theatre proprietor who hoped to attract big business in that way  he has succeeded grumbled arthur as he took his place at the end of a long line of ticket buyers  the picture as it flashed on the screen positively thrilled them first was shown the crowd of merry bathers with patsy and maud standing in the water a little apart from the others then the boyfar out beyond the restthrew up his arms struggling desperately maud swam swiftly toward him patsy making for the shore the launching of the boat the race to rescue mauds effort to keep the drowning one afloat and the return to the shore where an excited crowd surrounded themall was clearly shown in the picture now they had the advantage of observing the expressions on the faces of the bathers when they discovered a tragedy was being enacted in their midst the photographs were so full of action that the participants now looked upon their adventure in a new light and regarded it far more seriously than before  the picture concluded with the scene where uncle john lifted the body into the automobile and dashed away with it to the hospital  maud stanton used as she was to seeing herself in motion pictures was even more impressed than the others when observing her own actions at a time when she was wholly unconscious that a cameraman had his lens focused upon her  its a great picture whispered flo as they made their way out of the crowded theatre why cant all our films be as natural and absorbing as this one  because said her sister in this case there is no acting the picture carries conviction with a force that no carefully rehearsed scene could ever accomplish  that is true agreed her aunt jane the nature scenes are the best after all  the most unsatisfactory pictures i have ever seen remarked uncle john were those of prominent men and foreign kings and the like who stop before the camera and bow as awkwardly as a camel they know they are posing and in spite of their public experience theyre as bashful as schoolboys or as arrogant as policemen according to their personal characteristics  did you notice the mob of children in that theatre asked patsy as they proceeded homeward i wish there were more pictures made that are suitable to their understandings  they enjoy anything in the way of a picture said arthur it isnt necessary to cater to children theyll go anyhow whatever is shown  that may be to an extent true said beth children are fascinated by any sort of motion pictures but a lot of them must be wholly incomprehensible to the child mind i agree with patsy that the little ones ought to have their own theatres and their own pictures  that will come in time prophesied aunt jane already the film makers are recognizing the value of the childrens patronage and are trying to find subjects that especially appeal to them  they reached the hotel soon after ten oclock and found ajo seated in the lobby he appeared much brighter and stronger than the day before and rose to greet patsy with a smile that had lost much of its former sad expression  congratulate me dr doyle said he im still alive andthanks to your prescriptiongoing as well as could be expected  im glad i did the right thing she replied but we were all a little worried for fear id make a mistake  i have just thrown away about a thousand of those foodtablets he informed her with an air of pride i am positive there is no substitute for real food whatever the specialists may say in fact he continued more soberly i believe you have rescued me a second time from certain death for now i have acquired a new hope and have made up my mind to get well  be careful not to overdo it cautioned uncle john you ordered a queer supper we hear  but it seemed to agree with me ive had a delightful sleepthe first sound sleep in a monthand already i feel like a new man i waited up to tell you this hoping you would be interested  we are exclaimed patsy who felt both pride and pleasure this evening we have been to see the motion picture of your rescue from drowning  oh how did you like it  its a splendid picture im not sure it will interest others as much as ourselves yet the people present seemed to like it  well it was their last chance to observe my desperate peril and my heroic rescue said the boy the picture will not be shown after tonight  why not they asked in surprise  i bought the thing this afternoon it didnt seem to me quite modest to exploit our little adventure in public  this was a new phase of the strange boys character and the girls did not know whether to approve it or not  it must have cost you something remarked flo the irrepressible besides how could you do it while you were asleep  why i wakened long enough to use the telephone he replied with a smile there are more wonderful inventions in the world than motion pictures you know  but you like motion pictures dont you asked maud wondering why he had suppressed the film in question  very much in fact i am more interested in them than in anything else not excepting the telephonewhich makes aladdins lamp look like a firefly in the sunshine  i suppose said flo staring into his face with curious interest that you will introduce motion pictures into your island of sangoa when you return  i suppose so he answered a little absently i had not considered that seriously as yet but my people would appreciate such a treat im sure  this speech seemed to destroy in a manner their shrewd conjecture that he was in america to purchase large quantities of films why then should goldstein have paid such abject deference to this unknown islander  in his own room after the party had separated for the night mr merrick remarked to arthur weldon as they sat smoking their cigars  young jones is evidently possessed of some means  so it seems replied arthur perhaps his father the scientific recluse had accumulated some money and the boy came to america to get rid of it he will be extravagant and wasteful for awhile and then go back to his island with the idea that he has seen the world  uncle john nodded  he is a rather cleancut young fellow said he and the chances are he wont become dissipated even though he loses his money through lack of worldly knowledge or business experience a boy brought up and educated on an island cant be expected to prove very shrewd and whatever the extent of his fortune it is liable to melt like snow in the sunshine  after all returned arthur this experience wont hurt him he will still have his island to return to  they smoked for a time in silence  has it ever occurred to you sir said arthur that the story jones has related to us meager though it is bears somewhat the stamp of a fairy tale  uncle john removed his cigar and looked reflectively at the ash  you mean that the boy is not what he seems  scarcely that sir he seems like a good boy in the main but his story issuch as one might invent if he were loath to tell the truth  uncle john struck a match and relit his cigar  i believe in a jones and i see no reason to doubt his story he asserted if real life was not full of romance and surprises the novelists would be unable to interest us in their books     chapter xi  a damsel in distress   the day had not started auspiciously for the stanton sisters soon after they arrived at the continental film companys plant maud had wrenched her ankle by stumbling over some loose planks which had been carelessly left on the openair stage and she was now lying upon a sofa in the managers room with her limb bandaged and soaked with liniment  flo was having troubles too a girl who had been selected by the producer to fall from an aeroplane in midair had sent word she was ill and could not work today and the producer had ordered flo to prepare for the part indignantly she sought the manager to file a protest and while she waited in the anteroom for an audience mr a jones of sangoa came in and greeted her with a bow and a smile  good gracious where did you come from she inquired  my hotel ive just driven over to see goldstein he replied  youll have to wait im afraid she warned him the manager is busy just now ive been wiggling on this bench half an hour and havent seen him yetand my business is very important  so is mine miss flo he rejoined looking at her with an odd expression then as a stenographer came hurrying from the inner room he stopped the girl and said  please take my card to mr goldstein  oh he wont see anybody now for hes busy talking with one of our producers youll have to call again she said flippantly but even as she spoke she glanced at the card started and turned red oh pardon me she added hastily and fled back to the managerial sanctum  thats funny muttered flo half to herself  yes he said laughing my cards are charged with electricity and theyre bound to galvanize anyone in this establishment come in miss flo he added as goldstein rushed out of his office to greet the boy effusively your business takes precedence to mine you know  the manager ushered them into his office a big room with a busy aspect at one end were two or three girls industriously thumping typewriters mcneil the producer was sorting manuscript on goldsteins own desk a young man who served as the managers private secretary was poring over a voluminous recordbook wherein were listed all the films ever made by the manufacturers of the world on a sofa in a far corner reclined the injured star of the company maud stanton whobeing half asleep at the momentdid not notice the entrance of her sister and young jones  sit down mr jones pray sit down exclaimed goldstein eagerly pointing to his own chair would you like me to clear the room so that our conversation may be private  not yet replied the boy refusing the seat of honor and taking a vacant chair miss stanton has precedence and i believe she wishes to speak with you  goldstein took his seat at the desk and cast an inquiring glance at flo  well he demanded impatiently  mr werner has ordered me to do the airship stunt for his picture because nance holden isnt here today began the girl  well why annoy me with such trifles werner knows what he wants and youll do as well as the holden girl  but i dont want to tumble out of that airship she protested  theres no danger life nets will be spread underneath the aeroplane said the manager the camera merely catches you as you are falling so the thing wont be more than twenty or thirty feet from the ground now run away and dont bother i must speak with mr jones  but im afraid mr goldstein pleaded the girl i dont want to go up in the aeroplane and these stunts are not in my line or what i was engaged to do  youll do what i tell you asserted the manager with marked irritation i wont stand for any rebellion among my actors and youll do as werner orders or youll forfeit your weeks pay  here maud half rose from her sofa to address her employer  please mr goldstein she said dont make flo do that fall there are plenty of other girls to take her place and she  silence miss stanton roared the manager youll disrupt all discipline if you interfere a nice time wed have here if we allowed our actors to choose their own parts i insist that your sister obey my producers orders  quite right goldstein remarked young jones in his quiet voice youve carried your point and maintained discipline i like that miss flo stanton will do exactly what you request her to do but youre going to change your mind and think better of her protest im almost sure goldstein from the expression of your face that you intend to issue prompt orders that another girl must take her place  goldstein looked at him steadily a moment and the arrogant expression changed to one of meek subservience  to be sure he muttered you have read my mind accurately mr jones here judd to his secretary find werner and tell him i dont approve his choice of flo stanton as a substitute for nance holden lets see tell him to put that moore girl in her place  the young fellow bowed and left the room mcneil smiled slyly to himself as he bent over his manuscript jones had gone to mauds side to inquire anxiously after her injury  i dont imagine it will amount to much she said reassuringly mr goldstein wants me to rest quietly until this afternoon when our new photoplay is to be produced im to do the leading part you know and he thinks ill be able by that time to get through all right  goldstein overheard this and came toward them rubbing his hands together nervously  that seems unwise miss maud objected jones to use your foot so soon might make it much worse let us postpone the play until some other time  goldsteins face was a study his body twitched spasmodically  oh mr jones he exclaimed thats impossible it wouldnt do at all weve been rehearsing this play and preparing for its production for the last two weeks and today all our actors and assistants are here and ready to make the picture ive already postponed it four hoursuntil this afternoonto favor miss stanton but really  never mind the details interrupted the boy i do not consider miss stanton able to do her work today send her back to her hotel at once and order the play postponed until she is able to attend  goldstein was greatly disturbed by this order issued quietly but in a tone of command that brooked no opposition again he glanced shrewdly at the young man and in the managers face astonishment and fear were intermingled  sir he said in repressed tones for he was really angry and had been accustomed to wield the power of an autocrat in this establishment you are placing me in an embarrassing position i am expected to make every day count so that the continental may pay a liberal profit to its owners to follow your instructions would burden us with an enormous expense quite useless i assure you and  very well incur the expense goldstein  all right mr jones excuse me a moment while i issue instructions for the postponement  mcneil rose and faced the manager  are you really going to postpone this important play he demanded in a voice of wonder  goldstein was glad to vent his chagrin on the producer  no insolence sir he roared come with me and as he dragged mcneil to the door and paused there if you dare lisp a word of what youve overheard ill fire you like a shot  when they had left the room maud said with a puzzled air  i cant understand your power over goldstein mr jones he is a dictatoralmost a tyrantand in this place his word is law at least it was until you came andand  dont try to understand it miss stanton he answered in a careless manner do you think you can manage to crawl to the automobile or shall we carry you  ill bet goldstein has murdered someone and mr jones knows all about it exclaimed flo who had been an interested witness of the scene  maud stood up with her sisters support and tested her lame ankle  it still hurts a little she said but i can manage to hobble on it  get your sisters wraps the boy said to flo and well send her straight home  i expect goldstein will dock my salary as well as fine flo remarked maud musingly as she waited for her hat and coat he obeyed you very meekly mr jones but i could see a wicked glitter in his eye nevertheless  i am sure the manager will neither dock nor fine either of you he replied reassuringly on the contrary you might sue the company for damages for leaving that lumber where you would fall over it  oh no she returned laughing at the idea we have signed contracts waiving any damages for injuries sustained while at work on the premises we all have to do that you know because the business is hazardous at its best on the other hand mr goldstein has a physician and surgeon always within call in case of accident and the service is quite free to all the employees  he nodded  i know but the fact that you signed such a contract under compulsion would not prevent the court from awarding damages if you sustained them while on duty  this hurt is nothing of importance she said hastily in a day or two i shall be able to walk as well as ever  flo came running back with mauds things aunt jane followed saying that if maud was to go to the hotel she would accompany her and take care of her  ive examined the ankle she said to young jones and i assure you it is not a severe strain but it is true that she will be better off in her own room where she can rest quietly so i will go with her  how about miss flo asked the boy  flo is very selfreliant and will get along today very nicely without me replied mrs montrose  mr goldstein entered frowning and still resenting the interference of this mr a jones of sangoa but he ventured no further protest nor did he speak until maud flo and aunt jane had all left the room  youre not going mr jones he asked  only to see miss stanton started for home then ill come back and have a little talk with you  thank you sir     chapter xii  pictures girls and nonsense   well aunt jane said maud stanton when their car was rolling toward the hotel and the girl had related the remarkable interview in the office what do you think of ajo now  he is certainly an amazing young man was the reply i cannot in any way figure out his connection with goldstein or his power over the man the continental film manufacturing company is a great corporation with headquarters in new york and mr goldstein is the authorized head and manager of the concern on the pacific coast i understand his salary is ten thousand a year on the other hand young jones has only been in this country for a year coming from an insignificant island somewhere in the south seas where he was born and reared much of the time since he arrived in america he has been an invalid aside from this meager information no one seems to know anything about him  putting the case that way makes it all the more remarkable observed maud a big experienced important man cowed by a mere boy when goldstein first met this callow sallow youth he trembled before him when the boy enters the office of the great film company he dictates to the manager who meekly obeys him remember too that a jones by his interference has caused a direct loss to the company which goldstein will have to explain as best he may in his weekly report to the new york office a more astonishing state of affairs could not be imagined aunt jane  the puzzle will solve itself presently said the lady abnormal conditions seldom last long  maud passed the day in bed quietly reading a book her injury was really slight and with rest it mended rapidly patsy and beth came in to see her and in the conversation that ensued the girls were told of the latest mystery surrounding a jones  it is surely queer admitted miss doyle impressed and thoughtful uncle john and arthur were saying this noon at lunch that ajo was a helpless sort of individual and easily influenced by othersas witness his caving in to me when i opposed his doctors treatment arthur thinks he has come to this country to squander what little money his father left him and that his public career outside the limits of his little island will be brief yet according to your story the boy is no weakling but has power and knows how to use it  he surely laid down the law to goldstein said maud  he is very young remarked beth ignoring the fact that she was herself no older and perhaps that is why we attach so much importance to his actions a grownup man is seldom astonishing however eccentric he may prove to be in a boy we expect only boyishness and young jones has interested us because he is unique  after a little the conversation drifted to motion pictures for both patsy and beth were eager to learn all about the business details of film making which maud by reason of her months of experience was able to explain to them in a comprehensive manner flo came home toward evening but had little more to tell them as the day had passed very quietly at the studio jones had remained closeted with the manager for a full hour and it was remarked that after he had gone away goldstein was somewhat subdued and performed his duties less aggressively than usual  mauds visitors now left her to dress for dinner at which meal she was able to rejoin them walking with a slight limp but otherwise recovered from her accident to their surprise young jones appeared as they were entering the dining room and begged for a seat at their table uncle john at once ordered another place laid at the big round table which accommodated the company of nine very nicely  ajo sat between patsy and maud and although he selected his dishes with some care he partook of all the courses from soup to dessert  the morning interview with goldstein was not mentioned ajo inquired about mauds hurt but then changed the subject and conversed upon nearly everything but motion pictures however after they had repaired to the hotel lobby and were seated together in a cosy informal group patsy broached a project very near to her heart  beth and i said she have decided to build a childrens picture theatre  where asked uncle john rather startled by the proposition  here or in los angeles was the reply  you see explained beth there is a crying need for a place where children may go and see pictures that appeal especially to them and are at the same time quite proper for them to witness a great educational field is to be opened by this venture and patsy and i would enjoy the work of creating the first picture theatre exclusively for children ever established in america  you may say in the world added arthur i like this idea of yours girls and i hope you will carry it out  oh theyll carry it out all right remarked uncle john ive been expecting something of this sort ever since we came here my girls mr jones he said turning to the young man are always doing some quaint thing or indulging in some queer enterprise for theyre a restless lot before louise married she was usually in these skirmishes with fate but now  oh i shall join patsy and beth of course asserted louise it will make it easier for all to divide the expense between us and i am as much interested in pictures as they are  perhaps said patsy musingly we might build two theatres in different parts of the city there are so many children to be amused and we intend to make the admission price five cents  have you any idea what it costs to build one of these picture theatres asked arthur  were not going to build one of these theatres retorted patsy many of the dens ive been in cost scarcely anything being mere shelters the city is strewn with a lot of miserable stuffy theatres that no one can enjoy sitting in even to see a good picture we have talked this over and decided to erect a new style of building roomy and sanitary with cushioned seats and plenty of broad aisles there are one or two of this class already in los angeles but we want to make our childrens theatres a little better than the best  and the expense  well it will cost money of course but it will be a great delight to the childrenbless their little hearts  this is really a business enterprise added beth gravely  uncle john chuckled with amusement  have you figured out the profits he inquired  it really ought to pay uncle declared patsy somewhat nettled by this flaccid reception of her pet scheme all the children will insist on being taken to a place like that for we shall show just the pictures they love to see and allowing there is no money to be made from the venture think of the joy we shall give to innumerable little ones  go ahead my dears said uncle john smiling approval and if you girls find you havent enough money to carry out your plans come to me  oh thank you uncle exclaimed beth but i feel sure we can manage the cost ourselves we will build one of the theatres first and if that is a success we will build others  but about those films made especially for children remarked arthur where will you get them  why there are lots of firms making films replied patsy we can select from all that are made the ones most suitable for our purpose  i fear you cannot do that said mrs montrose who had listened with wonder to this conversation there are three combinations or trusts among the film makers which are known as the licensed the mutual and the independents if you purchase from one of these trusts you cannot get films from the others for that is their edict therefore you will have only about onethird of the films made to select from  i thought money would buy anythingin the way of merchandise said louise half laughing and half indignant  not from these film dictators was the reply  they all make a few childrens pictures announced maud stanton even the continental turns out one occasionally but there are not nearly enough taken all together to supply an exclusive childrens theatre  then we will have some made declared patsy we will order some fairy tales such as the children like they would be splendid in motion pictures  some have already been made and exhibited said mrs montrose the various manufacturers have made films of the fairy tales of hans andersen frank baum lewis carroll and other wellknown writers  and were they successful  quite so i believe but such films are seldom put out except at holiday time  i think beth said patsy to her cousin in a businesslike tone that we must organize a company and make our own films then we can get exactly what we want  oh yes replied beth delighted with the suggestion and let us get maud and flo to act in our pictures wont it be exciting  pardon me young ladies said a jones speaking for the first time since this subject had been broached would it not be wise to consider the expense of making films before you undertake it  patsy looked at him inquiringly  do you know what the things cost she asked  ive some idea said he feature films of fairy tales such as you propose cost at least two thousand dollars each to produce you would need about three for each performance and you will have to change your programmes at least once a week that would mean an outlay of not less than six thousand dollars a week which is doubtless more money than your fivecent theatre could take in  this argument staggered the girls for a moment then beth asked how do the ordinary theatres manage  the ordinary theatre simply rents its pictures paying about three hundred dollars a week for the service there is a middleman called the exchange whose business is to buy the films from the makers and rent them to the theatres he pays a big price for a film but is able to rent it to dozens of theatres by turns and by this method he not only gets back the money he has expended but makes a liberal profit  well said patsy not to be baffled we could sell several copies of our films to these middlemen and so reduce the expense of making them for our use  the middleman wont buy them asserted jones he is the thrall of one or the other of the trusts and buys only trust pictures  i see said uncle john catching the idea its a scheme to destroy competition  exactly replied young jones  what does the continental do maud asked patsy  i dont know answered the girl but perhaps aunt jane can tell you  i believe the continental is a sort of trust within itself explained mrs montrose since we have been connected with the company i have learned more or less of its methods it employs a dozen or so producing companies and makes three or four pictures every week the concern has its own exchange or middleman who rents only continental films to the theatres that patronize him  well we might do the same thing proposed patsy who was loath to abandon her plan  you might if you have the capital assented mrs montrose the continental is an immense corporation and i am told it has more than a million dollars invested  two millions said a jones  the girls were silent a while seriously considering this startling assertion they had between them considerable money but they realized they could not enter a field that required such an enormous investment as film making  i suppose said beth regretfully we shall have to give up making films  then where are we to get the proper pictures for our theatre demanded patsy  it is quite evident we cant get them said louise therefore we may be obliged to abandon the theatre proposition  another silence still more grave uncle john was discreet enough to say nothing the stantons and mrs montrose felt it was not their affair arthur weldon was slyly enjoying the chagrin visible upon the faces of mr merricks three pretty nieces  as for a jones he was industriously figuring upon the back of an envelope with a stubby bit of pencil     chapter xiii  a foolish boy   it was the youthful sangoan who first broke the silence glancing at the figures he had made he said  it is estimated that if twenty picture theatres use any one filmcopies of it of coursethat film will pay for its cost of making therefore if you build twenty childrens theatres instead of the one or two you originally proposed you would be able to manufacture your own films and they would be no expense to you  they gazed at him in bewilderment  that is all simple enough laughed arthur twenty picture theatres at twenty thousand dollars eacha low estimate my dears for such as you requirewould mean an investment of four hundred thousand dollars a film factory with several producing companies to keep it busy and all the necessary paraphernalia of costumes and properties would mean a million or so more say a million and a half all told why its a mere bagatelle  arthur severely from louise  i advise you girls to economize in other ways and devote your resources to this business which might pay youand might not he continued oblivious to stony glares  really mr jones said beth pouting we were not joking but in real earnest  have i questioned it miss de graf  mr jones was merely trying to show you howererhow impractical your idea was explained uncle john mildly  no i am in earnest too said the boy to prove it i will agree to establish a plant and make the pictures if the young ladies will build the twenty theatres to show them in  here was another suggestion of a bewildering nature extravagant as the offer seemed the boy was very serious he blushed a little as he observed mr merrick eyeing him earnestly and continued in an embarrassed halting way ii assure you sir that i am able to fulfill my part of the agreement also i would like to do it it would serve to interest me and keep me occupied in ways that are not wholly selfish mymy other business does not demand my personal attention you see  to hear this weak sickly youth speak of investing a million dollars in a doubtful enterprise in spite of the fact that he lived on a faraway island and was a practical stranger in america set them all to speculating anew in regard to his history and condition in life seeing that the boy had himself made an opening for a logical query uncle john asked  do you mind telling us what this other business is to which you refer  a jones moved uneasily in his chair then he glanced quickly around the circle and found every eye regarding him with eager curiosity he blushed again a deep red this time but an instant later straightened up and spoke in a tone of sudden resolve  most people dislike to speak of themselves he said and i am no exception but you who have kindly received me as a friend after having generously saved me from an untimely death have surely the right to know something about meif indeed the subject interests you  it is but natural that we should feel an interest in you mr jones replied mr merrick yet i assure you we have no desire to pry into your personal affairs you have already volunteered a general statement of your antecedents and the object of your visit to america and that i assure you will suffice us pardon me for asking an impertinent question  the boy seemed perplexed now  i did not consider it impertinent sir i made a business proposal to your nieces he said and before they could accept such a proposal they would be entitled to know something of my financial standing  for a green inexperienced youth he spoke with rare acumen thought mr merrick but the old gentleman had now determined to shield the boy from a forced declaration of his finances so he said  my nieces can hardly afford to accept your proposition they are really able to build one or two theatres without inconveniencing themselves but twenty would be beyond their means you of course understand they were not seeking an investment but trying with all their hearts to benefit the children i thoroughly approve their original idea but if it requires twenty picture theatres to render it practical they will abandon the notion at once  jones nodded absently his eyes half closed in thought after a brief pause he replied  i hate to see this idea abandoned at the very moment of its birth its a good idea and in no way impractical in my opinion so permit me to make another proposition i will build the twenty theatres myself and furnish the films for them provided the young ladies will agree to assume the entire management of them when they are completed  dead silence followed this speech the girls did some rapidfire mental calculations and realized that this young man was proposing to invest something like fourteen hundred thousand dollars in order that they might carry out their philanthropic conception why should he do this even if he could afford it  both mr merrick and arthur weldon were staring stolidly at the floor their attitudes expressed for the first time doubtif not positive unbelief as men of considerable financial experience they regarded the young islanders proposition as an impossible one  jones noted this blank reception of his offer and glanced appealingly at patsy it was an uncomfortable moment for the girl and to avoid meeting his eyes she looked away across the lobby a few paces distant stood a man who leaned against a table and held a newspaper before his face patsy knew however that he was not reading a pair of dark glistening eyes peered over the top of the paper and were steadfastly fixed upon the unconscious features of young jones  something in the attitude of the stranger whom she had never seen before something in the rigid pose the intent gazeindicating both alertness and repressionriveted the girls attention at once and gave her a distinct shock of uneasiness  i wish said the boy in his quiet firm way yet with much deference in his manner and tone that you young ladies would consider my offer seriously and take proper time to reach a decision i am absolutely in earnest i want to join you in your attempt to give pleasure to children and i am willing andand ableto furnish the funds required without your cooperation however i could do nothing and my health is such that i wish to leave the management of the theatres entirely in your hands as well as all the details of their construction  we will consider it of course mr jones answered beth gravely we are a little startled just now as you see but when we grow accustomed to the immensity of the schemeour baby which you have transformed into a giantwe shall be able to consider it calmly and critically and decide if we are competent to undertake the management of so many theatres  thank you then i think i will excuse myself for this evening and return to my room im improving famously under dr doyles instructions but am not yet a rugged example of health  patsy took his hand at parting as did the others but her attention was divided between ajo and the strange man who had never for a moment ceased watching him not once did the dark eyes waver but followed each motion of the boy as he sauntered to the desk got his key from the clerk and then proceeded to his room turning up one of the corridors on the main floor  the stranger now laid his newspaper on the table and disclosed his entire face for the first time a middleaged man he seemed to be with irongray hair and a smoothly shaven rather handsome face from his dress he appeared to be a prosperous business man and it was evident that he was a guest of the hotel for he wandered through the lobbyin which many other guests were grouped some chatting and others playing bridgeand presently disappeared down the corridor traversed by young jones  patsy drew a deep breath but said nothing to the others who when relieved of the boys presence began to discuss volubly his singular proposal  the fellow is crazy commented arthur twenty picture theatres with a film factory to supply them is a big order even for a multimillionaireand i cant imagine this boy coming under that head  he seemed in earnest said maud musingly what do you think aunt jane  i am greatly perplexed admitted mrs montrose had i not known of the conquest of goldstein by this boy who issued orders which the manager of the continental meekly obeyed i would have laughed at his proposition as it is im afraid to state that he wont carry out his plan to the letter of the agreement  would it not be a rash investment maam inquired uncle john  frankly i do not know while all the film makers evade any attempt to discover how prosperousfinanciallythey are we know that without exception they have grown very wealthy i am wondering if this young jones is not one of the owners of the continentala large stockholder perhaps if so that not only accounts for his influence with goldstein but it proves him able to finance this remarkable enterprise he doubtless knows what he is undertaking for his figures while not accurate were logical  of course cried patsy that explains everything  still said uncle john cautiously this is merely surmise on our part and before accepting it we must reconcile it with the incongruities in the case it is possible that the elder jones owned an interest in the continental and bequeathed it to his son but is it probable remember he was an islander and a recluse  more likely said beth ajos father left him a great fortune which the boy invested in the continental stock  i have been told remarked aunt jane thoughtfully that continental stock cannot be bought at any price it pays such enormous dividends that no owner will dispose of it  the whole thing is perplexing in the extreme declared arthur the boy tells a story that at first seems frank and straightforward yet his statements do not dovetail so to speak  i think he is holding something back said beth something that would explain all the discrepancies in his story you were wrong uncle john not to let him speak when he offered to tell you all  there was something in his manner that made me revolt from forcing his confidence was the reply  there was something in his manner that made me think he was about to concoct a story that would satisfy our curiosity said louise with a shrug  uncle john looked around the circle of faces  you are not questioning the young fellows sincerity i hope said he  i dont for a single second asserted patsy stoutly he may have a queer history and he may not have told us all of it but ajo is honest ill vouch for him  so will i my dear said uncle john  that is more than i can do just at present arthur frankly stated my opinion is that his preposterous offer is mere bluff if you accepted it you would find him unable to do his part  then what is his object asked maud  i cant figure it out as yet he might pose as a millionaire and a generous friend and philanthropist for some time before the truth was discovered and during that time he could carry out any secret plans he had in mind the boy is more shrewd than he appears to be we by chance saved his life and at once he attached himself to us like a barnacle and we cant shake him off  we dont want to said patsy  my explanation is that he has fallen in love with one of us girls suggested flo with a mischievous glance at her sister i wonder if its me  it is more likely said louise that he has discovered uncle john to be a veryprosperousman  nonsense my dear exclaimed that gentleman evidently irritated by the insinuation dont pick the boy to pieces give him a chance so far he has asked nothing from us but offers everything hes a grateful fellow and is anxious to help you girls carry out your ambitious plans that is how i read him and i think it is absurd to prejudge him in the way you are doing  the party broke up the stantons and weldons going to their rooms beth also rose  are you coming to bed patsy she inquired  not just now her cousin replied between us weve rubbed uncle johns fur the wrong way and he wont get composed until he has smoked his goodnight cigar ill sit with him in this corner and keep him company  so the little man and his favorite niece were left together and he did not seem in the least ruffled as he lit his cigar and settled down in a big chair with patsy beside him to enjoy it     chapter xiv  isidore le drieux   perhaps the cigar was half gone when patsy gave a sudden start and squeezed uncle johns hand which she had been holding in both her own  what is it my dear  the man i told you of there he is just across the lobby the man with the gray clothes and gray hair  oh yes the one lighting a cigar  precisely  uncle john gazed across the lobby reflectively the strangers eyes roved carelessly around the big room and then he moved with deliberate steps toward their corner he passed several vacant chairs and settees on his way and finally paused before a loungingchair not six feet distant from the one occupied by mr merrick  pardon me is this seat engaged sir he asked  no replied uncle john not very graciously for it was a deliberate intrusion  the stranger sat down and for a time smoked his cigar in silence he was so near them that patsy forbore any conversation knowing he would overhear it  suddenly the man turned squarely in their direction and addressed them  i hope you will pardon me mr merrick if i venture to ask a question said he  well sir  i saw you talking with mr jones this eveninga jones you know who says he came from sangoa  didnt he demanded the old gentleman  the stranger smiled  perhaps once on a time allowing such a place exists but his last journey was here from austria  indeed  mr merrick and patsy were both staring at the man incredulously  i am quite sure of that statement sir but i cannot prove it as yet  ah i thought not  patsy had just told her uncle how she had detected this man stealthily watching jones and how he had followed the boy when he retired to his room the present interview had they both knew something to do with this singular action therefore mr merrick restrained his indignation at the strangers pointed questioning he realized quite well that the man had come to their corner determined to catechise them and gain what information he could patsy realized this too so being forewarned they hoped to learn his object without granting him the satisfaction of pumping them  i suppose you are friends of this mr a jones was his next remark  we are acquaintances said mr merrick  has he ever mentioned his adventures in austria to you  are you a friend of mr jones demanded uncle john  i am not even an acquaintance said the man smiling but i am interested in him through a friend of mine who met him abroad permit me to introduce myself sir  he handed them a card which read        isadore le drieux importer of pearls and precious stones         36 maiden lane         new york city  i have connections abroad in nearly all countries continued the man and it is through some of them that i have knowledge of this young fellow who has taken the name of a jones in fact i have a portrait of the lad taken in paris which i will show you  he searched in his pocket and produced an envelope from which he carefully removed a photograph which he handed to uncle john patsy examined it too with a start of surprise the thin features the large serious eyes even the closely set lips were indeed those of a jones but in the picture he wore a small mustache  it cant be our a jones murmured patsy this one is older  that is on account of the mustache remarked le drieux who was closely watching their faces this portrait was taken more than a year ago  oh but he was in sangoa then protested patsy who was really bewildered by the striking resemblance  the stranger smiled indulgently  as a matter of fact there is no sangoa said he so we may doubt the young mans assertion that he was ever there  why are you interested in him inquired mr merrick  a natural question said le drieux after a moment of hesitation i know you well by reputation mr merrick and believe i am justified in speaking frankly to you and your niece provided you regard my statements as strictly confidential a year ago i received notice from my friend in austria that the young man had gone to america and he was anxious i should meet him at the time i was too busy with my own affairs to look him up but i recently came to california for a rest and noticed the strong resemblance between the boy a jones and the portrait sent me so i hunted up this picture and compared the two in my judgment they are one and the same what do you think sir  i believe there is a resemblance answered uncle john turning the card over but here is a name on the back of the photograph jack andrews  yes this is jack andrews said le drieux nodding have you ever heard the name before  never  well andrews is noted throughout europe and it is but natural he should desire to escape his notoriety by assuming another name out here do you note the similarity of the initials ja stand for jack andrews reverse them and aj stand for a jones by the way what does he claim the a means is it andrew  it means nothing at all said patsy he told us so  i see you caught him unprepared that isnt like jack he is always on guard  both patsy and uncle john were by this time sorely perplexed they had a feeling common to both of them that the subject of this portrait and a jones were two separate and distinct persons yet the resemblance could not be denied if they were indeed the same young jones had deliberately lied to them and recalling his various statements and the manner in which they had been made they promptly acquitted the boy of the charge of falsehood  for what was jack andrews noted throughout europe inquired mr merrick after silently considering these things  well he was a highflier for one thing answered le drieux he was known as a thorough sport and i am told a clever gambler he had a faculty of making friends even among the nobility the gilded youth of london paris and vienna cultivated his acquaintance and through them he managed to get into very good society he was a guest at the splendid villa of countess ahmberg near vienna when her magnificent collection of pearls disappeared you remember that loss and the excitement it caused do you not  no sir i have never before heard of the countess of ahmberg or her pearls  well the story filled the newspapers for a couple of weeks the collection embraced the rarest and most valuable pearls known to exist  and you accuse this man andrews of stealing them asked uncle john tapping with his finger the portrait he still held  by no means sir by no means cried le drieux hastily in fact he was one of the few guests at the villa to whom no suspicion attached from the moment the casket of pearls was last seen by the countess until their loss was discovered every moment of andrews time was accounted for his alibi was perfect and he was quite prominent in the unsuccessful quest of the thief  the pearls were not recovered then  no the whole affair is still a mystery my friend in vienna a pearl merchant like myself assisted andrews in his endeavor to discover the thief and being much impressed by the young mans personality sent me this photograph asking me to meet him as i have told you when he reached america  is his home in this country  new york knows him but knows nothing of his family or his history he is popular there spending money freely and bearing the reputation of an allaround good fellow on his arrival there a year ago he led a gay life for a few days and then suddenly disappeared no one knew what had become of him when i found him here under the name of a jones the disappearance was solved  i think said uncle john you are laboring under a serious if somewhat natural mistake the subject of this picture is like a jones indeed but he is older and his expression moremore  blase and sophisticated said patsy  thank you my dear i am no dictionary and if those are real words they may convey my meaning i feel quite sure mr le drieux that the story of andrews can not be the story of young jones  le drieux took the picture and replaced it in his pocket  to err is human said he and i will admit the possibility of my being mistaken in my man but you will admit the resemblance  yes they might be brothers but young jones has said he has no brothers and i believe him  le drieux sat in silence for a few minutes then he said  i appealed to you mr merrick because i was not thoroughly satisfied in my own mind of my conclusions you have added to my doubts i must confess yet i cannot abandon the idea that the two men are one and the same as my suspicion is only shared by you and your niece in confidence i shall devote myself for a few days to studying young jones and observing his actions in that way i may get a clue that will set all doubt at rest  we will introduce you to him said patsy and then you may question him as much as you like  oh no i prefer not to make his acquaintance until i am quite sure was the reply if he is not jack andrews he would be likely to resent the insinuation that he is here trading under a false name good night mr merrick good night miss doyle i thank you for your courteous consideration  he had risen and now bowed and walked away  well said patsy what was he after and did he learn anything from us  he did most of the talking himself replied uncle john looking after le drieux with a puzzled expression of course he is not a jewel merchant  no said patsy hes a detective and ill bet a toothpick to a match that hes on the wrong scent  he surely is unfortunately we cannot warn ajo against him  it isnt necessary uncle why the whole thing is absurd our boy is not a gambler or roysterer nor do i think he has ever been in europe mr le drieux will have to guess again     chapter xv  a few pearls   the next morning patsy beth and louise met in earnest conference over the important proposition made them by young jones and although uncle john and arthur weldon were both present the men took no part in the discussion  some doubt has been expressed said beth judicially that ajo is really able to finance this big venture but he says he is and that he will carry it through to the end so i propose we let him do it  why not asked louise if he succeeds it will be glorious if he fails we will suffer in no way except through disappointment  well shall we accept this offer girls  first said louise let us consider what we will have to do on our part when the twenty theatres are built and the film factory is in operation  we are to be the general managers returned patsy we must select the subjects or plots for the pictures and order them made under our direction then we must see that all of our theatres present them in a proper manner and we must invite children to come and see the shows i guess thats all  that will be enough to keep us busy im sure said beth but we will gladly undertake it and i am sure we shall prove good managers as soon as we get acquainted with the details of the business  it will give us the sort of employment we like patsy assured them our first duty will be to plan these theatres for children and make them as cosy and comfortable as possible regardless of expense ajo will pay the bills and when all the buildings are ready we will set to work in earnest  so when a jones appeared he was told that the girls would gladly accept his proposition the young man seemed greatly pleased by this verdict he appeared to be much better and stronger today and he entered eagerly into a discussion of the plans in detail together they made a list of a string of twenty theatres to be built in towns reaching from santa barbara on the north to san diego in the south the film factory was to be located in the san fernando valley just north of hollywood  this consumed the entire forenoon and after lunch they met a prominent real estate man whom jones had summoned to the hotel this gentleman was given a copy of the list of locations and instructed to purchase in each town the best site that could be secured for a motion picture theatre this big order made the real estate man open his eyes in surprise  do you wish me to secure options or to purchase the land outright he asked  be sure of your locations and then close the deals at once replied jones we do not wish to waste time in useless dickering and a location in the heart of each town perhaps on the main street is more important than the price you will of course protect me from robbery to the best of your ability but buy even if the price is exorbitant i will this afternoon place a hundred thousand dollars to your credit in the bank with which to make advance payments and when you notify me how much more is required i will forward my checks at once  that is satisfactory sir i will do the best i can to guard your interests said the man  when he had gone the girls accompanied ajo in a motorcar to los angeles to consult an architect they visited several offices before the boy who seemed to estimate men at a glance found one that satisfied him the girls explained with care to the architect their idea of a luxurious picture theatre for children and when he had grasped their conception which he did with enthusiasm he suggested several improvements on their immature plans and promised to have complete drawings ready to submit to them in a few days  from the architects office they drove to the germanamerican bank where ajo gave his check for a hundred thousand dollars to be placed to the credit of mr wilcox the real estate agent the deference shown him by the cashier seemed to indicate that this big check was not the extent of a jones credit there by any means  as they drove back to hollywood patsy could not help eyeing this youthful capitalist with wonder during this day of exciting business deals the boy had behaved admirably and there was no longer a shadow of doubt in the minds of any of uncle johns nieces that he was both able and anxious to carry out his part of the agreement  patsy almost giggled outright as she thought of le drieux and his ridiculous suspicions one would have to steal a good many pearls in order to acquire a fortune to match that of the sangoan  he was speaking of sangoa now in answer to a question of beths  yes indeed said he sangoa is very beautiful and the climate is even more mild than that of your southern california the north coast is a high bluff on which is a splendid forest of rosewood and mahogany my father would never allow any of these magnificent trees to be cut except a few that were used in building our house  but how do your people live what is the principal industry of your islanders asked beth  my people arefishermen he said and then the automobile drew up before the hotel entrance and the conversation ended  it was on the following afternoon as they all met in the hotel lobby after lunch that a messenger handed young jones a neat parcel for which a receipt was demanded ajo held the parcel in his hand a while listening to the chatter of the girls who were earnestly discussing plans for the new picture enterprise then very quietly and unobtrusively he unwrapped the package and laid upon the table beside him several small boxes bearing the name of a prominent jeweler  i hope said he taking advantage of a pause caused by the girls observing this action and growing visibly confused by their involuntary stares of curiosity ii hope that you my new friends will pardon a liberty i have taken i wanted toto present those who were instrumental in saving my life withwith aa slight token of my gratitudea sort ofofmemento of a brave and generous act that gave me back the life i had carelessly jeopardized no as he saw surprise and protest written on their faces dont refuse me this pleasure i implore you the littleehehmementos are from my own island of sangoa with the necessary mountings by a los angeles jeweler andplease accept them  as he spoke he handed to each of the girls a box afterward giving one to uncle john and another to arthur there remained upon the table three others he penciled a name upon the bottom of each and then handed them to patsy saying  will you kindly present these with my compliments to the misses stanton and to their aunt when they return this evening thank you  and then before they could recover from their astonishment he turned abruptly and fled to his room  the girls stared at one another a moment and then began laughing arthur seemed crestfallen while uncle john handled his small box as gingerly as if he suspected it contained an explosive  how ridiculous cried patsy her blue eyes dancing and did you notice how scared poor ajo was and how he skipped as fearfully as though he had committed some crime but im sure the poor boy meant well lets open our boxes girls and see what foolishness ajo has been up to  slipping off the cover of her box beth uttered a low cry of amazement and admiration then she held up a dainty lavalliere with a pendant containing a superb pearl louise had the mate to this but the one patsy found had a pearl of immense size its color being an exquisite shade of pink such as is rarely seen arthur displayed a ring set with a splendid white pearl while uncle johns box contained a stick pin set with a huge black pearl of remarkable luster indeed they saw at a glance that the size and beauty of all these pearls were very uncommon and while the others expressed their enthusiastic delight the faces of mr merrick and patsy doyle were solemn and perplexed they stared at the pearls with feelings of dismay rather than joy and chancing to meet one anothers eyes they quickly dropped their gaze to avoid exchanging the ugly suspicion that had forced itself upon their minds  with a sudden thought patsy raised her head to cast a searching glance around the lobby for although their party was seated in an alcove they were visible to all in the big room of which it formed a part yes mr isidore le drieux was standing near them as she had feared and the slight sneer upon his lips proved that he had observed the transfer of the pearls  so the girl promptly clasped her lavalliere around her neck and openly displayed it as a proud defiance if not a direct challenge to that detestable sneer  arthur admiring his ring in spite of his chagrin at receiving such a gift from a comparative stranger placed the token on his finger  it is a beauty indeed said he but i dont think we ought to accept such valuable gifts from this boy  i do not see why returned his wife louise i think these pretty tributes for saving mr jones life are very appropriate of course neither beth nor i had anything to do with that affair but we are included in the distribution because it would be more embarrassing to leave us out of it  and the pearls came from sangoa added beth so all these precious gifts have cost ajo nothing except for their settings  if sangoa can furnish many such pearls as these remarked arthur reflectively the island ought to be famous instead of unknown their size and beauty render the gems priceless  well said patsy soberly we know now where a jones got his money which is so plentiful that he can build any number of film factories and picture theatres sangoa must have wonderful pearl fisheriesdont you remember girls that he told us his people were fishermenfor each of these specimens is worth a small fortune mine especially is the largest and finest pearl i have ever seen  i beg your pardon sternly exclaimed uncle john as he whirled swiftly around can i do anything for you sir  for mr le drieux had stealthily advanced to the alcove and was glaring at the display of pearls and making notes in a small book  he bowed without apparent resentment as he answered mr merrick thank you sir you have already served me admirably pardon my intrusion  then he closed the book slipped it into his pocket and with another low bow walked away  what rank impertinence cried arthur staring after him some newspaper reporter i suppose do you know him uncle john  he forced an introduction a few evenings ago it is a pearl merchant from new york named le drieux so i suppose his curiosity is but natural  shall we keep our pearls uncle asked beth  i shall keep mine replied the little man who never wore any ornament of jewelry it was generous and thoughtful in young jones to present these things and we ought not offend him by refusing his mementos as he calls them  perhaps all the nieces were relieved to hear this verdict for already they loved their beautiful gifts that evening the stanton girls and their aunt jane received their parcels being fully as much surprised as the others had been and their boxes also contained pearls flo and maud had lavallieres the latter receiving one as large and beautiful as that of patsy doyle while mrs montrose found a brooch set with numerous smaller pearls  patsy urged them all to wear the ornaments to dinner that evening which they did and although jones was not there to observe the effect of the splendid pearls mr le drieux was at his place in the dining room and made more notes in his little book  that was exactly what patsy wanted i cant stand the suspense of this thing she whispered to uncle john and if that man wants any information about these pearls i propose we give it to him in that way he will soon discover he is wrong in suspecting the identity of jack andrews and a jones  mr merrick nodded absently and went to his corner for a smoke arthur soon after joined him while aunt jane took her bevy of girls to another part of the loge  le drieux will be here presently said uncle john to young weldon  oh the fellow with the book why sir  hes a detective i think anyhow he is shadowing jones whom he suspects is a thief  he then told arthur frankly of his former conversation with le drieux and of the puzzling photograph  it really resembles the boy he admitted with a frown of perplexity yet at the same time i realized the whole thing was absurd neither patsy nor i can believe that jones is the man who robbed an austrian countess its preposterous and let me say right now arthur that im going to stand by this young fellow with all my influence in case those hounds try to make him trouble  arthur did not reply at once he puffed his cigar silently while he revolved the startling accusation in his mind  both you and patsy are staunch friends he observed after a while and i have noticed that your intuition as regards character is seldom at fault but i advise you in this instance not to be hasty for  i know you are going to refer to those pearls  naturally if i dont le drieux will as you have yourself prophesied pearlsespecially such pearls as theseare rare and easy to recognize the world does not contain many blackpearls for instance such as that you are wearing an experta man with a photograph that strongly resembles young jonesis tracing some stolen pearls of great valuea collection i think you said we find jones a man seemingly unknown here giving away a number of wonderful pearls that are worthy a place in any collection admit it is curious uncle john it may be all a coincidence of course but how do you account for it sir  jones has an island in the south seas a locality where most of the worlds famous pearls have been found  sangoa  yes  it is not on any map this man le drieux positively stated that there is no such island did he not  uncle john rubbed his chin a gesture that showed he was disturbed  he was not positive he said he thought there was no such island  well sir  if jones could lie about his island he would be capable of the theft of those pearls admitted mr merrick reluctantly  that is conclusive sir  but he isnt capable of the theft le drieux states that jack andrews is a society swell an allaround confidence man and a gambler jones is a diffident and retiring but a very manly young fellow who loves quiet and seems to have no bad habits you cant connect the two in any possible way  again arthur took time to consider  i have no desire to suspect jones unjustly he said in fact i have been inclined to like the fellow and yethis quaint stories and his foolish expenditures have made me suspicious from the first you have scarcely done justice to his character in your description sir to us he appears diffident retiring and rather weak in a way while in his intercourse with goldstein he shows a mailed fist he can be hard as nails on occasion as we know and at times he displays a surprising knowledge of the world and its waysfor one who has been brought up on an outoftheway island what do we know about him anyway he tells a tale no one can disprove for the south seas are full of small islands some of which are probably unrecorded on the charts all this might possibly be explained by remembering that a man like jack andrews is undoubtedly a clever actor  exactly said a jubilant voice behind them and mr isidore le drieux stepped forward and calmly drew up a chair in which he seated himself you will pardon me gentlemen for eavesdropping but i was curious to know what you thought of this remarkable young man who calls himself a jones  arthur faced the intruder with a frown he objected to being startled in this manner you are a detective he asked  oh scarcely that sir le drieux replied in a deprecating way my printed card indicates that i am a merchant but in truth i am a special agent employed by the largest pearl and gem dealers in the world a firm with branches in every large european and american city my name is le drieux sir at your service and with a flourish he presented his card  the young rancher preferred to study the mans face  i am a sort of messenger he continued placidly when valuable consignments of jewels are to be delivered i am the carrier instead of the express companies the method is safer in twentysix years of this work i have never lost a single jewel  one firm employs you exclusively then  one firm but it has many branches  it is a trust  oh no we have many competitors but none very important our closest rival for instance has headquarters on this very coastin san franciscobut spreads as we do over the civilized world yet jephsonsthats the firmdo not claim to equal our business they deal mostly in pearls  pearls eh said arthur musingly then it was your firm that lost the valuable collection of pearls you mentioned to mr merrick  no they were the property of countess ahmberg of vienna but we had sold many of the finest specimens to the countess and have records of their weight size shape and color the one you are now wearing sir pointing to uncle johns scarf pin is one of the best black pearls ever discovered it was found at tremloe in 1883 and was originally purchased by our firm in 1887 i took it to tiffany who sold it to prince godesky of warsaw i carried it to him with other valuable purchases and after his death it was again resold to our firm it was in october 1904 that i again became the bearer of the pearl delivering it safely to countess ahmberg at her villa it was stolen from her together with 188 other rare pearls valued at a half million dollars a little over a year ago  this pearl sir said uncle john stiffly is not the one you refer to it was found on the shores of the island of sangoa and you have never seen it before  le drieux smiled sweetly as he brushed the ashes from his cigar  i am seldom mistaken in a pearl especially one that i have handled said he moreover a good pearl becomes historic and it is my business to know the history of each and every one in existence  even those owned by jephsons asked arthur  yes unless they were acquired lately i have spoken in this manner in order that you may understand the statements i am about to make and i beg you to listen carefully three daring pearl robberies have taken place within the past two years the first was a collection scarcely inferior to that of the countess ahmberg a bank messenger was carrying it through the streets of london one evening to be delivered to lady grandison when he was stabbed to the heart and the gems stolen singularly enough jack andrews was passing by and found the dying messenger he called for the police but when they arrived the messenger had expired the fate of the pearls has always remained a mystery although a large reward has been offered for their recovery  oh a reward  naturally sir four months later princess lemoine lost her wonderful pearl necklace while sitting in a box at the grand opera in paris this was one of the cleverest thefts that ever baffled the police for the necklace was never recovered we know however that jack andrews occupied the box next to that of the princess a coincidenceperhaps we now come to the robbery of the countess ahmberg the third on the list jack andrews was a guest at her house as i have explained to you no blame has ever attached to this youthful adventurer yet my firm always interested in the pearls they have sold advised me to keep an eye on him when he returned to america i did so  now mr merrick i will add to the tale i told you the other night andrews behaved very well for a few weeks after he landed at new york then he disposed of seven fine pearls anddisappeared they were not notable pearls especially but two of them i was able to trace to the necklace of princess lemoine i cabled my firm they called attention to the various rewards offered and urged me to follow andrews that was impossible he had left no clue but chance favored me coming here to los angeles on business i suddenly ran across my quarry jack andrews he has changed a bit the mustache is gone he is in poor health and i am told he was nearly drowned in the ocean the other day so at first i was not sure of my man i registered at this hotel and watched him carefully sometimes i became positive he was andrews at other times i doubted but when he began distributing pearls to you his new friends all doubt vanished there gentlemen is my story in a nutshell what do you think of it  both mr merrick and young weldon had listened with rapt interest but their interpretation of the tale which amounted to a positive accusation of a jones showed the difference in the two mens natures  i think you are on the wrong trail sir answered mr merrick doubtless you have been misled by a casual resemblance coupled with the fact that andrews is suspected of stealing pearls and jones is known to possess pearlsthe pearls being of rare worth in both cases still you are wrong for instance if you have the weight and measurement of the tremloe black pearl you will find they do not fit the pearl i am now wearing  le drieux smiled genially  it is unnecessary to make the test sir he replied the pearl andrews gave to miss doyle is as unmistakable as your own but i am curious to hear your opinion mr weldon  i have been suspicious of young jones from the first said arthur but i have been studying this boys character and he is positively incapable of the crimes you accuse him of such as robbery and murder in other words whatever jones may be he is not andrews or if by chance he proves to be andrews then andrews is innocent of crime all your theories are based upon a desire to secure rewards backed by a chain of circumstantial evidence  a chain said le drieux grimly that will hold jack andrews fast in its coils clever though he is  circumstantial evidence retorted mr merrick doesnt amount to shucks it is constantly getting good people into trouble and allowing rascals to escape nothing but direct evidence will ever convince me that a man is guilty  le drieux shrugged his shoulders  the pearls are evidence enough said he  to be sure evidence enough to free the poor boy of suspicion you may be a better messenger than you are a detective mr le drieux but that doesnt convince me you are a judge of pearls  the agent rose with a frown of annoyance  i am going to have jack andrews arrested in the morning he remarked if you warn him in the meantime i shall charge you with complicity  uncle john nearly choked with anger but he maintained his dignity  i have no knowledge of your jack andrews he replied and turned his back     chapter xvi  trouble   uncle john and arthur decided not to mention to the girls this astounding charge of isidore le drieux fearing the news would make them nervous and disturb their rest so when the men joined the merry party in the alcove they did not refer to their late interview  afterward however when all but arthur weldon had gone to bed and he was sitting in uncle johns room the two discussed the matter together with much seriousness  we ought to do something sir said arthur this jones is a mere boy and in poor health at that he has no friends so far as we know other than ourselves therefore it is our duty to see him through this trouble  mr merrick nodded assent  we cannot prevent the arrest he replied for le drieux will not listen to reason if we aided jones to run away he would soon be caught absurd as the charge is the youngster must face it and prove his innocence  arthur paced the floor in a way that indicated he was disturbed by this verdict  he ought to have no difficulty in proving he is not jack andrews he remarked reflectively and yetthose pearls are difficult to explain their similarity to the ones stolen in europe fooled the expert le drieux and they are likely to fool a judge or jury i hope jones has some means of proving that he brought the pearls from sangoa that would settle the matter at once  as soon as he is arrested we will get him a lawyerthe best in this country said mr merrick more than that we cannot do but a good lawyer will know the proper method of freeing his client  the next morning they were up early awaiting developments but le drieux seemed in no hurry to move he had breakfast at about nine oclock read his newspaper for a half hour or so and then deliberately left the hotel all of mr merricks party had breakfasted before this and soon after le drieux had gone away young jones appeared in the lobby he was just in time to see the stanton girls drive away in their automobile accompanied by their aunt jane  the motion picture stars must be late today said the boy looking after them  they are answered patsy standing beside him at the window but maud says this happens to be one of their days of leisure no picture is to be taken and they have only to rehearse a new play but its a busy life seems to me and it would really prove hard work if the girls didnt enjoy it so much  yes said he its a fascinating profession i understand and nothing can be called work that is interesting when we are obliged to do something that we do not like to do it becomes work otherwise what is usually called work is mere play for it furnishes its quota of amusement  he was quite unconscious of any impending misfortune and when beth and louise joined patsy in thanking him for his pretty gifts of the pearls he flushed with pleasure evidently their expressions of delight were very grateful to his ears  said uncle john in a casual way those are remarkably fine pearls to have come from such an island as sangoa  but we find much better ones there i assure you replied the boy i have many in my room of much greater value but did not dare ask you to accept them as gifts  do many pearls come from sangoa then asked arthur  that is our one industry answered the young man many years ago my father discovered the pearl fisheries it was after he had purchased the island but he recognized the value of the pearls and brought a colony of people from america to settle at sangoa and devote their time to pearl fishing once or twice every year we send a ship to market with a consignment of pearls to our agent andto be quite frank with youthat is why i am now able to build the picture theatres i have contracted for as well as the film factory  i see said uncle john but tell me this please why is sangoa so little known or rather so quite unknown  my father jones returned loved quiet and seclusion he was willing to develop the pearl fisheries but objected to the flock of adventurers sure to descend upon his island if its wealth of pearls became generally known his colony he selected with great care and with few exceptions they are a sturdy wholesome lot enjoying the peaceful life of sangoa and thoroughly satisfied with their condition there it is only within the last two years that our american agents knew where our pearls came from yet they could not locate the island if they tried i do not feel the same desire my father did to keep the secret although i would dislike to see sangoa overrun with tourists or traders  he spoke so quietly and at the same time so convincingly that both arthur and uncle john accepted his explanation unquestioningly nevertheless in the embarrassing dilemma in which jones would presently be involved the story would be sure to bear the stamp of unreality to any uninterested hearer  the girls had now begun to chatter over the theatre plans and their financial backeras patsy doyle called himjoined them with eager interest arthur sat at a nearby desk writing a letter uncle john glanced over the morning paper inez the mexican nurse brought baby to louise for a kiss before it went for a ride in its perambulator  an hour had passed when le drieux entered the lobby in company with a thinfaced sharpeyed man in plain clothes they walked directly toward the group that was seated by the open alcove window and arthur weldon observing them and knowing what was about to happen rose from the writingdesk and drew himself tensely together as he followed them uncle john lowered his paper frowned at le drieux and then turned his eyes upon the face of young jones  it was the thinfeatured man who advanced and lightly touched the boys arm  beg pardon sir said he in even unemotional tones you are mr andrews i believemr jack andrews  the youth turned his head to look at his questioner  no sir he answered with a smile a case of mistaken identity my name is jones then continuing his speech to patsy doyle he said there is no need to consider the acoustic properties of our theatres for the architect  pardon me again interrupted the man more sternly i am positive this is not a case of mistaken identity we have ample proof that jack andrews is parading here under the alias of a jones  the boy regarded him with a puzzled expression  what insolence muttered beth in an undertone but audible enough to be distinctly heard  the man flushed slightly and glanced at le drieux who nodded his head then he continued firmly  in any event sir i have a warrant for your arrest and i hope you will come with me quietly and so avoid a scene  the boy grew pale and then red his eyes narrowed as he stared fixedly at the officer but he did not change his position nor did he betray either fear or agitation in a voice quite unmoved he asked  on what charge do you arrest me  you are charged with stealing a valuable collection of pearls from the countess ahmberg at vienna about a year ago  but i have never been in vienna  you will have an opportunity to prove that  and my name is not andrews  you must prove that also  the boy thought for a moment then he asked  who accuses me  this gentleman mr le drieux he is an expert in pearls knows intimately all those in the collection of the countess and has recognized several which you have recently presented to your friends as among those you brought from austria  again jones smiled  this is absurd sir he remarked  the officer returned the smile but rather grimly  it is the usual protest mr andrews i dont blame you for the denial but the evidence against you is very strong will you come and quietly  i am unable to offer physical resistance replied the young fellow as he slowly rose from his chair and displayed his thin figure moreover he added with a touch of humor i believe theres a fine for resisting an officer i suppose you have a legal warrant may i be permitted to see it  the officer produced the warrant jones perused it slowly and then handed it to mr merrick who read it and passed it back to the officer  what shall i do sir asked the boy  obey the law answered uncle john this officer is only the laws instrument and it is useless to argue with him but i will go with you to the police station and furnish bail  le drieux shook his head  quite impossible mr merrick he said this is not a bailable offense  are you sure  i am positive this is an extradition case of international importance andrews after an examination will be taken to new york and from there to vienna where his crime was committed  but he has committed no crime  le drieux shrugged his shoulders  he is accused and he must prove his innocence said he  but that is nonsense interposed arthur warmly there is no justice in such an assertion if i know anything of the purpose of the law and i think i do you must first prove this mans guilt before you carry him to austria to be tried by a foreign court  i dont care a snap for the purpose of the law retorted le drieux our treaty with austria provides for extradition and that settles it this man is already under arrest the judge who issued the warrant believes that jones is jack andrews and that jack andrews stole the pearls from the countess ahmberg of course the prisoner will have a formal examination when he may defend himself as best he can but we havent made this move without being sure of our case and it will be rather difficult for him to escape the penalty of his crimes clever as he is  clever it was jones himself who asked this wonderingly  le drieux bowed to him with exaggerated politeness  i consider you the cleverest rogue in existence said he but even the cleverest may be trapped in time and your big mistake was in disposing of those pearls so openly see here he added taking from his pocket a small packet here are the famous taprobane pearlssix of themwhich were found in your room a half hour ago they also were a part of the countess collection  oh you have been to my room  under the authority of the law  and you have seen those pearls before  several times i am an expert in pearls and can recognize their value at a glance said le drieux with much dignity  jones gave a little chuckle and then turned deprecatingly to mr merrick  you need not come with me to the station sir said he but if you wish to assist me please send me a lawyer and then go to the continental and tell mr goldstein of my predicament  i will do that promptly replied uncle john  jones turned to bow to the girls  i hope you young ladies can forgive this disgraceful scene he remarked in a tone of regret rather then humiliation i do not see how any effort of mine could have avoided it it seems to be one of the privileges of the peoples guardians in your free country to arrest and imprison anyone on a mere suspicion of crime here is a case in which someone has sadly blundered and i imagine it is the pompous gentleman who claims to know pearls and does not with a nod toward le drieux who scowled indignantly  it is an outrage cried beth  its worse than that said patsy but of course you can easily prove your innocence  if i have the chance the boy agreed but at present i am a prisoner and must follow my captor  he turned to the officer and bowed to indicate that he was ready to go arthur shook the young fellows hand and promised to watch his interests in every possible way  go with him now arthur proposed louise its a hard thing to be taken to jail and im sure he needs a friend at his side at this time  good advice agreed uncle john of course theyll give him a preliminary hearing before locking him up and if youll stick to him ill send on a lawyer in doublequick time  thank you said the boy the lawyer first mr merrick and then goldstein     chapter xvii  uncle john is puzzled   uncle john was off on his errands even before jones and arthur weldon had driven away from the hotel with the officer and le drieux there had been no scene and none of the guests of the hotel had any inkling of the arrest  uncle john had always detested lawyers and so he realized that he was sure to be a poor judge of the merits of any legal gentleman he might secure to defend jones  i may as well leave it to chance he grumbled as he drove down the main boulevard the rascals are all alike  glancing to this side and that he encountered a sign on a building fred a colby lawyer  all right i mustnt waste time he said and stopping his driver he ascended a stairway to a gloomy upper hall here the doors all in a row were alike forbidding but one of them bore the lawyers name so mr merrick turned the handle and abruptly entered  a sallowfaced young man in his shirtsleeves was seated at a table littered with newspapers and magazines engaged in the task of putting new strings on a battered guitar as his visitor entered he looked up in surprise and laid down the instrument  i want to see colby the lawyer began uncle john regarding the disordered room with strong disapproval  you are seeing him retorted the young man with a fleeting smile and ill bet you two to one that if you came here on business you will presently go away and find another lawyer  why questioned mr merrick eyeing him more closely  i dont impress people explained colby picking up the guitar again i dont inspire confidence as for the law i know it as well as anyonewhich is begging the questionbut when im interviewed i have to admit ive had no experience  no practice  just a few collections thats all i sleep on that sofa yonder eat at a cafeteria and so manage to keep body and soul together once in a while a stranger sees my sign and needs a lawyer so he climbs the stairs but when he meets me face to face he beats a hasty retreat  as he spoke colby tightened a string and began strumming it to get it tuned uncle john sat down on the one other chair in the room and thought a moment  youve been admitted to the bar he asked  yes sir graduate of the penn law school  then you know enough to defend an innocent man from an unjust accusation  colby laid down the guitar  ah said he this grows interesting i really believe you have half a mind to give me your case sir i know enough i hope to defend an innocent man but i cant promise offhand to save him even from an unjust accusation  why not doesnt law stand for justice  perhaps in the abstract anyhow theres a pretty fable to that effect but law in the abstract and law as it is interpreted and applied are not even second cousins to be quite frank id rather defend a guilty person than an innocent one the chances are id win more easily are you sure your man is innocent  uncle john scowled  perhaps id better find another lawyer who is more optimistic he said  oh im full of optimism sir my fault is that im not well known in the courts and have no arrangement to divide my fees with the powers that be but ive been observing and i know the tricks of the trade as well as any lawyer in california my chief recommendation however is that im eager to get a case for my rent is sadly overdue why not try me just to see what im able to do id like to find that out myself  this is a very important matter asserted mr merrick  very if im evicted for lack of rentmoney my career is crippled  i mean the case is a serious one  are you willing to pay for success  liberally  then ill win it for you dont judge my ability by my present condition sir tell me your story and ill get to work at once  uncle john rose with sudden decision  put on your coat he said and while colby obeyed with alacrity he gave him a brief outline of the accusation brought against jones i want you to take my car he added and hasten to the police station that you may be present at the preliminary examination there will be plenty of time to talk afterward  colby nodded his coat and hat made the young lawyer quite presentable and without another word he followed mr merrick down the stairs and took his seat in the motorcar next moment he was whirling down the street and uncle john looked after him with a half puzzled expression as if he wondered whether or not he had blundered in his choice of a lawyer  a little later he secured a taxicab and drove to the office of the continental film manufacturing company mr goldstein was in his office but sent word that he was too busy to see visitors nevertheless when mr merrick declared he had been sent by a jones he was promptly admitted to the managers sanctum  our friend young jones he began has just been arrested by a detective  goldsteins nervous jump fairly raised him off his chair but in an instant he settled back and shot an eager interested look at his visitor  what for mr merrick he demanded  for stealing valuable pearls from some foreign woman a trumpedup charge of course  goldstein rubbed the palms of his hands softly together his face wore a look of supreme content  arrested ah that is bad mr merrick it is very bad indeed and it involves usthe continental you knowin an embarrassing manner  why so asked uncle john  cant you see sir asked the manager trying hard to restrain a smile if the papers get hold of this affair and state that our presidentour biggest ownerthe man who controls the continental stockis a common thief the story willehehput a bad crimp in our business so to speak  uncle john looked at the man thoughtfully  so jones controls the continental eh he said how long since mr goldstein  why since the january meeting a year and more ago it was an astonishing thing and dramaticbelieve me at the annual meeting of stockholders in walks this striplinga mere kidproves that he holds the majority of stock elects himself president and installs a new board of directors turning the tired and true builders of the business out in the cold then without apology promise or argument president jones walks out again in an hour he upset the old conditions turned our business topsyturvy and disappeared with as little regard for the continental as if it had been a turnip that stock must have cost him millions and how he ever got hold of it is a mystery that has kept us all guessing ever since the only redeeming feature of the affair was that the new board of directors proved decent and jones kept away from us all and let us alone id never seen him until he came here a few days ago and began to order me around so there mr merrick you know as much about jones as i do  mr merrick was perplexed the more he heard of young jones the more amazing the boy seemed to be  has the continental lost money since jones took possession he inquired  i think not replied goldstein cautiously youre a business man mr merrick and can understand that our machineryour business systemis so perfect that it runs smoothly regardless of who grabs the dividends what i object to is this young fellows impertinence in interfering with my work here he walks in reverses my instructions to my people orders me to do unbusinesslike things and raises hob with the whole organization  well it belongs to him goldstein said uncle john in defense of the boy he is your employer and has the right to dictate but just at present he needs your help he asked me to come here and tell you of his arrest  goldstein shrugged his shoulders  his arrest is none of my business was his reply if jones stole the money to buy continental stock he must suffer the consequences im working for the stock not for the individual  but surely you will go to the station and see what can be done for him protested uncle john  surely i will not retorted the manager whats the use there isnt even a foot of good picture film in so common a thing as the arrest of a thiefand the censors would forbid it if there were let jones fight his own battles  it occurs to me suggested mr merrick who was growing indignant that mr jones will be able to satisfy the court that he is not a thief and so secure his freedom without your assistance what will happen then mr goldstein  then why it is still none of my business im the manager of a motion picture concernone of the biggest concerns in the worldand ive nothing to do with the troubles of my stockholders  he turned to his desk and mr merrick was obliged to go away without farther parley on his way out he caught a glimpse of maud stanton passing through the building she was dressed in the costume of an indian princess and looked radiantly beautiful uncle john received a nod and a smile and then she was gone without as yet a hint of the misfortune that had overtaken a jones of sangoa  returning to the hotel rather worried and flustered by the mornings events he found the girls quietly seated in the lobby busy over their embroidery  well uncle said patsy cheerfully is ajo still in limbo  i suppose so he rejoined sinking into an easy chair beside her is arthur back yet  no said louise answering for her husband he is probably staying to do all he can for the poor boy  did you get a lawyer inquired beth  i got a fellow who claims to be a lawyer but im not sure he will be of any use  then he related his interview with colby to the amusement of his nieces all three of whom approved the course he had taken and were already prepared to vouch for the briefless barristers ability on the grounds that eccentricity meant talent  you see explained miss patsy he has nothing else to do but jump heart and soul into this case so ajo will be able to command his exclusive services which with some big bustling lawyer would be impossible  luncheon was over before arthur finally appeared looking somewhat grave and perturbed  they wont accept bail he reported jones must stay in jail until his formal examination and if they then decide that he is really jack andrews he will remain in jail until his extradition papers arrive  when will he be examined asked louise  whenever the judge feels in the humor it seems our lawyer demanded jones release at once on the ground that a mistake of identity had been made but the stupid judge is of the opinion that the charge against our friend is valid at any rate he refused to let him go he wouldnt even argue the case at present he issues a warrant on a charge of larceny claps a man in jail whether innocent or not and refuses to let him explain anything or prove his innocence until a formal examination is held  there is some justice in that remarked uncle john suppose jones is guilty it would be a mistake to let him go free until a thorough examination had been made  and if he is innocent he will have spent several days in jail been worried and disgraced and there is no redress for the false imprisonment the judge wont even apologize to him  its all in the interests of law and order i suppose said patsy but the law seems dreadfully inadequate to protect the innocent i suppose its because the courts are run by cheap and incompetent people who couldnt earn a salary in any other way  someone must run them and it isnt an ambitious mans job replied uncle john what do you think of the lawyer i sent you arthur  the young ranchman smiled  hes a wonder uncle he seemed to know more about the case than jones or i did and more about the law than the judge did hes an irrepressible fellow and told that rascal le drieux a lot about pearls that the expert never had heard before where did you find him sir  uncle john explained  well said arthur i think jones is in good hands colby has secured him a private room at the jail with a bath and all the comforts of home meals are to be sent in from a restaurant and when i left the place the jailer had gone out to buy jones a stock of books to while away his leisure hourswhich are bound to be numerous id no idea a prisoner could live in such luxury  money did it i suppose patsy shrewdly suggested  yes jones wrote a lot of checks colby got a couple of hundred for a retaining fee and gleefully informed us it was more money than he had ever owned at one time in all his previous career i think he will earn it however  where is he now asked uncle john  visiting all the newspaper offices to buy white space as he put it in other words colby will bribe the press to silence at least until the case develops  im glad of that exclaimed beth what do you think of this queer business arthur  why ive no doubt of the boys innocence if that is what you mean ive watched him closely and am positive he is no more jack andrews than i am but i fear he will have a hard task to satisfy the judge that he is falsely accused it would be an admission of error you see and so the judge will prefer to find him guilty it is this same judgewilton i think his name iswho will conduct the formal examination and today he openly sneered at the mention of sangoa on the other hand he evidently believed every statement made by le drieux about the identity of the pearls found in jones possession le drieux has a printed list of the ahmberg pearls and was able to check the jones pearls off this list with a fair degree of accuracy it astonished even me and i could see that jones was equally amazed  wouldnt it be queer if they convicted him exclaimed beth  it would be dreadful since he is innocent said patsy  there is no need to worry about that just at present arthur assured them i am placing a great deal of confidence in the ability of lawyer colby     chapter xviii  doubts and difficulties   the stanton girls and mrs montrose came in early that afternoon they had heard rumors of the arrest of jones and were eager to learn what had occurred patsy and beth followed them to their rooms to give them every known detail and canvass the situation in all its phases  goldstein has been an angel all afternoon said flo he grinned and capered about like a schoolboy and some of us guessed hed been left a fortune  he ought to be ashamed of himself patsy indignantly asserted the man admitted to uncle john that ajo is the biggest stockholder in the continental the president to boot yet goldstein wouldnt lift a finger to help him and positively refused to obey his request to go to him after he was arrested  i know about that said aunt jane quietly goldstein talked to me about the affair this afternoon and declared his conviction that young jones is really a pearl thief he has taken a violent dislike to the boy and is delighted to think his stock will be taken away from him  maud had silently listened to this dialogue as she dressed for dinner but now she impetuously broke into the conversation saying  something definite ought to be done for the boy he needs intelligent assistance im afraid his situation is serious  that is what arthur thinks said beth he says that unless he can furnish proof that he is not jack andrews and that he came by those pearls honestly he will be shipped to austria for trial no one knows what those foreigners will do to him but he would probably fare badly in their hands  such being the logical conclusion said maud we must make our fight now at the examination  uncle john has engaged a lawyer announced patsy and if he proves bright and intelligent he ought to be able to free ajo  id like to see that lawyer and take his measure answered maud musingly and her wish was granted soon after they had finished dinner colby entered the hotel jaunty as ever and arthur met him and introduced him to the girls  you must forgive me for coming on a disagreeable mission began the young attorney but i have promised the judge that i would produce all the pearls mr jones gave you not later than tomorrow morning he wants them as evidence and to compare privately with le drieuxs list although he will likely have the expert at his elbow so i cant promise that you will ever get your jewels back again  oh you think then that mr jones is guilty said maud coldly  no indeed i believe he is innocent a lawyer should never suspect his client you know but to win i must prove my case and opposed to me is that terrible le drieux who insists he is never mistaken  arthurmr weldonsays you understand pearls as well as mr le drieux does suggested patsy  i thank him but he is in error i chattered to the judge about pearls it is true because i found he couldnt tell a pearl from a glass bead and i believe i even perplexed le drieux by hinting at a broad knowledge on the subject which i do not possess it was all a bit of bluff on my part but by tomorrow morning this knowledge will be a fact for ive bought a lot of books on pearls and intend to sit up all night reading them  that was a clever idea said uncle john nodding approval  so my mission here this evening is to get the pearls that i may study them as i read continued colby heretofore ive only seen the things through a plate glass window or a show case the success of our defense depends upon our refuting le drieuxs assertion that the pearls found in jones possession are a part of the countess ahmbergs collection he has a full description of the stolen gems and i must be prepared to show that none of the jones pearls is on the list  can you do that asked maud  she was gazing seriously into the young mans eyes and this caused him to blush and stammer a little as he replied  ii hope to miss stanton  and are you following no other line of defense she inquired  he sat back and regarded the girl curiously for a moment  i would like you to suggest some other line of defense he replied ive tried to find oneand failed  cant you prove he is not jack andrews  not if the identity of the pearls is established said the lawyer if the pearls were stolen and if jones cannot explain how he obtained possession of them the evidence is prima facia that he is jack andrews or at least his accomplice moreover his likeness to the photograph is somewhat bewildering you must admit  this gloomy view made them all silent for a time each thoughtfully considering the matter then maud asked  do you know the cash value of mr jones stock in the continental film company  colby shook his head but uncle john replied  goldstein told me it is worth millions  ah exclaimed the girl there then is our proof  the lawyer reflected with knitted brows  i confess i dont quite see your point said he  how much were those stolen pearls worth asked the girl  i dont know  you know they were not worth millions jack andrews was an adventurer by le drieuxs showing he was a fellow who lived by his wits and generally earned his livelihood by gambling with the scions of wealthy families even had he stolen the countess pearls and disposed of the collection at enormous priceswhich a thief is usually unable to dohe would still have been utterly unable to purchase a controlling interest in the continental stock  she spoke with quiet assurance but her statement roused the group to sudden excitement  hooray cried patsy theres your proof mr colby  the logic of genius commented uncle john  why its proof positive said beth  it is certainly a strong argument in favor of the boys innocence asserted arthur weldon  mauds a wonder when she wakes up she ought to have been a lady detective remarked flo regarding her sister admiringly  colby at first startled was now also regarding maud stanton with open admiration but there was an odd smile on his lips a smile of indulgent toleration  le drieuxs statement connects andrews with two other pearl robberies he reminded her the necklace of the princess lemoine is said to be priceless and the grandison collection stolen in london was scarcely less valuable than that of countess ahmberg  allowing all that said mr merrick two or three hundred thousand dollars would doubtless cover the value of the entire lot i am quite certain mr colby that miss stantons suggestion will afford you an excellent line of defense  i shall not neglect it you may be sure replied the lawyer tonight ill try to figure out as nearly as possible the total cash value of all the stolen pearls and of course jones will tell us what he paid for his stock or how much it is worth but i am not sure this argument will have as much weight as miss stanton suggests it may a bold gambler such as andrews might have obtained a huge sum at baden baden or monte carlo and were he indeed so clever a thief as his record indicates he may have robbed a bank or stolen in some way an immense sum of money logically the question has weight and i shall present it as effectively as i can but as i said i rely more on my ability to disprove the identity of the pearls on which the expert le drieux lays so much stress jones will have a thorough and formal examination within a few daysperhaps tomorrowand if the judge considers that andrews the pearl thief has been captured he will be held here pending the arrival from washington of the extradition paperssay two or three weeks longer  then we shall have all that time to prove his innocence inquired maud  unfortunately no there will be no further trial of the prisoner until he gets to vienna and is delivered to the authorities there all our work must be done previous to the formal examination  you do not seem very hopeful observed maud a hint of reproach in her tone  then appearances are against me miss stanton replied the lawyer with a smile this is my first important case and if i win it my future is assured so i mean to win but in order to do that i must consider the charge of the prosecution the effect of its arguments upon the judge and then find the right means to combat them when i am with you the friends of the accused i may consider the seamy side of the fabric but the presiding judge will find me so sure of my position that he will instinctively agree with me  they brought him the pearls jones had presented to them and then the lawyer bade them good night and went to his office to master the history of pearls in general and those famous ones stolen from countess ahmberg in particular  when he had gone uncle john remarked  well what do you think of him  they seemed in doubt  i think he will do all he can said patsy  and he appears quite a clever young man added beth as if to encourage them  allowing all that said maud gravely he has warned us of the possibility of failure i cannot understand how the coils of evidence have wrapped themselves so tightly around poor ajo  that asserted flo is because you cannot understand ajo himself nor can i nor can any of us     chapter xix  maud makes a memorandum   my mother used to say to me never expect to find brains in a pretty girl perhaps she said it because i was not a pretty girl and she wished to encourage me in any event that absurd notion of the ancients that when the fairies bestow the gift of beauty on a baby they withhold all other qualities has so often been disproved that we may well disregard it  maud stanton was a pretty girlindeed a beautiful girlbut she possessed brains as well as beauty and used her intellect to advantage more often than her quiet demeanor would indicate to others than her most intimate associates from the first she had been impressed by the notion that there was something mysterious about a jones and that his romantic explanation of his former life and present position was intended to hide a truth that would embarrass him were it fully known therefore she had secretly observed the young man at such times as they were together and had treasured every careless remark he had madeevery admission or assertionand made a note of it the boys arrest had startled her because it was so unexpected and her first impulse was to doubt his innocence later however she had thoroughly reviewed the notes she had made and decided he was innocent  in the quiet of her own room when she was supposed to be asleep maud got out her notebook and read therein again the review of all she had learned concerning a jones of sangoa  for a boy he has a good knowledge of business for a foreigner he has an excellent conception of modern american methods she murmured thoughtfully he is simple in little things shrewd if not wise in important matters he proved this by purchasing the control of the continental for its shares pay enormous dividends  had he stolen those pearls i am sure he would have been too shrewd to have given a portion of them to us knowing we would display them openly and so attract attention to them a thief so ingenious as andrews for instance would never have done so foolish a thing as that i am positive therefore jones is not andrews  now to account for the likeness between andrews an american adventurer and jones reared and educated in the mysterious island of sangoa ajos father must have left some near relatives in this country when he became a recluse in his faraway island why did he become a recluse thats a subject i must consider carefully for he was a man of money a man of science a man of affairs jones has told us he has no relatives here he may have spoken honestly if his father kept him in ignorance of the family history im not going to jump at the conclusion that the man who calls himself jack andrews is a near relative of our ajoa cousin perhapsbut ill not forget that that might explain the likeness between them  ajos father must have amassed a great fortune during many years from his pearl fisheries that would explain why the boy has so much money at his disposal he didnt get it from the sale of stolen pearls that is certain in addition to the money he invested in the continental he has enough in reserve to expend another million or so in patsy doyles motion picture scheme and he says he can spare it easily and have plenty left this in my opinion is a stronger proof of jones innocence than lawyer colby seems to consider it to me it is conclusive  now then where is sangoa how can one get to the island and finally how did jones get here from sangoa and how is he to return if he ever wants to go back to his valuable pearl fisheries his people and his home  she strove earnestly to answer these questions but could not with her present knowledge so she tucked the notebook into a drawer of her desk put out her light and got into bed  but sleep would not come to her the interest she took in the fate of young jones was quite impersonal she liked the boy in the same way she had liked dozens of boys the fact that she had been of material assistance in saving his life aroused no especial tenderness in her on his own account however jones was interesting to her because he was so unusual the complications that now beset him added to this interest because they were so curious and difficult to explain maud had the feeling that she had encountered a puzzle to tax her best talents and so she wanted to solve it  suddenly she bounded out of bed and turned on the electric light the notebook was again brought into requisition and she penciled on its pages the following words  what was the exact date that jack andrews landed in america what was the exact date that ajo landed from sangoa the first question may be easily answered for doubtless the police have the record butthe other  then she replaced the book put out the light and went to sleep very easily  that last thought now jotted down in black and white had effectually cleared her mind of its cobwebs     chapter xx  a girlish notion   colby came around next morning just as mr merrick was entering the breakfast room and the little man took the lawyer in to have a cup of coffee the young attorney still maintained his jaunty air although redeyed from his nights vigil and when he saw the stanton girls and their aunt jane having breakfast by an open window he eagerly begged permission to join them somewhat to uncle johns amusement  well demanded maud reading colbys face with her clear eyes  i made a night of it as i promised said he this morning i know so much about pearls that im tempted to go into the business  as jack andrews did inquired flo  not exactly he answered with a smile but its an interesting subjectso interesting that i only abandoned my reading when i found i was burning my electric lamp by daylight listen a pearl is nothing more or less than nacre a fluid secretion of a certain variety of oysternot the eatable kind a grain of sand gets between the folds of the oyster and its shell and irritates the beast in selfdefense the oyster covers the sand with a fluid which hardens and forms a pearl  ive always known that said flo with a toss of her head  yes but i want you all to bear it in mind for it will explain a discovery i have made before i get to that however i want to say that at one time the island of ceylon supplied the world with its most famous pearls the early egyptians discovered them there as well as on the persian and indian coasts the pearl which cleopatra is said to have dissolved in wine and swallowed was worth about four hundred thousand dollars in our money but of course pearls were scarce in her day a single pearl was cut in two and used for earrings for the statue of venus in the pantheon at rome and the sum paid for it was equal to about a quarter of a million dollars sir thomas gresham in the days of queen elizabeth had a pearl valued at about seventyfive thousand dollars which he treated in the same manner cleopatra did dissolving it in wine and boasting he had given the most expensive dinner ever known  all of which began maud impatiently  all of which miss stanton goes to show that pearls have been of great price since the beginning of history nowadays we get just as valuable pearls from the south seas and even from panama st margarita and the caromandel coast as ever came from ceylon but only those of rare size shape or color are now valued at high prices for instance a string of matched pearls such as that owned by princess lemoine is estimated as worth only eighty thousand dollars because it could be quite easily duplicated the collection of countess ahmberg was noted for its variety of shapes and colors more than for its large or costly pearls and that leads to my great discovery  thank heaven said flo with a sigh  i have discovered that our famous expert le drieux is an arrant humbug  we had suspected that remarked maud  now we know it declared colby pearls i have learned change their color their degree of luster even their weight according to atmospheric conditions and location a tenpennyweight pearl in vienna might weigh eight or nine pennyweights here in california or it is more likely to weigh twelve the things absorb certain moistures and chemicals from the air and sun and shed those absorptions when kept in darkness or from the fresh air pearls die so to speak but are often restored to life by immersions in seawater their native element as for color the pink and blue pearls often grow white at times especially if kept long in darkness but sunbaths restore their former tints in the same way a white pearl if placed near the fumes of ammonia changes to a pinkish hue while certain combinations of chemicals render them black or smoked a clever man could steal a pink pearl bleach it white and sell it to its former owner without its being recognized therefore when our expert le drieux attempts to show that the pearls found in jones possession are identical with those stolen from the austrian lady he fails to allow for climatic or other changes and cannot be accurate enough to convince anyone who knows the versatile characteristics of these gems  ah but does the judge know that mr colby asked maud  i shall post him after that the conviction of the prisoner will be impossible  do you think the examination will be held today inquired mr merrick  i cannot tell that it will depend upon the mood of judge wilton if he feels grouchy or disagreeable he is liable to postpone the case if he is in good spirits and wants to clear his docket he may begin the examination at ten oclock today which is the hour set for it  is your evidence ready mr colby  such as i can command miss stanton he replied last evening i wired new york for information as to the exact amount of stock jones owns in the continental and i got a curious reply the stock is valued at nineteen hundred thousand dollars but no one believes that jones owns it personally it is generally thought that for politic reasons the young man was made the holder of stock for several different parties who still own it although it is in jones name the control of stock without ownership is not unusual it gives the real owners an opportunity to hide behind their catspaw who simply obeys their instructions  i do not believe that jones is connected with anyone in that manner said mr merrick  nor do i asserted aunt jane his interference with goldsteins plans proves he is under no obligations to others for he has acted arbitrarily in accordance with his personal desires and against the financial interests of the concern  why didnt you ask him about this instead of wiring to new york demanded maud  he might not give us exact information under the circumstances said colby  the girl frowned  jones is not an ordinary client continued the lawyer coolly he wont tell me anything about himself or give me what is known as inside information on the contrary he contents himself with saying he is innocent and i must prove it im going to save the young man but im not looking to him for much assistance  maud still frowned presently she said  i want to see mr jones can you arrange an interview for me sir  of course youd better go into town with me this morning if the examination is held you will see jones then if its postponed you may visit him in the jail  maud reflected a moment  very well said she ill go with you then turning to her aunt she continued you must make my excuses to mr goldstein aunt jane  mrs montrose eyed her niece critically  who will accompany you maud she asked  why ill go said patsy doyle and so it was settled uncle john agreeing to escort the young ladies and see them safely home again     chapter xxi  the yacht arabella   as the party drove into town colby said  it wouldnt be a bad idea for jones to bribe that fellow le drieux if le drieux who holds a warrant for the arrest of jack andrews issued by the austrian government and vised in washington could be won to our side the whole charge against our friend might be speedily dissolved  disgraceful snapped maud indignantly i am positive mr jones would not consider such a proposition  diplomatic not disgraceful commented the lawyer smiling at her why should jones refuse to consider bribery  to use money to defeat justice would be a crime as despicable as stealing pearls she said  dear me muttered colby with a puzzled frown what a queer way to look at it le drieux has already been bribed by a liberal reward to run down a supposed criminal if we bribe him with a larger sum to give up the pursuit of jones whom we believe innocent we are merely defending ourselves from a possible injustice which may be brought about by an error of judgment  isnt this judge both able and honest asked uncle john  wilton well possibly his ability consists in his knowledge of law rather than of men and affairs he believes himself honest i suppose but ill venture to predict he will act upon prejudice and an assumption of personal dignity rather than attempt to discover if his personal impressions correspond with justice a judge mr merrick is a mere man with all the average mans failings so we must expect him to be quite human  never mind said patsy resignedly perhaps we shall find him a better judge than you are lawyer  he has had more experience anyhow said colby much amused at the shot  they found on arriving at court that the case had already been postponed they drove to the jail and obtained permission to see the prisoner who was incarcerated under the name of jack andrews alias a jones maud would have liked a private audience but the lawyer was present as well as patsy and mr merrick and she did not like to ask them to go away  the boy greeted them with his old frank smile and did not seem in the least oppressed by the fact that he was a prisoner accused of an ugly crime the interview was held in a parlor of the jail a guard standing by the door but discreetly keeping out of earshot  colby first informed the boy of the postponement of his formal examination and then submitted to his client an outline of the defense he had planned jones listened quietly and shook his head  is that the best you can do for me  with my present knowledge yes returned the lawyer  and will it clear me from this suspicion was the next question  i hope so  you are not sure  this is an extraordinary case mr jones your friends all believe you innocent but the judge wants factscold hard factsand only these will influence him mr le drieux commissioned by the austrian government states that you are jack andrews and have escaped to america after having stolen the pearls of a noble viennese lady he will offer as evidence to prove his assertion the photograph and the pearls you must refute this charge with counterevidence in order to escape extradition and a journey to the country where the crime was committed there you will be granted a regular trial to be sure but even if you then secure an acquittal you will have suffered many indignities and your good name will be permanently tarnished  well sir  i shall work unceasingly to secure your release at the examination but i wish i had some stronger evidence to offer in rebuttal  go ahead and do your best said the boy nonchalantly i will abide by the result whatever it may be  may i ask a few questions maud timidly inquired  he turned to her with an air of relief  most certainly you may miss stanton  and you will answer them  i pledge myself to do so if i am able  thank you she said i am not going to interfere with mr colbys plans but id like to help you on my own account if i may  he gave her a quick look at once grateful suspicious and amused then he said  clear out colby im sure you have a hundred things to attend to and when youre gone ill have a little talk with miss stanton  the lawyer hesitated  if this conversation is likely to affect your case he began then  then miss stanton will give you any information she may acquire interrupted jones and that left colby no alternative but to go away  now then miss stanton out with it said the boy  there are a lot of things we dont know but ought to know in order to defend you properly she observed looking at him earnestly  question me then  i want to know the exact date when you landed in this country from sangoa  let me see it was the twelfth day of october of last year  oh so long ago as that it is fifteen months once you told us that you had been here about a year  i didnt stop to count the months you see the twelfth of october is correct  where did you land  at san francisco  direct from sangoa  direct from sangoa  and what brought you from sangoa to san francisco  a boat  a sailingship  no a large yacht two thousand tons burden  whose yacht was it  mine  then where is it now  he reflected a moment  i think captain carg must be anchored at san pedro by now or perhaps he is at long beach or santa monica he said quietly  on this coast exclaimed maud  yes  patsy was all excitement by now and could no longer hold her tongue  is the yacht arabella yours she demanded  it is miss patsy  then it is lying off santa monica bay ive seen it she cried  it was named for my mother said the boy his voice softening and built by my father in the arabella i made my first voyage so you will realize i am very fond of the little craft  maud was busily thinking  is captain carg a sangoan she asked  of course the entire crew are sangoans  then where has the yacht been since it landed you here fifteen months ago  it returned at once to the island and at my request has now made another voyage to america  it has been here several days  quite likely  has it brought more pearls from sangoa  perhaps i do not know for i have not yet asked for the captains report  both uncle john and patsy were amazed at the rapidity with which maud was acquiring information of a really important character indeed she was herself surprised and the boys answers were already clearing away some of the mists she stared at him thoughtfully as she considered her next question and jones seemed to grow thoughtful too  i have no desire to worry my friends over my peculiar difficulties he presently said frankly i am not in the least worried myself the charge against me is so preposterous that i am sure to be released after the judge has examined me and even at the worstif i were sent to vienna for trialthe austrians would know very well that i am not the man they seek  that trip would cause you great inconvenience however suggested mr merrick  i am told a prisoner is treated very well if he is willing to pay for such consideration said jones  and your good name asked maud with a touch of impatience  my good name is precious only to me and i know it is still untarnished for your sake my newly found friends i would like the world to believe in me but there is none save you to suffer through my disgrace and you may easily ignore my acquaintance  what nonsense cried patsy scornfully tell me sir whats to become of our grand motion picture enterprise if you allow yourself to be shipped to vienna as a captured thief  he winced a trifle at the blunt epithet but quickly recovered and smiled at her  im sorry miss patsy said he i know you will be disappointed if our enterprise is abandoned so will i since this latest complication arose i fear i have not given our project the consideration it deserves  the boy passed his hand wearily across his forehead and rising from his seat took a few nervous steps up and down the room then pausing he asked abruptly  are you still inclined to be my champion miss stanton  if i can be of any help she replied simply  then i wish you would visit the yacht make the acquaintance of captain carg and tell him of the trouble i am in will you  with pleasure that isill be glad to do your errand  ill give you a letter to him he continued and turning to the attendant he asked for writing material which was promptly furnished him at the table he wrote a brief note and enclosed it in an envelope which he handed to maud  you will find the captain a splendid old fellow said he  will he answer any questions i may ask him she demanded  that will depend upon your questions he answered evasively carg is considered a bit taciturn i believe but he has my best interests at heart and you will find him ready to serve me in any possible way  is there any objection to my going with maud asked patsy id like to visit that yacht it looks so beautiful from a distance  you may all go if you wish said he it might be well for mr merrick to meet captain carg who would prefer i am sure to discuss so delicate a matter as my arrest with a man not that he is ungallant but with a man such as mr merrick he would be more at his ease carg is a sailor rather blunt and rugged both in speech and demeanor but wholly devoted to me because i am at present the jones of sangoa  ill accompany the girls of course said uncle john and i think we ought not to delay in seeing your man colby says you may be called for examination at any time  there is one more question i want to ask announced maud as they rose to go on what date did you reach new york after landing at san francisco  why it must have been some time in last january i know it was soon after christmas which i passed in chicago  is that as near as you can recollect the date  yes at short notice  then perhaps you can tell me the date you took possession of the continental film company by entering the stockholders meeting and ejecting yourself president  he seemed surprised at her information and the question drew from him an odd laugh  how did you learn about that incident he asked  goldstein told mr merrick he said it was a coup detat  the boy laughed again  it was really funny said he old bingley the last president had no inkling that i controlled the stock he was so sure of being reelected that he had a cameraman on hand to make a motion picture of the scene where all would hail him as the chief the picture was taken but it didnt interest bingley any for it showed the consternation on his face and the faces of his favored coterie when i rose and calmly voted him out of office with the majority of the stock  oh exclaimed maud there was a picture made of that scene then  to be sure it was never shown but once to an audience of one i sat and chuckled to myself while the film was being run  was it kept or destroyed asked the girl breathlessly  i ordered it preserved amongst our archives probably goldstein now has the negative out here stored in our hollywood vaults  and the datewhen was it she demanded  why the annual meeting is always the last thursday in january figure it outit must have been the twentysixth but is the exact date important miss stanton  very she announced i dont know yet the exact date that andrews landed in new york on his return from vienna but if it happened to be later than the twentysixth of january  i see in that case the picture will clear me of suspicion  precisely i shall now go and wire new york for the information i need  cant you get it of le drieux asked the young man  perhaps so ill try but it will be better to get the date from the steamship agent direct  with this they shook the boys hand assuring him of their sympathy and their keen desire to aid him and then hurried away from the jail     chapter xxii  masculine and feminine   uncle john and the girls after consulting together decided to stop at the hollywood studio and pick up flo and mrs montrose  it would be a shame to visit that lovely yacht without them said patsy and we were all invited you know  yes invited by a host who is unavoidably detained elsewhere added uncle john  still that yacht is very exclusive his niece stated and im sure we are the first americans to step foot on its decks  they were all in a brighter mood since the interview at the jail and after a hurried lunch at the hotel during which maud related to the others the mornings occurrences they boarded the big merrick sevenpassenger automobile and drove to santa monica bay louise couldnt leave the baby who was cutting teeth but arthur and beth joined the party and on arrival at the beach uncle john had no difficulty in securing a launch to take them out to the arabella  they wont let you aboard though declared the boatman a good many have tried it an come back disjointed theres something queer about that craft but the govment dont seem worried so i guess it aint a pirate  the beauty of the yacht grew on them as they approached it it was painted a pure white in every part and on the stern was the one word arabella but no name of the port from which she hailed the ladder was hoisted and fastened to an upper rail but as they drew up to the smooth sides a closecropped bullethead projected from the bulwarks and a gruff voice demanded  well whats wanted  we want to see captain carg called arthur in reply  the head wagged sidewise  no one allowed aboard said the man  heres a letter to the captain from mr jones said maud exhibiting it  the word seemed magical immediately the head disappeared and an instant later the boarding ladder began to descend but the man a subofficer dressed in a neat uniform of white and gold came quickly down the steps and held out his hand for the letter  beg pardon said he touching his cap to the ladies but the rules are very strict aboard the arabella will you please wait until ive taken this to the captain thank you  then he ran lightly up the steps and they remained seated in the launch until he returned  the captain begs you to come aboard he then said speaking very respectfully but with a face that betrayed his wonder at the order of his superior then he escorted them up the side to the deck which was marvelously neat and attractive some half a dozen sailors lounged here and there and these stared as wonderingly at the invasion of strangers as the subaltern had done but their guide did not pause longer than to see that they had all reached the deck safely when he led them into a spacious cabin  here they faced captain carg whom patsy afterward declared was the tallest thinnest chilliest man she had ever encountered his hair was grizzled and hung low on his neck his chin was very long and ended in a point his nose was broad with sensitive nostrils that marked every breath he drew as for his eyes which instantly attracted attention they were brown and gentle as a girls but had that retrospective expression that suggests faraway thoughts or an utter lack of interest in ones surroundings they never looked at but through one the effect of cargs eyes was distinctly disconcerting  the commander of the arabella bowed with much dignity as his guests entered and with a sweep of his long arm he muttered in distant tones pray be seated they obeyed the cabin was luxuriously furnished and there was no lack of comfortable chairs  somehow despite the courteous words and attitude of captain carg there was something about him that repelled confidence already maud and patsy were wondering if such a man could be loyal and true  my young master he was saying as he glanced at the letter he still held in his hand tells me that any questions you may ask i may answer as freely as i am permitted to  what does that mean sir maud inquired for the speech was quite ambiguous  that i await your queries miss with another perfunctory bow in her direction  she hesitated puzzled how to proceed  mr jones is in a little trouble she finally began he has been mistaken for some other man andthey have put him in jail until he can be examined by the federal judge of this district  the captains face exhibited no expression whatever even the eyes failed to express surprise at her startling news he faced his visitors without emotion  at the examination maud went on it will be necessary for him to prove he is from sangoa  no reply the captain sat like a statue  he must also prove that certain pearls found in his possession came from sangoa  still no reply maud began to falter and fidget beth was amused patsy was fast growing indignant flo had a queer expression on her pretty face that denoted mischief to such an extent that it alarmed her aunt jane  im afraid said maud that unless you come to your masters assistance captain carg he will be sent to austria a prisoner charged with a serious crime  she meant this assertion to be very impressive but it did not seem to affect the man in the least she sighed and flo with a giggle broke an awkward pause  well why dont you get busy maud she asked  iin what way flo asked her sister catching at the suggestion implied  captain carg would make a splendid motion picture actor declared the younger miss stanton audaciously he sticks close to his cues you see and wont move till he gets one he will answer your questions yes he has said he would but you may prattle until doomsday without effect so far as he is concerned unless you finish your speech with an interrogation point  mrs montrose gave a gasp of dismay while maud flushed painfully the captain however allowed a gleam of admiration to soften his grim features as he stared fixedly at saucy flo patsy marked this fleeting change of expression at once and said hastily  i think maud dear the captain is waiting to be questioned  at this he cast a grateful look in miss doyles direction and bowed to her maud began to appreciate the peculiar situation and marshalled her questions in orderly array  tell me please where is sangoa she began  in the south seas miss  will you give me the latitude and longitude  i cannot  oh you mean that you will not  i have been commanded to forget the latitude and longitude of sangoa  but this is folly she exclaimed much annoyed such absurd reticence may be fatal to mr jones interests  he made no reply to this and after reflection she tried again  what is the nearest land to sangoa  toerdal said he  what is that an island  yes  is it on the maps is it charted  no miss  she silenced flos aggravating giggle with a frown  tell me sir she continued what is the nearest land to sangoa that is known to the world  he smiled faintly as he replied i cannot tell  uncle john had grown very uneasy by this time and he decided he ought to attempt to assist maud so addressing captain carg he said in a positive tone  we quite understand sir that it has been the policy of the owners of sangoa to guard all knowledge of the islands whereabouts from the outside world as well as the fact that its pearl fisheries are very rich we understand that an influx of treasureseekers would embarrass the sangoans but we are close friends of young mr jones and have no desire to usurp his island kingdom or seize his pearls our only anxiety is to free him from an unjust suspicion a foolish man named le drieux accuses jones of stealing a choice collection of pearls from a lady in austria and fleeing with them to america he has a photograph of the real criminal taken abroad which curiously resembles your young master  here the captain turned a quick look upon the speaker and for the first time his eyes lost their dull expression but he made no remark and uncle john continued  this man le drieux found several choice pearls in the possession of mr jones which he claims are a part of the stolen collection hence he obtained your masters arrest jones says he brought the pearls from sangoa his home where they were found no one here knows anything of sangoa so they regard his story with suspicion now sir we believe that through you we can prove he has told the truth and so secure his release here is the important question will you help us  willingly sir replied the captain  are you forbidden to tell us where sangoa is or anything about the island  yes sir i am forbidden to do that under any circumstances was the ready answer  have you been to sangoa since you landed mr jones in san francisco some fifteen months ago  yes sir  and did you bring back with you on this trip any pearls  yes sir  have you already disposed of them  no sir  why not  i am awaiting orders from my master  has he been aboard since you anchored here  no sir  what were your instructions  to anchor on this coast and await his coming  well said mr merrick reflectively i believe you can prove our case without telling the location of sangoa an exhibition of the pearls you have brought ought to convince any reasonable judge are there many of them in this lot  not so many as usual sir  are they very choice ones  not so choice as usual sir  uncle john was greatly disappointed but maud exclaimed eagerly  let us see them please  that was not a question but the captain rose at once bowed and left the cabin it was some ten minutes before he returned followed by two men who bore between them a heavy bronze chest which they placed upon the cabin floor then they left the room and the captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked a secret panel in the wainscoting of the cabin a small compartment was disclosed in which hung another key on an iron hook he removed this and with it unlocked the chest drawingfrom its recesses several trays which he deposited upon the table these trays were lined and padded with white velvet and when the covers were removed the girls who had crowded around the table uttered cries of astonishment and delight  they may not be as numerous or as choice as usual murmured mrs montrose but they are the most amazing lot of pearls i have ever beheld  and did all these come from sangoa maud asked the captain  they represent two months fishing on the coast of our island he replied but not the best two months of the year the weather was bad there were many storms  why the pearls that ajo gave us were insignificant when compared with these cried beth this collection must be worth an enormous sum uncle john  uncle john merely nodded he had been thinking as he studied the pearls and now turned to captain carg  will you come ashore and testify before the judge in behalf of your master  yes if he asks me to do so  and will you bring these pearls with you  if my master orders it  very good we will have him send you instructions  the captain bowed after which he turned to the table and began replacing the trays in the chest then he locked it again hung the key in the secret aperture and closed the panel a whistle summoned the two seamen who bore away the chest accompanied by the captain in person  when they were left alone maud said anxiously  is there anything more we can do here  i think not replied mr merrick  then let us get back i want to complete my evidence at once for no one knows when the judge will summon ajo for examination  they thanked the captain when he rejoined them but he remained as silent and undemonstrative as ever so they took their departure without further ceremony and returned to the shore     chapter xxiii  the advantage of a day   that evening le drieux appeared in the lobby of the hotel and sat himself comfortably down as if his sole desire in life was to read the evening paper and smoke his afterdinner cigar he cast a selfsatisfied and rather supercilious glance in the direction of the merrick party which on this occasion included the stantons and their aunt but he made no attempt to approach the corner where they were seated  maud however as soon as she saw le drieux asked arthur weldon to interview the man and endeavor to obtain from him the exact date when jack andrews landed in new york uncle john had already wired to major doyle patsys father to get the steamship lists and find which boat andrews had come on and the date of its arrival but no answer had as yet been received  arthur made a pretext of buying a cigar at the counter and then strolled aimlessly about until he came as if by chance near to where le drieux was sitting making a pretense of suddenly observing the man he remarked casually  ah good evening  good evening mr weldon replied le drieux a note of illsuppressed triumph in his voice  i suppose you are now content to rest on your laurels pending the formal examination said arthur  i am sir but the examination is a mere form you know i have already cabled the commissioner of police at vienna and received a reply stating that the austrian ambassador would make a prompt demand for extradition and the papers would be forwarded from washington to the austrian consul located in this city the consul has also been instructed to render me aid in transporting the prisoner to vienna all this will require several days time so you see we are in no hurry to conclude the examination  i see said arthur is it then your intention to accompany the prisoner to vienna  of course i have not mentioned the fact to you before but i hold a commission from the chief of police of vienna authorizing me to arrest jack andrews wherever i may find him and deliver him up for trial my firm procured for me this commission as they are very anxious to recover the lost pearls  why  well to be frank sir the countess still owes our firm a large sum for purchases she had almost her entire fortune tied up in that collection and unless it is recovered  i can well appreciate the anxiety of your firm but aside from that mr le drieux i suppose a big reward has been offered  not big just a fair amount it will repay me quite handsomely for my trouble in this affair but of course my firm gets half of the reward  they are not too generous you deserve it all  thank you it has been an interesting episode mr weldon  it has been more than that i consider this escapade of andrews quite a romance or is it more of a tragedy in your opinion  it will be a tragedy for andrews before hes through with it replied le drieux grimly theyre pretty severe on the longfingered gentry over there in europe and you must remember that if the fellow lives through the sentence they will undoubtedly impose upon him in vienna he has still to answer for the paris robbery and the london murder its all up with andrews i guess and its a good thing too for he is too clever to remain at large  i do not consider him so clever as his captor said arthur smoothly it did not take you long to discover where he had hidden why he has only returned to america about fifteen months ago  eleven months agoeven less than that i think retorted le drieux with much pride let me see taking out a notebook andrews landed from the princess irene on the twentyseventh of january last  oh the twentyseventh are you sure of that said arthur  of course  i was under the impression he landed on the twentyfifth  no you are wrong why i met the boat myself but missed him although he was on the passenger list he disembarked very slyly i afterward learned being doubtless afraid he would be arrested but at that time i had no positive evidence against him  arthur asked a few more questions of no importance and then bade le drieux good night and rejoined the girls  you win maud he remarked as he sat down that clew of yours was an inspiration andrews arrived in america on january twentyseventh just one day after jones had a motion picture of himself taken at the stockholders meeting of the continental film company  then we neednt worry over ajo any longer asserted patsy joyfully with this evidence and the testimony of captain carg and his pearls the most stupid judge on earth would declare the boy innocent why beth we shall get our theatres built after all     chapter xxiv  picture number nineteen   well where have you been demanded goldstein gruffly as maud stanton entered his office the next morning in response to a summons from the continental manager what made you run away yesterday dont you know such things make us lots of trouble and cost us money  im not worrying about that replied maud as she composedly sat down opposite the manager  goldstein glared at her but he was cautious  youre a fine actress miss stanton and youre popular on the films he said but if you cannot attend to business we are paying you too much money  indeed  no other firm could afford to give you so much you know that and the only reason we are so extravagant is because you are one of our features  am i to take this as a dismissal she asked carelessly  dismissal he cried holding up his hands of course not who is talking of dismissal but i owe a duty to my firm such actions as yours in running away from rehearsals must have aareprimand not severe i am not so angry as grieved but a reprimand is your dueand that flyaway sister of yours is just as bad  we went to assist your presidentmr jonesto establish his innocence of the awful charge made against him she explained  bah you cant do that no one can save him he replied with triumph and satisfaction mingled in his tone  she looked at him thoughtfully  you seem pleased with the idea that he is guilty mr goldstein  i am glad he is caught what is jones to me an interloper a boy who gets money buys stock and then interferes with a business he knows nothing about you are a professional miss stanton you know how we who are in the game have won our knowledge of it by long experience by careful study by keeping the thousand threads of the rope of success twisted tightly together any fool could buy this business but only an expert could run it successfully you know that so i am glad this interfering boy is wiped off the slate forever  but he isnt she protested you still have this boy to reckon with goldstein when he is examined by the judge he will be set free for all the evidence is in his favor and there is ample proof that he is not the man they are after and that reminds me there is a negative here that was made at the directors meeting in january a year ago which shows mr jones taking control of the continental  i have never seen it he said shaking his head  it is here though and i want a positive printed at once and mounted on a reel so it can be exhibited before the judge have alfred get it out of the vault  why should i do that he inquired frowning  because if you refuse mr jones is quite likely to find another manager no other firm would pay you so much as you are getting here you know that  he grinned with delight at the thrust then grew solemn  you are sure he will go free  positive returned maud he doesnt really need that film but it would be good policyexcellent policyfor you to produce it  alfred called the manager bring me the stock book  he ran his finger down the pages  januaryeheh  january twentysixth she said  here it is special of annual meeting cfm co280 feetno 19 get number nineteen out of the vault alfred  while the young man was gone he relapsed into thought maud waited patiently  you see resumed the manager abruptly i am making more money for the continental than i get paid for that is because i know how it is not good business to cut down the profits therefore i should be paid a bigger salary miss stanton youre a friend of young jones who controls this company yon might talk to him about me  i will she said  you might say i know every trick of the trade tell jones how all the other film makers are crazy to get me but say how i refuse more money because i believe our directors will wake up to my value and raise my salary that sounds pretty good eh  it sounds remarkable  and its no dream ah here comes alfred  the clerk laid upon the table a round box coated with paraffin to exclude the air a tag was attached to the box describing its contents  number nineteen quite right take it to the printing room and tell mcdonald to make me a copy as quickly as possible tell him to let me know when its dry and ready to run  as the clerk disappeared maud said  i neednt wait i suppose  no werner wants you at the rehearsal of the love of a princess before you go home tonight ill call you in to see the run of number nineteen then you may take the film to joneswith my compliments  at five oclock when she was dressing to go home maud was summoned to the little dark room where all films are exhibited trimmed and tested before being sent out she took aunt jane and flo with her and they found goldstein already waiting and the operator standing by his machine  the scene was short and not very exciting although of interest in the present crisis it showed the interior of the hall where the stockholders meeting was held and began with the assembling of the members two or three pompous individuals then seated themselves facing the others and the proceedings began a slim boy on a back bench arose and said something panic was at once written on the faces of the former officers they gesticulated their lips moved rapidly the boy easily recognized as a jones advanced and displayed a lot of papers which were carefully examined he then took the presidents chair the former officers fled in disgust and the throng of stockholders wildly applauded then the light went out the machine stopped and goldstein opened the door to let in light and air  it was the same kid all right he remarked i had never seen this film run before but it shows how jones called the turn on the old officers in great shape i wonder where he got all the money  maud secured his promise to send an operator to town to exhibit the film before the judge whenever he might be required then she went to her hotel fully satisfied that she had done all in her power to assist a jones of sangoa     chapter xxv  judgment   a telegram from major doyle corroborated le drieuxs assertion that jack andrews had arrived at the port of new york via the princess irene on january twentyseventh a report from lawyer colby stated that he was now so thoroughly posted on everything pertaining to pearls that he could easily confound the expert mr isidore le drieux there the matter rested for three days during which the stanton girls continued their work at the studio and uncle johns nieces busied themselves enjoying the charms of the ideal hollywood climate then came the news that the judge would call jones for examination at nine oclock on friday morning the thirteenth  friday the thirteenth said patsy with a grimace i hope ajo isnt superstitious  that combination proves lucky for some people replied arthur laughing let us hope that jones is one of them  of course we shall all go to see what happens said beth and to this there was no dissenting voice  maud obtained a letter from jones to captain carg asking him to be on hand and this she dispatched by a safe messenger to the yacht arabella she also told goldstein to have his operator in attendance with the film finally a conference was called that evening with mr colby at which the complete program of defense was carefully rehearsed  really said the lawyer theres nothing to this case its a regular walkaway believe me im almost ashamed to take mr jones money for conducting a case that miss stanton has all cut and dried for me ill not receive one half the credit i should had the thing been complicated or difficult however ive learned so much about pearls that im almost tempted to go into the jewelry business  friday morning was bright and coolone of those perfect days for which southern california is famous judge wilton appeared in court with a tranquil expression upon his face that proved he was in a contented mood all conditions augured well for the prisoner  the prosecution was represented by two well known attorneys who had brought a dozen witnesses to support their charge among them being the austrian consul the case opened with the statement that the prisoner jackson dowd andrews alias a jones while a guest at the villa of the countess ahmberg near vienna had stolen from his hostess a valuable collection of pearls which he had secretly brought to america some of the stolen booty the prisoner had disposed of it was asserted a part had been found in his possession at the time of his arrest some of the pearls had been mounted by brock  co the los angeles jewelers at his request and by him presented to several acquaintances he had recently made but who were innocent of any knowledge of his past history or his misdeeds therefore the prosecution demanded that the prisoner be kept in custody until the arrival of extradition papers which were already on the way and that on the arrival of these papers andrews should be turned over to le drieux a representative of the vienna police and by him taken to austria the scene of his crime for trial and punishment  the judge followed the charge of the prosecution rather indifferently being already familiar with it then he asked if there was any defense  colby took the floor he denied that the prisoner was jackson dowd andrews or that he had ever been in vienna it was a case of mistaken identity his clients liberty had been outraged by the stupid blunders of the prosecution he demanded the immediate release of the prisoner  have you evidence to support this plea inquired judge wilton  we have your honor but the prosecution must first prove its charge  the prosecution promptly responded to the challenge the photograph of andrews taken abroad was shown two recognized experts in physiognomy declared after comparison that it was undoubtedly the photograph of the prisoner then le drieux took the stand he read a newspaper account of the robbery he produced a list of the pearls attested by the countess herself each individual pearl was described and its color weight and value given then le drieux exhibited the pearls taken from jones and except for the small ones in the brooch which had been presented to mrs montrose he checked off every pearl against his list weighing them before the judge and describing their color  during this judge wilton continually nodded approval such evidence was concise and indisputable it seemed moreover the defense readily admitted that the pearls exhibited had all been in jones possession  then colby got up to refute the evidence  mr jones he began has  give the prisoners full name said the judge  his full name is a jones  what does the a stand for  it is only an initial your honor mr jones has no other name  puh he ought to have taken some other name names are cheap sneered the judge  colby ignored the point  mr jones is a resident of sangoa where he was born until he landed at san francisco fifteen months ago he had never set foot on any land but that of his native island  where is sangoa demanded the judge  it is an island of the south seas  what nationality  it is independent it was purchased from uruguay by mr jones father many years ago and now belongs exclusively to his son  your information is indefinite snapped the judge  i realize that your honor but my client deems it wise to keep the location of his island a secret because he has valuable pearl fisheries on its shores the pearls exhibited by the prosecution were all found at sangoa  how do you account then for their checking so accurately against the list of stolen pearls  i can make almost any pearls check with that list which represents a huge collection of almost every size weight and color replied colby to prove this i will introduce in evidence captain carg of sangoa who recently arrived at santa monica bay with the last proceeds of the pearl fisheries of the island  captain carg was on hand with his two sailors guarding the chest he now produced the trays of pearls and spread them on the desk before the amazed eyes of the judge le drieux was astounded and showed it plainly on his face  colby now borrowed the list and picking up a pearl from the tray weighed it on le drieuxs scales and then found a parallel to it on the list this he did with several of the pearls chosen at random until one of le drieuxs attorneys took the expert aside and whispered to him then le drieuxs expression changed from chagrin to joy and coming forward he exclaimed  your honor this is the collectionthe balance of itwhich was stolen from the countess ahmberg  the judge looked at him a moment leaned back in his chair and nodded his head impressively  what nonsense protested colby these trays contain twice the number of pearls included in that entire list as your honor may plainly see  of course retorted le drieux eagerly here are also the pearls from the necklace of princess lemoine and the london collection of lady grandison your honor in his audacity the defense has furnished us proof positive that this prisoner can be none other than the adventurer and clever thief jack andrews  it was in vain that colby declared these pearls had just come from sangoa where they were found the judge cut him short and asked if he had any other evidence to advance  these pearls he added indicating the trays i shall take possession of they must remain in my custody until their owners claim them or captain carg can prove they are the lawful property of the prisoner  consternation now pervaded the ranks of the defense the girls were absolutely dismayed while uncle john and arthur weldon wore bewildered looks only jones remained composed an amused smile curling the corners of his delicate mouth as he eyed the judge who was to decide his fate  on the side of the prosecution were looks of triumph le drieux already regarded his case as won  colby now played his trump card which maud stantons logic and energy had supplied the defense  the prosecution said he has stated that the alleged robbery was committed at vienna on the evening of september fifteenth and that jack andrews arrived in america on the steamship princess irene on the afternoon of the january twentyseventh following am i correct in those dates  the judge consulted his stenographer  the dates mentioned are correct he said pompously  here are the papers issued by the commander of the port of san francisco proving that the yacht arabella of sangoa anchored in that harbor on october twelfth and disembarked one passenger namely a jones of sangoa  that might or might not have been the prisoner declared the prosecuting attorney  true said the judge the name a jones is neither distinguished nor distinguishing  on the evening of january twentysixth twentyfour hours before jack andrews landed in america continued colby the prisoner mr a jones appeared at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the continental film manufacturing company in new york and was formally elected president of that organization  what is your proof inquired the judge stifling a yawn  i beg to submit the minutes of the meeting attested by its secretary  the judge glanced at the minutes  we object to this evidence said the opposing attorney there is no proof that the a jones referred to is the prisoner  the minutes said colby state that a motion picture was taken of the meeting i have the film here in this room and beg permission to exhibit it before your honor as evidence  the judge was a bit startled at so novel a suggestion but assented with a nod in a twinkling the operator had suspended a rollerscreen from the chandelier dependent from the ceiling pulled down the window shades and attached his projecting machine to an electriclight socket  then the picture flashed upon the screen it was not entirely distinct because the room could not be fully darkened and the current was not strong yet every face in the gathering of stockholders could be plainly recognized jones especially as the central figure could not be mistaken and no one who looked upon the picture could doubt his identity  when the exhibition was concluded and the room again lightened le drieuxs face was visibly perturbed and anxious while his attorneys sat glum and disconcerted  colby now put goldstein on the stand who testified that he recognized jones as president of his company and the owner of the majority of stock the young man had come to him with unimpeachable credentials to that effect  the girls were now smiling and cheerful to them the defense was absolutely convincing but le drieuxs attorneys were skillful fighters and did not relish defeat they advanced the theory that the motion picture just shown had been made at a later dale and substituted for the one mentioned in the minutes of the meeting they questioned goldstein who admitted that he had never seen jones until a few days previous the manager denied however any substitution of the picture he was not a very satisfactory witness for the defense and colby was sorry he had summoned him  as for the judge he seemed to accept the idea of the substitution with alacrity he had practically decided against jones in the matter of the pearls now he listened carefully to the arguments of the prosecution and cut colby short when he raised objections to their sophistry  finally judge wilton rose to state his decision  the evidence submitted in proof of the alleged fact that the prisoner is jack andrews and that jack andrews may have robbed the countess ahmberg of vienna of her valuable collection of pearls is in the judgment of this court clear and convincing he said the lawyer for the defense has further succeeded in entangling his client by exhibiting an additional assortment of pearls which may likewise be stolen property the attempt to impose upon this court a mythical island called sangoa isehdistinctly reprehensible this court is not so easily hoodwinked therefore in consideration of the evidence advanced i declare that the prisoner is jack andrews otherwise jackson dowd andrews otherwise parading under the alias of a jones and i recognize the claim of the austrian police to his person that he may be legally tried for his alleged crimes in the territory where it is alleged he committed them therefore i order that the prisoner be held for requisition and turned over to the proper authorities when the papers arrive the court is adjourned     chapter xxvi  sunshine after rain   of course not one of our friends agreed with the judge indignation and resentment were written on every faceexcept that of goldstein the manager rubbed his hands softly together and approaching maud he whispered  you neednt speak to jones about me its all right i guess he wont be interfering with me any more eh and come early tomorrow morning weve got a lot of rehearsing to do today i will call a holiday for you and believe me miss stanton this is nothing to worry any of us the judge settles it right or wrong for the law defies us all  as the manager hurried away uncle john looked after him and said  i wonder if he realizes how true his words are the law defies us all how helpless we are to oppose injustice and oppression when one man with a mans limitations and prejudices is clothed with authority to condemn us  colby stood silent the poor fellows eyes were full of unshed tears  this is my first case and my last said he i won it honestly it was the judge not the evidence that defeated me im going to rent my office and apply for a job as a chauffeur  jones was the least affected of the group never mind friends he said to them it will all come right in the end if you will stand by me colby ill retain you to plead my case in the austrian court or at least advise my austrian lawyers ive an idea they will treat me fairly over there in vienna  its outrageous quoth indignant patsy doyle id like to give that judge a piece of my mind  if you did replied arthur hed fine you for contempt  it would be a just line in that case said patsy so im sure he wouldnt do it  the jailer had come to take the prisoner back to his cell he smiled whimsically at miss doyles speech and remarked  theres always one side to kick miss whichever way the judge decides it was only solomon who could satisfy everybody  clear the room shouted the bailiff  captain cargs men took the empty chest back to the launch the captain followed them after pressing the hand of his young master who said wait for orders captain uncle john took his flock back to the hotel where they gathered in his room and held an indignation meeting here it was safe to give full vent to their chagrin and disappointment  every bit of honest evidence was on our side declared maud i shall never be able to understand why we lost  bribery and corruption said flo ill bet a cookie le drieux divided the reward with the judge  i suppose its all up with ajo now sighed beth regretfully  yes replied colby who had accompanied them there is nothing more to be done for him at present from the judges order there is no appeal in such a case mr jones must go to vienna for trial but there he may secure an acquittal  he is very brave i think said patsy this affair must have hurt his pride but he smiles through it all in his condition of health the confinement and humiliation may well shorten his life yet he has made no murmur  hes good stuff that boy commented uncle john perhaps it is due to that john paul blood his father was so proud of  when arthur went into the lobby a little later he found le drieux seated comfortably and smoking a long cigar the pearl expert nodded to the young ranchman with so much evident satisfaction that arthur could not resist engaging him in conversation  well you won he remarked taking a vacant chair beside le drieux  yes of course was the reply but ill admit that fellow andrews is a smooth one why at one time he had even me puzzled with his alibis and his evidence that flash of the pearls was the cleverest trick i ever heard of but it didnt go id warned the judge to look out for a scoop he knew he was dealing with one of the most slippery rogues in captivity  see here le drieux said arthur let us be honest with one another now that the thing is settled and diplomacy is uncalled for do you really believe that jones is jack andrews  me i know it mr weldon i dont pose as a detective but im considered to have a shrewd insight into human character and from the first moment i set eyes on him i was positive that jones was the famous jack andrews i can understand how you people generous and trusting have been deceived in the fellow i admire the grit youve all shown in standing by him to the last i havent a particle of malice toward any one of you i assure younot even toward andrews himself  then why have you bounded him so persistently  for two reasons said le drieux as a noted pearl expert i wanted to prove my ability to run down the thief and as a man in modest circumstances i wanted the reward  how much will you get  all together the rewards aggregate twenty thousand dollars ill get half and my firm will get half  i think said arthur to test the man that jones would have paid you double that amount to let him alone  le drieux shook his head then he smiled  i dont mind telling you mr weldonin strict confidence of coursethat i approached jones on that very subject the day he was placed in jail he must have been sure his tricks would clear him for he refused to give me a single penny i imagine he is very sorry right now dont you sir  no said arthur i dont i still believe in his innocence  le drieux stared at him incredulously  what after that examination of today he demanded  before and after there was no justice in the decision of judge wilton he was unduly prejudiced  be careful sir  we are talking confidentially  to be sure but you astonish me i understand the character of andrews so thoroughly that i fail to comprehend how any sensible person can believe in him talk about prejudice  i suppose you are to remain at this hotel said arthur evading further argument  yes until the papers arrive they ought to be here by monday then i shall take andrews to new york and we will board the first steamer for europe  arthur left him le drieux puzzled him more than he puzzled le drieux the expert seemed sincere in the belief that he had trapped in jones a noted criminal weldon could not help wondering as he walked away if possibly he and his friends had been deceived in a jones of sangoa the doubt was but momentary yet it had forced itself into his mind  on saturday afternoon they all made a visit to the prisoner and tried to cheer him again on sunday they calledthe stantons and merricks and weldons and all young jones received them with composure and begged them not to worry on his account  i am quite comfortable in this jail i assure you said he on my journey to vienna i shall be able to bribe le drieux to let me have such comforts as i desire there is but one experience i shrink from the passage across the atlantic if it brings a return of my former malady i shall suffer terribly  it may not be so bad as you fear patsy assured him although in her heart she realized it might be the death of the boy often those who are distressed by a voyage on the pacific endure the atlantic very well  that is encouraging said he it is my dread of the water that has prevented me from returning to sangoa or even visiting my yacht and this reminds me of a favor i wish to ask  you may rely upon our friendship said maud  i believe that here is a letter to captain carg putting the arabella at your disposal until my return from vienna i have named mr merrick as the commander of the yacht in my absence and if you feel inclined to make the trip and can spare the time i would like you all to make a voyage to sangoa  to sangoa they cried in chorus  yes i am ambitious to prove to you who have been my staunch friends that the island is indeed there incidentally you will become acquainted with the prettiest place in all the world my house will be at your disposal while you remain and i am sure you will find it fairly comfortable  they were so amazed at this proposition that at first no one found words to answer the boy it was flo naturally who first collected her thoughts  it will be awfully jolly she cried clapping her hands with delight im sure maud and i need a vacation lets stick up our noses at goldstein and sail away to the mysterious isle what do you say girls and you mr merrick  i believe my boy said uncle john laying a kindly hand on the youths shoulder that all of us are inclined to take advantage of your offer that is if you are sure we can be of no further use to you in your difficulties  i am taking colby abroad with me and he can do all that may be done until after my trial then i hope to rejoin you here and am looking forward to a jolly reunion  uncle john took the letters which ajo had written to captain carg to his superintendent in sangoa and to his housekeeper then they all pressed the boys hand and went away                                       monday morning the extradition papers arrived le drieux exhibited them proudly to young weldon to mr merrick and even to the girls who regarded the documents with shuddering awe  well take the night train said the man that will get us to new york on friday in time to catch the saturday steamer for calais  as he spoke a boy approached and handed le drieux a telegram  excuse me said he and opened it with an important flourish the next moment his face fell he staggered and sank half fainting into a chair which mr merrick pushed toward him  patsy ran for some water maud stanton fanned the man with a folded newspaper arthur weldon picked up the telegram which had fluttered from le drieuxs grasp and deliberately read it then he too sank gasping into a chair  listen girls he cried his voice shrill with emotion what do you think of this  jack andrews arrested here in new york today by burns detectives countess ahmbergs collection of pearls was found in his possession intact return here first train  signed eckstrom  co  there was a moment of tense silence  flo clapped her hands  come on she shouted in glee lets go and tell ajo
