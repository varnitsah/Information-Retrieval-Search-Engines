9910072	an outcast of the islands  by joseph conrad      pues el delito mayor del hombre es haber nacito calderon    to edward lancelot sanderson    authors note  an outcast of the islands is my second novel in the absolute sense of the word second in conception second in execution second as it were in its essence there was no hesitation halfformed plan vague idea or the vaguest reverie of anything else between it and almayers folly the only doubt i suffered from after the publication of almayers folly was whether i should write another line for print those days now grown so dim had their poignant moments neither in my mind nor in my heart had i then given up the sea in truth i was clinging to it desperately all the more desperately because against my will i could not help feeling that there was something changed in my relation to it almayers folly had been finished and done with the mood itself was gone but it had left the memory of an experience that both in thought and emotion was unconnected with the sea and i suppose that part of my moral being which is rooted in consistency was badly shaken i was a victim of contrary stresses which produced a state of immobility i gave myself up to indolence since it was impossible for me to face both ways i had elected to face nothing the discovery of new values in life is a very chaotic experience there is a tremendous amount of jostling and confusion and a momentary feeling of darkness i let my spirit float supine over that chaos  a phrase of edward garnetts is as a matter of fact responsible for this book the first of the friends i made for myself by my pen it was but natural that he should be the recipient at that time of my confidences one evening when we had dined together and he had listened to the account of my perplexities i fear he must have been growing a little tired of them he pointed out that there was no need to determine my future absolutely then he added you have the style you have the temperament why not write another i believe that as far as one man may wish to influence another mans life edward garnett had a great desire that i should go on writing at that time and i may say ever afterwards he was always very patient and gentle with me what strikes me most however in the phrase quoted above which was offered to me in a tone of detachment is not its gentleness but its effective wisdom had he said why not go on writing it is very probable he would have scared me away from pen and ink for ever but there was nothing either to frighten one or arouse ones antagonism in the mere suggestion to write another and thus a dead point in the revolution of my affairs was insidiously got over the word another did it at about eleven oclock of a nice london night edward and i walked along interminable streets talking of many things and i remember that on getting home i sat down and wrote about half a page of an outcast of the islands before i slept this was committing myself definitely i wont say to another life but to another book there is apparently something in my character which will not allow me to abandon for good any piece of work i have begun i have laid aside many beginnings i have laid them aside with sorrow with disgust with rage with melancholy and even with selfcontempt but even at the worst i had an uneasy consciousness that i would have to go back to them  an outcast of the islands belongs to those novels of mine that were never laid aside and though it brought me the qualification of exotic writer i dont think the charge was at all justified  for the life of me i dont see that there is the slightest exotic spirit in the conception or style of that novel it is certainly the most tropical of my eastern tales the mere scenery got a great hold on me as i went on perhaps because i may just as well confess that the story itself was never very near my heart  it engaged my imagination much more than my affection as to my feeling for willems it was but the regard one cannot help having for ones own creation obviously i could not be indifferent to a man on whose head i had brought so much evil simply by imagining him such as he appears in the noveland that too on a very slight foundation  the man who suggested willems to me was not particularly interesting in himself my interest was aroused by his dependent position his strange dubious status of a mistrusted disliked wornout european living on the reluctant toleration of that settlement hidden in the heart of the forestland up that sombre stream which our ship was the only white mens ship to visit with his hollow cleanshaved cheeks a heavy grey moustache and eyes without any expression whatever clad always in a spotless sleeping suit much befrogged in front which left his lean neck wholly uncovered and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers he wandered silently amongst the houses in daylight almost as dumb as an animal and apparently much more homeless i dont know what he did with himself at night he must have had a place a hut a palmleaf shed some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and his change of sleeping suits an air of futile mystery hung over him something not exactly dark but obviously ugly the only definite statement i could extract from anybody was that it was he who had brought the arabs into the river that must have happened many years before but how did he bring them into the river he could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens i knew that almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes on the date of that fateful advent and yet the very first time we dined with almayer there was willems sitting at table with us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast obviously shunned by everybody never addressed by any one and for all recognition of his existence getting now and then from almayer a venomous glance which i observed with great surprise in the course of the whole evening he ventured one single remark which i didnt catch because his articulation was imperfect as of a man who had forgotten how to speak i was the only person who seemed aware of the sound willems subsided presently he retired pointedly unnoticedinto the forest maybe its immensity was there within three hundred yards of the verandah ready to swallow up anything almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while he glared angrily at the retreating back didnt that fellow bring the arabs into the river nevertheless willems turned up next morning on almayers verandah from the bridge of the steamer i could see plainly these two breakfasting together tete a tete and i suppose in dead silence one with his air of being no longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes now and then with intense dislike  it was clear that in those days willems lived on almayers charity yet on returning two months later to sambir i heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steamlaunch belonging to the arabs to make some discovery or other on account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction moreover i was a newcomer the youngest of the company and i suspect not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence i was not much concerned about that exclusion the faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching almayers affairs amused me vastly almayer was obviously very much affected i believe he missed willems immensely he wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain i could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences then one morning as i came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table almayer checked himself in his lowtoned discourse my captains face was perfectly impenetrable there was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone  one things certain if he finds anything worth having up there they will poison him like a dog  disconnected though it was that phrase as food for thought was distinctly worth hearing we left the river three days afterwards and i never returned to sambir but whatever happened to the protagonist of my willems nobody can deny that i have recorded for him a less squalid fate  j c 1919     part i  an outcast of the islands  chapter one  when he stepped off the straight and narrow path of his peculiar honesty it was with an inward assertion of unflinching resolve to fall back again into the monotonous but safe stride of virtue as soon as his little excursion into the wayside quagmires had produced the desired effect it was going to be a short episodea sentence in brackets so to speakin the flowing tale of his life a thing of no moment to be done unwillingly yet neatly and to be quickly forgotten he imagined that he could go on afterwards looking at the sunshine enjoying the shade breathing in the perfume of flowers in the small garden before his house he fancied that nothing would be changed that he would be able as heretofore to tyrannize goodhumouredly over his halfcaste wife to notice with tender contempt his pale yellow child to patronize loftily his darkskinned brotherinlaw who loved pink neckties and wore patentleather boots on his little feet and was so humble before the white husband of the lucky sister those were the delights of his life and he was unable to conceive that the moral significance of any act of his could interfere with the very nature of things could dim the light of the sun could destroy the perfume of the flowers the submission of his wife the smile of his child the awestruck respect of leonard da souza and of all the da souza family that familys admiration was the great luxury of his life it rounded and completed his existence in a perpetual assurance of unquestionable superiority he loved to breathe the coarse incense they offered before the shrine of the successful white man the man that had done them the honour to marry their daughter sister cousin the rising man sure to climb very high the confidential clerk of hudig  co they were a numerous and an unclean crowd living in ruined bamboo houses surrounded by neglected compounds on the outskirts of macassar he kept them at arms length and even further off perhaps having no illusions as to their worth they were a halfcaste lazy lot and he saw them as they wereragged lean unwashed undersized men of various ages shuffling about aimlessly in slippers motionless old women who looked like monstrous bags of pink calico stuffed with shapeless lumps of fat and deposited askew upon decaying rattan chairs in shady corners of dusty verandahs young women slim and yellow bigeyed longhaired moving languidly amongst the dirt and rubbish of their dwellings as if every step they took was going to be their very last he heard their shrill quarrellings the squalling of their children the grunting of their pigs he smelt the odours of the heaps of garbage in their courtyards and he was greatly disgusted but he fed and clothed that shabby multitude those degenerate descendants of portuguese conquerors he was their providence he kept them singing his praises in the midst of their laziness of their dirt of their immense and hopeless squalor and he was greatly delighted they wanted much but he could give them all they wanted without ruining himself in exchange he had their silent fear their loquacious love their noisy veneration it is a fine thing to be a providence and to be told so on every day of ones life it gives one a feeling of enormously remote superiority and willems revelled in it he did not analyze the state of his mind but probably his greatest delight lay in the unexpressed but intimate conviction that should he close his hand all those admiring human beings would starve his munificence had demoralized them an easy task since he descended amongst them and married joanna they had lost the little aptitude and strength for work they might have had to put forth under the stress of extreme necessity they lived now by the grace of his will this was power willems loved it in another and perhaps a lower plane his days did not want for their less complex but more obvious pleasures he liked the simple games of skillbilliards also games not so simple and calling for quite another kind of skillpoker he had been the aptest pupil of a steadyeyed sententious american who had drifted mysteriously into macassar from the wastes of the pacific and after knocking about for a time in the eddies of town life had drifted out enigmatically into the sunny solitudes of the indian ocean the memory of the californian stranger was perpetuated in the game of pokerwhich became popular in the capital of celebes from that timeand in a powerful cocktail the recipe for which is transmittedin the kwangtung dialectfrom head boy to head boy of the chinese servants in the sunda hotel even to this day willems was a connoisseur in the drink and an adept at the game of those accomplishments he was moderately proud of the confidence reposed in him by hudigthe masterhe was boastfully and obtrusively proud this arose from his great benevolence and from an exalted sense of his duty to himself and the world at large he experienced that irresistible impulse to impart information which is inseparable from gross ignorance there is always some one thing which the ignorant man knows and that thing is the only thing worth knowing it fills the ignorant mans universe willems knew all about himself on the day when with many misgivings he ran away from a dutch eastindiaman in samarang roads he had commenced that study of himself of his own ways of his own abilities of those fatecompelling qualities of his which led him toward that lucrative position which he now filled being of a modest and diffident nature his successes amazed almost frightened him and endedas he got over the succeeding shocks of surpriseby making him ferociously conceited he believed in his genius and in his knowledge of the world others should know of it also for their own good and for his greater glory all those friendly men who slapped him on the back and greeted him noisily should have the benefit of his example for that he must talk he talked to them conscientiously in the afternoon he expounded his theory of success over the little tables dipping now and then his moustache in the crushed ice of the cocktails in the evening he would often hold forth cue in hand to a young listener across the billiard table the billiard balls stood still as if listening also under the vivid brilliance of the shaded oil lamps hung low over the cloth while away in the shadows of the big room the chinaman marker would lean wearily against the wall the blank mask of his face looking pale under the mahogany markingboard his eyelids dropped in the drowsy fatigue of late hours and in the buzzing monotony of the unintelligible stream of words poured out by the white man in a sudden pause of the talk the game would recommence with a sharp click and go on for a time in the flowing soft whirr and the subdued thuds as the balls rolled zigzagging towards the inevitably successful cannon through the big windows and the open doors the salt dampness of the sea the vague smell of mould and flowers from the garden of the hotel drifted in and mingled with the odour of lamp oil growing heavier as the night advanced the players heads dived into the light as they bent down for the stroke springing back again smartly into the greenish gloom of broad lampshades the clock ticked methodically the unmoved chinaman continuously repeated the score in a lifeless voice like a big talking dolland willems would win the game with a remark that it was getting late and that he was a married man he would say a patronizing goodnight and step out into the long empty street at that hour its white dust was like a dazzling streak of moonlight where the eye sought repose in the dimmer gleam of rare oil lamps willems walked homewards following the line of walls overtopped by the luxuriant vegetation of the front gardens the houses right and left were hidden behind the black masses of flowering shrubs willems had the street to himself he would walk in the middle his shadow gliding obsequiously before him he looked down on it complacently the shadow of a successful man he would be slightly dizzy with the cocktails and with the intoxication of his own glory as he often told people he came east fourteen years agoa cabin boy a small boy his shadow must have been very small at that time he thought with a smile that he was not aware then he had anythingeven a shadowwhich he dared call his own and now he was looking at the shadow of the confidential clerk of hudig  co going home how glorious how good was life for those that were on the winning side he had won the game of life also the game of billiards he walked faster jingling his winnings and thinking of the white stone days that had marked the path of his existence he thought of the trip to lombok for poniesthat first important transaction confided to him by hudig then he reviewed the more important affairs the quiet deal in opium the illegal traffic in gunpowder the great affair of smuggled firearms the difficult business of the rajah of goak he carried that last through by sheer pluck he had bearded the savage old ruler in his council room he had bribed him with a gilt glass coach which rumour said was used as a hencoop now he had overpersuaded him he had bested him in every way that was the way to get on he disapproved of the elementary dishonesty that dips the hand in the cashbox but one could evade the laws and push the principles of trade to their furthest consequences some call that cheating those are the fools the weak the contemptible the wise the strong the respected have no scruples where there are scruples there can be no power on that text he preached often to the young men it was his doctrine and he himself was a shining example of its truth  night after night he went home thus after a day of toil and pleasure drunk with the sound of his own voice celebrating his own prosperity on his thirtieth birthday he went home thus he had spent in good company a nice noisy evening and as he walked along the empty street the feeling of his own greatness grew upon him lifted him above the white dust of the road and filled him with exultation and regrets he had not done himself justice over there in the hotel he had not talked enough about himself he had not impressed his hearers enough never mind some other time now he would go home and make his wife get up and listen to him why should she not get upand mix a cocktail for himand listen patiently just so she shall if he wanted he could make all the da souza family get up he had only to say a word and they would all come and sit silently in their night vestments on the hard cold ground of his compound and listen as long as he wished to go on explaining to them from the top of the stairs how great and good he was they would however his wife would dofor tonight  his wife he winced inwardly a dismal woman with startled eyes and dolorously drooping mouth that would listen to him in pained wonder and mute stillness she was used to those nightdiscourses now she had rebelled onceat the beginning only once now while he sprawled in the long chair and drank and talked she would stand at the further end of the table her hands resting on the edge her frightened eyes watching his lips without a sound without a stir hardly breathing till he dismissed her with a contemptuous go to bed dummy she would draw a long breath then and trail out of the room relieved but unmoved nothing could startle her make her scold or make her cry she did not complain she did not rebel that first difference of theirs was decisive too decisive thought willems discontentedly it had frightened the soul out of her body apparently a dismal woman a damnd business altogether what the devil did he want to go and saddle himself    ah well he wanted a home and the match seemed to please hudig and hudig gave him the bungalow that flowerbowered house to which he was wending his way in the cool moonlight and he had the worship of the da souza tribe a man of his stamp could carry off anything do anything aspire to anything in another five years those white people who attended the sunday cardparties of the governor would accept himhalfcaste wife and all hooray he saw his shadow dart forward and wave a hat as big as a rum barrel at the end of an arm several yards long    who shouted hooray    he smiled shamefacedly to himself and pushing his hands deep into his pockets walked faster with a suddenly grave face behind himto the lefta cigar end glowed in the gateway of mr vincks front yard leaning against one of the brick pillars mr vinck the cashier of hudig  co smoked the last cheroot of the evening amongst the shadows of the trimmed bushes mrs vinck crunched slowly with measured steps the gravel of the circular path before the house  theres willems going home on footand drunk i fancy said mr vinck over his shoulder i saw him jump and wave his hat  the crunching of the gravel stopped  horrid man said mrs vinck calmly i have heard he beats his wife  oh no my dear no muttered absently mr vinck with a vague gesture the aspect of willems as a wifebeater presented to him no interest how women do misjudge if willems wanted to torture his wife he would have recourse to less primitive methods mr vinck knew willems well and believed him to be very able very smartobjectionably so as he took the last quick draws at the stump of his cheroot mr vinck reflected that the confidence accorded by hudig to willems was open under the circumstances to loyal criticism from hudigs cashier  he is becoming dangerous he knows too much he will have to be got rid of said mr vinck aloud but mrs vinck had gone in already and after shaking his head he threw away his cheroot and followed her slowly  willems walked on homeward weaving the splendid web of his future the road to greatness lay plainly before his eyes straight and shining without any obstacle that he could see he had stepped off the path of honesty as he understood it but he would soon regain it never to leave it any more it was a very small matter he would soon put it right again meantime his duty was not to be found out and he trusted in his skill in his luck in his wellestablished reputation that would disarm suspicion if anybody dared to suspect but nobody would dare true he was conscious of a slight deterioration he had appropriated temporarily some of hudigs money a deplorable necessity but he judged himself with the indulgence that should be extended to the weaknesses of genius he would make reparation and all would be as before nobody would be the loser for it and he would go on unchecked toward the brilliant goal of his ambition  hudigs partner  before going up the steps of his house he stood for awhile his feet well apart chin in hand contemplating mentally hudigs future partner a glorious occupation he saw him quite safe solid as the hills deepdeep as an abyss discreet as the grave    chapter two   the sea perhaps because of its saltness roughens the outside but keeps sweet the kernel of its servants soul the old sea the sea of many years ago whose servants were devoted slaves and went from youth to age or to a sudden grave without needing to open the book of life because they could look at eternity reflected on the element that gave the life and dealt the death like a beautiful and unscrupulous woman the sea of the past was glorious in its smiles irresistible in its anger capricious enticing illogical irresponsible a thing to love a thing to fear it cast a spell it gave joy it lulled gently into boundless faith then with quick and causeless anger it killed but its cruelty was redeemed by the charm of its inscrutable mystery by the immensity of its promise by the supreme witchery of its possible favour strong men with childlike hearts were faithful to it were content to live by its graceto die by its will that was the sea before the time when the french mind set the egyptian muscle in motion and produced a dismal but profitable ditch then a great pall of smoke sent out by countless steamboats was spread over the restless mirror of the infinite the hand of the engineer tore down the veil of the terrible beauty in order that greedy and faithless landlubbers might pocket dividends the mystery was destroyed like all mysteries it lived only in the hearts of its worshippers the hearts changed the men changed the once loving and devoted servants went out armed with fire and iron and conquering the fear of their own hearts became a calculating crowd of cold and exacting masters the sea of the past was an incomparably beautiful mistress with inscrutable face with cruel and promising eyes the sea of today is a usedup drudge wrinkled and defaced by the churnedup wakes of brutal propellers robbed of the enslaving charm of its vastness stripped of its beauty of its mystery and of its promise  tom lingard was a master a lover a servant of the sea the sea took him young fashioned him body and soul gave him his fierce aspect his loud voice his fearless eyes his stupidly guileless heart generously it gave him his absurd faith in himself his universal love of creation his wide indulgence his contemptuous severity his straightforward simplicity of motive and honesty of aim having made him what he was womanlike the sea served him humbly and let him bask unharmed in the sunshine of its terribly uncertain favour tom lingard grew rich on the sea and by the sea he loved it with the ardent affection of a lover he made light of it with the assurance of perfect mastery he feared it with the wise fear of a brave man and he took liberties with it as a spoiled child might do with a paternal and goodnatured ogre he was grateful to it with the gratitude of an honest heart his greatest pride lay in his profound conviction of its faithfulnessin the deep sense of his unerring knowledge of its treachery  the little brig flash was the instrument of lingards fortune they came north togetherboth youngout of an australian port and after a very few years there was not a white man in the islands from palembang to ternate from ombawa to palawan that did not know captain tom and his lucky craft he was liked for his reckless generosity for his unswerving honesty and at first was a little feared on account of his violent temper very soon however they found him out and the word went round that captain toms fury was less dangerous than many a mans smile he prospered greatly after his firstand successfulfight with the sea robbers when he rescued as rumour had it the yacht of some big wig from home somewhere down carimata way his great popularity began as years went on it grew apace always visiting outoftheway places of that part of the world always in search of new markets for his cargoesnot so much for profit as for the pleasure of finding themhe soon became known to the malays and by his successful recklessness in several encounters with pirates established the terror of his name those white men with whom he had business and who naturally were on the lookout for his weaknesses could easily see that it was enough to give him his malay title to flatter him greatly so when there was anything to be gained by it and sometimes out of pure and unprofitable good nature they would drop the ceremonious captain lingard and address him half seriously as rajah lautthe king of the sea  he carried the name bravely on his broad shoulders he had carried it many years already when the boy willems ran barefooted on the deck of the ship kosmopoliet iv in samarang roads looking with innocent eyes on the strange shore and objurgating his immediate surroundings with blasphemous lips while his childish brain worked upon the heroic idea of running away from the poop of the flash lingard saw in the early morning the dutch ship get lumberingly under weigh bound for the eastern ports very late in the evening of the same day he stood on the quay of the landing canal ready to go on board of his brig the night was starry and clear the little customhouse building was shut up and as the gharry that brought him down disappeared up the long avenue of dusty trees leading to the town lingard thought himself alone on the quay he roused up his sleeping boatcrew and stood waiting for them to get ready when he felt a tug at his coat and a thin voice said very distinctly  english captain  lingard turned round quickly and what seemed to be a very lean boy jumped back with commendable activity  who are you where do you spring from asked lingard in startled surprise  from a safe distance the boy pointed toward a cargo lighter moored to the quay  been hiding there have you said lingard well what do you want speak out confound you you did not come here to scare me to death for fun did you  the boy tried to explain in imperfect english but very soon lingard interrupted him  i see he exclaimed you ran away from the big ship that sailed this morning well why dont you go to your countrymen here  ship gone only a little wayto sourabaya make me go back to the ship explained the boy  best thing for you affirmed lingard with conviction  no retorted the boy me want stop here not want go home get money here home no good  this beats all my going afishing commented the astonished lingard its money you want well well and you were not afraid to run away you bag of bones you  the boy intimated that he was frightened of nothing but of being sent back to the ship lingard looked at him in meditative silence  come closer he said at last he took the boy by the chin and turning up his face gave him a searching look how old are you  seventeen  theres not much of you for seventeen are you hungry  a little  will you come with me in that brig there  the boy moved without a word towards the boat and scrambled into the bows  knows his place muttered lingard to himself as he stepped heavily into the stern sheets and took up the yoke lines give way there  the malay boat crew lay back together and the gig sprang away from the quay heading towards the brigs riding light  such was the beginning of willems career  lingard learned in half an hour all that there was of willems commonplace story father outdoor clerk of some shipbroker in rotterdam mother dead the boy quick in learning but idle in school the straitened circumstances in the house filled with small brothers and sisters sufficiently clothed and fed but otherwise running wild while the disconsolate widower tramped about all day in a shabby overcoat and imperfect boots on the muddy quays and in the evening piloted wearily the halfintoxicated foreign skippers amongst the places of cheap delights returning home late sick with too much smoking and drinkingfor companys sakewith these men who expected such attentions in the way of business then the offer of the goodnatured captain of kosmopoliet iv who was pleased to do something for the patient and obliging fellow young willems great joy his still greater disappointment with the sea that looked so charming from afar but proved so hard and exacting on closer acquaintanceand then this running away by a sudden impulse the boy was hopelessly at variance with the spirit of the sea he had an instinctive contempt for the honest simplicity of that work which led to nothing he cared for lingard soon found this out he offered to send him home in an english ship but the boy begged hard to be permitted to remain he wrote a beautiful hand became soon perfect in english was quick at figures and lingard made him useful in that way as he grew older his trading instincts developed themselves astonishingly and lingard left him often to trade in one island or another while he himself made an intermediate trip to some outoftheway place on willems expressing a wish to that effect lingard let him enter hudigs service he felt a little sore at that abandonment because he had attached himself in a way to his protege still he was proud of him and spoke up for him loyally at first it was smart boy thatnever make a seaman though then when willems was helping in the trading he referred to him as that clever young fellow later when willems became the confidential agent of hudig employed in many a delicate affair the simplehearted old seaman would point an admiring finger at his back and whisper to whoever stood near at the moment longheaded chap that deuced longheaded chap look at him confidential man of old hudig i picked him up in a ditch you may say like a starved cat skin and bone pon my word i did and now he knows more than i do about island trading fact i am not joking more than i do he would repeat seriously with innocent pride in his honest eyes  from the safe elevation of his commercial successes willems patronized lingard he had a liking for his benefactor not unmixed with some disdain for the crude directness of the old fellows methods of conduct there were however certain sides of lingards character for which willems felt a qualified respect the talkative seaman knew how to be silent on certain matters that to willems were very interesting besides lingard was rich and that in itself was enough to compel willems unwilling admiration in his confidential chats with hudig willems generally alluded to the benevolent englishman as the lucky old fool in a very distinct tone of vexation hudig would grunt an unqualified assent and then the two would look at each other in a sudden immobility of pupils fixed by a stare of unexpressed thought  you cant find out where he gets all that indiarubber hey willems hudig would ask at last turning away and bending over the papers on his desk  no mr hudig not yet but i am trying was willems invariable reply delivered with a ring of regretful deprecation  try always try you may try you think yourself clever perhaps rumbled on hudig without looking up i have been trading with him twentythirty years now the old fox and i have tried bah  he stretched out a short podgy leg and contemplated the bare instep and the grass slipper hanging by the toes you cant make him drunk he would add after a pause of stertorous breathing  no mr hudig i cant really protested willems earnestly  well dont try i know him dont try advised the master and bending again over his desk his staring bloodshot eyes close to the paper he would go on tracing laboriously with his thick fingers the slim unsteady letters of his correspondence while willems waited respectfully for his further good pleasure before asking with great deference  any orders mr hudig  hm yes go to bunhin yourself and see the dollars of that payment counted and packed and have them put on board the mailboat for ternate shes due here this afternoon  yes mr hudig  and look here if the boat is late leave the case in bunhins godown till tomorrow seal it up eight seals as usual dont take it away till the boat is here  no mr hudig  and dont forget about these opium cases its for tonight use my own boatmen transship them from the caroline to the arab barque went on the master in his hoarse undertone and dont you come to me with another story of a case dropped overboard like last time he added with sudden ferocity looking up at his confidential clerk  no mr hudig i will take care  thats all tell that pig as you go out that if he doesnt make the punkah go a little better i will break every bone in his body finished up hudig wiping his purple face with a red silk handkerchief nearly as big as a counterpane  noiselessly willems went out shutting carefully behind him the little green door through which he passed to the warehouse hudig pen in hand listened to him bullying the punkah boy with profane violence born of unbounded zeal for the masters comfort before he returned to his writing amid the rustling of papers fluttering in the wind sent down by the punkah that waved in wide sweeps above his head  willems would nod familiarly to mr vinck who had his desk close to the little door of the private office and march down the warehouse with an important air mr vinckextreme dislike lurking in every wrinkle of his gentlemanly countenancewould follow with his eyes the white figure flitting in the gloom amongst the piles of bales and cases till it passed out through the big archway into the glare of the street    chapter three   the opportunity and the temptation were too much for willems and under the pressure of sudden necessity he abused that trust which was his pride the perpetual sign of his cleverness and a load too heavy for him to carry a run of bad luck at cards the failure of a small speculation undertaken on his own account an unexpected demand for money from one or another member of the da souza familyand almost before he was well aware of it he was off the path of his peculiar honesty it was such a faint and illdefined track that it took him some time to find out how far he had strayed amongst the brambles of the dangerous wilderness he had been skirting for so many years without any other guide than his own convenience and that doctrine of success which he had found for himself in the book of lifein those interesting chapters that the devil has been permitted to write in it to test the sharpness of mens eyesight and the steadfastness of their hearts for one short dark and solitary moment he was dismayed but he had that courage that will not scale heights yet will wade bravely through the mudif there be no other road he applied himself to the task of restitution and devoted himself to the duty of not being found out on his thirtieth birthday he had almost accomplished the taskand the duty had been faithfully and cleverly performed he saw himself safe again he could look hopefully towards the goal of his legitimate ambition nobody would dare to suspect him and in a few days there would be nothing to suspect he was elated he did not know that his prosperity had touched then its highwater mark and that the tide was already on the turn  two days afterwards he knew mr vinck hearing the rattle of the doorhandle jumped up from his deskwhere he had been tremulously listening to the loud voices in the private officeand buried his face in the big safe with nervous haste for the last time willems passed through the little green door leading to hudigs sanctum which during the past halfhour might have been takenfrom the fiendish noise withinfor the cavern of some wild beast willems troubled eyes took in the quick impression of men and things as he came out from the place of his humiliation he saw the scared expression of the punkah boy the chinamen tellers sitting on their heels with unmovable faces turned up blankly towards him while their arrested hands hovered over the little piles of bright guilders ranged on the floor mr vincks shoulderblades with the fleshy rims of two red ears above he saw the long avenue of gin cases stretching from where he stood to the arched doorway beyond which he would be able to breathe perhaps a thin ropes end lay across his path and he saw it distinctly yet stumbled heavily over it as if it had been a bar of iron then he found himself in the street at last but could not find air enough to fill his lungs he walked towards his home gasping  as the sound of hudigs insults that lingered in his ears grew fainter by the lapse of time the feeling of shame was replaced slowly by a passion of anger against himself and still more against the stupid concourse of circumstances that had driven him into his idiotic indiscretion idiotic indiscretion that is how he defined his guilt to himself could there be anything worse from the point of view of his undeniable cleverness what a fatal aberration of an acute mind he did not recognize himself there he must have been mad thats it a sudden gust of madness and now the work of long years was destroyed utterly what would become of him  before he could answer that question he found himself in the garden before his house hudigs wedding gift he looked at it with a vague surprise to find it there his past was so utterly gone from him that the dwelling which belonged to it appeared to him incongruous standing there intact neat and cheerful in the sunshine of the hot afternoon the house was a pretty little structure all doors and windows surrounded on all sides by the deep verandah supported on slender columns clothed in the green foliage of creepers which also fringed the overhanging eaves of the highpitched roof slowly willems mounted the dozen steps that led to the verandah he paused at every step he must tell his wife he felt frightened at the prospect and his alarm dismayed him frightened to face her nothing could give him a better measure of the greatness of the change around him and in him another manand another life with the faith in himself gone he could not be worth much if he was afraid to face that woman  he dared not enter the house through the open door of the diningroom but stood irresolute by the little worktable where trailed a white piece of calico with a needle stuck in it as if the work had been left hurriedly the pinkcrested cockatoo started on his appearance into clumsy activity and began to climb laboriously up and down his perch calling joanna with indistinct loudness and a persistent screech that prolonged the last syllable of the name as if in a peal of insane laughter the screen in the doorway moved gently once or twice in the breeze and each time willems started slightly expecting his wife but he never lifted his eyes although straining his ears for the sound of her footsteps gradually he lost himself in his thoughts in the endless speculation as to the manner in which she would receive his newsand his orders in this preoccupation he almost forgot the fear of her presence no doubt she will cry she will lament she will be helpless and frightened and passive as ever and he would have to drag that limp weight on and on through the darkness of a spoiled life horrible of course he could not abandon her and the child to certain misery or possible starvation the wife and the child of willems willems the successful the smart willems the conf     pah and what was willems now willems the    he strangled the halfborn thought and cleared his throat to stifle a groan ah wont they talk tonight in the billiardroomhis world where he had been firstall those men to whom he had been so superciliously condescending wont they talk with surprise and affected regret and grave faces and wise nods some of them owed him money but he never pressed anybody not he willems the prince of good fellows they called him and now they will rejoice no doubt at his downfall a crowd of imbeciles in his abasement he was yet aware of his superiority over those fellows who were merely honest or simply not found out yet a crowd of imbeciles he shook his fist at the evoked image of his friends and the startled parrot fluttered its wings and shrieked in desperate fright  in a short glance upwards willems saw his wife come round the corner of the house he lowered his eyelids quickly and waited silently till she came near and stood on the other side of the little table he would not look at her face but he could see the red dressinggown he knew so well she trailed through life in that red dressinggown with its row of dirty blue bows down the front stained and hooked on awry a torn flounce at the bottom following her like a snake as she moved languidly about with her hair negligently caught up and a tangled wisp straggling untidily down her back his gaze travelled upwards from bow to bow noticing those that hung only by a thread but it did not go beyond her chin he looked at her lean throat at the obtrusive collarbone visible in the disarray of the upper part of her attire he saw the thin arm and the bony hand clasping the child she carried and he felt an immense distaste for those encumbrances of his life he waited for her to say something but as he felt her eyes rest on him in unbroken silence he sighed and began to speak  it was a hard task he spoke slowly lingering amongst the memories of this early life in his reluctance to confess that this was the end of it and the beginning of a less splendid existence in his conviction of having made her happiness in the full satisfaction of all material wants he never doubted for a moment that she was ready to keep him company on no matter how hard and stony a road he was not elated by this certitude he had married her to please hudig and the greatness of his sacrifice ought to have made her happy without any further exertion on his part she had years of glory as willems wife and years of comfort of loyal care and of such tenderness as she deserved he had guarded her carefully from any bodily hurt and of any other suffering he had no conception the assertion of his superiority was only another benefit conferred on her all this was a matter of course but he told her all this so as to bring vividly before her the greatness of her loss she was so dull of understanding that she would not grasp it else and now it was at an end they would have to go leave this house leave this island go far away where he was unknown to the english straitsettlements perhaps he would find an opening there for his abilitiesand juster men to deal with than old hudig he laughed bitterly  you have the money i left at home this morning joanna he asked we will want it all now  as he spoke those words he thought he was a fine fellow nothing new that still he surpassed there his own expectations hang it all there are sacred things in life after all the marriage tie was one of them and he was not the man to break it the solidity of his principles caused him great satisfaction but he did not care to look at his wife for all that he waited for her to speak then he would have to console her tell her not to be a crying fool to get ready to go go where how when he shook his head they must leave at once that was the principal thing he felt a sudden need to hurry up his departure  well joanna he said a little impatientlydont stand there in a trance do you hear we must     he looked up at his wife and whatever he was going to add remained unspoken she was staring at him with her big slanting eyes that seemed to him twice their natural size the child its dirty little face pressed to its mothers shoulder was sleeping peacefully the deep silence of the house was not broken but rather accentuated by the low mutter of the cockatoo now very still on its perch as willems was looking at joanna her upper lip was drawn up on one side giving to her melancholy face a vicious expression altogether new to his experience he stepped back in his surprise  oh you great man she said distinctly but in a voice that was hardly above a whisper  those words and still more her tone stunned him as if somebody had fired a gun close to his ear he stared back at her stupidly  oh you great man she repeated slowly glancing right and left as if meditating a sudden escape and you think that i am going to starve with you you are nobody now you think my mamma and leonard would let me go away and with you with you she repeated scornfully raising her voice which woke up the child and caused it to whimper feebly  joanna exclaimed willems  do not speak to me i have heard what i have waited for all these years you are less than dirt you that have wiped your feet on me i have waited for this i am not afraid now i do not want you do not come near me ahh she screamed shrilly as he held out his hand in an entreating gestureah keep off me keep off me keep off  she backed away looking at him with eyes both angry and frightened willems stared motionless in dumb amazement at the mystery of anger and revolt in the head of his wife why what had he ever done to her this was the day of injustice indeed first hudigand now his wife he felt a terror at this hate that had lived stealthily so near him for years he tried to speak but she shrieked again and it was like a needle through his heart again he raised his hand  help called mrs willems in a piercing voice help  be quiet you fool shouted willems trying to drown the noise of his wife and child in his own angry accents and rattling violently the little zinc table in his exasperation  from under the house where there were bathrooms and a tool closet appeared leonard a rusty iron bar in his hand he called threateningly from the bottom of the stairs  do not hurt her mr willems you are a savage not at all like we whites  you too said the bewildered willems i havent touched her is this a madhouse he moved towards the stairs and leonard dropped the bar with a clang and made for the gate of the compound willems turned back to his wife  so you expected this he said it is a conspiracy whos that sobbing and groaning in the room some more of your precious family hey  she was more calm now and putting hastily the crying child in the big chair walked towards him with sudden fearlessness  my mother she said my mother who came to defend me from youman from nowhere a vagabond  you did not call me a vagabond when you hung round my neckbefore we were married said willems contemptuously  you took good care that i should not hang round your neck after we were she answered clenching her hands and putting her face close to his you boasted while i suffered and said nothing what has become of your greatness of our greatnessyou were always speaking about now i am going to live on the charity of your master yes that is true he sent leonard to tell me so and you will go and boast somewhere else and starve so ah i can breathe now this house is mine  enough said willems slowly with an arresting gesture  she leaped back the fright again in her eyes snatched up the child pressed it to her breast and falling into a chair drummed insanely with her heels on the resounding floor of the verandah  i shall go said willems steadily i thank you for the first time in your life you make me happy you were a stone round my neck you understand i did not mean to tell you that as long as you lived but you made menow before i pass this gate you shall be gone from my mind you made it very easy i thank you  he turned and went down the steps without giving her a glance while she sat upright and quiet with wideopen eyes the child crying querulously in her arms at the gate he came suddenly upon leonard who had been dodging about there and failed to get out of the way in time  do not be brutal mr willems said leonard hurriedly it is unbecoming between white men with all those natives looking on leonards legs trembled very much and his voice wavered between high and low tones without any attempt at control on his part restrain your improper violence he went on mumbling rapidly i am a respectable man of very good family while you    it is regrettable    they all say so     what thundered willems he felt a sudden impulse of mad anger and before he knew what had happened he was looking at leonard da souza rolling in the dust at his feet he stepped over his prostrate brotherinlaw and tore blindly down the street everybody making way for the frantic white man  when he came to himself he was beyond the outskirts of the town stumbling on the hard and cracked earth of reaped rice fields how did he get there it was dark he must get back as he walked towards the town slowly his mind reviewed the events of the day and he felt a sense of bitter loneliness his wife had turned him out of his own house he had assaulted brutally his brotherinlaw a member of the da souza familyof that band of his worshippers he did well no it was some other man another man was coming back a man without a past without a future yet full of pain and shame and anger he stopped and looked round a dog or two glided across the empty street and rushed past him with a frightened snarl he was now in the midst of the malay quarter whose bamboo houses hidden in the verdure of their little gardens were dark and silent men women and children slept in there human beings would he ever sleep and where he felt as if he was the outcast of all mankind and as he looked hopelessly round before resuming his weary march it seemed to him that the world was bigger the night more vast and more black but he went on doggedly with his head down as if pushing his way through some thick brambles then suddenly he felt planks under his feet and looking up saw the red light at the end of the jetty he walked quite to the end and stood leaning against the post under the lamp looking at the roadstead where two vessels at anchor swayed their slender rigging amongst the stars the end of the jetty and here in one step more the end of life the end of everything better so what else could he do nothing ever comes back he saw it clearly the respect and admiration of them all the old habits and old affections finished abruptly in the clear perception of the cause of his disgrace he saw all this and for a time he came out of himself out of his selfishnessout of the constant preoccupation of his interests and his desiresout of the temple of self and the concentration of personal thought  his thoughts now wandered home standing in the tepid stillness of a starry tropical night he felt the breath of the bitter east wind he saw the high and narrow fronts of tall houses under the gloom of a clouded sky and on muddy quays he saw the shabby highshouldered figurethe patient faded face of the weary man earning bread for the children that waited for him in a dingy home it was miserable miserable but it would never come back what was there in common between those things and willems the clever willems the successful he had cut himself adrift from that home many years ago better for him then better for them now all this was gone never to come back again and suddenly he shivered seeing himself alone in the presence of unknown and terrible dangers  for the first time in his life he felt afraid of the future because he had lost his faith the faith in his own success and he had destroyed it foolishly with his own hands    chapter four   his meditation which resembled slow drifting into suicide was interrupted by lingard who with a loud ive got you at last dropped his hand heavily on willems shoulder this time it was the old seaman himself going out of his way to pick up the uninteresting waifall that there was left of that sudden and sordid shipwreck to willems the rough friendly voice was a quick and fleeting relief followed by a sharper pang of anger and unavailing regret that voice carried him back to the beginning of his promising career the end of which was very visible now from the jetty where they both stood he shook himself free from the friendly grasp saying with ready bitterness  its all your fault give me a push now do and send me over i have been standing here waiting for help you are the manof all men you helped at the beginning you ought to have a hand in the end  i have better use for you than to throw you to the fishes said lingard seriously taking willems by the arm and forcing him gently to walk up the jetty i have been buzzing over this town like a bluebottle fly looking for you high and low i have heard a lot i will tell you what willems you are no saint thats a fact and you have not been overwise either i am not throwing stones he added hastily as willems made an effort to get away but i am not going to mince matters never could you keep quiet while i talk cant you  with a gesture of resignation and a halfstifled groan willems submitted to the stronger will and the two men paced slowly up and down the resounding planks while lingard disclosed to willems the exact manner of his undoing after the first shock willems lost the faculty of surprise in the overpowering feeling of indignation so it was vinck and leonard who had served him so they had watched him tracked his misdeeds reported them to hudig they had bribed obscure chinamen wormed out confidences from tipsy skippers got at various boatmen and had pieced out in that way the story of his irregularities the blackness of this dark intrigue filled him with horror he could understand vinck there was no love lost between them but leonard leonard  why captain lingard he burst out the fellow licked my boots  yes yes yes said lingard testily we know that and you did your best to cram your boot down his throat no man likes that my boy  i was always giving money to all that hungry lot went on willems passionately always my hand in my pocket they never had to ask twice  just so your generosity frightened them they asked themselves where all that came from and concluded that it was safer to throw you overboard after all hudig is a much greater man than you my friend and they have a claim on him also  what do you mean captain lingard  what do i mean repeated lingard slowly why you are not going to make me believe you did not know your wife was hudigs daughter come now  willems stopped suddenly and swayed about  ah i understand he gasped i never heard    lately i thought there was    but no i never guessed  oh you simpleton said lingard pityingly pon my word he muttered to himself i dont believe the fellow knew well well steady now pull yourself together whats wrong there she is a good wife to you  excellent wife said willems in a dreary voice looking far over the black and scintillating water  very well then went on lingard with increasing friendliness nothing wrong there but did you really think that hudig was marrying you off and giving you a house and i dont know what out of love for you  i had served him well answered willems how well you know yourselfthrough thick and thin no matter what work and what risk i was always there always ready  how well he saw the greatness of his work and the immensity of that injustice which was his reward she was that mans daughter  in the light of this disclosure the facts of the last five years of his life stood clearly revealed in their full meaning he had spoken first to joanna at the gate of their dwelling as he went to his work in the brilliant flush of the early morning when women and flowers are charming even to the dullest eyes a most respectable familytwo women and a young manwere his nextdoor neighbours nobody ever came to their little house but the priest a native from the spanish islands now and then the young man leonard he had met in town and was flattered by the little fellows immense respect for the great willems he let him bring chairs call the waiters chalk his cues when playing billiards express his admiration in choice words he even condescended to listen patiently to leonards allusions to our beloved father a man of official position a government agent in koti where he died of cholera alas a victim to duty like a good catholic and a good man it sounded very respectable and willems approved of those feeling references moreover he prided himself upon having no colourprejudices and no racial antipathies he consented to drink curacoa one afternoon on the verandah of mrs da souzas house he remembered joanna that day swinging in a hammock she was untidy even then he remembered and that was the only impression he carried away from that visit he had no time for love in those glorious days no time even for a passing fancy but gradually he fell into the habit of calling almost every day at that little house where he was greeted by mrs da souzas shrill voice screaming for joanna to come and entertain the gentleman from hudig  co and then the sudden and unexpected visit of the priest he remembered the mans flat yellow face his thin legs his propitiatory smile his beaming black eyes his conciliating manner his veiled hints which he did not understand at the time how he wondered what the man wanted and how unceremoniously he got rid of him and then came vividly into his recollection the morning when he met again that fellow coming out of hudigs office and how he was amused at the incongruous visit and that morning with hudig would he ever forget it would he ever forget his surprise as the master instead of plunging at once into business looked at him thoughtfully before turning with a furtive smile to the papers on the desk he could hear him now his nose in the paper before him dropping astonishing words in the intervals of wheezy breathing  heard said    called there often    most respectable ladies    knew the father very well    estimable    best thing for a young man    settle down    personally very glad to hear    thing arranged    suitable recognition of valuable services    best thingbest thing to do  and he believed what credulity what an ass hudig knew the father rather and so did everybody else probably all except himself how proud he had been of hudigs benevolent interest in his fate how proud he was when invited by hudig to stay with him at his little house in the countrywhere he could meet men men of official positionas a friend vinck had been green with envy oh yes he had believed in the best thing and took the girl like a gift of fortune how he boasted to hudig of being free from prejudices the old scoundrel must have been laughing in his sleeve at his fool of a confidential clerk he took the girl guessing nothing how could he there had been a father of some kind to the common knowledge men knew him spoke about him a lank man of hopelessly mixed descent but otherwiseapparentlyunobjectionable the shady relations came out afterward butwith his freedom from prejudiceshe did not mind them because with their humble dependence they completed his triumphant life taken in taken in hudig had found an easy way to provide for the begging crowd he had shifted the burden of his youthful vagaries on to the shoulders of his confidential clerk and while he worked for the master the master had cheated him had stolen his very self from him he was married he belonged to that woman no matter what she might do    had sworn    for all life    thrown himself away    and that man dared this very morning call him a thief damnation  let go lingard he shouted trying to get away by a sudden jerk from the watchful old seaman let me go and kill that     no you dont panted lingard hanging on manfully you want to kill do you you lunatic ahive got you now be quiet i say  they struggled violently lingard forcing willems slowly towards the guardrail under their feet the jetty sounded like a drum in the quiet night on the shore end the native caretaker of the wharf watched the combat squatting behind the safe shelter of some big cases the next day he informed his friends with calm satisfaction that two drunken white men had fought on the jetty  it had been a great fight they fought without arms like wild beasts after the manner of white men no nobody was killed or there would have been trouble and a report to make how could he know why they fought white men have no reason when they are like that  just as lingard was beginning to fear that he would be unable to restrain much longer the violence of the younger man he felt willems muscles relaxing and took advantage of this opportunity to pin him by a last effort to the rail they both panted heavily speechless their faces very close  all right muttered willems at last dont break my back over this infernal rail i will be quiet  now you are reasonable said lingard much relieved what made you fly into that passion he asked leading him back to the end of the jetty and still holding him prudently with one hand he fumbled with the other for his whistle and blew a shrill and prolonged blast over the smooth water of the roadstead came in answer a faint cry from one of the ships at anchor  my boat will be here directly said lingard think of what you are going to do i sail tonight  what is there for me to do except one thing said willems gloomily  look here said lingard i picked you up as a boy and consider myself responsible for you in a way you took your life into your own hands many years agobut still     he paused listening till he heard the regular grind of the oars in the rowlocks of the approaching boat then went on again  i have made it all right with hudig you owe him nothing now go back to your wife she is a good woman go back to her  why captain lingard exclaimed willems she     it was most affecting went on lingard without heeding him i went to your house to look for you and there i saw her despair it was heartbreaking she called for you she entreated me to find you she spoke wildly poor woman as if all this was her fault  willems listened amazed the blind old idiot how queerly he misunderstood but if it was true if it was even true the very idea of seeing her filled his soul with intense loathing he did not break his oath but he would not go back to her let hers be the sin of that separation of the sacred bond broken he revelled in the extreme purity of his heart and he would not go back to her let her come back to him he had the comfortable conviction that he would never see her again and that through her own fault only in this conviction he told himself solemnly that if she would come to him he would receive her with generous forgiveness because such was the praiseworthy solidity of his principles but he hesitated whether he would or would not disclose to lingard the revolting completeness of his humiliation turned out of his houseand by his wife that woman who hardly dared to breathe in his presence yesterday he remained perplexed and silent no he lacked the courage to tell the ignoble story  as the boat of the brig appeared suddenly on the black water close to the jetty lingard broke the painful silence  i always thought he said sadly i always thought you were somewhat heartless willems and apt to cast adrift those that thought most of you i appeal to what is best in you do not abandon that woman  i have not abandoned her answered willems quickly with conscious truthfulness why should i as you so justly observed she has been a good wife to me a very good quiet obedient loving wife and i love her as much as she loves me every bit but as to going back now to that place where i    to walk again amongst those men who yesterday were ready to crawl before me and then feel on my back the sting of their pitying or satisfied smilesno i cant i would rather hide from them at the bottom of the sea he went on with resolute energy i dont think captain lingard he added more quietly i dont think that you realize what my position was there  in a wide sweep of his hand he took in the sleeping shore from north to south as if wishing it a proud and threatening goodbye for a short moment he forgot his downfall in the recollection of his brilliant triumphs amongst the men of his class and occupation who slept in those dark houses he had been indeed the first  it is hard muttered lingard pensively but whose the fault whose the fault  captain lingard cried willems under the sudden impulse of a felicitous inspiration if you leave me here on this jettyits murder i shall never return to that place alive wife or no wife you may just as well cut my throat at once  the old seaman started  dont try to frighten me willems he said with great severity and paused  above the accents of willems brazen despair he heard with considerable uneasiness the whisper of his own absurd conscience he meditated for awhile with an irresolute air  i could tell you to go and drown yourself and be damned to you he said with an unsuccessful assumption of brutality in his manner but i wont we are responsible for one anotherworse luck i am almost ashamed of myself but i can understand your dirty pride i can by     he broke off with a loud sigh and walked briskly to the steps at the bottom of which lay his boat rising and falling gently on the slight and invisible swell  below there got a lamp in the boat well light it and bring it up one of you hurry now  he tore out a page of his pocketbook moistened his pencil with great energy and waited stamping his feet impatiently  i will see this thing through he muttered to himself and i will have it all square and shipshape see if i dont are you going to bring that lamp you son of a crippled mudturtle i am waiting  the gleam of the light on the paper placated his professional anger and he wrote rapidly the final dash of his signature curling the paper up in a triangular tear  take that to this white tuans house i will send the boat back for you in half an hour  the coxswain raised his lamp deliberately to willems face  this tuan tau i know  quick then said lingard taking the lamp from himand the man went off at a run  kassi mem to the lady herself called lingard after him  then when the man disappeared he turned to willems  i have written to your wife he said if you do not return for good you do not go back to that house only for another parting you must come as you stand i wont have that poor woman tormented i will see to it that you are not separated for long trust me  willems shivered then smiled in the darkness  no fear of that he muttered enigmatically i trust you implicitly captain lingard he added in a louder tone  lingard led the way down the steps swinging the lamp and speaking over his shoulder  it is the second time willems i take you in hand mind it is the last the second time and the only difference between then and now is that you were barefooted then and have boots now in fourteen years with all your smartness a poor result that a very poor result  he stood for awhile on the lowest platform of the steps the light of the lamp falling on the upturned face of the stroke oar who held the gunwale of the boat close alongside ready for the captain to step in  you see he went on argumentatively fumbling about the top of the lamp you got yourself so crooked amongst those longshore quilldrivers that you could not run clear in any way thats what comes of such talk as yours and of such a life a man sees so much falsehood that he begins to lie to himself pah he said in disgust theres only one place for an honest man the sea my boy the sea but you never would didnt think there was enough money in it and nowlook  he blew the light out and stepping into the boat stretched quickly his hand towards willems with friendly care willems sat by him in silence and the boat shoved off sweeping in a wide circle towards the brig  your compassion is all for my wife captain lingard said willems moodily do you think i am so very happy  no no said lingard heartily not a word more shall pass my lips i had to speak my mind once seeing that i knew you from a child so to speak and now i shall forget but you are young yet life is very long he went on with unconscious sadness let this be a lesson to you  he laid his hand affectionately on willems shoulder and they both sat silent till the boat came alongside the ships ladder  when on board lingard gave orders to his mate and leading willems on the poop sat on the breech of one of the brass sixpounders with which his vessel was armed the boat went off again to bring back the messenger as soon as it was seen returning dark forms appeared on the brigs spars then the sails fell in festoons with a swish of their heavy folds and hung motionless under the yards in the dead calm of the clear and dewy night from the forward end came the clink of the windlass and soon afterwards the hail of the chief mate informing lingard that the cable was hove short  hold on everything hailed back lingard we must wait for the landbreeze before we let go our hold of the ground  he approached willems who sat on the skylight his body bent down his head low and his hands hanging listlessly between his knees  i am going to take you to sambir he said youve never heard of the place have you well its up that river of mine about which people talk so much and know so little ive found out the entrance for a ship of flashs size it isnt easy youll see i will show you you have been at sea long enough to take an interest    pity you didnt stick to it well i am going there i have my own trading post in the place almayer is my partner you knew him when he was at hudigs oh he lives there as happy as a king dye see i have them all in my pocket the rajah is an old friend of mine my word is lawand i am the only trader no other white man but almayer had ever been in that settlement you will live quietly there till i come back from my next cruise to the westward we shall see then what can be done for you never fear i have no doubt my secret will be safe with you keep mum about my river when you get amongst the traders again theres many would give their ears for the knowledge of it ill tell you something thats where i get all my guttah and rattans simply inexhaustible my boy  while lingard spoke willems looked up quickly but soon his head fell on his breast in the discouraging certitude that the knowledge he and hudig had wished for so much had come to him too late he sat in a listless attitude  you will help almayer in his trading if you have a heart for it continued lingard just to kill time till i come back for you only six weeks or so  over their heads the damp sails fluttered noisily in the first faint puff of the breeze then as the airs freshened the brig tended to the wind and the silenced canvas lay quietly aback the mate spoke with low distinctness from the shadows of the quarterdeck  theres the breeze which way do you want to cast her captain lingard  lingards eyes that had been fixed aloft glanced down at the dejected figure of the man sitting on the skylight he seemed to hesitate for a minute  to the northward to the northward he answered testily as if annoyed at his own fleeting thought and bear a hand there every puff of wind is worth money in these seas  he remained motionless listening to the rattle of blocks and the creaking of trusses as the headyards were hauled round sail was made on the ship and the windlass manned again while he stood still lost in thought he only roused himself when a barefooted seacannie glided past him silently on his way to the wheel  put the helm aport hard over he said in his harsh seavoice to the man whose face appeared suddenly out of the darkness in the circle of light thrown upwards from the binnacle lamps  the anchor was secured the yards trimmed and the brig began to move out of the roadstead the sea woke up under the push of the sharp cutwater and whispered softly to the gliding craft in that tender and rippling murmur in which it speaks sometimes to those it nurses and loves lingard stood by the taffrail listening with a pleased smile till the flash began to draw close to the only other vessel in the anchorage  here willems he said calling him to his side dye see that barque here thats an arab vessel white men have mostly given up the game but this fellow drops in my wake often and lives in hopes of cutting me out in that settlement not while i live i trust you see willems i brought prosperity to that place i composed their quarrels and saw them grow under my eyes theres peace and happiness there i am more master there than his dutch excellency down in batavia ever will be when some day a lazy manofwar blunders at last against the river i mean to keep the arabs out of it with their lies and their intrigues i shall keep the venomous breed out if it costs me my fortune  the flash drew quietly abreast of the barque and was beginning to drop it astern when a white figure started up on the poop of the arab vessel and a voice called out  greeting to the rajah laut  to you greeting answered lingard after a moment of hesitating surprise then he turned to willems with a grim smile thats abdullas voice he said mighty civil all of a sudden isnt he i wonder what it means just like his impudence no matter his civility or his impudence are all one to me i know that this fellow will be under way and after me like a shot i dont care i have the heels of anything that floats in these seas he added while his proud and loving glance ran over and rested fondly amongst the brigs lofty and graceful spars    chapter five   it was the writing on his forehead said babalatchi adding a couple of small sticks to the little fire by which he was squatting and without looking at lakamba who lay down supported on his elbow on the other side of the embers it was written when he was born that he should end his life in darkness and now he is like a man walking in a black nightwith his eyes open yet seeing not i knew him well when he had slaves and many wives and much merchandise and trading praus and praus for fighting haiya he was a great fighter in the days before the breath of the merciful put out the light in his eyes he was a pilgrim and had many virtues he was brave his hand was open and he was a great robber for many years he led the men that drank blood on the sea first in prayer and first in fight have i not stood behind him when his face was turned to the west have i not watched by his side ships with high masts burning in a straight flame on the calm water have i not followed him on dark nights amongst sleeping men that woke up only to die his sword was swifter than the fire from heaven and struck before it flashed hai tuan those were the days and that was a leader and i myself was younger and in those days there were not so many fireships with guns that deal fiery death from afar over the hill and over the foresto tuan lakamba they dropped whistling fireballs into the creek where our praus took refuge and where they dared not follow men who had arms in their hands  he shook his head with mournful regret and threw another handful of fuel on the fire the burst of clear flame lit up his broad dark and pockmarked face where the big lips stained with beteljuice looked like a deep and bleeding gash of a fresh wound the reflection of the firelight gleamed brightly in his solitary eye lending it for a moment a fierce animation that died out together with the shortlived flame with quick touches of his bare hands he raked the embers into a heap then wiping the warm ash on his waistclothhis only garmenthe clasped his thin legs with his entwined fingers and rested his chin on his drawnup knees lakamba stirred slightly without changing his position or taking his eyes off the glowing coals on which they had been fixed in dreamy immobility  yes went on babalatchi in a low monotone as if pursuing aloud a train of thought that had its beginning in the silent contemplation of the unstable nature of earthly greatnessyes he has been rich and strong and now he lives on alms old feeble blind and without companions but for his daughter the rajah patalolo gives him rice and the pale womanhis daughtercooks it for him for he has no slave  i saw her from afar muttered lakamba disparagingly a shedog with white teeth like a woman of the orangputih  right right assented babalatchi but you have not seen her near her mother was a woman from the west a baghdadi woman with veiled face now she goes uncovered like our women do for she is poor and he is blind and nobody ever comes near them unless to ask for a charm or a blessing and depart quickly for fear of his anger and of the rajahs hand you have not been on that side of the river  not for a long time if i go     true true interrupted babalatchi soothingly but i go often alonefor your goodand lookand listen when the time comes when we both go together towards the rajahs campong it will be to enterand to remain  lakamba sat up and looked at babalatchi gloomily  this is good talk once twice when it is heard too often it becomes foolish like the prattle of children  many many times have i seen the cloudy sky and have heard the wind of the rainy seasons said babalatchi impressively  and where is your wisdom it must be with the wind and the clouds of seasons past for i do not hear it in your talk  those are the words of the ungrateful shouted babalatchi with sudden exasperation verily our only refuge is with the one the mighty the redresser of     peace peace growled the startled lakamba it is but a friends talk  babalatchi subsided into his former attitude muttering to himself after awhile he went on again in a louder voice  since the rajah laut left another white man here in sambir the daughter of the blind omar el badavi has spoken to other ears than mine  would a white man listen to a beggars daughter said lakamba doubtingly  hai i have seen     and what did you see o oneeyed one exclaimed lakamba contemptuously  i have seen the strange white man walking on the narrow path before the sun could dry the drops of dew on the bushes and i have heard the whisper of his voice when he spoke through the smoke of the morning fire to that woman with big eyes and a pale skin woman in body but in heart a man she knows no fear and no shame i have heard her voice too  he nodded twice at lakamba sagaciously and gave himself up to silent musing his solitary eye fixed immovably upon the straight wall of forest on the opposite bank lakamba lay silent staring vacantly under them lingards own river rippled softly amongst the piles supporting the bamboo platform of the little watchhouse before which they were lying behind the house the ground rose in a gentle swell of a low hill cleared of the big timber but thickly overgrown with the grass and bushes now withered and burnt up in the long drought of the dry season this old rice clearing which had been several years lying fallow was framed on three sides by the impenetrable and tangled growth of the untouched forest and on the fourth came down to the muddy river bank there was not a breath of wind on the land or river but high above in the transparent sky little clouds rushed past the moon now appearing in her diffused rays with the brilliance of silver now obscuring her face with the blackness of ebony far away in the middle of the river a fish would leap now and then with a short splash the very loudness of which measured the profundity of the overpowering silence that swallowed up the sharp sound suddenly  lakamba dozed uneasily off but the wakeful babalatchi sat thinking deeply sighing from time to time and slapping himself over his naked torso incessantly in a vain endeavour to keep off an occasional and wandering mosquito that rising as high as the platform above the swarms of the riverside would settle with a ping of triumph on the unexpected victim the moon pursuing her silent and toilsome path attained her highest elevation and chasing the shadow of the roofeaves from lakambas face seemed to hang arrested over their heads babalatchi revived the fire and woke up his companion who sat up yawning and shivering discontentedly  babalatchi spoke again in a voice which was like the murmur of a brook that runs over the stones low monotonous persistent irresistible in its power to wear out and to destroy the hardest obstacles lakamba listened silent but interested they were malay adventurers ambitious men of that place and time the bohemians of their race in the early days of the settlement before the ruler patalolo had shaken off his allegiance to the sultan of koti lakamba appeared in the river with two small trading vessels he was disappointed to find already some semblance of organization amongst the settlers of various races who recognized the unobtrusive sway of old patalolo and he was not politic enough to conceal his disappointment he declared himself to be a man from the east from those parts where no white man ruled and to be of an oppressed race but of a princely family and truly enough he had all the gifts of an exiled prince he was discontented ungrateful turbulent a man full of envy and ready for intrigue with brave words and empty promises for ever on his lips he was obstinate but his will was made up of short impulses that never lasted long enough to carry him to the goal of his ambition received coldly by the suspicious patalolo he persistedpermission or no permissionin clearing the ground on a good spot some fourteen miles down the river from sambir and built himself a house there which he fortified by a high palisade as he had many followers and seemed very reckless the old rajah did not think it prudent at the time to interfere with him by force once settled he began to intrigue the quarrel of patalolo with the sultan of koti was of his fomenting but failed to produce the result he expected because the sultan could not back him up effectively at such a great distance disappointed in that scheme he promptly organized an outbreak of the bugis settlers and besieged the old rajah in his stockade with much noisy valour and a fair chance of success but lingard then appeared on the scene with the armed brig and the old seamans hairy forefinger shaken menacingly in his face quelled his martial ardour no man cared to encounter the rajah laut and lakamba with momentary resignation subsided into a halfcultivator halftrader and nursed in his fortified house his wrath and his ambition keeping it for use on a more propitious occasion still faithful to his character of a princepretender he would not recognize the constituted authorities answering sulkily the rajahs messenger who claimed the tribute for the cultivated fields that the rajah had better come and take it himself by lingards advice he was left alone notwithstanding his rebellious mood and for many days he lived undisturbed amongst his wives and retainers cherishing that persistent and causeless hope of better times the possession of which seems to be the universal privilege of exiled greatness  but the passing days brought no change the hope grew faint and the hot ambition burnt itself out leaving only a feeble and expiring spark amongst a heap of dull and tepid ashes of indolent acquiescence with the decrees of fate till babalatchi fanned it again into a bright flame babalatchi had blundered upon the river while in search of a safe refuge for his disreputable head  he was a vagabond of the seas a true oranglaut living by rapine and plunder of coasts and ships in his prosperous days earning his living by honest and irksome toil when the days of adversity were upon him so although at times leading the sulu rovers he had also served as serang of country ships and in that wise had visited the distant seas beheld the glories of bombay the might of the mascati sultan had even struggled in a pious throng for the privilege of touching with his lips the sacred stone of the holy city he gathered experience and wisdom in many lands and after attaching himself to omar el badavi he affected great piety as became a pilgrim although unable to read the inspired words of the prophet he was brave and bloodthirsty without any affection and he hated the white men who interfered with the manly pursuits of throatcutting kidnapping slavedealing and fireraising that were the only possible occupation for a true man of the sea he found favour in the eyes of his chief the fearless omar el badavi the leader of brunei rovers whom he followed with unquestioning loyalty through the long years of successful depredation and when that long career of murder robbery and violence received its first serious check at the hands of white men he stood faithfully by his chief looked steadily at the bursting shells was undismayed by the flames of the burning stronghold by the death of his companions by the shrieks of their women the wailing of their children by the sudden ruin and destruction of all that he deemed indispensable to a happy and glorious existence the beaten ground between the houses was slippery with blood and the dark mangroves of the muddy creeks were full of sighs of the dying men who were stricken down before they could see their enemy they died helplessly for into the tangled forest there was no escape and their swift praus in which they had so often scoured the coast and the seas now wedged together in the narrow creek were burning fiercely babalatchi with the clear perception of the coming end devoted all his energies to saving if it was but only one of them he succeeded in time when the end came in the explosion of the stored powderbarrels he was ready to look for his chief he found him half dead and totally blinded with nobody near him but his daughter aissathe sons had fallen earlier in the day as became men of their courage helped by the girl with the steadfast heart babalatchi carried omar on board the light prau and succeeded in escaping but with very few companions only as they hauled their craft into the network of dark and silent creeks they could hear the cheering of the crews of the manofwars boats dashing to the attack of the rovers village aissa sitting on the high afterdeck her fathers blackened and bleeding head in her lap looked up with fearless eyes at babalatchi they shall find only smoke blood and dead men and women mad with fear there but nothing else living she said mournfully babalatchi pressing with his right hand the deep gash on his shoulder answered sadly they are very strong when we fight with them we can only die yet he added menacinglysome of us still live some of us still live  for a short time he dreamed of vengeance but his dream was dispelled by the cold reception of the sultan of sulu with whom they sought refuge at first and who gave them only a contemptuous and grudging hospitality while omar nursed by aissa was recovering from his wounds babalatchi attended industriously before the exalted presence that had extended to them the hand of protection for all that when babalatchi spoke into the sultans ear certain proposals of a great and profitable raid that was to sweep the islands from ternate to acheen the sultan was very angry i know you you men from the west he exclaimed angrily your words are poison in a rulers ears your talk is of fire and murder and bootybut on our heads falls the vengeance of the blood you drink begone  there was nothing to be done times were changed so changed that when a spanish frigate appeared before the island and a demand was sent to the sultan to deliver omar and his companions babalatchi was not surprised to hear that they were going to be made the victims of political expediency but from that sane appreciation of danger to tame submission was a very long step and then began omars second flight it began arms in hand for the little band had to fight in the night on the beach for the possession of the small canoes in which those that survived got away at last the story of that escape lives in the hearts of brave men even to this day they talk of babalatchi and of the strong woman who carried her blind father through the surf under the fire of the warship from the north the companions of that piratical and sonless aeneas are dead now but their ghosts wander over the waters and the islands at nightafter the manner of ghostsand haunt the fires by which sit armed men as is meet for the spirits of fearless warriors who died in battle there they may hear the story of their own deeds of their own courage suffering and death on the lips of living men that story is told in many places on the cool mats in breezy verandahs of rajahs houses it is alluded to disdainfully by impassive statesmen but amongst armed men that throng the courtyards it is a tale which stills the murmur of voices and the tinkle of anklets arrests the passage of the sirivessel and fixes the eyes in absorbed gaze they talk of the fight of the fearless woman of the wise man of long suffering on the thirsty sea in leaky canoes of those who died    many died a few survived the chief the woman and another one who became great  there was no hint of incipient greatness in babalatchis unostentatious arrival in sambir he came with omar and aissa in a small prau loaded with green cocoanuts and claimed the ownership of both vessel and cargo how it came to pass that babalatchi fleeing for his life in a small canoe managed to end his hazardous journey in a vessel full of a valuable commodity is one of those secrets of the sea that baffle the most searching inquiry in truth nobody inquired much there were rumours of a missing trading prau belonging to menado but they were vague and remained mysterious babalatchi told a story whichit must be said in justice to patalolos knowledge of the worldwas not believed when the rajah ventured to state his doubts babalatchi asked him in tones of calm remonstrance whether he could reasonably suppose that two oldish menwho had only one eye amongst themand a young woman were likely to gain possession of anything whatever by violence charity was a virtue recommended by the prophet there were charitable people and their hand was open to the deserving patalolo wagged his aged head doubtingly and babalatchi withdrew with a shocked mien and put himself forthwith under lakambas protection the two men who completed the praus crew followed him into that magnates campong the blind omar with aissa remained under the care of the rajah and the rajah confiscated the cargo the prau hauled up on the mudbank at the junction of the two branches of the pantai rotted in the rain warped in the sun fell to pieces and gradually vanished into the smoke of household fires of the settlement only a forgotten plank and a rib or two sticking neglected in the shiny ooze for a long time served to remind babalatchi during many months that he was a stranger in the land  otherwise he felt perfectly at home in lakambas establishment where his peculiar position and influence were quickly recognized and soon submitted to even by the women he had all a true vagabonds pliability to circumstances and adaptiveness to momentary surroundings in his readiness to learn from experience that contempt for early principles so necessary to a true statesman he equalled the most successful politicians of any age and he had enough persuasiveness and firmness of purpose to acquire a complete mastery over lakambas vacillating mindwhere there was nothing stable but an allpervading discontent he kept the discontent alive he rekindled the expiring ambition he moderated the poor exiles not unnatural impatience to attain a high and lucrative position hethe man of violencedeprecated the use of force for he had a clear comprehension of the difficult situation from the same cause hethe hater of white menwould to some extent admit the eventual expediency of dutch protection but nothing should be done in a hurry whatever his master lakamba might think there was no use in poisoning old patalolo he maintained it could be done of course but what then as long as lingards influence was paramountas long as almayer lingards representative was the only great trader of the settlement it was not worth lakambas whileeven if it had been possibleto grasp the rule of the young state killing almayer and lingard was so difficult and so risky that it might be dismissed as impracticable what was wanted was an alliance somebody to set up against the white mens influenceand somebody who while favourable to lakamba would at the same time be a person of a good standing with the dutch authorities a rich and considered trader was wanted such a person once firmly established in sambir would help them to oust the old rajah to remove him from power or from life if there was no other way then it would be time to apply to the orang blanda for a flag for a recognition of their meritorious services for that protection which would make them safe for ever the word of a rich and loyal trader would mean something with the ruler down in batavia the first thing to do was to find such an ally and to induce him to settle in sambir a white trader would not do a white man would not fall in with their ideaswould not be trustworthy the man they wanted should be rich unscrupulous have many followers and be a wellknown personality in the islands such a man might be found amongst the arab traders lingards jealousy said babalatchi kept all the traders out of the river some were afraid and some did not know how to get there others ignored the very existence of sambir a good many did not think it worth their while to run the risk of lingards enmity for the doubtful advantage of trade with a comparatively unknown settlement the great majority were undesirable or untrustworthy and babalatchi mentioned regretfully the men he had known in his young days wealthy resolute courageous reckless ready for any enterprise but why lament the past and speak about the dead there is one manlivinggreatnot far off     such was babalatchis line of policy laid before his ambitious protector lakamba assented his only objection being that it was very slow work in his extreme desire to grasp dollars and power the unintellectual exile was ready to throw himself into the arms of any wandering cutthroat whose help could be secured and babalatchi experienced great difficulty in restraining him from unconsidered violence it would not do to let it be seen that they had any hand in introducing a new element into the social and political life of sambir there was always a possibility of failure and in that case lingards vengeance would be swift and certain no risk should be run they must wait  meantime he pervaded the settlement squatting in the course of each day by many household fires testing the public temper and public opinionand always talking about his impending departure  at night he would often take lakambas smallest canoe and depart silently to pay mysterious visits to his old chief on the other side of the river omar lived in odour of sanctity under the wing of patalolo between the bamboo fence enclosing the houses of the rajah and the wild forest there was a banana plantation and on its further edge stood two little houses built on low piles under a few precious fruit trees that grew on the banks of a clear brook which bubbling up behind the house ran in its short and rapid course down to the big river along the brook a narrow path led through the dense second growth of a neglected clearing to the banana plantation and to the houses in it which the rajah had given for residence to omar the rajah was greatly impressed by omars ostentatious piety by his oracular wisdom by his many misfortunes by the solemn fortitude with which he bore his affliction often the old ruler of sambir would visit informally the blind arab and listen gravely to his talk during the hot hours of an afternoon in the night babalatchi would call and interrupt omars repose unrebuked aissa standing silently at the door of one of the huts could see the two old friends as they sat very still by the fire in the middle of the beaten ground between the two houses talking in an indistinct murmur far into the night she could not hear their words but she watched the two formless shadows curiously finally babalatchi would rise and taking her father by the wrist would lead him back to the house arrange his mats for him and go out quietly instead of going away babalatchi unconscious of aissas eyes often sat again by the fire in a long and deep meditation aissa looked with respect on that wise and brave manshe was accustomed to see at her fathers side as long as she could remembersitting alone and thoughtful in the silent night by the dying fire his body motionless and his mind wandering in the land of memories orwho knowsperhaps groping for a road in the waste spaces of the uncertain future  babalatchi noted the arrival of willems with alarm at this new accession to the white mens strength afterwards he changed his opinion he met willems one night on the path leading to omars house and noticed later on with only a moderate surprise that the blind arab did not seem to be aware of the new white mans visits to the neighbourhood of his dwelling once coming unexpectedly in the daytime babalatchi fancied he could see the gleam of a white jacket in the bushes on the other side of the brook that day he watched aissa pensively as she moved about preparing the evening rice but after awhile he went hurriedly away before sunset refusing omars hospitable invitation in the name of allah to share their meal that same evening he startled lakamba by announcing that the time had come at last to make the first move in their longdeferred game lakamba asked excitedly for explanation babalatchi shook his head and pointed to the flitting shadows of moving women and to the vague forms of men sitting by the evening fires in the courtyard not a word would he speak here he declared but when the whole household was reposing babalatchi and lakamba passed silent amongst sleeping groups to the riverside and taking a canoe paddled off stealthily on their way to the dilapidated guardhut in the old riceclearing there they were safe from all eyes and ears and could account if need be for their excursion by the wish to kill a deer the spot being well known as the drinkingplace of all kinds of game in the seclusion of its quiet solitude babalatchi explained his plan to the attentive lakamba his idea was to make use of willems for the destruction of lingards influence  i know the white men tuan he said in conclusion in many lands have i seen them always the slaves of their desires always ready to give up their strength and their reason into the hands of some woman the fate of the believers is written by the hand of the mighty one but they who worship many gods are thrown into the world with smooth foreheads for any womans hand to mark their destruction there let one white man destroy another the will of the most high is that they should be fools they know how to keep faith with their enemies but towards each other they know only deception hai i have seen i have seen  he stretched himself full length before the fire and closed his eye in real or simulated sleep lakamba not quite convinced sat for a long time with his gaze riveted on the dull embers as the night advanced a slight white mist rose from the river and the declining moon bowed over the tops of the forest seemed to seek the repose of the earth like a wayward and wandering lover who returns at last to lay his tired and silent head on his beloveds breast    chapter six   lend me your gun almayer said willems across the table on which a smoky lamp shone redly above the disorder of a finished meal i have a mind to go and look for a deer when the moon rises tonight  almayer sitting sidewise to the table his elbow pushed amongst the dirty plates his chin on his breast and his legs stretched stiffly out kept his eyes steadily on the toes of his grass slippers and laughed abruptly  you might say yes or no instead of making that unpleasant noise remarked willems with calm irritation  if i believed one word of what you say i would answered almayer without changing his attitude and speaking slowly with pauses as if dropping his words on the floor as it iswhats the use you know where the gun is you may take it or leave it gun deer bosh hunt deer pah its a    gazelle you are after my honoured guest you want gold anklets and silk sarongs for that gamemy mighty hunter and you wont get those for the asking i promise you all day amongst the natives a fine help you are to me  you shouldnt drink so much almayer said willems disguising his fury under an affected drawl you have no head never had as far as i can remember in the old days in macassar you drink too much  i drink my own retorted almayer lifting his head quickly and darting an angry glance at willems  those two specimens of the superior race glared at each other savagely for a minute then turned away their heads at the same moment as if by previous arrangement and both got up almayer kicked off his slippers and scrambled into his hammock which hung between two wooden columns of the verandah so as to catch every rare breeze of the dry season and willems after standing irresolutely by the table for a short time walked without a word down the steps of the house and over the courtyard towards the little wooden jetty where several small canoes and a couple of big white whaleboats were made fast tugging at their short painters and bumping together in the swift current of the river he jumped into the smallest canoe balancing himself clumsily slipped the rattan painter and gave an unnecessary and violent shove which nearly sent him headlong overboard by the time he regained his balance the canoe had drifted some fifty yards down the river he knelt in the bottom of his little craft and fought the current with long sweeps of the paddle almayer sat up in his hammock grasping his feet and peering over the river with parted lips till he made out the shadowy form of man and canoe as they struggled past the jetty again  i thought you would go he shouted wont you take the gun hey he yelled straining his voice then he fell back in his hammock and laughed to himself feebly till he fell asleep on the river willems his eyes fixed intently ahead swept his paddle right and left unheeding the words that reached him faintly  it was now three months since lingard had landed willems in sambir and had departed hurriedly leaving him in almayers care  the two white men did not get on well together almayer remembering the time when they both served hudig and when the superior willems treated him with offensive condescension felt a great dislike towards his guest he was also jealous of lingards favour almayer had married a malay girl whom the old seaman had adopted in one of his accesses of unreasoning benevolence and as the marriage was not a happy one from a domestic point of view he looked to lingards fortune for compensation in his matrimonial unhappiness the appearance of that man who seemed to have a claim of some sort upon lingard filled him with considerable uneasiness the more so because the old seaman did not choose to acquaint the husband of his adopted daughter with willems history or to confide to him his intentions as to that individuals future fate suspicious from the first almayer discouraged willems attempts to help him in his trading and then when willems drew back he made with characteristic perverseness a grievance of his unconcern from cold civility in their relations the two men drifted into silent hostility then into outspoken enmity and both wished ardently for lingards return and the end of a situation that grew more intolerable from day to day the time dragged slowly willems watched the succeeding sunrises wondering dismally whether before the evening some change would occur in the deadly dullness of his life he missed the commercial activity of that existence which seemed to him far off irreparably lost buried out of sight under the ruins of his past successnow gone from him beyond the possibility of redemption he mooned disconsolately about almayers courtyard watching from afar with uninterested eyes the upcountry canoes discharging guttah or rattans and loading rice or european goods on the little wharf of lingard  co big as was the extent of ground owned by almayer willems yet felt that there was not enough room for him inside those neat fences the man who during long years became accustomed to think of himself as indispensable to others felt a bitter and savage rage at the cruel consciousness of his superfluity of his uselessness at the cold hostility visible in every look of the only white man in this barbarous corner of the world he gnashed his teeth when he thought of the wasted days of the life thrown away in the unwilling company of that peevish and suspicious fool he heard the reproach of his idleness in the murmurs of the river in the unceasing whisper of the great forests round him everything stirred moved swept by in a rush the earth under his feet and the heavens above his head the very savages around him strove struggled fought workedif only to prolong a miserable existence but they lived they lived and it was only himself that seemed to be left outside the scheme of creation in a hopeless immobility filled with tormenting anger and with everstinging regret  he took to wandering about the settlement the afterwards flourishing sambir was born in a swamp and passed its youth in malodorous mud the houses crowded the bank and as if to get away from the unhealthy shore stepped boldly into the river shooting over it in a close row of bamboo platforms elevated on high piles amongst which the current below spoke in a soft and unceasing plaint of murmuring eddies there was only one path in the whole town and it ran at the back of the houses along the succession of blackened circular patches that marked the place of the household fires on the other side the virgin forest bordered the path coming close to it as if to provoke impudently any passerby to the solution of the gloomy problem of its depths nobody would accept the deceptive challenge there were only a few feeble attempts at a clearing here and there but the ground was low and the river retiring after its yearly floods left on each a gradually diminishing mudhole where the imported buffaloes of the bugis settlers wallowed happily during the heat of the day when willems walked on the path the indolent men stretched on the shady side of the houses looked at him with calm curiosity the women busy round the cooking fires would send after him wondering and timid glances while the children would only look once and then run away yelling with fright at the horrible appearance of the man with a red and white face these manifestations of childish disgust and fear stung willems with a sense of absurd humiliation he sought in his walks the comparative solitude of the rudimentary clearings but the very buffaloes snorted with alarm at his sight scrambled lumberingly out of the cool mud and stared wildly in a compact herd at him as he tried to slink unperceived along the edge of the forest one day at some unguarded and sudden movement of his the whole herd stampeded down the path scattered the fires sent the women flying with shrill cries and left behind a track of smashed pots trampled rice overturned children and a crowd of angry men brandishing sticks in loudvoiced pursuit the innocent cause of that disturbance ran shamefacedly the gauntlet of black looks and unfriendly remarks and hastily sought refuge in almayers campong after that he left the settlement alone  later when the enforced confinement grew irksome willems took one of almayers many canoes and crossed the main branch of the pantai in search of some solitary spot where he could hide his discouragement and his weariness he skirted in his little craft the wall of tangled verdure keeping in the dead water close to the bank where the spreading nipa palms nodded their broad leaves over his head as if in contemptuous pity of the wandering outcast here and there he could see the beginnings of choppedout pathways and with the fixed idea of getting out of sight of the busy river he would land and follow the narrow and winding path only to find that it led nowhere ending abruptly in the discouragement of thorny thickets he would go back slowly with a bitter sense of unreasonable disappointment and sadness oppressed by the hot smell of earth dampness and decay in that forest which seemed to push him mercilessly back into the glittering sunshine of the river and he would recommence paddling with tired arms to seek another opening to find another deception  as he paddled up to the point where the rajahs stockade came down to the river the nipas were left behind rattling their leaves over the brown water and the big trees would appear on the bank tall strong indifferent in the immense solidity of their life which endures for ages to that short and fleeting life in the heart of the man who crept painfully amongst their shadows in search of a refuge from the unceasing reproach of his thoughts amongst their smooth trunks a clear brook meandered for a time in twining lacets before it made up its mind to take a leap into the hurrying river over the edge of the steep bank there was also a pathway there and it seemed frequented willems landed and following the capricious promise of the track soon found himself in a comparatively clear space where the confused tracery of sunlight fell through the branches and the foliage overhead and lay on the stream that shone in an easy curve like a bright swordblade dropped amongst the long and feathery grass  further on the path continued narrowed again in the thick undergrowth at the end of the first turning willems saw a flash of white and colour a gleam of gold like a sunray lost in shadow and a vision of blackness darker than the deepest shade of the forest he stopped surprised and fancied he had heard light footstepsgrowing lighterceasing he looked around the grass on the bank of the stream trembled and a tremulous path of its shivering silvergrey tops ran from the water to the beginning of the thicket and yet there was not a breath of wind somebody kind passed there he looked pensive while the tremor died out in a quick tremble under his eyes and the grass stood high unstirring with drooping heads in the warm and motionless air  he hurried on driven by a suddenly awakened curiosity and entered the narrow way between the bushes at the next turn of the path he caught again the glimpse of coloured stuff and of a womans black hair before him he hastened his pace and came in full view of the object of his pursuit the woman who was carrying two bamboo vessels full of water heard his footsteps stopped and putting the bamboos down half turned to look back willems also stood still for a minute then walked steadily on with a firm tread while the woman moved aside to let him pass he kept his eyes fixed straight before him yet almost unconsciously he took in every detail of the tall and graceful figure as he approached her the woman tossed her head slightly back and with a free gesture of her strong round arm caught up the mass of loose black hair and brought it over her shoulder and across the lower part of her face the next moment he was passing her close walking rigidly like a man in a trance he heard her rapid breathing and he felt the touch of a look darted at him from halfopen eyes it touched his brain and his heart together it seemed to him to be something loud and stirring like a shout silent and penetrating like an inspiration the momentum of his motion carried him past her but an invisible force made up of surprise and curiosity and desire spun him round as soon as he had passed  she had taken up her burden already with the intention of pursuing her path his sudden movement arrested her at the first step and again she stood straight slim expectant with a readiness to dart away suggested in the light immobility of her pose high above the branches of the trees met in a transparent shimmer of waving green mist through which the rain of yellow rays descended upon her head streamed in glints down her black tresses shone with the changing glow of liquid metal on her face and lost itself in vanishing sparks in the sombre depths of her eyes that wide open now with enlarged pupils looked steadily at the man in her path and willems stared at her charmed with a charm that carries with it a sense of irreparable loss tingling with that feeling which begins like a caress and ends in a blow in that sudden hurt of a new emotion making its way into a human heart with the brusque stirring of sleeping sensations awakening suddenly to the rush of new hopes new fears new desiresand to the flight of ones old self  she moved a step forward and again halted a breath of wind that came through the trees but in willems fancy seemed to be driven by her moving figure rippled in a hot wave round his body and scorched his face in a burning touch he drew it in with a long breath the last long breath of a soldier before the rush of battle of a lover before he takes in his arms the adored woman the breath that gives courage to confront the menace of death or the storm of passion  who was she where did she come from wonderingly he took his eyes off her face to look round at the serried trees of the forest that stood big and still and straight as if watching him and her breathlessly he had been baffled repelled almost frightened by the intensity of that tropical life which wants the sunshine but works in gloom which seems to be all grace of colour and form all brilliance all smiles but is only the blossoming of the dead whose mystery holds the promise of joy and beauty yet contains nothing but poison and decay he had been frightened by the vague perception of danger before but now as he looked at that life again his eyes seemed able to pierce the fantastic veil of creepers and leaves to look past the solid trunks to see through the forbidding gloomand the mystery was disclosedenchanting subduing beautiful he looked at the woman through the checkered light between them she appeared to him with the impalpable distinctness of a dream the very spirit of that land of mysterious forests standing before him like an apparition behind a transparent veila veil woven of sunbeams and shadows  she had approached him still nearer he felt a strange impatience within him at her advance confused thoughts rushed through his head disordered shapeless stunning then he heard his own voice asking  who are you  i am the daughter of the blind omar she answered in a low but steady tone and you she went on a little louder you are the white traderthe great man of this place  yes said willems holding her eyes with his in a sense of extreme effort yes i am white then he added feeling as if he spoke about some other man but i am the outcast of my people  she listened to him gravely through the mesh of scattered hair her face looked like the face of a golden statue with living eyes the heavy eyelids dropped slightly and from between the long eyelashes she sent out a sidelong look hard keen and narrow like the gleam of sharp steel her lips were firm and composed in a graceful curve but the distended nostrils the upward poise of the halfaverted head gave to her whole person the expression of a wild and resentful defiance  a shadow passed over willems face he put his hand over his lips as if to keep back the words that wanted to come out in a surge of impulsive necessity the outcome of dominant thought that rushes from the heart to the brain and must be spoken in the face of doubt of danger of fear of destruction itself  you are beautiful he whispered  she looked at him again with a glance that running in one quick flash of her eyes over his sunburnt features his broad shoulders his straight tall motionless figure rested at last on the ground at his feet then she smiled in the sombre beauty of her face that smile was like the first ray of light on a stormy daybreak that darts evanescent and pale through the gloomy clouds the forerunner of sunrise and of thunder    chapter seven   there are in our lives short periods which hold no place in memory but only as the recollection of a feeling there is no remembrance of gesture of action of any outward manifestation of life those are lost in the unearthly brilliance or in the unearthly gloom of such moments we are absorbed in the contemplation of that something within our bodies which rejoices or suffers while the body goes on breathing instinctively runs away or not less instinctively fightsperhaps dies but death in such a moment is the privilege of the fortunate it is a high and rare favour a supreme grace  willems never remembered how and when he parted from aissa he caught himself drinking the muddy water out of the hollow of his hand while his canoe was drifting in midstream past the last houses of sambir with his returning wits came the fear of something unknown that had taken possession of his heart of something inarticulate and masterful which could not speak and would be obeyed his first impulse was that of revolt he would never go back there never he looked round slowly at the brilliance of things in the deadly sunshine and took up his paddle how changed everything seemed the river was broader the sky was higher how fast the canoe flew under the strokes of his paddle since when had he acquired the strength of two men or more he looked up and down the reach at the forests of the bank with a confused notion that with one sweep of his hand he could tumble all these trees into the stream his face felt burning he drank again and shuddered with a depraved sense of pleasure at the aftertaste of slime in the water  it was late when he reached almayers house but he crossed the dark and uneven courtyard walking lightly in the radiance of some light of his own invisible to other eyes his hosts sulky greeting jarred him like a sudden fall down a great height he took his place at the table opposite almayer and tried to speak cheerfully to his gloomy companion but when the meal was ended and they sat smoking in silence he felt an abrupt discouragement a lassitude in all his limbs a sense of immense sadness as after some great and irreparable loss the darkness of the night entered his heart bringing with it doubt and hesitation and dull anger with himself and all the world he had an impulse to shout horrible curses to quarrel with almayer to do something violent quite without any immediate provocation he thought he would like to assault the wretched sulky beast he glanced at him ferociously from under his eyebrows the unconscious almayer smoked thoughtfully planning tomorrows work probably the mans composure seemed to willems an unpardonable insult why didnt that idiot talk tonight when he wanted him to    on other nights he was ready enough to chatter and such dull nonsense too and willems trying hard to repress his own senseless rage looked fixedly through the thick tobaccosmoke at the stained tablecloth  they retired early as usual but in the middle of the night willems leaped out of his hammock with a stifled execration and ran down the steps into the courtyard the two night watchmen who sat by a little fire talking together in a monotonous undertone lifted their heads to look wonderingly at the discomposed features of the white man as he crossed the circle of light thrown out by their fire he disappeared in the darkness and then came back again passing them close but with no sign of consciousness of their presence on his face backwards and forwards he paced muttering to himself and the two malays after a short consultation in whispers left the fire quietly not thinking it safe to remain in the vicinity of a white man who behaved in such a strange manner they retired round the corner of the godown and watched willems curiously through the night till the short daybreak was followed by the sudden blaze of the rising sun and almayers establishment woke up to life and work  as soon as he could get away unnoticed in the bustle of the busy riverside willems crossed the river on his way to the place where he had met aissa he threw himself down in the grass by the side of the brook and listened for the sound of her footsteps the brilliant light of day fell through the irregular opening in the high branches of the trees and streamed down softened amongst the shadows of big trunks here and there a narrow sunbeam touched the rugged bark of a tree with a golden splash sparkled on the leaping water of the brook or rested on a leaf that stood out shimmering and distinct on the monotonous background of sombre green tints the clear gap of blue above his head was crossed by the quick flight of white ricebirds whose wings flashed in the sunlight while through it the heat poured down from the sky clung about the steaming earth rolled among the trees and wrapped up willems in the soft and odorous folds of air heavy with the faint scent of blossoms and with the acrid smell of decaying life and in that atmosphere of natures workshop willems felt soothed and lulled into forgetfulness of his past into indifference as to his future the recollections of his triumphs of his wrongs and of his ambition vanished in that warmth which seemed to melt all regrets all hope all anger all strength out of his heart and he lay there dreamily contented in the tepid and perfumed shelter thinking of aissas eyes recalling the sound of her voice the quiver of her lipsher frowns and her smile  she came of course to her he was something new unknown and strange he was bigger stronger than any man she had seen before and altogether different from all those she knew he was of the victorious race with a vivid remembrance of the great catastrophe of her life he appeared to her with all the fascination of a great and dangerous thing of a terror vanquished surmounted made a plaything of they spoke with just such a deep voicethose victorious men they looked with just such hard blue eyes at their enemies and she made that voice speak softly to her those eyes look tenderly at her face he was indeed a man she could not understand all he told her of his life but the fragments she understood she made up for herself into a story of a man great amongst his own people valorous and unfortunate an undaunted fugitive dreaming of vengeance against his enemies he had all the attractiveness of the vague and the unknownof the unforeseen and of the sudden of a being strong dangerous alive and human ready to be enslaved  she felt that he was ready she felt it with the unerring intuition of a primitive woman confronted by a simple impulse day after day when they met and she stood a little way off listening to his words holding him with her look the undefined terror of the new conquest became faint and blurred like the memory of a dream and the certitude grew distinct and convincing and visible to the eyes like some material thing in full sunlight it was a deep joy a great pride a tangible sweetness that seemed to leave the taste of honey on her lips he lay stretched at her feet without moving for he knew from experience how a slight movement of his could frighten her away in those first days of their intercourse he lay very quiet with all the ardour of his desire ringing in his voice and shining in his eyes whilst his body was still like death itself and he looked at her standing above him her head lost in the shadow of broad and graceful leaves that touched her cheek while the slender spikes of pale green orchids streamed down from amongst the boughs and mingled with the black hair that framed her face as if all those plants claimed her for their ownthe animated and brilliant flower of all that exuberant life which born in gloom struggles for ever towards the sunshine  every day she came a little nearer he watched her slow progressthe gradual taming of that woman by the words of his love it was the monotonous song of praise and desire that commencing at creation wraps up the world like an atmosphere and shall end only in the end of all thingswhen there are no lips to sing and no ears to hear he told her that she was beautiful and desirable and he repeated it again and again for when he told her that he had said all there was within himhe had expressed his only thought his only feeling and he watched the startled look of wonder and mistrust vanish from her face with the passing days her eyes soften the smile dwell longer and longer on her lips a smile as of one charmed by a delightful dream with the slight exaltation of intoxicating triumph lurking in its dawning tenderness  and while she was near there was nothing in the whole worldfor that idle manbut her look and her smile nothing in the past nothing in the future and in the present only the luminous fact of her existence but in the sudden darkness of her going he would be left weak and helpless as though despoiled violently of all that was himself he who had lived all his life with no preoccupation but that of his own career contemptuously indifferent to all feminine influence full of scorn for men that would submit to it if ever so little he so strong so superior even in his errors realized at last that his very individuality was snatched from within himself by the hand of a woman where was the assurance and pride of his cleverness the belief in success the anger of failure the wish to retrieve his fortune the certitude of his ability to accomplish it yet gone all gone all that had been a man within him was gone and there remained only the trouble of his heartthat heart which had become a contemptible thing which could be fluttered by a look or a smile tormented by a word soothed by a promise  when the longedfor day came at last when she sank on the grass by his side and with a quick gesture took his hand in hers he sat up suddenly with the movement and look of a man awakened by the crash of his own falling house all his blood all his sensation all his life seemed to rush into that hand leaving him without strength in a cold shiver in the sudden clamminess and collapse as of a deadly gunshot wound he flung her hand away brutally like something burning and sat motionless his head fallen forward staring on the ground and catching his breath in painful gasps his impulse of fear and apparent horror did not dismay her in the least her face was grave and her eyes looked seriously at him her fingers touched the hair of his temple ran in a light caress down his cheek twisted gently the end of his long moustache and while he sat in the tremor of that contact she ran off with startling fleetness and disappeared in a peal of clear laughter in the stir of grass in the nod of young twigs growing over the path leaving behind only a vanishing trail of motion and sound  he scrambled to his feet slowly and painfully like a man with a burden on his shoulders and walked towards the riverside he hugged to his breast the recollection of his fear and of his delight but told himself seriously over and over again that this must be the end of that adventure after shoving off his canoe into the stream he lifted his eyes to the bank and gazed at it long and steadily as if taking his last look at a place of charming memories he marched up to almayers house with the concentrated expression and the determined step of a man who had just taken a momentous resolution his face was set and rigid his gestures and movements were guarded and slow he was keeping a tight hand on himself a very tight hand he had a vivid illusionas vivid as reality almostof being in charge of a slippery prisoner he sat opposite almayer during that dinnerwhich was their last meal togetherwith a perfectly calm face and within him a growing terror of escape from his own self  now and then he would grasp the edge of the table and set his teeth hard in a sudden wave of acute despair like one who falling down a smooth and rapid declivity that ends in a precipice digs his finger nails into the yielding surface and feels himself slipping helplessly to inevitable destruction  then abruptly came a relaxation of his muscles the giving way of his will something seemed to snap in his head and that wish that idea kept back during all those hours darted into his brain with the heat and noise of a conflagration he must see her see her at once go now tonight he had the raging regret of the lost hour of every passing moment there was no thought of resistance now yet with the instinctive fear of the irrevocable with the innate falseness of the human heart he wanted to keep open the way of retreat he had never absented himself during the night what did almayer know what would almayer think better ask him for the gun a moonlight night    look for deer    a colourable pretext he would lie to almayer what did it matter he lied to himself every minute of his life and for what for a woman and such     almayers answer showed him that deception was useless everything gets to be known even in this place well he did not care cared for nothing but for the lost seconds what if he should suddenly die die before he saw her before he could     as with the sound of almayers laughter in his ears he urged his canoe in a slanting course across the rapid current he tried to tell himself that he could return at any moment he would just go and look at the place where they used to meet at the tree under which he lay when she took his hand at the spot where she sat by his side just go there and then returnnothing more but when his little skiff touched the bank he leaped out forgetting the painter and the canoe hung for a moment amongst the bushes and then swung out of sight before he had time to dash into the water and secure it he was thunderstruck at first now he could not go back unless he called up the rajahs people to get a boat and rowersand the way to patalolos campong led past aissas house  he went up the path with the eager eyes and reluctant steps of a man pursuing a phantom and when he found himself at a place where a narrow track branched off to the left towards omars clearing he stood still with a look of strained attention on his face as if listening to a faroff voicethe voice of his fate it was a sound inarticulate but full of meaning and following it there came a rending and tearing within his breast he twisted his fingers together and the joints of his hands and arms cracked on his forehead the perspiration stood out in small pearly drops he looked round wildly above the shapeless darkness of the forest undergrowth rose the treetops with their high boughs and leaves standing out black on the pale skylike fragments of night floating on moonbeams under his feet warm steam rose from the heated earth round him there was a great silence  he was looking round for help this silence this immobility of his surroundings seemed to him a cold rebuke a stern refusal a cruel unconcern there was no safety outside of himselfand in himself there was no refuge there was only the image of that woman he had a sudden moment of lucidityof that cruel lucidity that comes once in life to the most benighted he seemed to see what went on within him and was horrified at the strange sight he a white man whose worst fault till then had been a little want of judgment and too much confidence in the rectitude of his kind that woman was a complete savage and    he tried to tell himself that the thing was of no consequence it was a vain effort the novelty of the sensations he had never experienced before in the slightest degree yet had despised on hearsay from his safe position of a civilized man destroyed his courage he was disappointed with himself he seemed to be surrendering to a wild creature the unstained purity of his life of his race of his civilization he had a notion of being lost amongst shapeless things that were dangerous and ghastly he struggled with the sense of certain defeatlost his footingfell back into the darkness with a faint cry and an upward throw of his arms he gave up as a tired swimmer gives up because the swamped craft is gone from under his feet because the night is dark and the shore is farbecause death is better than strife     part ii   chapter one   the light and heat fell upon the settlement the clearings and the river as if flung down by an angry hand the land lay silent still and brilliant under the avalanche of burning rays that had destroyed all sound and all motion had buried all shadows had choked every breath no living thing dared to affront the serenity of this cloudless sky dared to revolt against the oppression of this glorious and cruel sunshine strength and resolution body and mind alike were helpless and tried to hide before the rush of the fire from heaven only the frail butterflies the fearless children of the sun the capricious tyrants of the flowers fluttered audaciously in the open and their minute shadows hovered in swarms over the drooping blossoms ran lightly on the withering grass or glided on the dry and cracked earth no voice was heard in this hot noontide but the faint murmur of the river that hurried on in swirls and eddies its sparkling wavelets chasing each other in their joyous course to the sheltering depths to the cool refuge of the sea  almayer had dismissed his workmen for the midday rest and his little daughter on his shoulder ran quickly across the courtyard making for the shade of the verandah of his house he laid the sleepy child on the seat of the big rockingchair on a pillow which he took out of his own hammock and stood for a while looking down at her with tender and pensive eyes the child tired and hot moved uneasily sighed and looked up at him with the veiled look of sleepy fatigue he picked up from the floor a broken palmleaf fan and began fanning gently the flushed little face her eyelids fluttered and almayer smiled a responsive smile brightened for a second her heavy eyes broke with a dimple the soft outline of her cheek then the eyelids dropped suddenly she drew a long breath through the parted lipsand was in a deep sleep before the fleeting smile could vanish from her face  almayer moved lightly off took one of the wooden armchairs and placing it close to the balustrade of the verandah sat down with a sigh of relief he spread his elbows on the top rail and resting his chin on his clasped hands looked absently at the river at the dance of sunlight on the flowing water gradually the forest of the further bank became smaller as if sinking below the level of the river the outlines wavered grew thin dissolved in the air before his eyes there was now only a space of undulating blueone big empty sky growing dark at times    where was the sunshine    he felt soothed and happy as if some gentle and invisible hand had removed from his soul the burden of his body in another second he seemed to float out into a cool brightness where there was no such thing as memory or pain delicious his eyes closedopenedclosed again  almayer  with a sudden jerk of his whole body he sat up grasping the front rail with both his hands and blinked stupidly  what whats that he muttered looking round vaguely  here down here almayer  half rising in his chair almayer looked over the rail at the foot of the verandah and fell back with a low whistle of astonishment  a ghost by heavens he exclaimed softly to himself  will you listen to me went on the husky voice from the courtyard may i come up almayer  almayer stood up and leaned over the rail dont you dare he said in a voice subdued but distinct dont you dare the child sleeps here and i dont want to hear youor speak to you either  you must listen to me its something important  not to me surely  yes to you very important  you were always a humbug said almayer after a short silence in an indulgent tone always i remember the old days some fellows used to say there was no one like you for smartnessbut you never took me in not quite i never quite believed in you mr willems  i admit your superior intelligence retorted willems with scornful impatience from below listening to me would be a further proof of it you will be sorry if you dont  oh you funny fellow said almayer banteringly well come up dont make a noise but come up youll catch a sunstroke down there and die on my doorstep perhaps i dont want any tragedy here come on  before he finished speaking willems head appeared above the level of the floor then his shoulders rose gradually and he stood at last before almayera masquerading spectre of the once so very confidential clerk of the richest merchant in the islands his jacket was soiled and torn below the waist he was clothed in a wornout and faded sarong he flung off his hat uncovering his long tangled hair that stuck in wisps on his perspiring forehead and straggled over his eyes which glittered deep down in the sockets like the last sparks amongst the black embers of a burntout fire an unclean beard grew out of the caverns of his sunburnt cheeks the hand he put out towards almayer was very unsteady the once firm mouth had the telltale droop of mental suffering and physical exhaustion he was barefooted almayer surveyed him with leisurely composure  well he said at last without taking the extended hand which dropped slowly along willems body  i am come began willems  so i see interrupted almayer you might have spared me this treat without making me unhappy you have been away five weeks if i am not mistaken i got on very well without youand now you are here you are not pretty to look at  let me speak will you exclaimed willems  dont shout like this do you think yourself in the forest with your    your friends this is a civilized mans house a white mans understand  i am come began willems again i am come for your good and mine  you look as if you had come for a good feed chimed in the irrepressible almayer while willems waved his hand in a discouraged gesture dont they give you enough to eat went on almayer in a tone of easy banter thosewhat am i to call themthose new relations of yours that old blind scoundrel must be delighted with your company you know he was the greatest thief and murderer of those seas say do you exchange confidences tell me willems did you kill somebody in macassar or did you only steal something  it is not true exclaimed willems hotly i only borrowed    they all lied i     shsh hissed almayer warningly with a look at the sleeping child so you did steal he went on with repressed exultation i thought there was something of the kind and now here you steal again  for the first time willems raised his eyes to almayers face  oh i dont mean from me i havent missed anything said almayer with mocking haste but that girl hey you stole her you did not pay the old fellow she is no good to him now is she  stop that almayer  something in willems tone caused almayer to pause he looked narrowly at the man before him and could not help being shocked at his appearance  almayer went on willems listen to me if you are a human being you will i suffer horriblyand for your sake  almayer lifted his eyebrows indeed how but you are raving he added negligently  ah you dont know whispered willems she is gone gone he repeated with tears in his voice gone two days ago  no exclaimed the surprised almayer gone i havent heard that news yet he burst into a subdued laugh how funny had enough of you already you know its not flattering for you my superior countryman  willemsas if not hearing himleaned against one of the columns of the roof and looked over the river at first he whispered dreamily my life was like a vision of heavenor hell i didnt know which since she went i know what perdition means what darkness is i know what it is to be torn to pieces alive thats how i feel  you may come and live with me again said almayer coldly after all lingardwhom i call my father and respect as suchleft you under my care you pleased yourself by going away very good now you want to come back be it so i am no friend of yours i act for captain lingard  come back repeated willems passionately come back to you and abandon her do you think i am mad without her man what are you made of to think that she moves lives breathes out of my sight i am jealous of the wind that fans her of the air she breathes of the earth that receives the caress of her foot of the sun that looks at her now while i    i havent seen her for two daystwo days  the intensity of willems feeling moved almayer somewhat but he affected to yawn elaborately you do bore me he muttered why dont you go after her instead of coming here  why indeed  dont you know where she is she cant be very far no native craft has left this river for the last fortnight  no not very farand i will tell you where she is she is in lakambas campong and willems fixed his eyes steadily on almayers face  phew patalolo never sent to let me know strange said almayer thoughtfully are you afraid of that lot he added after a short pause  iafraid  then is it the care of your dignity which prevents you from following her there my highminded friend asked almayer with mock solicitude how noble of you  there was a short silence then willems said quietly you are a fool i should like to kick you  no fear answered almayer carelessly you are too weak for that you look starved  i dont think i have eaten anything for the last two days perhaps morei dont remember it does not matter i am full of live embers said willems gloomily look and he bared an arm covered with fresh scars i have been biting myself to forget in that pain the fire that hurts me there he struck his breast violently with his fist reeled under his own blow fell into a chair that stood near and closed his eyes slowly  disgusting exhibition said almayer loftily what could father ever see in you you are as estimable as a heap of garbage  you talk like that you who sold your soul for a few guilders muttered willems wearily without opening his eyes  not so few said almayer with instinctive readiness and stopped confused for a moment he recovered himself quickly however and went on but youyou have thrown yours away for nothing flung it under the feet of a damned savage woman who has made you already the thing you are and will kill you very soon one way or another with her love or with her hate you spoke just now about guilders you meant lingards money i suppose well whatever i have sold and for whatever price i never meant youyou of all peopleto spoil my bargain i feel pretty safe though even father even captain lingard would not touch you now with a pair of tongs not with a tenfoot pole     he spoke excitedly all in one breath and ceasing suddenly glared at willems and breathed hard through his nose in sulky resentment willems looked at him steadily for a moment then got up  almayer he said resolutely i want to become a trader in this place  almayer shrugged his shoulders  yes and you shall set me up i want a house and trade goodsperhaps a little money i ask you for it  anything else you want perhaps this coat and here almayer unbuttoned his jacketor my houseor my boots  after all its natural went on willems without paying any attention to almayerits natural that she should expect the advantages which    and then i could shut up that old wretch and then     he paused his face brightened with the soft light of dreamy enthusiasm and he turned his eyes upwards with his gaunt figure and dilapidated appearance he looked like some ascetic dweller in a wilderness finding the reward of a selfdenying life in a vision of dazzling glory he went on in an impassioned murmur  and then i would have her all to myself away from her peopleall to myselfunder my own influenceto fashionto mouldto adoreto softento    oh delight and thenthen go away to some distant place where far from all she knew i would be all the world to her all the world to her  his face changed suddenly his eyes wandered for awhile and then became steady all at once  i would repay every cent of course he said in a businesslike tone with something of his old assurance of his old belief in himself in it every cent i need not interfere with your business i shall cut out the small native traders i have ideasbut never mind that now and captain lingard would approve i feel sure after all its a loan and i shall be at hand safe thing for you  ah captain lingard would approve he would app    almayer choked the notion of lingard doing something for willems enraged him his face was purple he spluttered insulting words willems looked at him coolly  i assure you almayer he said gently that i have good grounds for my demand  your cursed impudence  believe me almayer your position here is not so safe as you may think an unscrupulous rival here would destroy your trade in a year it would be ruin now lingards long absence gives courage to certain individuals you knowi have heard much lately they made proposals to me    you are very much alone here even patalolo     damn patalolo i am master in this place  but almayer dont you see     yes i see i see a mysterious ass interrupted almayer violently what is the meaning of your veiled threats dont you think i know something also they have been intriguing for yearsand nothing has happened the arabs have been hanging about outside this river for yearsand i am still the only trader here the master here do you bring me a declaration of war then its from yourself only i know all my other enemies i ought to knock you on the head you are not worth powder and shot though you ought to be destroyed with a sticklike a snake  almayers voice woke up the little girl who sat up on the pillow with a sharp cry he rushed over to the chair caught up the child in his arms walked back blindly stumbled against willems hat which lay on the floor and kicked it furiously down the steps  clear out of this clear out he shouted  willems made an attempt to speak but almayer howled him down  take yourself off dont you see you frighten the childyou scarecrow no no dear he went on to his little daughter soothingly while willems walked down the steps slowly no dont cry see bad man going away look he is afraid of your papa nasty bad man never come back again he shall live in the woods and never come near my little girl if he comes papa will kill himso he struck his fist on the rail of the balustrade to show how he would kill willems and perching the consoled child on his shoulder held her with one hand while he pointed toward the retreating figure of his visitor  look how he runs away dearest he said coaxingly isnt he funny call pig after him dearest call after him  the seriousness of her face vanished into dimples under the long eyelashes glistening with recent tears her big eyes sparkled and danced with fun she took firm hold of almayers hair with one hand while she waved the other joyously and called out with all her might in a clear note soft and distinct like the pipe of a bird  pig pig pig    chapter two  a sigh under the flaming blue a shiver of the sleeping sea a cool breath as if a door had been swung upon the frozen spaces of the universe and with a stir of leaves with the nod of boughs with the tremble of slender branches the sea breeze struck the coast rushed up the river swept round the broad reaches and travelled on in a soft ripple of darkening water in the whisper of branches in the rustle of leaves of the awakened forests it fanned in lakambas campong the dull red of expiring embers into a pale brilliance and under its touch the slender upright spirals of smoke that rose from every glowing heap swayed wavered and eddying down filled the twilight of clustered shade trees with the aromatic scent of the burning wood the men who had been dozing in the shade during the hot hours of the afternoon woke up and the silence of the big courtyard was broken by the hesitating murmur of yet sleepy voices by coughs and yawns with now and then a burst of laughter a loud hail a name or a joke sent out in a soft drawl small groups squatted round the little fires and the monotonous undertone of talk filled the enclosure the talk of barbarians persistent steady repeating itself in the soft syllables in musical tones of the neverending discourses of those men of the forests and the sea who can talk most of the day and all the night who never exhaust a subject never seem able to thresh a matter out to whom that talk is poetry and painting and music all art all history their only accomplishment their only superiority their only amusement the talk of camp fires which speaks of bravery and cunning of strange events and of far countries of the news of yesterday and the news of tomorrow the talk about the dead and the livingabout those who fought and those who loved  lakamba came out on the platform before his own house and sat downperspiring half asleep and sulkyin a wooden armchair under the shade of the overhanging eaves through the darkness of the doorway he could hear the soft warbling of his womenkind busy round the looms where they were weaving the checkered pattern of his gala sarongs right and left of him on the flexible bamboo floor those of his followers to whom their distinguished birth long devotion or faithful service had given the privilege of using the chiefs house were sleeping on mats or just sat up rubbing their eyes while the more wakeful had mustered enough energy to draw a chessboard with red clay on a fine mat and were now meditating silently over their moves above the prostrate forms of the players who lay face downward supported on elbow the soles of their feet waving irresolutely about in the absorbed meditation of the game there towered here and there the straight figure of an attentive spectator looking down with dispassionate but profound interest on the edge of the platform a row of highheeled leather sandals stood ranged carefully in a level line and against the rough wooden rail leaned the slender shafts of the spears belonging to these gentlemen the broad blades of dulled steel looking very black in the reddening light of approaching sunset  a boy of about twelvethe personal attendant of lakambasquatted at his masters feet and held up towards him a silver siri box slowly lakamba took the box opened it and tearing off a piece of green leaf deposited in it a pinch of lime a morsel of gambier a small bit of areca nut and wrapped up the whole with a dexterous twist he paused morsel in hand seemed to miss something turned his head from side to side slowly like a man with a stiff neck and ejaculated in an illhumoured bass  babalatchi  the players glanced up quickly and looked down again directly those men who were standing stirred uneasily as if prodded by the sound of the chiefs voice the one nearest to lakamba repeated the call after a while over the rail into the courtyard there was a movement of upturned faces below by the fires and the cry trailed over the enclosure in singsong tones the thumping of wooden pestles husking the evening rice stopped for a moment and babalatchis name rang afresh shrilly on womens lips in various keys a voice far off shouted somethinganother nearer repeated it there was a short hubbub which died out with extreme suddenness the first crier turned to lakamba saying indolently  he is with the blind omar  lakambas lips moved inaudibly the man who had just spoken was again deeply absorbed in the game going on at his feet and the chiefas if he had forgotten all about it alreadysat with a stolid face amongst his silent followers leaning back squarely in his chair his hands on the arms of his seat his knees apart his big bloodshot eyes blinking solemnly as if dazzled by the noble vacuity of his thoughts  babalatchi had gone to see old omar late in the afternoon the delicate manipulation of the ancient pirates susceptibilities the skilful management of aissas violent impulses engrossed him to the exclusion of every other businessinterfered with his regular attendance upon his chief and protectoreven disturbed his sleep for the last three nights that day when he left his own bamboo hutwhich stood amongst others in lakambas camponghis heart was heavy with anxiety and with doubt as to the success of his intrigue he walked slowly with his usual air of detachment from his surroundings as if unaware that many sleepy eyes watched from all parts of the courtyard his progress towards a small gate at its upper end that gate gave access to a separate enclosure in which a rather large house built of planks had been prepared by lakambas orders for the reception of omar and aissa it was a superior kind of habitation which lakamba intended for the dwelling of his chief adviserwhose abilities were worth that honour he thought but after the consultation in the deserted clearingwhen babalatchi had disclosed his planthey both had agreed that the new house should be used at first to shelter omar and aissa after they had been persuaded to leave the rajahs place or had been kidnapped from thereas the case might be babalatchi did not mind in the least the putting off of his own occupation of the house of honour because it had many advantages for the quiet working out of his plans it had a certain seclusion having an enclosure of its own and that enclosure communicated also with lakambas private courtyard at the back of his residencea place set apart for the female household of the chief the only communication with the river was through the great front courtyard always full of armed men and watchful eyes behind the whole group of buildings there stretched the level ground of riceclearings which in their turn were closed in by the wall of untouched forests with undergrowth so thick and tangled that nothing but a bulletand that fired at pretty close rangecould penetrate any distance there  babalatchi slipped quietly through the little gate and closing it tied up carefully the rattan fastenings before the house there was a square space of ground beaten hard into the level smoothness of asphalte a big buttressed tree a giant left there on purpose during the process of clearing the land roofed in the clear space with a high canopy of gnarled boughs and thick sombre leaves to the rightand some small distance away from the large housea little hut of reeds covered with mats had been put up for the special convenience of omar who being blind and infirm had some difficulty in ascending the steep plankway that led to the more substantial dwelling which was built on low posts and had an uncovered verandah close by the trunk of the tree and facing the doorway of the hut the household fire glowed in a small handful of embers in the midst of a large circle of white ashes an old womansome humble relation of one of lakambas wives who had been ordered to attend on aissawas squatting over the fire and lifted up her bleared eyes to gaze at babalatchi in an uninterested manner as he advanced rapidly across the courtyard  babalatchi took in the courtyard with a keen glance of his solitary eye and without looking down at the old woman muttered a question silently the woman stretched a tremulous and emaciated arm towards the hut babalatchi made a few steps towards the doorway but stopped outside in the sunlight  o tuan omar omar besar it is ibabalatchi  within the hut there was a feeble groan a fit of coughing and an indistinct murmur in the broken tones of a vague plaint encouraged evidently by those signs of dismal life within babalatchi entered the hut and after some time came out leading with rigid carefulness the blind omar who followed with both his hands on his guides shoulders there was a rude seat under the tree and there babalatchi led his old chief who sat down with a sigh of relief and leaned wearily against the rugged trunk the rays of the setting sun darting under the spreading branches rested on the whiterobed figure sitting with head thrown back in stiff dignity on the thin hands moving uneasily and on the stolid face with its eyelids dropped over the destroyed eyeballs a face set into the immobility of a plaster cast yellowed by age  is the sun near its setting asked omar in a dull voice  very near answered babalatchi  where am i why have i been taken away from the place which i knewwhere i blind could move without fear it is like black night to those who see and the sun is near its settingand i have not heard the sound of her footsteps since the morning twice a strange hand has given me my food today why why where is she  she is near said babalatchi  and he went on omar with sudden eagerness and a drop in his voice where is he not here not here he repeated turning his head from side to side as if in deliberate attempt to see  no he is not here now said babalatchi soothingly then after a pause he added very low but he shall soon return  return o crafty one will he return i have cursed him three times exclaimed omar with weak violence  he isno doubtaccursed assented babalatchi in a conciliating mannerand yet he will be here before very longi know  you are crafty and faithless i have made you great you were dirt under my feetless than dirt said omar with tremulous energy  i have fought by your side many times said babalatchi calmly  why did he come went on omar did you send him why did he come to defile the air i breatheto mock at my fateto poison her mind and steal her body she has grown hard of heart to me hard and merciless and stealthy like rocks that tear a ships life out under the smooth sea he drew a long breath struggled with his anger then broke down suddenly i have been hungry he continued in a whimpering toneoften i have been very hungryand coldand neglectedand nobody near me she has often forgotten meand my sons are dead and that man is an infidel and a dog why did he come did you show him the way  he found the way himself o leader of the brave said babalatchi sadly i only saw a way for their destruction and our own greatness and if i saw aright then you shall never suffer from hunger any more there shall be peace for us and glory and riches  and i shall die tomorrow murmured omar bitterly  who knows those things have been written since the beginning of the world whispered babalatchi thoughtfully  do not let him come back exclaimed omar  neither can he escape his fate went on babalatchi he shall come back and the power of men we always hated you and i shall crumble into dust in our hand then he added with enthusiasm they shall fight amongst themselves and perish both  and you shall see all this while i     true murmured babalatchi regretfully to you life is darkness  no flame exclaimed the old arab half rising then falling back in his seat the flame of that last day i see it yetthe last thing i saw and i hear the noise of the rent earthwhen they all died and i live to be the plaything of a crafty one he added with inconsequential peevishness  you are my master still said babalatchi humbly you are very wiseand in your wisdom you shall speak to syed abdulla when he comes hereyou shall speak to him as i advised i your servant the man who fought at your right hand for many years i have heard by a messenger that the syed abdulla is coming tonight perhaps late for those things must be done secretly lest the white man the trader up the river should know of them but he will be here there has been a surat delivered to lakamba in it syed abdulla says he will leave his ship which is anchored outside the river at the hour of noon today he will be here before daylight if allah wills  he spoke with his eye fixed on the ground and did not become aware of aissas presence till he lifted his head when he ceased speaking she had approached so quietly that even omar did not hear her footsteps and she stood now looking at them with troubled eyes and parted lips as if she was going to speak but at babalatchis entreating gesture she remained silent omar sat absorbed in thought  ay wa even so he said at last in a weak voice i am to speak your wisdom o babalatchi tell him to trust the white man i do not understand i am old and blind and weak i do not understand i am very cold he continued in a lower tone moving his shoulders uneasily he ceased then went on rambling in a faint whisper they are the sons of witches and their father is satan the stoned sons of witches sons of witches after a short silence he asked suddenly in a firmer voicehow many white men are there here o crafty one  there are two here two white men to fight one another answered babalatchi with alacrity  and how many will be left then how many tell me you who are wise  the downfall of an enemy is the consolation of the unfortunate said babalatchi sententiously they are on every sea only the wisdom of the most high knows their numberbut you shall know that some of them suffer  tell me babalatchi will they die will they both die asked omar in sudden agitation  aissa made a movement babalatchi held up a warning hand  they shall surely die he said steadily looking at the girl with unflinching eye  ay wa but die soon so that i can pass my hand over their faces when allah has made them stiff  if such is their fate and yours answered babalatchi without hesitation god is great  a violent fit of coughing doubled omar up and he rocked himself to and fro wheezing and moaning in turns while babalatchi and the girl looked at him in silence then he leaned back against the tree exhausted  i am alone i am alone he wailed feebly groping vaguely about with his trembling hands is there anybody near me is there anybody i am afraid of this strange place  i am by your side o leader of the brave said babalatchi touching his shoulder lightly always by your side as in the days when we both were young as in the time when we both went with arms in our hands  has there been such a time babalatchi said omar wildly i have forgotten and now when i die there will be no man no fearless man to speak of his fathers bravery there was a woman a woman and she has forsaken me for an infidel dog the hand of the compassionate is heavy on my head oh my calamity oh my shame  he calmed down after a while and asked quietly  is the sun set babalatchi  it is now as low as the highest tree i can see from here answered babalatchi  it is the time of prayer said omar attempting to get up  dutifully babalatchi helped his old chief to rise and they walked slowly towards the hut omar waited outside while babalatchi went in and came out directly dragging after him the old arabs praying carpet out of a brass vessel he poured the water of ablution on omars outstretched hands and eased him carefully down into a kneeling posture for the venerable robber was far too infirm to be able to stand then as omar droned out the first words and made his first bow towards the holy city babalatchi stepped noiselessly towards aissa who did not move all the time  aissa looked steadily at the oneeyed sage who was approaching her slowly and with a great show of deference for a moment they stood facing each other in silence babalatchi appeared embarrassed with a sudden and quick gesture she caught hold of his arm and with the other hand pointed towards the sinking red disc that glowed rayless through the floating mists of the evening  the third sunset the last and he is not here she whispered what have you done man without faith what have you done  indeed i have kept my word murmured babalatchi earnestly this morning bulangi went with a canoe to look for him he is a strange man but our friend and shall keep close to him and watch him without ostentation and at the third hour of the day i have sent another canoe with four rowers indeed the man you long for o daughter of omar may come when he likes  but he is not here i waited for him yesterday today tomorrow i shall go  not alive muttered babalatchi to himself and do you doubt your power he went on in a louder toneyou that to him are more beautiful than an houri of the seventh heaven he is your slave  a slave does run away sometimes she said gloomily and then the master must go and seek him out  and do you want to live and die a beggar asked babalatchi impatiently  i care not she exclaimed wringing her hands and the black pupils of her wideopen eyes darted wildly here and there like petrels before the storm  sh sh hissed babalatchi with a glance towards omar do you think o girl that he himself would live like a beggar even with you  he is great she said ardently he despises you all he despises you all he is indeed a man  you know that best muttered babalatchi with a fugitive smilebut remember woman with the strong heart that to hold him now you must be to him like the great sea to thirsty mena neverceasing torment and a madness  he ceased and they stood in silence both looking on the ground and for a time nothing was heard above the crackling of the fire but the intoning of omar glorifying the godhis god and the faithhis faith then babalatchi cocked his head on one side and appeared to listen intently to the hum of voices in the big courtyard the dull noise swelled into distinct shouts then into a great tumult of voices dying away recommencing growing louder to cease again abruptly and in those short pauses the shrill vociferations of women rushed up as if released towards the quiet heaven aissa and babalatchi started but the latter gripped in his turn the girls arm and restrained her with a strong grasp  wait he whispered  the little door in the heavy stockade which separated lakambas private ground from omars enclosure swung back quickly and the noble exile appeared with disturbed mien and a naked short sword in his hand his turban was half unrolled and the end trailed on the ground behind him his jacket was open he breathed thickly for a moment before he spoke  he came in bulangis boat he said and walked quietly till he was in my presence when the senseless fury of white men caused him to rush upon me i have been in great danger went on the ambitious nobleman in an aggrieved tone do you hear that babalatchi that eater of swine aimed a blow at my face with his unclean fist he tried to rush amongst my household six men are holding him now  a fresh outburst of yells stopped lakambas discourse angry voices shouted hold him beat him down strike at his head  then the clamour ceased with sudden completeness as if strangled by a mighty hand and after a second of surprising silence the voice of willems was heard alone howling maledictions in malay in dutch and in english  listen said lakamba speaking with unsteady lips he blasphemes his god his speech is like the raving of a mad dog can we hold him for ever he must be killed  fool muttered babalatchi looking up at aissa who stood with set teeth with gleaming eyes and distended nostrils yet obedient to the touch of his restraining hand it is the third day and i have kept my promise he said to her speaking very low remember he added warninglylike the sea to the thirsty and now he said aloud releasing her and stepping back go fearless daughter go  like an arrow rapid and silent she flew down the enclosure and disappeared through the gate of the courtyard lakamba and babalatchi looked after her they heard the renewed tumult the girls clear voice calling out let him go then after a pause in the din no longer than half the human breath the name of aissa rang in a shout loud discordant and piercing which sent through them an involuntary shudder old omar collapsed on his carpet and moaned feebly lakamba stared with gloomy contempt in the direction of the inhuman sound but babalatchi forcing a smile pushed his distinguished protector through the narrow gate in the stockade followed him and closed it quickly  the old woman who had been most of the time kneeling by the fire now rose glanced round fearfully and crouched hiding behind the tree the gate of the great courtyard flew open with a great clatter before a frantic kick and willems darted in carrying aissa in his arms he rushed up the enclosure like a tornado pressing the girl to his breast her arms round his neck her head hanging back over his arm her eyes closed and her long hair nearly touching the ground they appeared for a second in the glare of the fire then with immense strides he dashed up the planks and disappeared with his burden in the doorway of the big house  inside and outside the enclosure there was silence omar lay supporting himself on his elbow his terrified face with its closed eyes giving him the appearance of a man tormented by a nightmare  what is it help help me to rise he called out faintly  the old hag still crouching in the shadow stared with bleared eyes at the doorway of the big house and took no notice of his call he listened for a while then his arm gave way and with a deep sigh of discouragement he let himself fall on the carpet  the boughs of the tree nodded and trembled in the unsteady currents of the light wind a leaf fluttered down slowly from some high branch and rested on the ground immobile as if resting for ever in the glow of the fire but soon it stirred then soared suddenly and flew spinning and turning before the breath of the perfumed breeze driven helplessly into the dark night that had closed over the land    chapter three   for upwards of forty years abdulla had walked in the way of his lord son of the rich syed selim bin sali the great mohammedan trader of the straits he went forth at the age of seventeen on his first commercial expedition as his fathers representative on board a pilgrim ship chartered by the wealthy arab to convey a crowd of pious malays to the holy shrine that was in the days when steam was not in those seasor at least not so much as now the voyage was long and the young mans eyes were opened to the wonders of many lands allah had made it his fate to become a pilgrim very early in life this was a great favour of heaven and it could not have been bestowed upon a man who prized it more or who made himself more worthy of it by the unswerving piety of his heart and by the religious solemnity of his demeanour later on it became clear that the book of his destiny contained the programme of a wandering life he visited bombay and calcutta looked in at the persian gulf beheld in due course the high and barren coasts of the gulf of suez and this was the limit of his wanderings westward he was then twentyseven and the writing on his forehead decreed that the time had come for him to return to the straits and take from his dying fathers hands the many threads of a business that was spread over all the archipelago from sumatra to new guinea from batavia to palawan  very soon his ability his willstrong to obstinacyhis wisdom beyond his years caused him to be recognized as the head of a family whose members and connections were found in every part of those seas an uncle herea brother there a fatherinlaw in batavia another in palembang husbands of numerous sisters cousins innumerable scattered north south east and westin every place where there was trade the great family lay like a network over the islands they lent money to princes influenced the councilrooms facedif need bewith peaceful intrepidity the white rulers who held the land and the sea under the edge of sharp swords and they all paid great deference to abdulla listened to his advice entered into his plansbecause he was wise pious and fortunate  he bore himself with the humility becoming a believer who never forgets even for one moment of his waking life that he is the servant of the most high he was largely charitable because the charitable man is the friend of allah and when he walked out of his housebuilt of stone just outside the town of penangon his way to his godowns in the port he had often to snatch his hand away sharply from under the lips of men of his race and creed and often he had to murmur deprecating words or even to rebuke with severity those who attempted to touch his knees with their fingertips in gratitude or supplication he was very handsome and carried his small head high with meek gravity his lofty brow straight nose narrow dark face with its chiselled delicacy of feature gave him an aristocratic appearance which proclaimed his pure descent his beard was trimmed close and to a rounded point his large brown eyes looked out steadily with a sweetness that was belied by the expression of his thinlipped mouth his aspect was serene he had a belief in his own prosperity which nothing could shake  restless like all his people he very seldom dwelt for many days together in his splendid house in penang owner of ships he was often on board one or another of them traversing in all directions the field of his operations in every port he had a householdhis own or that of a relationto hail his advent with demonstrative joy in every port there were rich and influential men eager to see him there was business to talk over there were important letters to read an immense correspondence enclosed in silk envelopesa correspondence which had nothing to do with the infidels of colonial postoffices but came into his hands by devious yet safe ways it was left for him by taciturn nakhodas of native trading craft or was delivered with profound salaams by travelstained and weary men who would withdraw from his presence calling upon allah to bless the generous giver of splendid rewards and the news was always good and all his attempts always succeeded and in his ears there rang always a chorus of admiration of gratitude of humble entreaties  a fortunate man and his felicity was so complete that the good genii who ordered the stars at his birth had not neglectedby a refinement of benevolence strange in such primitive beingsto provide him with a desire difficult to attain and with an enemy hard to overcome the envy of lingards political and commercial successes and the wish to get the best of him in every way became abdullas mania the paramount interest of his life the salt of his existence  for the last few months he had been receiving mysterious messages from sambir urging him to decisive action he had found the river a couple of years ago and had been anchored more than once off that estuary where the till then rapid pantai spreading slowly over the lowlands seems to hesitate before it flows gently through twenty outlets over a maze of mudflats sandbanks and reefs into the expectant sea he had never attempted the entrance however because men of his race although brave and adventurous travellers lack the true seamanlike instincts and he was afraid of getting wrecked he could not bear the idea of the rajah laut being able to boast that abdulla bin selim like other and lesser men had also come to grief when trying to wrest his secret from him meantime he returned encouraging answers to his unknown friends in sambir and waited for his opportunity in the calm certitude of ultimate triumph  such was the man whom lakamba and babalatchi expected to see for the first time on the night of willems return to aissa babalatchi who had been tormented for three days by the fear of having overreached himself in his little plot now feeling sure of his white man felt lighthearted and happy as he superintended the preparations in the courtyard for abdullas reception halfway between lakambas house and the river a pile of dry wood was made ready for the torch that would set fire to it at the moment of abdullas landing between this and the house again there was ranged in a semicircle a set of low bamboo frames and on those were piled all the carpets and cushions of lakambas household it had been decided that the reception was to take place in the open air and that it should be made impressive by the great number of lakambas retainers who clad in clean white with their red sarongs gathered round their waists chopper at side and lance in hand were moving about the compound or gathering into small knots discussed eagerly the coming ceremony  two little fires burned brightly on the waters edge on each side of the landing place a small heap of damargum torches lay by each and between them babalatchi strolled backwards and forwards stopping often with his face to the river and his head on one side listening to the sounds that came from the darkness over the water there was no moon and the night was very clear overhead but after the afternoon breeze had expired in fitful puffs the vapours hung thickening over the glancing surface of the pantai and clung to the shore hiding from view the middle of the stream  a cry in the mistthen anotherand before babalatchi could answer two little canoes dashed up to the landingplace and two of the principal citizens of sambir daoud sahamin and hamet bahassoen who had been confidentially invited to meet abdulla landed quickly and after greeting babalatchi walked up the dark courtyard towards the house the little stir caused by their arrival soon subsided and another silent hour dragged its slow length while babalatchi tramped up and down between the fires his face growing more anxious with every passing moment  at last there was heard a loud hail from down the river at a call from babalatchi men ran down to the riverside and snatching the torches thrust them into the fires then waved them above their heads till they burst into a flame the smoke ascended in thick wispy streams and hung in a ruddy cloud above the glare that lit up the courtyard and flashed over the water showing three long canoes manned by many paddlers lying a little off the men in them lifting their paddles on high and dipping them down together in an easy stroke that kept the small flotilla motionless in the strong current exactly abreast of the landingplace a man stood up in the largest craft and called out  syed abdulla bin selim is here  babalatchi answered aloud in a formal tone  allah gladdens our hearts come to the land  abdulla landed first steadying himself by the help of babalatchis extended hand in the short moment of his passing from the boat to the shore they exchanged sharp glances and a few rapid words  who are you  babalatchi the friend of omar the protected of lakamba  you wrote  my words were written o giver of alms  and then abdulla walked with composed face between the two lines of men holding torches and met lakamba in front of the big fire that was crackling itself up into a great blaze for a moment they stood with clasped hands invoking peace upon each others head then lakamba still holding his honoured guest by the hand led him round the fire to the prepared seats babalatchi followed close behind his protector abdulla was accompanied by two arabs he like his companions was dressed in a white robe of starched muslin which fell in stiff folds straight from the neck it was buttoned from the throat halfway down with a close row of very small gold buttons round the tight sleeves there was a narrow braid of gold lace on his shaven head he wore a small skullcap of plaited grass he was shod in patent leather slippers over his naked feet a rosary of heavy wooden beads hung by a round turn from his right wrist he sat down slowly in the place of honour and dropping his slippers tucked up his legs under him decorously  the improvised divan was arranged in a wide semicircle of which the point most distant from the firesome ten yardswas also the nearest to lakambas dwelling as soon as the principal personages were seated the verandah of the house was filled silently by the muffledup forms of lakambas female belongings they crowded close to the rail and looked down whispering faintly below the formal exchange of compliments went on for some time between lakamba and abdulla who sat side by side babalatchi squatted humbly at his protectors feet with nothing but a thin mat between himself and the hard ground  then there was a pause abdulla glanced round in an expectant manner and after a while babalatchi who had been sitting very still in a pensive attitude seemed to rouse himself with an effort and began to speak in gentle and persuasive tones he described in flowing sentences the first beginnings of sambir the dispute of the present ruler patalolo with the sultan of koti the consequent troubles ending with the rising of bugis settlers under the leadership of lakamba at different points of the narrative he would turn for confirmation to sahamin and bahassoen who sat listening eagerly and assented together with a betul betul right right ejaculated in a fervent undertone  warming up with his subject as the narrative proceeded babalatchi went on to relate the facts connected with lingards action at the critical period of those internal dissensions he spoke in a restrained voice still but with a growing energy of indignation what was he that man of fierce aspect to keep all the world away from them was he a government who made him ruler he took possession of patalolos mind and made his heart hard he put severe words into his mouth and caused his hand to strike right and left that unbeliever kept the faithful panting under the weight of his senseless oppression they had to trade with himaccept such goods as he would givesuch credit as he would accord and he exacted payment every year     very true exclaimed sahamin and bahassoen together  babalatchi glanced at them approvingly and turned to abdulla  listen to those men o protector of the oppressed he exclaimed what could we do a man must trade there was nobody else  sahamin got up staff in hand and spoke to abdulla with ponderous courtesy emphasizing his words by the solemn flourishes of his right arm  it is so we are weary of paying our debts to that white man here who is the son of the rajah laut that white manmay the grave of his mother be defiledis not content to hold us all in his hand with a cruel grasp he seeks to cause our very death he trades with the dyaks of the forest who are no better than monkeys he buys from them guttah and rattanswhile we starve only two days ago i went to him and said tuan almayereven so we must speak politely to that friend of satantuan almayer i have such and such goods to sell will you buy and he spoke thusbecause those white men have no understanding of any courtesyhe spoke to me as if i was a slave daoud you are a lucky manremark o first amongst the believers that by those words he could have brought misfortune on my headyou are a lucky man to have anything in these hard times bring your goods quickly and i shall receive them in payment of what you owe me from last year and he laughed and struck me on the shoulder with his open hand may jehannum be his lot  we will fight him said young bahassoen crisply we shall fight if there is help and a leader tuan abdulla will you come among us  abdulla did not answer at once his lips moved in an inaudible whisper and the beads passed through his fingers with a dry click all waited in respectful silence i shall come if my ship can enter this river said abdulla at last in a solemn tone  it can tuan exclaimed babalatchi there is a white man here who     i want to see omar el badavi and that white man you wrote about interrupted abdulla  babalatchi got on his feet quickly and there was a general move  the women on the verandah hurried indoors and from the crowd that had kept discreetly in distant parts of the courtyard a couple of men ran with armfuls of dry fuel which they cast upon the fire one of them at a sign from babalatchi approached and after getting his orders went towards the little gate and entered omars enclosure while waiting for his return lakamba abdulla and babalatchi talked together in low tones sahamin sat by himself chewing betelnut sleepily with a slight and indolent motion of his heavy jaw bahassoen his hand on the hilt of his short sword strutted backwards and forwards in the full light of the fire looking very warlike and reckless the envy and admiration of lakambas retainers who stood in groups or flitted about noiselessly in the shadows of the courtyard  the messenger who had been sent to omar came back and stood at a distance waiting till somebody noticed him babalatchi beckoned him close  what are his words asked babalatchi  he says that syed abdulla is welcome now answered the man  lakamba was speaking low to abdulla who listened to him with deep interest     we could have eighty men if there was need he was sayingeighty men in fourteen canoes the only thing we want is gunpowder     hai there will be no fighting broke in babalatchi the fear of your name will be enough and the terror of your coming  there may be powder too muttered abdulla with great nonchalance if only the ship enters the river safely  if the heart is stout the ship will be safe said babalatchi we will go now and see omar el badavi and the white man i have here  lakambas dull eyes became animated suddenly  take care tuan abdulla he said take care the behaviour of that unclean white madman is furious in the extreme he offered to strike     on my head you are safe o giver of alms interrupted babalatchi  abdulla looked from one to the other and the faintest flicker of a passing smile disturbed for a moment his grave composure he turned to babalatchi and said with decision  let us go  this way o uplifter of our hearts rattled on babalatchi with fussy deference only a very few paces and you shall behold omar the brave and a white man of great strength and cunning this way  he made a sign for lakamba to remain behind and with respectful touches on the elbow steered abdulla towards the gate at the upper end of the courtyard as they walked on slowly followed by the two arabs he kept on talking in a rapid undertone to the great man who never looked at him once although appearing to listen with flattering attention when near the gate babalatchi moved forward and stopped facing abdulla with his hand on the fastenings  you shall see them both he said all my words about them are true when i saw him enslaved by the one of whom i spoke i knew he would be soft in my hand like the mud of the river at first he answered my talk with bad words of his own language after the manner of white men afterwards when listening to the voice he loved he hesitated he hesitated for many daystoo many i knowing him well made omar withdraw here with his    household then this redfaced man raged for three days like a black panther that is hungry and this evening this very evening he came i have him here he is in the grasp of one with a merciless heart i have him here ended babalatchi exultingly tapping the upright of the gate with his hand  that is good murmured abdulla  and he shall guide your ship and lead in the fightif fight there be went on babalatchi if there is any killinglet him be the slayer you should give him armsa short gun that fires many times  yes by allah assented abdulla with slow thoughtfulness  and you will have to open your hand o first amongst the generous continued babalatchi you will have to satisfy the rapacity of a white man and also of one who is not a man and therefore greedy of ornaments  they shall be satisfied said abdulla but    he hesitated looking down on the ground and stroking his beard while babalatchi waited anxious with parted lips after a short time he spoke again jerkily in an indistinct whisper so that babalatchi had to turn his head to catch the words yes but omar is the son of my fathers uncle    and all belonging to him are of the faith    while that man is an unbeliever it is most unseemly    very unseemly he cannot live under my shadow not that dog penitence i take refuge with my god he mumbled rapidly how can he live under my eyes with that woman who is of the faith scandal o abomination  he finished with a rush and drew a long breath then added dubiously  and when that man has done all we want what is to be done with him  they stood close together meditative and silent their eyes roaming idly over the courtyard the big bonfire burned brightly and a wavering splash of light lay on the dark earth at their feet while the lazy smoke wreathed itself slowly in gleaming coils amongst the black boughs of the trees they could see lakamba who had returned to his place sitting hunched up spiritlessly on the cushions and sahamin who had got on his feet again and appeared to be talking to him with dignified animation men in twos or threes came out of the shadows into the light strolling slowly and passed again into the shadows their faces turned to each other their arms moving in restrained gestures bahassoen his head proudly thrown back his ornaments embroideries and swordhilt flashing in the light circled steadily round the fire like a planet round the sun a cool whiff of damp air came from the darkness of the riverside it made abdulla and babalatchi shiver and woke them up from their abstraction  open the gate and go first said abdulla there is no danger  on my life no answered babalatchi lifting the rattan ring he is all peace and content like a thirsty man who has drunk water after many days  he swung the gate wide made a few paces into the gloom of the enclosure and retraced his steps suddenly  he may be made useful in many ways he whispered to abdulla who had stopped short seeing him come back  o sin o temptation sighed out abdulla faintly our refuge is with the most high can i feed this infidel for ever and for ever he added impatiently  no breathed out babalatchi no not for ever only while he serves your designs o dispenser of allahs gifts when the time comesand your order     he sidled close to abdulla and brushed with a delicate touch the hand that hung down listlessly holding the prayerbeads  i am your slave and your offering he murmured in a distinct and polite tone into abdullas ear when your wisdom speaks there may be found a little poison that will not lie who knows    chapter four   babalatchi saw abdulla pass through the low and narrow entrance into the darkness of omars hut heard them exchange the usual greetings and the distinguished visitors grave voice asking there is no misfortuneplease godbut the sight and then becoming aware of the disapproving looks of the two arabs who had accompanied abdulla he followed their example and fell back out of earshot he did it unwillingly although he did not ignore that what was going to happen in there was now absolutely beyond his control he roamed irresolutely about for awhile and at last wandered with careless steps towards the fire which had been moved from under the tree close to the hut and a little to windward of its entrance he squatted on his heels and began playing pensively with live embers as was his habit when engrossed in thought withdrawing his hand sharply and shaking it above his head when he burnt his fingers in a fit of deeper abstraction sitting there he could hear the murmur of the talk inside the hut and he could distinguish the voices but not the words abdulla spoke in deep tones and now and then this flowing monotone was interrupted by a querulous exclamation a weak moan or a plaintive quaver of the old man yes it was annoying not to be able to make out what they were saying thought babalatchi as he sat gazing fixedly at the unsteady glow of the fire but it will be right all will be right abdulla inspired him with confidence he came up fully to his expectation from the very first moment when he set his eye on him he felt sure that this manwhom he had known by reputation onlywas very resolute perhaps too resolute perhaps he would want to grasp too much later on a shadow flitted over babalatchis face on the eve of the accomplishment of his desires he felt the bitter taste of that drop of doubt which is mixed with the sweetness of every success  when hearing footsteps on the verandah of the big house he lifted his head the shadow had passed away and on his face there was an expression of watchful alertness willems was coming down the plankway into the courtyard the light within trickled through the cracks of the badly joined walls of the house and in the illuminated doorway appeared the moving form of aissa she also passed into the night outside and disappeared from view babalatchi wondered where she had got to and for the moment forgot the approach of willems the voice of the white man speaking roughly above his head made him jump to his feet as if impelled upwards by a powerful spring  wheres abdulla  babalatchi waved his hand towards the hut and stood listening intently the voices within had ceased then recommenced again he shot an oblique glance at willems whose indistinct form towered above the glow of dying embers  make up this fire said willems abruptly i want to see your face  with obliging alacrity babalatchi put some dry brushwood on the coals from a handy pile keeping all the time a watchful eye on willems when he straightened himself up his hand wandered almost involuntarily towards his left side to feel the handle of a kriss amongst the folds of his sarong but he tried to look unconcerned under the angry stare  you are in good health please god he murmured  yes answered willems with an unexpected loudness that caused babalatchi to start nervously yes    health    you     he made a long stride and dropped both his hands on the malays shoulders in the powerful grip babalatchi swayed to and fro limply but his face was as peaceful as when he sata little while agodreaming by the fire with a final vicious jerk willems let go suddenly and turning away on his heel stretched his hands over the fire babalatchi stumbled backwards recovered himself and wriggled his shoulders laboriously  tse tse tse he clicked deprecatingly after a short silence he went on with accentuated admiration what a man it is what a strong man a man like thathe concluded in a tone of meditative wondera man like that could upset mountainsmountains  he gazed hopefully for a while at willems broad shoulders and continued addressing the inimical back in a low and persuasive voice  but why be angry with me with me who think only of your good did i not give her refuge in my own house yes tuan this is my own house i will let you have it without any recompense because she must have a shelter therefore you and she shall live here who can know a womans mind and such a woman if she wanted to go away from that other place who am ito say no i am omars servant i said gladden my heart by taking my house did i say right  ill tell you something said willems without changing his position if she takes a fancy to go away from this place it is you who shall suffer i will wring your neck  when the heart is full of love there is no room in it for justice recommenced babalatchi with unmoved and persistent softness why slay me you know tuan what she wants a splendid destiny is her desireas of all women you have been wronged and cast out by your people she knows that but you are brave you are strongyou are a man and tuani am older than youyou are in her hand such is the fate of strong men and she is of noble birth and cannot live like a slave you know herand you are in her hand you are like a snared bird because of your strength andremember i am a man that has seen muchsubmit tuan submit    or else     he drawled out the last words in a hesitating manner and broke off his sentence still stretching his hands in turns towards the blaze and without moving his head willems gave a short lugubrious laugh and asked  or else what  she may go away again who knows finished babalatchi in a gentle and insinuating tone  this time willems spun round sharply babalatchi stepped back  if she does it will be the worse for you said willems in a menacing voice it will be your doing and i     babalatchi spoke from beyond the circle of light with calm disdain  haiya i have heard before if she goesthen i die good will that bring her back do you thinktuan if it is my doing it shall be well done o white man andwho knowsyou will have to live without her  willems gasped and started back like a confident wayfarer who pursuing a path he thinks safe should see just in time a bottomless chasm under his feet babalatchi came into the light and approached willems sideways with his head thrown back and a little on one side so as to bring his only eye to bear full on the countenance of the tall white man  you threaten me said willems indistinctly  i tuan exclaimed babalatchi with a slight suspicion of irony in the affected surprise of his tone i tuan who spoke of death was it i no i spoke of life only only of life of a long life for a lonely man  they stood with the fire between them both silent both aware each in his own way of the importance of the passing minutes babalatchis fatalism gave him only an insignificant relief in his suspense because no fatalism can kill the thought of the future the desire of success the pain of waiting for the disclosure of the immutable decrees of heaven fatalism is born of the fear of failure for we all believe that we carry success in our own hands and we suspect that our hands are weak babalatchi looked at willems and congratulated himself upon his ability to manage that white man there was a pilot for abdullaa victim to appease lingards anger in case of any mishap he would take good care to put him forward in everything in any case let the white men fight it out amongst themselves they were fools he hated themthe strong foolsand knew that for his righteous wisdom was reserved the safe triumph  willems measured dismally the depth of his degradation hea white man the admired of white men was held by those miserable savages whose tool he was about to become he felt for them all the hate of his race of his morality of his intelligence he looked upon himself with dismay and pity she had him he had heard of such things he had heard of women who    he would never believe such stories    yet they were true but his own captivity seemed more complete terrible and finalwithout the hope of any redemption he wondered at the wickedness of providence that had made him what he was that worse still permitted such a creature as almayer to live he had done his duty by going to him why did he not understand all men were fools he gave him his chance the fellow did not see it it was hard very hard on himselfwillems he wanted to take her from amongst her own people thats why he had condescended to go to almayer he examined himself with a sinking heart he thought that really he could notsomehowlive without her it was terrible and sweet he remembered the first days her appearance her face her smile her eyes her words a savage woman yet he perceived that he could think of nothing else but of the three days of their separation of the few hours since their reunion very well if he could not take her away then he would go to her    he had for a moment a wicked pleasure in the thought that what he had done could not be undone he had given himself up he felt proud of it he was ready to face anything do anything he cared for nothing for nobody he thought himself very fearless but as a matter of fact he was only drunk drunk with the poison of passionate memories  he stretched his hands over the fire looked round and called out  aissa  she must have been near for she appeared at once within the light of the fire the upper part of her body was wrapped up in the thick folds of a head covering which was pulled down over her brow and one end of it thrown across from shoulder to shoulder hid the lower part of her face only her eyes were visiblesombre and gleaming like a starry night  willems looking at this strange muffled figure felt exasperated amazed and helpless the exconfidential clerk of the rich hudig would hug to his breast settled conceptions of respectable conduct he sought refuge within his ideas of propriety from the dismal mangroves from the darkness of the forests and of the heathen souls of the savages that were his masters she looked like an animated package of cheap cotton goods it made him furious she had disguised herself so because a man of her race was near he told her not to do it and she did not obey would his ideas ever change so as to agree with her own notions of what was becoming proper and respectable he was really afraid they would in time it seemed to him awful she would never change this manifestation of her sense of proprieties was another sign of their hopeless diversity something like another step downwards for him she was too different from him he was so civilized it struck him suddenly that they had nothing in commonnot a thought not a feeling he could not make clear to her the simplest motive of any act of his    and he could not live without her  the courageous man who stood facing babalatchi gasped unexpectedly with a gasp that was half a groan this little matter of her veiling herself against his wish acted upon him like a disclosure of some great disaster it increased his contempt for himself as the slave of a passion he had always derided as the man unable to assert his will this will all his sensations his personalityall this seemed to be lost in the abominable desire in the priceless promise of that woman he was not of course able to discern clearly the causes of his misery but there are none so ignorant as not to know suffering none so simple as not to feel and suffer from the shock of warring impulses the ignorant must feel and suffer from their complexity as well as the wisest but to them the pain of struggle and defeat appears strange mysterious remediable and unjust he stood watching her watching himself he tingled with rage from head to foot as if he had been struck in the face suddenly he laughed but his laugh was like a distorted echo of some insincere mirth very far away  from the other side of the fire babalatchi spoke hurriedly  here is tuan abdulla    chapter five   directly on stepping outside omars hut abdulla caught sight of willems he expected of course to see a white man but not that white man whom he knew so well everybody who traded in the islands and who had any dealings with hudig knew willems for the last two years of his stay in macassar the confidential clerk had been managing all the local trade of the house under a very slight supervision only on the part of the master so everybody knew willems abdulla amongst othersbut he was ignorant of willems disgrace as a matter of fact the thing had been kept very quietso quiet that a good many people in macassar were expecting willems return there supposing him to be absent on some confidential mission abdulla in his surprise hesitated on the threshold he had prepared himself to see some seamansome old officer of lingards a common manperhaps difficult to deal with but still no match for him instead he saw himself confronted by an individual whose reputation for sagacity in business was well known to him how did he get here and why abdulla recovering from his surprise advanced in a dignified manner towards the fire keeping his eyes fixed steadily on willems when within two paces from willems he stopped and lifted his right hand in grave salutation willems nodded slightly and spoke after a while  we know each other tuan abdulla he said with an assumption of easy indifference  we have traded together answered abdulla solemnly but it was far from here  and we may trade here also said willems  the place does not matter it is the open mind and the true heart that are required in business  very true my heart is as open as my mind i will tell you why i am here  what need is there in leaving home one learns life you travel travelling is victory you shall return with much wisdom  i shall never return interrupted willems i have done with my people i am a man without brothers injustice destroys fidelity  abdulla expressed his surprise by elevating his eyebrows at the same time he made a vague gesture with his arm that could be taken as an equivalent of an approving and conciliating just so  till then the arab had not taken any notice of aissa who stood by the fire but now she spoke in the interval of silence following willems declaration in a voice that was much deadened by her wrappings she addressed abdulla in a few words of greeting calling him a kinsman abdulla glanced at her swiftly for a second and then with perfect good breeding fixed his eyes on the ground she put out towards him her hand covered with a corner of her faceveil and he took it pressed it twice and dropping it turned towards willems she looked at the two men searchingly then backed away and seemed to melt suddenly into the night  i know what you came for tuan abdulla said willems i have been told by that man there he nodded towards babalatchi then went on slowly it will be a difficult thing  allah makes everything easy interjected babalatchi piously from a distance  the two men turned quickly and stood looking at him thoughtfully as if in deep consideration of the truth of that proposition under their sustained gaze babalatchi experienced an unwonted feeling of shyness and dared not approach nearer at last willems moved slightly abdulla followed readily and they both walked down the courtyard their voices dying away in the darkness soon they were heard returning and the voices grew distinct as their forms came out of the gloom by the fire they wheeled again and babalatchi caught a few words willems was saying  i have been at sea with him many years when young i have used my knowledge to observe the way into the river when coming in this time  abdulla assented in general terms  in the variety of knowledge there is safety he said and then they passed out of earshot  babalatchi ran to the tree and took up his position in the solid blackness under its branches leaning against the trunk there he was about midway between the fire and the other limit of the two mens walk they passed him close abdulla slim very straight his head high and his hands hanging before him and twisting mechanically the string of beads willems tall broad looking bigger and stronger in contrast to the slight white figure by the side of which he strolled carelessly taking one step to the others two his big arms in constant motion as he gesticulated vehemently bending forward to look abdulla in the face  they passed and repassed close to babalatchi some half a dozen times and whenever they were between him and the fire he could see them plain enough sometimes they would stop short willems speaking emphatically abdulla listening with rigid attention then when the other had ceased bending his head slightly as if consenting to some demand or admitting some statement now and then babalatchi caught a word here and there a fragment of a sentence a loud exclamation impelled by curiosity he crept to the very edge of the black shadow under the tree they were nearing him and he heard willems say  you will pay that money as soon as i come on board that i must have  he could not catch abdullas reply when they went past again willems was saying  my life is in your hand anyway the boat that brings me on board your ship shall take the money to omar you must have it ready in a sealed bag  again they were out of hearing but instead of coming back they stopped by the fire facing each other willems moved his arm shook his hand on high talking all the time then brought it down jerkilystamped his foot a short period of immobility ensued babalatchi gazing intently saw abdullas lips move almost imperceptibly suddenly willems seized the arabs passive hand and shook it babalatchi drew the long breath of relieved suspense the conference was over all well apparently  he ventured now to approach the two men who saw him and waited in silence willems had retired within himself already and wore a look of grim indifference abdulla moved away a step or two babalatchi looked at him inquisitively  i go now said abdulla and shall wait for you outside the river tuan willems till the second sunset you have only one word i know  only one word repeated willems  abdulla and babalatchi walked together down the enclosure leaving the white man alone by the fire the two arabs who had come with abdulla preceded them and passed at once through the little gate into the light and the murmur of voices of the principal courtyard but babalatchi and abdulla stopped on this side of it abdulla said  it is well we have spoken of many things he consents  when asked babalatchi eagerly  on the second day from this i have promised every thing i mean to keep much  your hand is always open o most generous amongst believers you will not forget your servant who called you here have i not spoken the truth she has made roast meat of his heart  with a horizontal sweep of his arm abdulla seemed to push away that last statement and said slowly with much meaning  he must be perfectly safe do you understand perfectly safeas if he was amongst his own peopletill     till when whispered babalatchi  till i speak said abdulla as to omar he hesitated for a moment then went on very low he is very old  haiya old and sick murmured babalatchi with sudden melancholy  he wanted me to kill that white man he begged me to have him killed at once said abdulla contemptuously moving again towards the gate  he is impatient like those who feel death near them exclaimed babalatchi apologetically  omar shall dwell with me went on abdulla when    but no matter remember the white man must be safe  he lives in your shadow answered babalatchi solemnly it is enough he touched his forehead and fell back to let abdulla go first  and now they are back in the courtyard wherefrom at their appearance listlessness vanishes and all the faces become alert and interested once more lakamba approaches his guest but looks at babalatchi who reassures him by a confident nod lakamba clumsily attempts a smile and looking with natural and ineradicable sulkiness from under his eyebrows at the man whom he wants to honour asks whether he would condescend to visit the place of sitting down and take food or perhaps he would prefer to give himself up to repose the house is his and what is in it and those many men that stand afar watching the interview are his syed abdulla presses his hosts hand to his breast and informs him in a confidential murmur that his habits are ascetic and his temperament inclines to melancholy no rest no food no use whatever for those many men who are his syed abdulla is impatient to be gone lakamba is sorrowful but polite in his hesitating gloomy way tuan abdulla must have fresh boatmen and many to shorten the dark and fatiguing road haiya there boats  by the riverside indistinct forms leap into a noisy and disorderly activity there are cries orders banter abuse torches blaze sending out much more smoke than light and in their red glare babalatchi comes up to say that the boats are ready  through that lurid glare syed abdulla in his long white gown seems to glide fantastically like a dignified apparition attended by two inferior shades and stands for a moment at the landingplace to take leave of his host and allywhom he loves syed abdulla says so distinctly before embarking and takes his seat in the middle of the canoe under a small canopy of blue calico stretched on four sticks before and behind syed abdulla the men squatting by the gunwales hold high the blades of their paddles in readiness for a dip all together ready not yet hold on all syed abdulla speaks again while lakamba and babalatchi stand close on the bank to hear his words his words are encouraging before the sun rises for the second time they shall meet and syed abdullas ship shall float on the waters of this riverat last lakamba and babalatchi have no doubtif allah wills they are in the hands of the compassionate no doubt and so is syed abdulla the great trader who does not know what the word failure means and so is the white manthe smartest business man in the islandswho is lying now by omars fire with his head on aissas lap while syed abdulla flies down the muddy river with current and paddles between the sombre walls of the sleeping forest on his way to the clear and open sea where the lord of the isles formerly of greenock but condemned sold and registered now as of penang waits for its owner and swings erratically at anchor in the currents of the capricious tide under the crumbling red cliffs of tanjong mirrah  for some time lakamba sahamin and bahassoen looked silently into the humid darkness which had swallowed the big canoe that carried abdulla and his unvarying good fortune then the two guests broke into a talk expressive of their joyful anticipations the venerable sahamin as became his advanced age found his delight in speculation as to the activities of a rather remote future he would buy praus he would send expeditions up the river he would enlarge his trade and backed by abdullas capital he would grow rich in a very few years very few meantime it would be a good thing to interview almayer tomorrow and profiting by the last day of the hated mans prosperity obtain some goods from him on credit sahamin thought it could be done by skilful wheedling after all that son of satan was a fool and the thing was worth doing because the coming revolution would wipe all debts out sahamin did not mind imparting that idea to his companions with much senile chuckling while they strolled together from the riverside towards the residence the bullnecked lakamba listening with pouted lips without the sign of a smile without a gleam in his dull bloodshot eyes shuffled slowly across the courtyard between his two guests but suddenly bahassoen broke in upon the old mans prattle with the generous enthusiasm of his youth    trading was very good but was the change that would make them happy effected yet the white man should be despoiled with a strong hand    he grew excited spoke very loud and his further discourse delivered with his hand on the hilt of his sword dealt incoherently with the honourable topics of throatcutting fireraising and with the farfamed valour of his ancestors  babalatchi remained behind alone with the greatness of his conceptions the sagacious statesman of sambir sent a scornful glance after his noble protector and his noble protectors friends and then stood meditating about that future which to the others seemed so assured not so to babalatchi who paid the penalty of his wisdom by a vague sense of insecurity that kept sleep at arms length from his tired body when he thought at last of leaving the waterside it was only to strike a path for himself and to creep along the fences avoiding the middle of the courtyard where small fires glimmered and winked as though the sinister darkness there had reflected the stars of the serene heaven he slunk past the wicketgate of omars enclosure and crept on patiently along the light bamboo palisade till he was stopped by the angle where it joined the heavy stockade of lakambas private ground standing there he could look over the fence and see omars hut and the fire before its door he could also see the shadow of two human beings sitting between him and the red glow a man and a woman the sight seemed to inspire the careworn sage with a frivolous desire to sing it could hardly be called a song it was more in the nature of a recitative without any rhythm delivered rapidly but distinctly in a croaking and unsteady voice and if babalatchi considered it a song then it was a song with a purpose and perhaps for that reason artistically defective it had all the imperfections of unskilful improvisation and its subject was gruesome it told a tale of shipwreck and of thirst and of one brother killing another for the sake of a gourd of water a repulsive story which might have had a purpose but possessed no moral whatever yet it must have pleased babalatchi for he repeated it twice the second time even in louder tones than at first causing a disturbance amongst the white ricebirds and the wild fruitpigeons which roosted on the boughs of the big tree growing in omars compound there was in the thick foliage above the singers head a confused beating of wings sleepy remarks in birdlanguage a sharp stir of leaves the forms by the fire moved the shadow of the woman altered its shape and babalatchis song was cut short abruptly by a fit of soft and persistent coughing he did not try to resume his efforts after that interruption but went away stealthily to seekif not sleepthen at least repose    chapter six   as soon as abdulla and his companions had left the enclosure aissa approached willems and stood by his side he took no notice of her expectant attitude till she touched him gently when he turned furiously upon her and tearing off her faceveil trampled upon it as though it had been a mortal enemy she looked at him with the faint smile of patient curiosity with the puzzled interest of ignorance watching the running of a complicated piece of machinery after he had exhausted his rage he stood again severe and unbending looking down at the fire but the touch of her fingers at the nape of his neck effaced instantly the hard lines round his mouth his eyes wavered uneasily his lips trembled slightly starting with the unresisting rapidity of a particle of ironwhich quiescent one moment leaps in the next to a powerful magnethe moved forward caught her in his arms and pressed her violently to his breast he released her as suddenly and she stumbled a little stepped back breathed quickly through her parted lips and said in a tone of pleased reproof  o foolman and if you had killed me in your strong arms what would you have done  you want to live    and to run away from me again he said gently tell medo you  she moved towards him with very short steps her head a little on one side hands on hips with a slight balancing of her body an approach more tantalizing than an escape he looked on eagercharmed she spoke jestingly  what am i to say to a man who has been away three days from me three she repeated holding up playfully three fingers before willems eyes he snatched at the hand but she was on her guard and whisked it behind her back  no she said i cannot be caught but i will come i am coming myself because i like do not move do not touch me with your mighty hands o child  as she spoke she made a step nearer then another willems did not stir pressing against him she stood on tiptoe to look into his eyes and her own seemed to grow bigger glistening and tender appealing and promising with that look she drew the mans soul away from him through his immobile pupils and from willems features the spark of reason vanished under her gaze and was replaced by an appearance of physical wellbeing an ecstasy of the senses which had taken possession of his rigid body an ecstasy that drove out regrets hesitation and doubt and proclaimed its terrible work by an appalling aspect of idiotic beatitude he never stirred a limb hardly breathed but stood in stiff immobility absorbing the delight of her close contact by every pore  closer closer he murmured  slowly she raised her arms put them over his shoulders and clasping her hands at the back of his neck swung off the full length of her arms her head fell back the eyelids dropped slightly and her thick hair hung straight down a mass of ebony touched by the red gleams of the fire he stood unyielding under the strain as solid and motionless as one of the big trees of the surrounding forests and his eyes looked at the modelling of her chin at the outline of her neck at the swelling lines of her bosom with the famished and concentrated expression of a starving man looking at food she drew herself up to him and rubbed her head against his cheek slowly and gently he sighed she with her hands still on his shoulders glanced up at the placid stars and said  the night is half gone we shall finish it by this fire by this fire you shall tell me all your words and syed abdullas words and listening to you i shall forget the three daysbecause i am good tell meam i good  he said yes dreamily and she ran off towards the big house  when she came back balancing a roll of fine mats on her head he had replenished the fire and was ready to help her in arranging a couch on the side of it nearest to the hut she sank down with a quick but gracefully controlled movement and he threw himself full length with impatient haste as if he wished to forestall somebody she took his head on her knees and when he felt her hands touching his face her fingers playing with his hair he had an expression of being taken possession of he experienced a sense of peace of rest of happiness and of soothing delight his hands strayed upwards about her neck and he drew her down so as to have her face above his then he whisperedi wish i could die like thisnow she looked at him with her big sombre eyes in which there was no responsive light his thought was so remote from her understanding that she let the words pass by unnoticed like the breath of the wind like the flight of a cloud woman though she was she could not comprehend in her simplicity the tremendous compliment of that speech that whisper of deadly happiness so sincere so spontaneous coming so straight from the heartlike every corruption it was the voice of madness of a delirious peace of happiness that is infamous cowardly and so exquisite that the debased mind refuses to contemplate its termination for to the victims of such happiness the moment of its ceasing is the beginning afresh of that torture which is its price  with her brows slightly knitted in the determined preoccupation of her own desires she said  now tell me all all the words spoken between you and syed abdulla  tell what what words her voice recalled back the consciousness that had departed under her touch and he became aware of the passing minutes every one of which was like a reproach of those minutes that falling slow reluctant irresistible into the past marked his footsteps on the way to perdition not that he had any conviction about it any notion of the possible ending on that painful road it was an indistinct feeling a threat of suffering like the confused warning of coming disease an inarticulate monition of evil made up of fear and pleasure of resignation and of revolt he was ashamed of his state of mind after all what was he afraid of were those scruples why that hesitation to think to speak of what he intended doing scruples were for imbeciles his clear duty was to make himself happy did he ever take an oath of fidelity to lingard no well thenhe would not let any interest of that old fool stand between willems and willems happiness happiness was he not perchance on a false track happiness meant money much money at least he had always thought so till he had experienced those new sensations which     aissas question repeated impatiently interrupted his musings and looking up at her face shining above him in the dim light of the fire he stretched his limbs luxuriously and obedient to her desire he spoke slowly and hardly above his breath she with her head close to his lips listened absorbed interested in attentive immobility the many noises of the great courtyard were hushed up gradually by the sleep that stilled all voices and closed all eyes then somebody droned out a song with a nasal drawl at the end of every verse he stirred she put her hand suddenly on his lips and sat upright there was a feeble coughing a rustle of leaves and then a complete silence took possession of the land a silence cold mournful profound more like death than peace more hard to bear than the fiercest tumult as soon as she removed her hand he hastened to speak so insupportable to him was that stillness perfect and absolute in which his thoughts seemed to ring with the loudness of shouts  who was there making that noise he asked  i do not know he is gone now she answered hastily tell me you will not return to your people not without me not with me do you promise  i have promised already i have no people of my own have i not told you that you are everybody to me  ah yes she said slowly but i like to hear you say that againevery day and every night whenever i ask and never to be angry because i ask i am afraid of white women who are shameless and have fierce eyes she scanned his features close for a moment and added  are they very beautiful they must be  i do not know he whispered thoughtfully and if i ever did know looking at you i have forgotten  forgotten and for three days and two nights you have forgotten me also why why were you angry with me when i spoke at first of tuan abdulla in the days when we lived beside the brook you remembered somebody then somebody in the land whence you come your tongue is false you are white indeed and your heart is full of deception i know it and yet i cannot help believing you when you talk of your love for me but i am afraid  he felt flattered and annoyed by her vehemence and said  well i am with you now i did come back and it was you that went away  when you have helped abdulla against the rajah laut who is the first of white men i shall not be afraid any more she whispered  you must believe what i say when i tell you that there never was another woman that there is nothing for me to regret and nothing but my enemies to remember  where do you come from she said impulsive and inconsequent in a passionate whisper what is that land beyond the great sea from which you come a land of lies and of evil from which nothing but misfortune ever comes to uswho are not white did you not at first ask me to go there with you that is why i went away  i shall never ask you again  and there is no woman waiting for you there  no said willems firmly  she bent over him her lips hovered above his face and her long hair brushed his cheeks  you taught me the love of your people which is of the devil she murmured and bending still lower she said faintly like this  yes like this he answered very low in a voice that trembled slightly with eagerness and she pressed suddenly her lips to his while he closed his eyes in an ecstasy of delight  there was a long interval of silence she stroked his head with gentle touches and he lay dreamily perfectly happy but for the annoyance of an indistinct vision of a wellknown figure a man going away from him and diminishing in a long perspective of fantastic trees whose every leaf was an eye looking after that man who walked away growing smaller but never getting out of sight for all his steady progress he felt a desire to see him vanish a hurried impatience of his disappearance and he watched for it with a careful and irksome effort there was something familiar about that figure why himself he gave a sudden start and opened his eyes quivering with the emotion of that quick return from so far of finding himself back by the fire with the rapidity of a flash of lightning it had been half a dream he had slumbered in her arms for a few seconds only the beginning of a dreamnothing more but it was some time before he recovered from the shock of seeing himself go away so deliberately so definitely so unguardedly and going awaywhere now if he had not woke up in time he would never have come back again from there from whatever place he was going to he felt indignant it was like an evasion like a prisoner breaking his parolethat thing slinking off stealthily while he slept he was very indignant and was also astonished at the absurdity of his own emotions  she felt him tremble and murmuring tender words pressed his head to her breast again he felt very peaceful with a peace that was as complete as the silence round them he muttered  you are tired aissa  she answered so low that it was like a sigh shaped into faint words  i shall watch your sleep o child  he lay very quiet and listened to the beating of her heart that sound light rapid persistent and steady her very life beating against his cheek gave him a clear perception of secure ownership strengthened his belief in his possession of that human being was like an assurance of the vague felicity of the future there were no regrets no doubts no hesitation now had there ever been all that seemed far away ages agoas unreal and pale as the fading memory of some delirium all the anguish suffering strife of the past days the humiliation and anger of his downfall all that was an infamous nightmare a thing born in sleep to be forgotten and leave no traceand true life was this this dreamy immobility with his head against her heart that beat so steadily  he was broad awake now with that tingling wakefulness of the tired body which succeeds to the few refreshing seconds of irresistible sleep and his wideopen eyes looked absently at the doorway of omars hut the reed walls glistened in the light of the fire the smoke of which thin and blue drifted slanting in a succession of rings and spirals across the doorway whose empty blackness seemed to him impenetrable and enigmatical like a curtain hiding vast spaces full of unexpected surprises this was only his fancy but it was absorbing enough to make him accept the sudden appearance of a head coming out of the gloom as part of his idle fantasy or as the beginning of another short dream of another vagary of his overtired brain a face with drooping eyelids old thin and yellow above the scattered white of a long beard that touched the earth a head without a body only a foot above the ground turning slightly from side to side on the edge of the circle of light as if to catch the radiating heat of the fire on either cheek in succession he watched it in passive amazement growing distinct as if coming nearer to him and the confused outlines of a body crawling on all fours came out creeping inch by inch towards the fire with a silent and all but imperceptible movement he was astounded at the appearance of that blind head dragging that crippled body behind without a sound without a change in the composure of the sightless face which was plain one second blurred the next in the play of the light that drew it to itself steadily a mute face with a kriss between its lips this was no dream omars face but why what was he after  he was too indolent in the happy languor of the moment to answer the question it darted through his brain and passed out leaving him free to listen again to the beating of her heart to that precious and delicate sound which filled the quiet immensity of the night glancing upwards he saw the motionless head of the woman looking down at him in a tender gleam of liquid white between the long eyelashes whose shadow rested on the soft curve of her cheek and under the caress of that look the uneasy wonder and the obscure fear of that apparition crouching and creeping in turns towards the fire that was its guide were lostwere drowned in the quietude of all his senses as pain is drowned in the flood of drowsy serenity that follows upon a dose of opium  he altered the position of his head by ever so little and now could see easily that apparition which he had seen a minute before and had nearly forgotten already it had moved closer gliding and noiseless like the shadow of some nightmare and now it was there very near motionless and still as if listening one hand and one knee advanced the neck stretched out and the head turned full towards the fire he could see the emaciated face the skin shiny over the prominent bones the black shadows of the hollow temples and sunken cheeks and the two patches of blackness over the eyes over those eyes that were dead and could not see what was the impulse which drove out this blind cripple into the night to creep and crawl towards that fire he looked at him fascinated but the face with its shifting lights and shadows let out nothing closed and impenetrable like a walled door  omar raised himself to a kneeling posture and sank on his heels with his hands hanging down before him willems looking out of his dreamy numbness could see plainly the kriss between the thin lips a bar across the face the handle on one side where the polished wood caught a red gleam from the fire and the thin line of the blade running to a dull black point on the other he felt an inward shock which left his body passive in aissas embrace but filled his breast with a tumult of powerless fear and he perceived suddenly that it was his own death that was groping towards him that it was the hate of himself and the hate of her love for him which drove this helpless wreck of a once brilliant and resolute pirate to attempt a desperate deed that would be the glorious and supreme consolation of an unhappy old age and while he looked paralyzed with dread at the father who had resumed his cautious advanceblind like fate persistent like destinyhe listened with greedy eagerness to the heart of the daughter beating light rapid and steady against his head  he was in the grip of horrible fear of a fear whose cold hand robs its victim of all will and of all power of all wish to escape to resist or to move which destroys hope and despair alike and holds the empty and useless carcass as if in a vise under the coming stroke it was not the fear of deathhe had faced danger beforeit was not even the fear of that particular form of death it was not the fear of the end for he knew that the end would not come then a movement a leap a shout would save him from the feeble hand of the blind old man from that hand that even now was with cautious sweeps along the ground feeling for his body in the darkness it was the unreasoning fear of this glimpse into the unknown things into those motives impulses desires he had ignored but that had lived in the breasts of despised men close by his side and were revealed to him for a second to be hidden again behind the black mists of doubt and deception it was not death that frightened him it was the horror of bewildered life where he could understand nothing and nobody round him where he could guide control comprehend nothing and no onenot even himself  he felt a touch on his side that contact lighter than the caress of a mothers hand on the cheek of a sleeping child had for him the force of a crushing blow omar had crept close and now kneeling above him held the kriss in one hand while the other skimmed over his jacket up towards his breast in gentle touches but the blind face still turned to the heat of the fire was set and immovable in its aspect of stony indifference to things it could not hope to see with an effort willems took his eyes off the deathlike mask and turned them up to aissas head she sat motionless as if she had been part of the sleeping earth then suddenly he saw her big sombre eyes open out wide in a piercing stare and felt the convulsive pressure of her hands pinning his arms along his body a second dragged itself out slow and bitter like a day of mourning a second full of regret and grief for that faith in her which took its flight from the shattered ruins of his trust she was holding him she too he felt her heart give a great leap his head slipped down on her knees he closed his eyes and there was nothing nothing it was as if she had died as though her heart had leaped out into the night abandoning him defenceless and alone in an empty world  his head struck the ground heavily as she flung him aside in her sudden rush he lay as if stunned face up and daring not move did not see the struggle but heard the piercing shriek of mad fear her low angry words another shriek dying out in a moan when he got up at last he looked at aissa kneeling over her father he saw her bent back in the effort of holding him down omars contorted limbs a hand thrown up above her head and her quick movement grasping the wrist he made an impulsive step forward but she turned a wild face to him and called out over her shoulder  keep back do not come near do not     and he stopped short his arms hanging lifelessly by his side as if those words had changed him into stone she was afraid of his possible violence but in the unsettling of all his convictions he was struck with the frightful thought that she preferred to kill her father all by herself and the last stage of their struggle at which he looked as though a red fog had filled his eyes loomed up with an unnatural ferocity with a sinister meaning like something monstrous and depraved forcing its complicity upon him under the cover of that awful night he was horrified and grateful drawn irresistibly to herand ready to run away he could not move at firstthen he did not want to stir he wanted to see what would happen he saw her lift with a tremendous effort the apparently lifeless body into the hut and remained standing after they disappeared with the vivid image in his eyes of that head swaying on her shoulder the lower jaw hanging down collapsed passive meaningless like the head of a corpse  then after a while he heard her voice speaking inside harshly with an agitated abruptness of tone and in answer there were groans and broken murmurs of exhaustion she spoke louder he heard her saying violentlyno no never  and again a plaintive murmur of entreaty as of some one begging for a supreme favour with a last breath then she said  never i would sooner strike it into my own heart  she came out stood panting for a short moment in the doorway and then stepped into the firelight behind her through the darkness came the sound of words calling the vengeance of heaven on her head rising higher shrill strained repeating the curse over and over againtill the voice cracked in a passionate shriek that died out into hoarse muttering ending with a deep and prolonged sigh she stood facing willems one hand behind her back the other raised in a gesture compelling attention and she listened in that attitude till all was still inside the hut then she made another step forward and her hand dropped slowly  nothing but misfortune she whispered absently to herself nothing but misfortune to us who are not white the anger and excitement died out of her face and she looked straight at willems with an intense and mournful gaze  he recovered his senses and his power of speech with a sudden start  aissa he exclaimed and the words broke out through his lips with hurried nervousness aissa how can i live here trust me believe in me let us go away from here go very far away very far you and i  he did not stop to ask himself whether he could escape and how and where he was carried away by the flood of hate disgust and contempt of a white man for that blood which is not his blood for that race which is not his race for the brown skins for the hearts false like the sea blacker than night this feeling of repulsion overmastered his reason in a clear conviction of the impossibility for him to live with her people he urged her passionately to fly with him because out of all that abhorred crowd he wanted this one woman but wanted her away from them away from that race of slaves and cutthroats from which she sprang he wanted her for himselffar from everybody in some safe and dumb solitude and as he spoke his anger and contempt rose his hate became almost fear and his desire of her grew immense burning illogical and merciless crying to him through all his senses louder than his hate stronger than his fear deeper than his contemptirresistible and certain like death itself  standing at a little distance just within the lightbut on the threshold of that darkness from which she had comeshe listened one hand still behind her back the other arm stretched out with the hand half open as if to catch the fleeting words that rang around her passionate menacing imploring but all tinged with the anguish of his suffering all hurried by the impatience that gnawed his breast and while she listened she felt a slowing down of her heartbeats as the meaning of his appeal grew clearer before her indignant eyes as she saw with rage and pain the edifice of her love her own work crumble slowly to pieces destroyed by that mans fears by that mans falseness her memory recalled the days by the brook when she had listened to other wordsto other thoughtsto promises and to pleadings for other things which came from that mans lips at the bidding of her look or her smile at the nod of her head at the whisper of her lips was there then in his heart something else than her image other desires than the desires of her love other fears than the fear of losing her how could that be had she grown ugly or old in a moment she was appalled surprised and angry with the anger of unexpected humiliation and her eyes looked fixedly sombre and steady at that man born in the land of violence and of evil wherefrom nothing but misfortune comes to those who are not white instead of thinking of her caresses instead of forgetting all the world in her embrace he was thinking yet of his people of that people that steals every land masters every sea that knows no mercy and no truthknows nothing but its own strength o man of strong arm and of false heart go with him to a far country be lost in the throng of cold eyes and false heartslose him there never he was madmad with fear but he should not escape her she would keep him here a slave and a master here where he was alone with her where he must live for heror die she had a right to his love which was of her making to the love that was in him now while he spoke those words without sense she must put between him and other white men a barrier of hate he must not only stay but he must also keep his promise to abdulla the fulfilment of which would make her safe  aissa let us go with you by my side i would attack them with my naked hands or no tomorrow we shall be outside on board abdullas ship you shall come with me and then i could    if the ship went ashore by some chance then we could steal a canoe and escape in the confusion    you are not afraid of the sea    of the sea that would give me freedom     he was approaching her gradually with extended arms while he pleaded ardently in incoherent words that ran over and tripped each other in the extreme eagerness of his speech she stepped back keeping her distance her eyes on his face watching on it the play of his doubts and of his hopes with a piercing gaze that seemed to search out the innermost recesses of his thought and it was as if she had drawn slowly the darkness round her wrapping herself in its undulating folds that made her indistinct and vague he followed her step by step till at last they both stopped facing each other under the big tree of the enclosure the solitary exile of the forests great motionless and solemn in his abandonment left alone by the life of ages that had been pushed away from him by those pigmies that crept at his foot towered high and straight above their heads he seemed to look on dispassionate and imposing in his lonely greatness spreading his branches wide in a gesture of lofty protection as if to hide them in the sombre shelter of innumerable leaves as if moved by the disdainful compassion of the strong by the scornful pity of an aged giant to screen this struggle of two human hearts from the cold scrutiny of glittering stars  the last cry of his appeal to her mercy rose loud vibrated under the sombre canopy darted among the boughs startling the white birds that slept wing to wingand died without an echo strangled in the dense mass of unstirring leaves he could not see her face but he heard her sighs and the distracted murmur of indistinct words then as he listened holding his breath she exclaimed suddenly  have you heard him he has cursed me because i love you you brought me suffering and strifeand his curse and now you want to take me far away where i would lose you lose my life because your love is my life now what else is there do not move she cried violently as he stirred a littledo not speak take this sleep in peace  he saw a shadowy movement of her arm something whizzed past and struck the ground behind him close to the fire instinctively he turned round to look at it a kriss without its sheath lay by the embers a sinuous dark object looking like something that had been alive and was now crushed dead and very inoffensive a black wavy outline very distinct and still in the dull red glow without thinking he moved to pick it up stooping with the sad and humble movement of a beggar gathering the alms flung into the dust of the roadside was this the answer to his pleading to the hot and living words that came from his heart was this the answer thrown at him like an insult that thing made of wood and iron insignificant and venomous fragile and deadly he held it by the blade and looked at the handle stupidly for a moment before he let it fall again at his feet and when he turned round he faced only the nightthe night immense profound and quiet a sea of darkness in which she had disappeared without leaving a trace  he moved forward with uncertain steps putting out both his hands before him with the anguish of a man blinded suddenly  aissa he criedcome to me at once  he peered and listened but saw nothing heard nothing after a while the solid blackness seemed to wave before his eyes like a curtain disclosing movements but hiding forms and he heard light and hurried footsteps then the short clatter of the gate leading to lakambas private enclosure he sprang forward and brought up against the rough timber in time to hear the words quick quick and the sound of the wooden bar dropped on the other side securing the gate with his arms thrown up the palms against the paling he slid down in a heap on the ground  aissa he said pleadingly pressing his lips to a chink between the stakes aissa do you hear me come back i will do what you want give you all you desireif i have to set the whole sambir on fire and put that fire out with blood only come back now at once are you there do you hear me aissa  on the other side there were startled whispers of feminine voices a frightened little laugh suddenly interrupted some womans admiring murmurthis is brave talk then after a short silence aissa cried  sleep in peacefor the time of your going is near now i am afraid of you afraid of your fear when you return with tuan abdulla you shall be great you will find me here and there will be nothing but love nothing elsealwaystill we die  he listened to the shuffle of footsteps going away and staggered to his feet mute with the excess of his passionate anger against that being so savage and so charming loathing her himself everybody he had ever known the earth the sky the very air he drew into his oppressed chest loathing it because it made him live loathing her because she made him suffer but he could not leave that gate through which she had passed he wandered a little way off then swerved round came back and fell down again by the stockade only to rise suddenly in another attempt to break away from the spell that held him that brought him back there dumb obedient and furious and under the immobilized gesture of lofty protection in the branches outspread wide above his head under the high branches where white birds slept wing to wing in the shelter of countless leaves he tossed like a grain of dust in a whirlwindsinking and risinground and roundalways near that gate all through the languid stillness of that night he fought with the impalpable he fought with the shadows with the darkness with the silence he fought without a sound striking futile blows dashing from side to side obstinate hopeless and always beaten back like a man bewitched within the invisible sweep of a magic circle     part iii   chapter one  yes cat dog anything that can scratch or bite as long as it is harmful enough and mangy enough a sick tiger would make you happyof all things a halfdead tiger that you could weep over and palm upon some poor devil in your power to tend and nurse for you never mind the consequencesto the poor devil let him be mangled or eaten up of course you havent any pity to spare for the victims of your infernal charity not you your tender heart bleeds only for what is poisonous and deadly i curse the day when you set your benevolent eyes on him i curse it     now then now then growled lingard in his moustache almayer who had talked himself up to the choking point drew a long breath and went on  yes it has been always so always as far back as i can remember dont you recollect what about that halfstarved dog you brought on board in bankok in your arms in your arms by     it went mad next day and bit the serang you dont mean to say you have forgotten the best serang you ever had you said so yourself while you were helping us to lash him down to the chaincable just before he died in his fits now didnt you two wives and ever so many children the man left that was your doing    and when you went out of your way and risked your ship to rescue some chinamen from a waterlogged junk in formosa straits that was also a clever piece of business wasnt it those damned chinamen rose on you before fortyeight hours they were cutthroats those poor fishermen you knew they were cutthroats before you made up your mind to run down on a lee shore in a gale of wind to save them a mad trick if they hadnt been scoundrelshopeless scoundrelsyou would not have put your ship in jeopardy for them i know you would not have risked the lives of your crewthat crew you loved soand your own life wasnt that foolish and besides you were not honest suppose you had been drowned i would have been in a pretty mess then left alone here with that adopted daughter of yours your duty was to myself first i married that girl because you promised to make my fortune you know you did and then three months afterwards you go and do that mad trickfor a lot of chinamen too chinamen you have no morality i might have been ruined for the sake of those murderous scoundrels that after all had to be driven overboard after killing ever so many of your crewof your beloved crew do you call that honest  well well muttered lingard chewing nervously the stump of his cheroot that had gone out and looking at almayerwho stamped wildly about the verandahmuch as a shepherd might look at a pet sheep in his obedient flock turning unexpectedly upon him in enraged revolt he seemed disconcerted contemptuously angry yet somewhat amused and also a little hurt as if at some bitter jest at his own expense almayer stopped suddenly and crossing his arms on his breast bent his body forward and went on speaking  i might have been left then in an awkward holeall on account of your absurd disregard for your safetyyet i bore no grudge i knew your weaknesses but nowwhen i think of it now we are ruined ruined ruined my poor little nina ruined  he slapped his thighs smartly walked with small steps this way and that seized a chair planted it with a bang before lingard and sat down staring at the old seaman with haggard eyes lingard returning his stare steadily dived slowly into various pockets fished out at last a box of matches and proceeded to light his cheroot carefully rolling it round and round between his lips without taking his gaze for a moment off the distressed almayer then from behind a cloud of tobacco smoke he said calmly  if you had been in trouble as often as i have my boy you wouldnt carry on so i have been ruined more than once well here i am  yes here you are interrupted almayer much good it is to me had you been here a month ago it would have been of some use but now   you might as well be a thousand miles off  you scold like a drunken fishwife said lingard serenely he got up and moved slowly to the front rail of the verandah the floor shook and the whole house vibrated under his heavy step for a moment he stood with his back to almayer looking out on the river and forest of the east bank then turned round and gazed mildly down upon him  its very lonely this morning here hey he said  almayer lifted up his head  ah you notice itdont you i should think it is lonely yes captain lingard your day is over in sambir only a month ago this verandah would have been full of people coming to greet you fellows would be coming up those steps grinning and salaamingto you and to me but our day is over and not by my fault either you cant say that its all the doing of that pet rascal of yours ah he is a beauty you should have seen him leading that hellish crowd you would have been proud of your old favourite  smart fellow that muttered lingard thoughtfully almayer jumped up with a shriek  and thats all you have to say smart fellow o lord  dont make a show of yourself sit down lets talk quietly i want to know all about it so he led  he was the soul of the whole thing he piloted abdullas ship in he ordered everything and everybody said almayer who sat down again with a resigned air  when did it happenexactly  on the sixteenth i heard the first rumours of abdullas ship being in the river a thing i refused to believe at first next day i could not doubt any more there was a great council held openly in lakambas place where almost everybody in sambir attended on the eighteenth the lord of the isles was anchored in sambir reach abreast of my house lets see six weeks today exactly  and all that happened like this all of a sudden you never heard anythingno warning nothing never had an idea that something was up come almayer  heard yes i used to hear something every day mostly lies is there anything else in sambir  you might not have believed them observed lingard in fact you ought not to have believed everything that was told to you as if you had been a green hand on his first voyage  almayer moved in his chair uneasily  that scoundrel came here one day he said he had been away from the house for a couple of months living with that woman i only heard about him now and then from patalolos people when they came over well one day about noon he appeared in this courtyard as if he had been jerked up from hellwhere he belongs  lingard took his cheroot out and with his mouth full of white smoke that oozed out through his parted lips listened attentive after a short pause almayer went on looking at the floor moodily  i must say he looked awful had a bad bout of the ague probably the left shore is very unhealthy strange that only the breadth of the river     he dropped off into deep thoughtfulness as if he had forgotten his grievances in a bitter meditation upon the unsanitary condition of the virgin forests on the left bank lingard took this opportunity to expel the smoke in a mighty expiration and threw the stump of his cheroot over his shoulder  go on he said after a while he came to see you     but it wasnt unhealthy enough to finish him worse luck went on almayer rousing himself and as i said he turned up here with his brazen impudence he bullied me he threatened vaguely he wanted to scare me to blackmail me me and by heavenhe said you would approve you can you conceive such impudence i couldnt exactly make out what he was driving at had i known i would have approved him yes with a bang on the head but how could i guess that he knew enough to pilot a ship through the entrance you always said was so difficult and after all that was the only danger i could deal with anybody herebut when abdulla came    that barque of his is armed he carries twelve brass sixpounders and about thirty men desperate beggars sumatra men from deli and acheen fight all day and ask for more in the evening that kind  i know i know said lingard impatiently  of course then they were cheeky as much as you please after he anchored abreast of our jetty willems brought her up himself in the best berth i could see him from this verandah standing forward together with the halfcaste master and that woman was there too close to him i heard they took her on board off lakambas place willems said he would not go higher without her stormed and raged frightened them i believe abdulla had to interfere she came off alone in a canoe and no sooner on deck than she fell at his feet before all hands embraced his knees wept raved begged his pardon why i wonder everybody in sambir is talking of it they never heard tell or saw anything like it i have all this from ali who goes about in the settlement and brings me the news i had better know what is going onhadnt i from what i can make out theyhe and that womanare looked upon as something mysteriousbeyond comprehension some think them mad they live alone with an old woman in a house outside lakambas campong and are greatly respectedor feared i should say rather at least he is he is very violent she knows nobody sees nobody will speak to nobody but him never leaves him for a moment its the talk of the place there are other rumours from what i hear i suspect that lakamba and abdulla are tired of him theres also talk of him going away in the lord of the isleswhen she leaves here for the southwardas a kind of abdullas agent at any rate he must take the ship out the halfcaste is not equal to it as yet  lingard who had listened absorbed till then began now to walk with measured steps almayer ceased talking and followed him with his eyes as he paced up and down with a quarterdeck swing tormenting and twisting his long white beard his face perplexed and thoughtful  so he came to you first of all did he asked lingard without stopping  yes i told you so he did come came to extort money goodsi dont know what else wanted to set up as a traderthe swine i kicked his hat into the courtyard and he went after it and that was the last of him till he showed up with abdulla how could i know that he could do harm in that way or in any way at that any local rising i could put down easy with my own men and with patalolos help  oh yes patalolo no good eh did you try him at all  didnt i exclaimed almayer i went to see him myself on the twelfth that was four days before abdulla entered the river in fact same day willems tried to get at me i did feel a little uneasy then patalolo assured me that there was no human being that did not love me in sambir looked as wise as an owl told me not to listen to the lies of wicked people from down the river he was alluding to that man bulangi who lives up the sea reach and who had sent me word that a strange ship was anchored outsidewhich of course i repeated to patalolo he would not believe kept on mumbling no no no like an old parrot his head all of a tremble all beslobbered with betelnut juice i thought there was something queer about him seemed so restless and as if in a hurry to get rid of me well next day that oneeyed malefactor who lives with lakambawhats his namebabalatchi put in an appearance here came about midday casually like and stood there on this verandah chatting about one thing and another asking when i expected you and so on then incidentally he mentioned that theyhis master and himselfwere very much bothered by a ferocious white manmy friendwho was hanging about that womanomars daughter asked my advice very deferential and proper i told him the white man was not my friend and that they had better kick him out whereupon he went away salaaming and protesting his friendship and his masters goodwill of course i know now the infernal nigger came to spy and to talk over some of my men anyway eight were missing at the evening muster then i took alarm did not dare to leave my house unguarded you know what my wife is dont you and i did not care to take the child with meit being lateso i sent a message to patalolo to say that we ought to consult that there were rumours and uneasiness in the settlement do you know what answer i got  lingard stopped short in his walk before almayer who went on after an impressive pause with growing animation  all brought it the rajah sends a friends greeting and does not understand the message that was all not a word more could ali get out of him i could see that ali was pretty well scared he hung about arranging my hammockone thing and another then just before going away he mentioned that the watergate of the rajahs place was heavily barred but that he could see only very few men about the courtyard finally he said there is darkness in our rajahs house but no sleep only darkness and fear and the wailing of women cheerful wasnt it it made me feel cold down my back somehow after ali slipped away i stood hereby this table and listened to the shouting and drumming in the settlement racket enough for twenty weddings it was a little past midnight then  again almayer stopped in his narrative with an abrupt shutting of lips as if he had said all that there was to tell and lingard stood staring at him pensive and silent a big bluebottle fly flew in recklessly into the cool verandah and darted with loud buzzing between the two men lingard struck at it with his hat the fly swerved and almayer dodged his head out of the way then lingard aimed another ineffectual blow almayer jumped up and waved his arms about the fly buzzed desperately and the vibration of minute wings sounded in the peace of the early morning like a faroff string orchestra accompanying the hollow determined stamping of the two men who with heads thrown back and arms gyrating on high or again bending low with infuriated lunges were intent upon killing the intruder but suddenly the buzz died out in a thin thrill away in the open space of the courtyard leaving lingard and almayer standing face to face in the fresh silence of the young day looking very puzzled and idle their arms hanging uselessly by their sideslike men disheartened by some portentous failure  look at that muttered lingard got away after all  nuisance said almayer in the same tone riverside is overrun with them this house is badly placed    mosquitos    and these big flies     last week stung nina    been ill four days    poor child    i wonder what such damned things are made for    chapter two  after a long silence during which almayer had moved towards the table and sat down his head between his hands staring straight before him lingard who had recommenced walking cleared his throat and said  what was it you were saying  ah yes you should have seen this settlement that night i dont think anybody went to bed i walked down to the point and could see them they had a big bonfire in the palm grove and the talk went on there till the morning when i came back here and sat in the dark verandah in this quiet house i felt so frightfully lonely that i stole in and took the child out of her cot and brought her here into my hammock if it hadnt been for her i am sure i would have gone mad i felt so utterly alone and helpless remember i hadnt heard from you for four months didnt know whether you were alive or dead patalolo would have nothing to do with me my own men were deserting me like rats do a sinking hulk that was a black night for me captain lingard a black night as i sat here not knowing what would happen next they were so excited and rowdy that i really feared they would come and burn the house over my head i went and brought my revolver laid it loaded on the table there were such awful yells now and then luckily the child slept through it and seeing her so pretty and peaceful steadied me somehow couldnt believe there was any violence in this world looking at her lying so quiet and so unconscious of what went on but it was very hard everything was at an end you must understand that on that night there was no government in sambir nothing to restrain those fellows patalolo had collapsed i was abandoned by my own people and all that lot could vent their spite on me if they wanted they know no gratitude how many times havent i saved this settlement from starvation absolute starvation only three months ago i distributed again a lot of rice on credit there was nothing to eat in this infernal place they came begging on their knees there isnt a man in sambir big or little who is not in debt to lingard  co not one you ought to be satisfied you always said that was the right policy for us well i carried it out ah captain lingard a policy like that should be backed by loaded rifles     you had them exclaimed lingard in the midst of his promenade that went on more rapid as almayer talked the headlong tramp of a man hurrying on to do something violent the verandah was full of dust oppressive and choking which rose under the old seamans feet and made almayer cough again and again  yes i had twenty and not a finger to pull a trigger its easy to talk he spluttered his face very red  lingard dropped into a chair and leaned back with one hand stretched out at length upon the table the other thrown over the back of his seat the dust settled and the sun surging above the forest flooded the verandah with a clear light almayer got up and busied himself in lowering the split rattan screens that hung between the columns of the verandah  phew said lingard it will be a hot day thats right my boy keep the sun out we dont want to be roasted alive here  almayer came back sat down and spoke very calmly  in the morning i went across to see patalolo i took the child with me of course i found the watergate barred and had to walk round through the bushes patalolo received me lying on the floor in the dark all the shutters closed i could get nothing out of him but lamentations and groans he said you must be dead that lakamba was coming now with abdullas guns to kill everybody said he did not mind being killed as he was an old man but that the wish of his heart was to make a pilgrimage he was tired of mens ingratitudehe had no heirshe wanted to go to mecca and die there he would ask abdulla to let him go then he abused lakambabetween sobsand you a little you prevented him from asking for a flag that would have been respectedhe was right thereand now when his enemies were strong he was weak and you were not there to help him when i tried to put some heart into him telling him he had four big gunsyou know the brass sixpounders you left here last yearand that i would get powder and that perhaps together we could make head against lakamba he simply howled at me no matter which way he turnedhe shriekedthe white men would be the death of him while he wanted only to be a pilgrim and be at peace my belief is added almayer after a short pause and fixing a dull stare upon lingard that the old fool saw this thing coming for a long time and was not only too frightened to do anything himself but actually too scared to let you or me know of his suspicions another of your particular pets well you have a lucky hand i must say  lingard struck a sudden blow on the table with his clenched hand there was a sharp crack of splitting wood almayer started up violently then fell back in his chair and looked at the table  there he said moodily you dont know your own strength this table is completely ruined the only table i had been able to save from my wife by and by i will have to eat squatting on the floor like a native  lingard laughed heartily well then dont nag at me like a woman at a drunken husband he became very serious after awhile and added if it hadnt been for the loss of the flash i would have been here three months ago and all would have been well no use crying over that dont you be uneasy kaspar we will have everything shipshape here in a very short time  what you dont mean to expel abdulla out of here by force i tell you you cant  not i exclaimed lingard thats all over i am afraid great pity they will suffer for it he will squeeze them great pity damn it i feel so sorry for them if i had the flash here i would try force eh why not however the poor flash is gone and there is an end of it poor old hooker hey almayer you made a voyage or two with me wasnt she a sweet craft could make her do anything but talk she was better than a wife to me never scolded hey    and to think that it should come to this that i should leave her poor old bones sticking on a reef as though i had been a damned fool of a southerngoing man who must have half a mile of water under his keel to be safe well well its only those who do nothing that make no mistakes i suppose but its hard hard  he nodded sadly with his eyes on the ground almayer looked at him with growing indignation  upon my word you are heartless he burst out perfectly heartlessand selfish it does not seem to strike youin all thatthat in losing your shipby your recklessness i am sureyou ruin meus and my little nina whats going to become of me and of her thats what i want to know you brought me here made me your partner and now when everything is gone to the devilthrough your fault mind youyou talk about your ship    ship you can get another but here this trade thats gone now thanks to willems    your dear willems  never you mind about willems i will look after him said lingard severely and as to the trade    i will make your fortune yet my boy never fear have you got any cargo for the schooner that brought me here  the shed is full of rattans answered almayer and i have about eighty tons of guttah in the well the last lot i ever will have no doubt he added bitterly  so after all there was no robbery youve lost nothing actually well then you must    hallo whats the matter    here     robbery no screamed almayer throwing up his hands  he fell back in the chair and his face became purple a little white foam appeared on his lips and trickled down his chin while he lay back showing the whites of his upturned eyes when he came to himself he saw lingard standing over him with an empty waterchatty in his hand  you had a fit of some kind said the old seaman with much concern what is it you did give me a fright so very sudden  almayer his hair all wet and stuck to his head as if he had been diving sat up and gasped  outrage a fiendish outrage i     lingard put the chatty on the table and looked at him in attentive silence almayer passed his hand over his forehead and went on in an unsteady tone  when i remember that i lose all control he said i told you he anchored abdullas ship abreast our jetty but over to the other shore near the rajahs place the ship was surrounded with boats from here it looked as if she had been landed on a raft every dugout in sambir was there through my glass i could distinguish the faces of people on the poopabdulla willems lakambaeverybody that old cringing scoundrel sahamin was there i could see quite plain there seemed to be much talk and discussion finally i saw a ships boat lowered some arab got into her and the boat went towards patalolos landingplace it seems they had been refused admittanceso they say i think myself that the watergate was not unbarred quick enough to please the exalted messenger at any rate i saw the boat come back almost directly i was looking on rather interested when i saw willems and some more go forwardvery busy about something there that woman was also amongst them ah that woman     almayer choked and seemed on the point of having a relapse but by a violent effort regained a comparative composure  all of a sudden he continuedbang they fired a shot into patalolos gate and before i had time to catch my breathi was startled you may believethey sent another and burst the gate open whereupon i suppose they thought they had done enough for a while and probably felt hungry for a feast began aft abdulla sat amongst them like an idol crosslegged his hands on his lap hes too great altogether to eat when others do but he presided you see willems kept on dodging about forward aloof from the crowd and looking at my house through the ships long glass i could not resist it i shook my fist at him  just so said lingard gravely that was the thing to do of course if you cant fight a man the best thing is to exasperate him  almayer waved his hand in a superior manner and continued unmoved you may say what you like you cant realize my feelings he saw me and with his eye still at the small end of the glass lifted his arm as if answering a hail i thought my turn to be shot at would come next after patalolo so i ran up the union jack to the flagstaff in the yard i had no other protection there were only three men besides ali that stuck to methree cripples for that matter too sick to get away i would have fought singlehanded i think i was that angry but there was the child what to do with her couldnt send her up the river with the mother you know i cant trust my wife i decided to keep very quiet but to let nobody land on our shore private property that under a deed from patalolo i was within my rightwasnt i the morning was very quiet after they had a feed on board the barque with abdulla most of them went home only the big people remained towards three oclock sahamin crossed alone in a small canoe i went down on our wharf with my gun to speak to him but didnt let him land the old hypocrite said abdulla sent greetings and wished to talk with me on business would i come on board i said no i would not told him that abdulla may write and i would answer but no interview neither on board his ship nor on shore i also said that if anybody attempted to land within my fences i would shootno matter whom on that he lifted his hands to heaven scandalized and then paddled away pretty smartlyto report i suppose an hour or so afterwards i saw willems land a boat party at the rajahs it was very quiet not a shot was fired and there was hardly any shouting they tumbled those brass guns you presented to patalolo last year down the bank into the river its deep there close to the channel runs that way you know about five willems went back on board and i saw him join abdulla by the wheel aft he talked a lot swinging his arms aboutseemed to explain thingspointed at my house then down the reach finally just before sunset they hove upon the cable and dredged the ship down nearly half a mile to the junction of the two branches of the riverwhere she is now as you might have seen  lingard nodded  that evening after darki was informedabdulla landed for the first time in sambir he was entertained in sahamins house i sent ali to the settlement for news he returned about nine and reported that patalolo was sitting on abdullas left hand before sahamins fire there was a great council ali seemed to think that patalolo was a prisoner but he was wrong there they did the trick very neatly before midnight everything was arranged as i can make out patalolo went back to his demolished stockade escorted by a dozen boats with torches it appears he begged abdulla to let him have a passage in the lord of the isles to penang from there he would go to mecca the firing business was alluded to as a mistake no doubt it was in a sense patalolo never meant resisting so he is going as soon as the ship is ready for sea he went on board next day with three women and half a dozen fellows as old as himself by abdullas orders he was received with a salute of seven guns and he has been living on board ever sincefive weeks i doubt whether he will leave the river alive at any rate he wont live to reach penang lakamba took over all his goods and gave him a draft on abdullas house payable in penang he is bound to die before he gets there dont you see  he sat silent for a while in dejected meditation then went on  of course there were several rows during the night various fellows took the opportunity of the unsettled state of affairs to pay off old scores and settle old grudges i passed the night in that chair there dozing uneasily now and then there would be a great tumult and yelling which would make me sit up revolver in hand however nobody was killed a few broken headsthats all early in the morning willems caused them to make a fresh move which i must say surprised me not a little as soon as there was daylight they busied themselves in setting up a flagpole on the space at the other end of the settlement where abdulla is having his houses built now shortly after sunrise there was a great gathering at the flagpole all went there willems was standing leaning against the mast one arm over that womans shoulders they had brought an armchair for patalolo and lakamba stood on the right hand of the old man who made a speech everybody in sambir was there women slaves childreneverybody then patalolo spoke he said that by the mercy of the most high he was going on a pilgrimage the dearest wish of his heart was to be accomplished then turning to lakamba he begged him to rule justly during hispatalolosabsence there was a bit of playacting there lakamba said he was unworthy of the honourable burden and patalolo insisted poor old fool it must have been bitter to him they made him actually entreat that scoundrel fancy a man compelled to beg of a robber to despoil him but the old rajah was so frightened anyway he did it and lakamba accepted at last then willems made a speech to the crowd said that on his way to the west the rajahhe meant patalolowould see the great white ruler in batavia and obtain his protection for sambir meantime he went on i an orang blanda and your friend hoist the flag under the shadow of which there is safety with that he ran up a dutch flag to the masthead it was made hurriedly during the night of cotton stuffs and being heavy hung down the mast while the crowd stared ali told me there was a great sigh of surprise but not a word was spoken till lakamba advanced and proclaimed in a loud voice that during all that day every one passing by the flagstaff must uncover his head and salaam before the emblem  but hang it all exclaimed lingardabdulla is british  abdulla wasnt there at alldid not go on shore that day yet ali who has his wits about him noticed that the space where the crowd stood was under the guns of the lord of the isles they had put a coir warp ashore and gave the barque a cant in the current so as to bring the broadside to bear on the flagstaff clever eh but nobody dreamt of resistance when they recovered from the surprise there was a little quiet jeering and bahassoen abused lakamba violently till one of lakambas men hit him on the head with a staff frightful crack i am told then they left off jeering meantime patalolo went away and lakamba sat in the chair at the foot of the flagstaff while the crowd surged around as if they could not make up their minds to go suddenly there was a great noise behind lakambas chair it was that woman who went for willems ali says she was like a wild beast but he twisted her wrist and made her grovel in the dust nobody knows exactly what it was about some say it was about that flag he carried her off flung her into a canoe and went on board abdullas ship after that sahamin was the first to salaam to the flag others followed suit before noon everything was quiet in the settlement and ali came back and told me all this  almayer drew a long breath lingard stretched out his legs  go on he said  almayer seemed to struggle with himself at last he spluttered out  the hardest is to tell yet the most unheardof thing an outrage a fiendish outrage    chapter three   well lets know all about it i cant imagine    began lingard after waiting for some time in silence  cant imagine i should think you couldnt interrupted almayer why    you just listen when ali came back i felt a little easier in my mind there was then some semblance of order in sambir i had the jack up since the morning and began to feel safer some of my men turned up in the afternoon i did not ask any questions set them to work as if nothing had happened towards the eveningit might have been five or halfpasti was on our jetty with the child when i heard shouts at the faroff end of the settlement at first i didnt take much notice by and by ali came to me and says master give me the child there is much trouble in the settlement so i gave him nina and went in took my revolver and passed through the house into the back courtyard as i came down the steps i saw all the serving girls clear out from the cooking shed and i heard a big crowd howling on the other side of the dry ditch which is the limit of our ground could not see them on account of the fringe of bushes along the ditch but i knew that crowd was angry and after somebody as i stood wondering that jimengyou know the chinaman who settled here a couple of years ago  he was my passenger i brought him here exclaimed lingard a firstclass chinaman that  did you i had forgotten well that jimeng he burst through the bush and fell into my arms so to speak he told me panting that they were after him because he wouldnt take off his hat to the flag he was not so much scared but he was very angry and indignant of course he had to run for it there were some fifty men after himlakambas friendsbut he was full of fight said he was an englishman and would not take off his hat to any flag but english i tried to soothe him while the crowd was shouting on the other side of the ditch i told him he must take one of my canoes and cross the river stop on the other side for a couple of days he wouldnt not he he was english and he would fight the whole lot says he they are only black fellows we white men meaning me and himself can fight everybody in sambir he was mad with passion the crowd quieted a little and i thought i could shelter jimeng without much risk when all of a sudden i heard willems voice he shouted to me in english let four men enter your compound to get that chinaman i said nothing told jimeng to keep quiet too then after a while willems shouts again dont resist almayer i give you good advice i am keeping this crowd back dont resist them that beggars voice enraged me i could not help it i cried to him you are a liar and just then jimeng who had flung off his jacket and had tucked up his trousers ready for a fight just then that fellow he snatches the revolver out of my hand and lets fly at them through the bush there was a sharp cryhe must have hit somebodyand a great yell and before i could wink twice they were over the ditch and through the bush and on top of us simply rolled over us there wasnt the slightest chance to resist i was trampled under foot jimeng got a dozen gashes about his body and we were carried halfway up the yard in the first rush my eyes and mouth were full of dust i was on my back with three or four fellows sitting on me i could hear jimeng trying to shout not very far from me now and then they would throttle him and he would gurgle i could hardly breathe myself with two heavy fellows on my chest willems came up running and ordered them to raise me up but to keep good hold they led me into the verandah i looked round but did not see either ali or the child felt easier struggled a little    oh my god  almayers face was distorted with a passing spasm of rage lingard moved in his chair slightly almayer went on after a short pause  they held me shouting threats in my face willems took down my hammock and threw it to them he pulled out the drawer of this table and found there a palm and needle and some sailtwine we were making awnings for your brig as you had asked me last voyage before you left he knew of course where to look for what he wanted by his orders they laid me out on the floor wrapped me in my hammock and he started to stitch me in as if i had been a corpse beginning at the feet while he worked he laughed wickedly i called him all the names i could think of he told them to put their dirty paws over my mouth and nose i was nearly choked whenever i moved they punched me in the ribs he went on taking fresh needlefuls as he wanted them and working steadily sewed me up to my throat then he rose saying that will do let go that woman had been standing by they must have been reconciled she clapped her hands i lay on the floor like a bale of goods while he stared at me and the woman shrieked with delight like a bale of goods there was a grin on every face and the verandah was full of them i wished myself deadpon my word captain lingard i did i do now whenever i think of it  lingards face expressed sympathetic indignation almayer dropped his head upon his arms on the table and spoke in that position in an indistinct and muffled voice without looking up  finally by his directions they flung me into the big rockingchair i was sewed in so tight that i was stiff like a piece of wood he was giving orders in a very loud voice and that man babalatchi saw that they were executed they obeyed him implicitly meantime i lay there in the chair like a log and that woman capered before me and made faces snapped her fingers before my nose women are badaint they i never saw her before as far as i know never done anything to her yet she was perfectly fiendish can you understand it now and then she would leave me alone to hang round his neck for awhile and then she would return before my chair and begin her exercises again he looked on indulgent the perspiration ran down my face got into my eyesmy arms were sewn in i was blinded half the time at times i could see better she drags him before my chair i am like white women she says her arms round his neck you should have seen the faces of the fellows in the verandah they were scandalized and ashamed of themselves to see her behaviour suddenly she asks him alluding to me when are you going to kill him imagine how i felt i must have swooned i dont remember exactly i fancy there was a row he was angry when i got my wits again he was sitting close to me and she was gone i understood he sent her to my wife who was hiding in the back room and never came out during this affair willems says to mei fancy i can hear his voice hoarse and dullhe says to me not a hair of your head shall be touched i made no sound then he goes on please remark that the flag you have hoistedwhich by the by is not yourshas been respected tell captain lingard so when you do see him but he says you first fired at the crowd you are a liar you blackguard i shouted he winced i am sure it hurt him to see i was not frightened anyways he says a shot had been fired out of your compound and a man was hit still all your property shall be respected on account of the union jack moreover i have no quarrel with captain lingard who is the senior partner in this business as to you he continued you will not forget this daynot if you live to be a hundred years oldor i dont know your nature you will keep the bitter taste of this humiliation to the last day of your life and so your kindness to me shall be repaid i shall remove all the powder you have this coast is under the protection of the netherlands and you have no right to have any powder there are the governors orders in council to that effect and you know it tell me where the key of the small storehouse is i said not a word and he waited a little then rose saying its your own fault if there is any damage done he ordered babalatchi to have the lock of the officeroom forced and went inrummaged amongst my drawerscould not find the key then that woman aissa asked my wife and she gave them the key after awhile they tumbled every barrel into the river eightythree hundredweight he superintended himself and saw every barrel roll into the water there were mutterings babalatchi was angry and tried to expostulate but he gave him a good shaking i must say he was perfectly fearless with those fellows then he came back to the verandah sat down by me again and says we found your man ali with your little daughter hiding in the bushes up the river we brought them in they are perfectly safe of course let me congratulate you almayer upon the cleverness of your child she recognized me at once and cried pig as naturally as you would yourself circumstances alter feelings you should have seen how frightened your man ali was clapped his hands over her mouth i think you spoil her almayer but i am not angry really you look so ridiculous in this chair that i cant feel angry i made a frantic effort to burst out of my hammock to get at that scoundrels throat but i only fell off and upset the chair over myself he laughed and said only i leave you half of your revolver cartridges and take half myself they will fit mine we are both white men and should back each other up i may want them i shouted at him from under the chair you are a thief but he never looked and went away one hand round that womans waist the other on babalatchis shoulder to whom he was talkinglaying down the law about something or other in less than five minutes there was nobody inside our fences after awhile ali came to look for me and cut me free i havent seen willems sincenor anybody else for that matter i have been left alone i offered sixty dollars to the man who had been wounded which were accepted they released jimeng the next day when the flag had been hauled down he sent six cases of opium to me for safe keeping but has not left his house i think he is safe enough now everything is very quiet  towards the end of his narrative almayer lifted his head off the table and now sat back in his chair and stared at the bamboo rafters of the roof above him lingard lolled in his seat with his legs stretched out in the peaceful gloom of the verandah with its lowered screens they heard faint noises from the world outside in the blazing sunshine a hail on the river the answer from the shore the creak of a pulley sounds short interrupted as if lost suddenly in the brilliance of noonday lingard got up slowly walked to the front rail and holding one of the screens aside looked out in silence over the water and the empty courtyard came a distinct voice from a small schooner anchored abreast of the lingard jetty  serang take a pull at the main peak halyards this gaff is down on the boom  there was a shrill pipe dying in longdrawn cadence the song of the men swinging on the rope the voice said sharply that will do another voicethe serangs probablyshouted ikat and as lingard dropped the blind and turned away all was silent again as if there had been nothing on the other side of the swaying screen nothing but the light brilliant crude heavy lying on a dead land like a pall of fire lingard sat down again facing almayer his elbow on the table in a thoughtful attitude  nice little schooner muttered almayer wearily did you buy her  no answered lingard after i lost the flash we got to palembang in our boats i chartered her there for six months from young ford you know belongs to him he wanted a spell ashore so i took charge myself of course all fords people on board strangers to me i had to go to singapore about the insurance then i went to macassar of course had long passages no wind it was like a curse on me i had lots of trouble with old hudig that delayed me much  ah hudig why with hudig asked almayer in a perfunctory manner  oh about a    a woman mumbled lingard  almayer looked at him with languid surprise the old seaman had twisted his white beard into a point and now was busy giving his moustaches a fierce curl his little red eyesthose eyes that had smarted under the salt sprays of every sea that had looked unwinking to windward in the gales of all latitudesnow glared at almayer from behind the lowered eyebrows like a pair of frightened wild beasts crouching in a bush  extraordinary so like you what can you have to do with hudigs women the old sinner said almayer negligently  what are you talking about wife of a friend of    i mean of a man i know     still i dont see    interjected almayer carelessly  of a man you know too well very well  i knew so many men before you made me bury myself in this hole growled almayer unamiably if she had anything to do with hudigthat wifethen she cant be up to much i would be sorry for the man added almayer brightening up with the recollection of the scandalous tittletattle of the past when he was a young man in the second capital of the islandsand so well informed so well informed he laughed lingards frown deepened  dont talk foolish its willems wife  almayer grasped the sides of his seat his eyes and mouth opened wide  what why he exclaimed bewildered  willemswife repeated lingard distinctly you aint deaf are you the wife of willems just so as to why there was a promise and i did not know what had happened here  what is it youve been giving her money i bet cried almayer  well no said lingard deliberately although i suppose i shall have to     almayer groaned  the fact is went on lingard speaking slowly and steadily the fact is that i have    i have brought her here here to sambir  in heavens name why shouted almayer jumping up the chair tilted and fell slowly over he raised his clasped hands above his head and brought them down jerkily separating his fingers with an effort as if tearing them apart lingard nodded quickly several times  i have awkward hey he said with a puzzled look upwards  upon my word said almayer tearfully i cant understand you at all what will you do next willems wife  wife and child small boy you know they are on board the schooner  almayer looked at lingard with sudden suspicion then turning away busied himself in picking up the chair sat down in it turning his back upon the old seaman and tried to whistle but gave it up directly lingard went on  fact is the fellow got into trouble with hudig worked upon my feelings i promised to arrange matters i did with much trouble hudig was angry with her for wishing to join her husband unprincipled old fellow you know she is his daughter well i said i would see her through it all right help willems to a fresh start and so on i spoke to craig in palembang he is getting on in years and wanted a manager or partner i promised to guarantee willems good behaviour we settled all that craig is an old crony of mine been shipmates in the forties hes waiting for him now a pretty mess what do you think  almayer shrugged his shoulders  that woman broke with hudig on my assurance that all would be well went on lingard with growing dismay she did proper thing of course wife husband    together    as it should be    smart fellow    impossible scoundrel    jolly old go oh damn  almayer laughed spitefully  how delighted he will be he said softly you will make two people happy two at least he laughed again while lingard looked at his shaking shoulders in consternation  i am jammed on a lee shore this time if ever i was muttered lingard  send her back quick suggested almayer stifling another laugh  what are you sniggering at growled lingard angrily ill work it out all clear yet meantime you must receive her into this house  my house cried almayer turning round  its mine tooa little isnt it said lingard dont argue he shouted as almayer opened his mouth obey orders and hold your tongue  oh if you take it in that tone mumbled almayer sulkily with a gesture of assent  you are so aggravating too my boy said the old seaman with unexpected placidity you must give me time to turn round i cant keep her on board all the time i must tell her something say for instance that he is gone up the river expected back every day thats it dye hear you must put her on that tack and dodge her along easy while i take the kinks out of the situation by god he exclaimed mournfully after a short pause life is foul foul like a lee forebrace on a dirty night and yet and yet one must see it clear for running before going belowfor good now you attend to what i said he added sharply if you dont want to quarrel with me my boy  i dont want to quarrel with you murmured almayer with unwilling deference only i wish i could understand you i know you are my best friend captain lingard only upon my word i cant make you out sometimes i wish i could     lingard burst into a loud laugh which ended shortly in a deep sigh he closed his eyes tilting his head over the back of his armchair and on his face baked by the unclouded suns of many hard years there appeared for a moment a weariness and a look of age which startled almayer like an unexpected disclosure of evil  i am done up said lingard gently perfectly done up all night on deck getting that schooner up the river then talking with you seems to me i could go to sleep on a clothesline i should like to eat something though just see about that kaspar  almayer clapped his hands and receiving no response was going to call when in the central passage of the house behind the red curtain of the doorway opening upon the verandah they heard a childs imperious voice speaking shrilly  take me up at once i want to be carried into the verandah i shall be very angry take me up  a mans voice answered subdued in humble remonstrance the faces of almayer and lingard brightened at once the old seaman called out  bring the child lekas  you will see how she has grown exclaimed almayer in a jubilant tone  through the curtained doorway ali appeared with little nina almayer in his arms the child had one arm round his neck and with the other she hugged a ripe pumelo nearly as big as her own head her little pink sleeveless robe had half slipped off her shoulders but the long black hair that framed her olive face in which the big black eyes looked out in childish solemnity fell in luxuriant profusion over her shoulders all round her and over alis arms like a closemeshed and delicate net of silken threads lingard got up to meet ali and as soon as she caught sight of the old seaman she dropped the fruit and put out both her hands with a cry of delight he took her from the malay and she laid hold of his moustaches with an affectionate goodwill that brought unaccustomed tears into his little red eyes  not so hard little one not so hard he murmured pressing with an enormous hand that covered it entirely the childs head to his face  pick up my pumelo o rajah of the sea she said speaking in a highpitched clear voice with great volubility there under the table i want it quick quick you have been away fighting with many men ali says so you are a mighty fighter ali says so on the great sea far away away away  she waved her hand staring with dreamy vacancy while lingard looked at her and squatting down groped under the table after the pumelo  where does she get those notions said lingard getting up cautiously to almayer who had been giving orders to ali  she is always with the men many a time ive found her with her fingers in their rice dish of an evening she does not care for her mother thoughi am glad to say how pretty she isand so sharp my very image  lingard had put the child on the table and both men stood looking at her with radiant faces  a perfect little woman whispered lingard yes my dear boy we shall make her somebody youll see  very little chance of that now remarked almayer sadly  you do not know exclaimed lingard taking up the child again and beginning to walk up and down the verandah i have my plans i havelisten  and he began to explain to the interested almayer his plans for the future he would interview abdulla and lakamba there must be some understanding with those fellows now they had the upper hand here he interrupted himself to swear freely while the child who had been diligently fumbling about his neck had found his whistle and blew a loud blast now and then close to his earwhich made him wince and laugh as he put her hands down scolding her lovingly yesthat would be easily settled he was a man to be reckoned with yet nobody knew that better than almayer very well then he must patiently try and keep some little trade together it would be all right but the great thingand here lingard spoke lower bringing himself to a sudden standstill before the entranced almayerthe great thing would be the gold hunt up the river helingardwould devote himself to it he had been in the interior before there were immense deposits of alluvial gold there fabulous he felt sure had seen places dangerous work of course but what a reward he would exploreand find not a shadow of doubt hang the danger they would first get as much as they could for themselves keep the thing quiet then after a time form a company in batavia or in england yes in england much better splendid why of course and that baby would be the richest woman in the world helingardwould not perhaps see italthough he felt good for many years yetbut almayer would here was something to live for yet hey  but the richest woman in the world had been for the last five minutes shouting shrillyrajah laut rajah laut hai give ear while the old seaman had been speaking louder unconsciously to make his deep bass heard above the impatient clamour he stopped now and said tenderly  what is it little woman  i am not a little woman i am a white child anak putih a white child and the white men are my brothers father says so and ali says so too ali knows as much as father everything  almayer almost danced with paternal delight  i taught her i taught her he repeated laughing with tears in his eyes isnt she sharp  i am the slave of the white child said lingard with playful solemnity what is the order  i want a house she warbled with great eagerness i want a house and another house on the roof and another on the roofhigh high like the places where they dwellmy brothersin the land where the sun sleeps  to the westward explained almayer under his breath she remembers everything she wants you to build a house of cards you did last time you were here  lingard sat down with the child on his knees and almayer pulled out violently one drawer after another looking for the cards as if the fate of the world depended upon his haste he produced a dirty double pack which was only used during lingards visit to sambir when he would sometimes playof an eveningwith almayer a game which he called chinese bezique it bored almayer but the old seaman delighted in it considering it a remarkable product of chinese geniusa race for which he had an unaccountable liking and admiration  now we will get on my little pearl he said putting together with extreme precaution two cards that looked absurdly flimsy between his big fingers little nina watched him with intense seriousness as he went on erecting the ground floor while he continued to speak to almayer with his head over his shoulder so as not to endanger the structure with his breath  i know what i am talking about    been in california in fortynine    not that i made much    then in victoria in the early days     i know all about it trust me moreover a blind man could    be quiet little sister or you will knock this affair down    my hand pretty steady yet hey kaspar    now delight of my heart we shall put a third house on the top of these two    keep very quiet    as i was saying you got only to stoop and gather handfuls of gold    dust    there now here we are three houses on top of one another grand  he leaned back in his chair one hand on the childs head which he smoothed mechanically and gesticulated with the other speaking to almayer  once on the spot there would be only the trouble to pick up the stuff then we shall all go to europe the child must be educated we shall be rich rich is no name for it down in devonshire where i belong there was a fellow who built a house near teignmouth which had as many windows as a threedecker has ports made all his money somewhere out here in the good old days people around said he had been a pirate we boysi was a boy in a brixham trawler thencertainly believed that he went about in a bathchair in his grounds had a glass eye     higher higher called out nina pulling the old seamans beard  you do worry medont you said lingard gently giving her a tender kiss what one more house on top of all these well i will try  the child watched him breathlessly when the difficult feat was accomplished she clapped her hands looked on steadily and after a while gave a great sigh of content  oh look out shouted almayer  the structure collapsed suddenly before the childs light breath lingard looked discomposed for a moment almayer laughed but the little girl began to cry  take her said the old seaman abruptly then after almayer went away with the crying child he remained sitting by the table looking gloomily at the heap of cards  damn this willems he muttered to himself but i will do it yet  he got up and with an angry push of his hand swept the cards off the table then he fell back in his chair  tired as a dog he sighed out closing his eyes    chapter four   consciously or unconsciously men are proud of their firmness steadfastness of purpose directness of aim they go straight towards their desire to the accomplishment of virtuesometimes of crimein an uplifting persuasion of their firmness they walk the road of life the road fenced in by their tastes prejudices disdains or enthusiasms generally honest invariably stupid and are proud of never losing their way if they do stop it is to look for a moment over the hedges that make them safe to look at the misty valleys at the distant peaks at cliffs and morasses at the dark forests and the hazy plains where other human beings grope their days painfully away stumbling over the bones of the wise over the unburied remains of their predecessors who died alone in gloom or in sunshine halfway from anywhere the man of purpose does not understand and goes on full of contempt he never loses his way he knows where he is going and what he wants travelling on he achieves great length without any breadth and battered besmirched and weary he touches the goal at last he grasps the reward of his perseverance of his virtue of his healthy optimism an untruthful tombstone over a dark and soon forgotten grave  lingard had never hesitated in his life why should he he had been a most successful trader and a man lucky in his fights skilful in navigation undeniably first in seamanship in those seas he knew it had he not heard the voice of common consent  the voice of the world that respected him so much the whole world to himfor to us the limits of the universe are strictly defined by those we know there is nothing for us outside the babble of praise and blame on familiar lips and beyond our last acquaintance there lies only a vast chaos a chaos of laughter and tears which concerns us not laughter and tears unpleasant wicked morbid contemptiblebecause heard imperfectly by ears rebellious to strange sounds to lingardsimple himselfall things were simple he seldom read books were not much in his way and he had to work hard navigating trading and also in obedience to his benevolent instincts shaping stray lives he found here and there under his busy hand he remembered the sundayschool teachings of his native village and the discourses of the blackcoated gentleman connected with the mission to fishermen and seamen whose yawlrigged boat darting through rainsqualls amongst the coasters windbound in falmouth bay was part of those precious pictures of his youthful days that lingered in his memory as clever a skypilot as you could wish to see he would say with conviction and the best man to handle a boat in any weather i ever did meet such were the agencies that had roughly shaped his young soul before he went away to see the world in a southerngoing shipbefore he went ignorant and happy heavy of hand pure in heart profane in speech to give himself up to the great sea that took his life and gave him his fortune when thinking of his rise in the worldcommander of ships then shipowner then a man of much capital respected wherever he went lingard in a word the rajah lauthe was amazed and awed by his fate that seemed to his illinformed mind the most wondrous known in the annals of men his experience appeared to him immense and conclusive teaching him the lesson of the simplicity of life in lifeas in seamanshipthere were only two ways of doing a thing the right way and the wrong way common sense and experience taught a man the way that was right the other was for lubbers and fools and led in seamanship to loss of spars and sails or shipwreck in life to loss of money and consideration or to an unlucky knock on the head he did not consider it his duty to be angry with rascals he was only angry with things he could not understand but for the weaknesses of humanity he could find a contemptuous tolerance it being manifest that he was wise and luckyotherwise how could he have been as successful in life as he had beenhe had an inclination to set right the lives of other people just as he could hardly refrainin defiance of nautical etiquettefrom interfering with his chief officer when the crew was sending up a new topmast or generally when busy about what he called a heavy job he was meddlesome with perfect modesty if he knew a thing or two there was no merit in it hard knocks taught me wisdom my boy he used to say and you had better take the advice of a man who has been a fool in his time have another and my boy as a rule took the cool drink the advice and the consequent help which lingard felt himself bound in honour to give so as to back up his opinion like an honest man captain tom went sailing from island to island appearing unexpectedly in various localities beaming noisy anecdotal commendatory or comminatory but always welcome  it was only since his return to sambir that the old seaman had for the first time known doubt and unhappiness the loss of the flashplanted firmly and for ever on a ledge of rock at the north end of gaspar straits in the uncertain light of a cloudy morningshook him considerably and the amazing news which he heard on his arrival in sambir were not made to soothe his feelings a good many years agoprompted by his love of adventurehe with infinite trouble had found out and surveyedfor his own benefit onlythe entrances to that river where he had heard through native report a new settlement of malays was forming no doubt he thought at the time mostly of personal gain but received with hearty friendliness by patalolo he soon came to like the ruler and the people offered his counsel and his help andknowing nothing of arcadiahe dreamed of arcadian happiness for that little corner of the world which he loved to think all his own his deepseated and immovable conviction that only hehe lingardknew what was good for them was characteristic of him and after all not so very far wrong he would make them happy whether or no he said and he meant it his trade brought prosperity to the young state and the fear of his heavy hand secured its internal peace for many years  he looked proudly upon his work with every passing year he loved more the land the people the muddy river that if he could help it would carry no other craft but the flash on its unclean and friendly surface as he slowly warped his vessel upstream he would scan with knowing looks the riverside clearings and pronounce solemn judgment upon the prospects of the seasons ricecrop he knew every settler on the banks between the sea and sambir he knew their wives their children he knew every individual of the multicoloured groups that standing on the flimsy platforms of tiny reed dwellings built over the water waved their hands and shouted shrilly o kapal layer hai while the flash swept slowly through the populated reach to enter the lonely stretches of sparkling brown water bordered by the dense and silent forest whose big trees nodded their outspread boughs gently in the faint warm breezeas if in sign of tender but melancholy welcome he loved it all the landscape of brown golds and brilliant emeralds under the dome of hot sapphire the whispering big trees the loquacious nipapalms that rattled their leaves volubly in the night breeze as if in haste to tell him all the secrets of the great forest behind them he loved the heavy scents of blossoms and black earth that breath of life and of death which lingered over his brig in the damp air of tepid and peaceful nights he loved the narrow and sombre creeks strangers to sunshine black smooth tortuouslike byways of despair he liked even the troops of sorrowfulfaced monkeys that profaned the quiet spots with capricious gambols and insane gestures of inhuman madness he loved everything there animated or inanimated the very mud of the riverside the very alligators enormous and stolid basking on it with impertinent unconcern their size was a source of pride to him immense fellows make two of them palembang reptiles i tell you old man he would shout poking some crony of his playfully in the ribs i tell you big as you are they could swallow you in one gulp hat boots and all magnificent beggars wouldnt you like to see them wouldnt you ha ha ha his thunderous laughter filled the verandah rolled over the hotel garden overflowed into the street paralyzing for a short moment the noiseless traffic of bare brown feet and its loud reverberations would even startle the landlords tame birda shameless mynahinto a momentary propriety of behaviour under the nearest chair in the big billiardroom perspiring men in thin cotton singlets would stop the game listen cue in hand for a while through the open windows then nod their moist faces at each other sagaciously and whisper the old fellow is talking about his river  his river the whispers of curious men the mystery of the thing were to lingard a source of neverending delight the common talk of ignorance exaggerated the profits of his queer monopoly and although strictly truthful in general he liked on that matter to mislead speculation still further by boasts full of cold raillery his river by it he was not only richhe was interesting this secret of his which made him different to the other traders of those seas gave intimate satisfaction to that desire for singularity which he shared with the rest of mankind without being aware of its presence within his breast it was the greater part of his happiness but he only knew it after its loss so unforeseen so sudden and so cruel  after his conversation with almayer he went on board the schooner sent joanna on shore and shut himself up in his cabin feeling very unwell he made the most of his indisposition to almayer who came to visit him twice a day it was an excuse for doing nothing just yet he wanted to think he was very angry angry with himself with willems angry at what willems had doneand also angry at what he had left undone the scoundrel was not complete the conception was perfect but the execution unaccountably fell short why he ought to have cut almayers throat and burnt the place to ashesthen cleared out got out of his way of him lingard yet he didnt was it impudence contemptor what he felt hurt at the implied disrespect of his power and the incomplete rascality of the proceeding disturbed him exceedingly there was something short something wanting something that would have given him a free hand in the work of retribution the obvious the right thing to do was to shoot willems yet how could he had the fellow resisted showed fight or ran away had he shown any consciousness of harm done it would have been more possible more natural but no the fellow actually had sent him a message wanted to see him what for the thing could not be explained an unexampled coldblooded treachery awful incomprehensible why did he do it why why the old seaman in the stuffy solitude of his little cabin on board the schooner groaned out many times that question striking with an open palm his perplexed forehead  during his four days of seclusion he had received two messages from the outer world from that world of sambir which had so suddenly and so finally slipped from his grasp one a few words from willems written on a tornout page of a small notebook the other a communication from abdulla caligraphed carefully on a large sheet of flimsy paper and delivered to him in a green silk wrapper the first he could not understand it said come and see me i am not afraid are you w he tore it up angrily but before the small bits of dirty paper had the time to flutter down and settle on the floor the anger was gone and was replaced by a sentiment that induced him to go on his knees pick up the fragments of the torn message piece it together on the top of his chronometer box and contemplate it long and thoughtfully as if he had hoped to read the answer of the horrible riddle in the very form of the letters that went to make up that fresh insult abdullas letter he read carefully and rammed it into his pocket also with anger but with anger that ended in a halfresigned halfamused smile he would never give in as long as there was a chance its generally the safest way to stick to the ship as long as she will swim was one of his favourite sayings the safest and the right way to abandon a craft because it leaks is easybut poor work poor work yet he was intelligent enough to know when he was beaten and to accept the situation like a man without repining when almayer came on board that afternoon he handed him the letter without comment  almayer read it returned it in silence and leaning over the taffrail the two men were on deck looked down for some time at the play of the eddies round the schooners rudder at last he said without looking up  thats a decent enough letter abdulla gives him up to you i told you they were getting sick of him what are you going to do  lingard cleared his throat shuffled his feet opened his mouth with great determination but said nothing for a while at last he murmured  ill be hanged if i knowjust yet  i wish you would do something soon     whats the hurry interrupted lingard he cant get away as it stands he is at my mercy as far as i can see  yes said almayer reflectivelyand very little mercy he deserves too abdullas meaningas i can make it out amongst all those complimentsis get rid for me of that white manand we shall live in peace and share the trade  you believe that asked lingard contemptuously  not altogether answered almayer no doubt we will share the trade for a timetill he can grab the lot well what are you going to do  he looked up as he spoke and was surprised to see lingards discomposed face  you aint well pain anywhere he asked with real solicitude  i have been queeryou knowthese last few days but no pain he struck his broad chest several times cleared his throat with a powerful hem and repeated no no pain good for a few years yet but i am bothered with all this i can tell you  you must take care of yourself said almayer then after a pause he added you will see abdulla wont you  i dont know not yet theres plenty of time said lingard impatiently  i wish you would do something urged almayer moodily you know that woman is a perfect nuisance to me she and her brat yelps all day and the children dont get on together yesterday the little devil wanted to fight with my nina scratched her face too a perfect savage like his honourable papa yes really she worries about her husband and whimpers from morning to night when she isnt weeping she is furious with me yesterday she tormented me to tell her when he would be back and cried because he was engaged in such dangerous work i said something about it being all rightno necessity to make a fool of herself when she turned upon me like a wild cat called me a brute selfish heartless raved about her beloved peter risking his life for my benefit while i did not care said i took advantage of his generous goodnature to get him to do dangerous workmy work that he was worth twenty of the likes of me that she would tell youopen your eyes as to the kind of man i was and so on thats what ive got to put up with for your sake you really might consider me a little i havent robbed anybody went on almayer with an attempt at bitter ironyor sold my best friend but still you ought to have some pity on me its like living in a hot fever she is out of her wits you make my house a refuge for scoundrels and lunatics it isnt fair pon my word it isnt when she is in her tantrums she is ridiculously ugly and screeches soit sets my teeth on edge thank god my wife got a fit of the sulks and cleared out of the house lives in a riverside hut since that affairyou know but this willems wife by herself is almost more than i can bear and i ask myself why should i you are exacting and no mistake this morning i thought she was going to claw me only think she wanted to go prancing about the settlement she might have heard something there so i told her she mustnt it wasnt safe outside our fences i said thereupon she rushes at me with her ten nails up to my eyes you miserable man she yells even this place is not safe and youve sent him up this awful river where he may lose his head if he dies before forgiving me heaven will punish you for your crime    my crime i ask myself sometimes whether i am dreaming it will make me ill all this ive lost my appetite already  he flung his hat on deck and laid hold of his hair despairingly lingard looked at him with concern  what did she mean by it he muttered thoughtfully  mean she is crazy i tell youand i will be very soon if this lasts  just a little patience kaspar pleaded lingard a day or so more  relieved or tired by his violent outburst almayer calmed down picked up his hat and leaning against the bulwark commenced to fan himself with it  days do pass he said resignedlybut that kind of thing makes a man old before his time what is there to think abouti cant imagine abdulla says plainly that if you undertake to pilot his ship out and instruct the halfcaste he will drop willems like a hot potato and be your friend ever after i believe him perfectly as to willems its so natural as to being your friend its a lie of course but we need not bother about that just yet you just say yes to abdulla and then whatever happens to willems will be nobodys business  he interrupted himself and remained silent for a while glaring about with set teeth and dilated nostrils  you leave it to me ill see to it that something happens to him he said at last with calm ferocity lingard smiled faintly  the fellow isnt worth a shot not the trouble of it he whispered as if to himself almayer fired up suddenly  thats what you think he cried you havent been sewn up in your hammock to be made a laughingstock of before a parcel of savages why i darent look anybody here in the face while that scoundrel is alive i will    i will settle him  i dont think you will growled lingard  do you think i am afraid of him  bless you no said lingard with alacrity afraid not you i know you i dont doubt your courage its your head my boy your head that i     thats it said the aggrieved almayer go on why dont you call me a fool at once  because i dont want to burst out lingard with nervous irritability if i wanted to call you a fool i would do so without asking your leave he began to walk athwart the narrow quarterdeck kicking ropes ends out of his way and growling to himself delicate gentleman    what next    ive done mans work before you could toddle understand    say what i like  well well said almayer with affected resignation theres no talking to you these last few days he put on his hat strolled to the gangway and stopped one foot on the little inside ladder as if hesitating came back and planted himself in lingards way compelling him to stand still and listen  of course you will do what you like you never take advicei know that but let me tell you that it wouldnt be honest to let that fellow get away from here if you do nothing that scoundrel will leave in abdullas ship for sure abdulla will make use of him to hurt you and others elsewhere willems knows too much about your affairs he will cause you lots of trouble you mark my words lots of trouble to youand to others perhaps think of that captain lingard thats all ive got to say now i must go back on shore theres lots of work we will begin loading this schooner tomorrow morning first thing all the bundles are ready if you should want me for anything hoist some kind of flag on the mainmast at night two shots will fetch me then he added in a friendly tone wont you come and dine in the house tonight it cant be good for you to stew on board like that day after day  lingard did not answer the image evoked by almayer the picture of willems ranging over the islands and disturbing the harmony of the universe by robbery treachery and violence held him silent entrancedpainfully spellbound almayer after waiting for a little while moved reluctantly towards the gangway lingered there then sighed and got over the side going down step by step his head disappeared slowly below the rail lingard who had been staring at him absently started suddenly ran to the side and looking over called out  hey kaspar hold on a bit  almayer signed to his boatmen to cease paddling and turned his head towards the schooner the boat drifted back slowly abreast of lingard nearly alongside  look here said lingard looking downi want a good canoe with four men today  do you want it now asked almayer  no catch this rope oh you clumsy devil    no kaspar went on lingard after the bowman had got hold of the end of the brace he had thrown down into the canoeno kaspar the sun is too much for me and it would be better to keep my affairs quiet too send the canoefour good paddlers mind and your canvas chair for me to sit in send it about sunset dye hear  all right father said almayer cheerfullyi will send ali for a steersman and the best men ive got anything else  no my lad only dont let them be late  i suppose its no use asking you where you are going said almayer tentatively because if it is to see abdulla i     i am not going to see abdulla not today now be off with you  he watched the canoe dart away shorewards waved his hand in response to almayers nod and walked to the taffrail smoothing out abdullas letter which he had pulled out of his pocket he read it over carefully crumpled it up slowly smiling the while and closing his fingers firmly over the crackling paper as though he had hold there of abdullas throat halfway to his pocket he changed his mind and flinging the ball overboard looked at it thoughtfully as it spun round in the eddies for a moment before the current bore it away downstream towards the sea     part iv   chapter one  the night was very dark for the first time in many months the east coast slept unseen by the stars under a veil of motionless cloud that driven before the first breath of the rainy monsoon had drifted slowly from the eastward all the afternoon pursuing the declining sun with its masses of black and grey that seemed to chase the light with wicked intent and with an ominous and gloomy steadiness as though conscious of the message of violence and turmoil they carried at the suns disappearance below the western horizon the immense cloud in quickened motion grappled with the glow of retreating light and rolling down to the clear and jagged outline of the distant mountains hung arrested above the steaming forests hanging low silent and menacing over the unstirring treetops withholding the blessing of rain nursing the wrath of its thunder undecidedas if brooding over its own power for good or for evil  babalatchi coming out of the red and smoky light of his little bamboo house glanced upwards drew in a long breath of the warm and stagnant air and stood for a moment with his good eye closed tightly as if intimidated by the unwonted and deep silence of lakambas courtyard when he opened his eye he had recovered his sight so far that he could distinguish the various degrees of formless blackness which marked the places of trees of abandoned houses of riverside bushes on the dark background of the night  the careworn sage walked cautiously down the deserted courtyard to the waterside and stood on the bank listening to the voice of the invisible river that flowed at his feet listening to the soft whispers to the deep murmurs to the sudden gurgles and the short hisses of the swift current racing along the bank through the hot darkness  he stood with his face turned to the river and it seemed to him that he could breathe easier with the knowledge of the clear vast space before him then after a while he leaned heavily forward on his staff his chin fell on his breast and a deep sigh was his answer to the selfish discourse of the river that hurried on unceasing and fast regardless of joy or sorrow of suffering and of strife of failures and triumphs that lived on its banks the brown water was there ready to carry friends or enemies to nurse love or hate on its submissive and heartless bosom to help or to hinder to save life or give death the great and rapid river a deliverance a prison a refuge or a grave  perchance such thoughts as these caused babalatchi to send another mournful sigh into the trailing mists of the unconcerned pantai the barbarous politician had forgotten the recent success of his plottings in the melancholy contemplation of a sorrow that made the night blacker the clammy heat more oppressive the still air more heavy the dumb solitude more significant of torment than of peace he had spent the night before by the side of the dying omar and now after twentyfour hours his memory persisted in returning to that low and sombre reed hut from which the fierce spirit of the incomparably accomplished pirate took its flight to learn too late in a worse world the error of its earthly ways the mind of the savage statesman chastened by bereavement felt for a moment the weight of his loneliness with keen perception worthy even of a sensibility exasperated by all the refinements of tender sentiment that a glorious civilization brings in its train among other blessings and virtues into this excellent world for the space of about thirty seconds a halfnaked betelchewing pessimist stood upon the bank of the tropical river on the edge of the still and immense forests a man angry powerless emptyhanded with a cry of bitter discontent ready on his lips a cry that had it come out would have rung through the virgin solitudes of the woods as true as great as profound as any philosophical shriek that ever came from the depths of an easychair to disturb the impure wilderness of chimneys and roofs  for half a minute and no more did babalatchi face the gods in the sublime privilege of his revolt and then the oneeyed puller of wires became himself again full of care and wisdom and farreaching plans and a victim to the tormenting superstitions of his race the night no matter how quiet is never perfectly silent to attentive ears and now babalatchi fancied he could detect in it other noises than those caused by the ripples and eddies of the river he turned his head sharply to the right and to the left in succession and then spun round quickly in a startled and watchful manner as if he had expected to see the blind ghost of his departed leader wandering in the obscurity of the empty courtyard behind his back nothing there yet he had heard a noise a strange noise no doubt a ghostly voice of a complaining and angry spirit he listened not a sound reassured babalatchi made a few paces towards his house when a very human noise that of hoarse coughing reached him from the river he stopped listened attentively but now without any sign of emotion and moving briskly back to the waterside stood expectant with parted lips trying to pierce with his eye the wavering curtain of mist that hung low over the water he could see nothing yet some people in a canoe must have been very near for he heard words spoken in an ordinary tone  do you think this is the place ali i can see nothing  it must be near here tuan answered another voice shall we try the bank  no    let drift a little if you go poking into the bank in the dark you might stove the canoe on some log we must be careful    let drift let drift    this does seem to be a clearing of some sort we may see a light by and by from some house or other in lakambas campong there are many houses hey  a great number tuan    i do not see any light  nor i grumbled the first voice again this time nearly abreast of the silent babalatchi who looked uneasily towards his own house the doorway of which glowed with the dim light of a torch burning within the house stood end on to the river and its doorway faced downstream so babalatchi reasoned rapidly that the strangers on the river could not see the light from the position their boat was in at the moment he could not make up his mind to call out to them and while he hesitated he heard the voices again but now some way below the landingplace where he stood  nothing this cannot be it let them give way ali dayong there  that order was followed by the splash of paddles then a sudden cry  i see a light i see it now i know where to land tuan  there was more splashing as the canoe was paddled sharply round and came back upstream close to the bank  call out said very near a deep voice which babalatchi felt sure must belong to a white man call outand somebody may come with a torch i cant see anything  the loud hail that succeeded these words was emitted nearly under the silent listeners nose babalatchi to preserve appearances ran with long but noiseless strides halfway up the courtyard and only then shouted in answer and kept on shouting as he walked slowly back again towards the river bank he saw there an indistinct shape of a boat not quite alongside the landingplace  who speaks on the river asked babalatchi throwing a tone of surprise into his question  a white man answered lingard from the canoe is there not one torch in rich lakambas campong to light a guest on his landing  there are no torches and no men i am alone here said babalatchi with some hesitation  alone exclaimed lingard who are you  only a servant of lakamba but land tuan putih and see my face here is my hand no here    by your mercy    ada    now you are safe  and you are alone here said lingard moving with precaution a few steps into the courtyard how dark it is he muttered to himselfone would think the world had been painted black  yes alone what more did you say tuan i did not understand your talk  it is nothing i expected to find here    but where are they all  what matters where they are said babalatchi gloomily have you come to see my people the last departed on a long journeyand i am alone tomorrow i go too  i came to see a white man said lingard walking on slowly he is not gone is he  no answered babalatchi at his elbow a man with a red skin and hard eyes he went on musingly whose hand is strong and whose heart is foolish and weak a white man indeed    but still a man  they were now at the foot of the short ladder which led to the splitbamboo platform surrounding babalatchis habitation the faint light from the doorway fell down upon the two mens faces as they stood looking at each other curiously  is he there asked lingard in a low voice with a wave of his hand upwards  babalatchi staring hard at his longexpected visitor did not answer at once no not there he said at last placing his foot on the lowest rung and looking back not there tuanyet not very far will you sit down in my dwelling there may be rice and fish and clear waternot from the river but from a spring     i am not hungry interrupted lingard curtly and i did not come here to sit in your dwelling lead me to the white man who expects me i have no time to lose  the night is long tuan went on babalatchi softly and there are other nights and other days long very long    how much time it takes for a man to die o rajah laut  lingard started  you know me he exclaimed  aywa i have seen your face and felt your hand beforemany years ago said babalatchi holding on halfway up the ladder and bending down from above to peer into lingards upturned face you do not rememberbut i have not forgotten there are many men like me there is only one rajah laut  he climbed with sudden agility the last few steps and stood on the platform waving his hand invitingly to lingard who followed after a short moment of indecision  the elastic bamboo floor of the hut bent under the heavy weight of the old seaman who standing within the threshold tried to look into the smoky gloom of the low dwelling under the torch thrust into the cleft of a stick fastened at a right angle to the middle stay of the ridge pole lay a red patch of light showing a few shabby mats and a corner of a big wooden chest the rest of which was lost in shadow in the obscurity of the more remote parts of the house a lancehead a brass tray hung on the wall the long barrel of a gun leaning against the chest caught the stray rays of the smoky illumination in trembling gleams that wavered disappeared reappeared went out came backas if engaged in a doubtful struggle with the darkness that lying in wait in distant corners seemed to dart out viciously towards its feeble enemy the vast space under the high pitch of the roof was filled with a thick cloud of smoke whose undersidelevel like a ceilingreflected the light of the swaying dull flame while at the top it oozed out through the imperfect thatch of dried palm leaves an indescribable and complicated smell made up of the exhalation of damp earth below of the taint of dried fish and of the effluvia of rotting vegetable matter pervaded the place and caused lingard to sniff strongly as he strode over sat on the chest and leaning his elbows on his knees took his head between his hands and stared at the doorway thoughtfully  babalatchi moved about in the shadows whispering to an indistinct form or two that flitted about at the far end of the hut without stirring lingard glanced sideways and caught sight of muffledup human shapes that hovered for a moment near the edge of light and retreated suddenly back into the darkness babalatchi approached and sat at lingards feet on a rolledup bundle of mats  will you eat rice and drink sagueir he said i have waked up my household  my friend said lingard without looking at him when i come to see lakamba or any of lakambas servants i am never hungry and never thirsty tau savee never do you think i am devoid of reason that there is nothing there  he sat up and fixing abruptly his eyes on babalatchi tapped his own forehead significantly  tse tse tse how can you talk like that tuan exclaimed babalatchi in a horrified tone  i talk as i think i have lived many years said lingard stretching his arm negligently to take up the gun which he began to examine knowingly cocking it and easing down the hammer several times this is good mataram make old too he went on  hai broke in babalatchi eagerly i got it when i was young he was an aru trader a man with a big stomach and a loud voice and bravevery brave when we came up with his prau in the grey morning he stood aft shouting to his men and fired this gun at us once only once    he paused laughed softly and went on in a low dreamy voice in the grey morning we came up forty silent men in a swift sulu prau and when the sun was so highhere he held up his hands about three feet apartwhen the sun was only so high tuan our work was doneand there was a feast ready for the fishes of the sea  aye aye muttered lingard nodding his head slowly i see you should not let it get rusty like this he added  he let the gun fall between his knees and moving back on his seat leaned his head against the wall of the hut crossing his arms on his breast  a good gun went on babalatchi carry far and true better than thisthere  with the tips of his fingers he touched gently the butt of a revolver peeping out of the right pocket of lingards white jacket  take your hand off that said lingard sharply but in a goodhumoured tone and without making the slightest movement  babalatchi smiled and hitched his seat a little further off  for some time they sat in silence lingard with his head tilted back looked downwards with lowered eyelids at babalatchi who was tracing invisible lines with his finger on the mat between his feet outside they could hear ali and the other boatmen chattering and laughing round the fire they had lighted in the big and deserted courtyard  well what about that white man said lingard quietly  it seemed as if babalatchi had not heard the question he went on tracing elaborate patterns on the floor for a good while lingard waited motionless at last the malay lifted his head  hai the white man i know he murmured absently this white man or another    tuan he said aloud with unexpected animation you are a man of the sea  you know me why ask said lingard in a low tone  yes a man of the seaeven as we are a true orang laut went on babalatchi thoughtfully not like the rest of the white men  i am like other whites and do not wish to speak many words when the truth is short i came here to see the white man that helped lakamba against patalolo who is my friend show me where that white man lives i want him to hear my talk  talk only tuan why hurry the night is long and death is swiftas you ought to know you who have dealt it to so many of my people many years ago i have faced you arms in hand do you not remember it was in carimatafar from here  i cannot remember every vagabond that came in my way protested lingard seriously  hai hai continued babalatchi unmoved and dreamy many years ago then all thisand looking up suddenly at lingards beard he flourished his fingers below his own beardless chinthen all this was like gold in sunlight now it is like the foam of an angry sea  maybe maybe said lingard patiently paying the involuntary tribute of a faint sigh to the memories of the past evoked by babalatchis words  he had been living with malays so long and so close that the extreme deliberation and deviousness of their mental proceedings had ceased to irritate him much tonight perhaps he was less prone to impatience than ever he was disposed if not to listen to babalatchi then to let him talk it was evident to him that the man had something to say and he hoped that from the talk a ray of light would shoot through the thick blackness of inexplicable treachery to show him clearlyif only for a secondthe man upon whom he would have to execute the verdict of justice justice only nothing was further from his thoughts than such an useless thing as revenge justice only it was his duty that justice should be doneand by his own hand he did not like to think how to him as to babalatchi it seemed that the night would be long enough for the work he had to do but he did not define to himself the nature of the work and he sat very still and willingly dilatory under the fearsome oppression of his call what was the good to think about it it was inevitable and its time was near yet he could not command his memories that came crowding round him in that evilsmelling hut while babalatchi talked on in a flowing monotone nothing of him moving but the lips in the artificially inanimated face lingard like an anchored ship that had broken her sheer darted about here and there on the rapid tide of his recollections the subdued sound of soft words rang around him but his thoughts were lost now in the contemplation of the past sweetness and strife of carimata days now in the uneasy wonder at the failure of his judgment at the fatal blindness of accident that had caused him many years ago to rescue a halfstarved runaway from a dutch ship in samarang roads how he had liked the man his assurance his push his desire to get on his conceited goodhumour and his selfish eloquence he had liked his very faultsthose faults that had so many to him sympathetic sides  and he had always dealt fairly by him from the very beginning and he would deal fairly by him nowto the very end this last thought darkened lingards features with a responsive and menacing frown the doer of justice sat with compressed lips and a heavy heart while in the calm darkness outside the silent world seemed to be waiting breathlessly for that justice he held in his handin his strong handready to strikereluctant to move    chapter two  babalatchi ceased speaking lingard shifted his feet a little uncrossed his arms and shook his head slowly the narrative of the events in sambir related from the point of view of the astute statesman the sense of which had been caught here and there by his inattentive ears had been yet like a thread to guide him out of the sombre labyrinth of his thoughts and now he had come to the end of it out of the tangled past into the pressing necessities of the present with the palms of his hands on his knees his elbows squared out he looked down on babalatchi who sat in a stiff attitude inexpressive and mute as a talking doll the mechanism of which had at length run down  you people did all this said lingard at last and you will be sorry for it before the dry wind begins to blow again abdullas voice will bring the dutch rule here  babalatchi waved his hand towards the dark doorway  there are forests there lakamba rules the land now tell me tuan do you think the big trees know the name of the ruler no they are born they grow they live and they dieyet know not feel not it is their land  even a big tree may be killed by a small axe said lingard drily and remember my oneeyed friend that axes are made by white hands you will soon find that out since you have hoisted the flag of the dutch  aywa said babalatchi slowly it is written that the earth belongs to those who have fair skins and hard but foolish hearts the farther away is the master the easier it is for the slave tuan you were too near your voice rang in our ears always now it is not going to be so the great rajah in batavia is strong but he may be deceived he must speak very loud to be heard here but if we have need to shout then he must hear the many voices that call for protection he is but a white man  if i ever spoke to patalolo like an elder brother it was for your goodfor the good of all said lingard with great earnestness  this is a white mans talk exclaimed babalatchi with bitter exultation i know you that is how you all talk while you load your guns and sharpen your swords and when you are ready then to those who are weak you say obey me and be happy or die you are strange you white men you think it is only your wisdom and your virtue and your happiness that are true you are stronger than the wild beasts but not so wise a black tiger knows when he is not hungryyou do not he knows the difference between himself and those that can speak you do not understand the difference between yourselves and uswho are men you are wise and greatand you shall always be fools  he threw up both his hands stirring the sleeping cloud of smoke that hung above his head and brought the open palms on the flimsy floor on each side of his outstretched legs the whole hut shook lingard looked at the excited statesman curiously  apa apa whats the matter he murmured soothingly whom did i kill here where are my guns what have i done what have i eaten up  babalatchi calmed down and spoke with studied courtesy  you tuan are of the sea and more like what we are therefore i speak to you all the words that are in my heart    only once has the sea been stronger than the rajah of the sea  you know it do you said lingard with pained sharpness  hai we have heard about your shipand some rejoiced not i amongst the whites who are devils you are a man  trima kassi i give you thanks said lingard gravely  babalatchi looked down with a bashful smile but his face became saddened directly and when he spoke again it was in a mournful tone  had you come a day sooner tuan you would have seen an enemy die you would have seen him die poor blind unhappywith no son to dig his grave and speak of his wisdom and courage yes you would have seen the man that fought you in carimata many years ago die alonebut for one friend a great sight to you  not to me answered lingard i did not even remember him till you spoke his name just now you do not understand us we fight we vanquishand we forget  true true said babalatchi with polite irony you whites are so great that you disdain to remember your enemies no no he went on in the same tone you have so much mercy for us that there is no room for any remembrance oh you are great and good but it is in my mind that amongst yourselves you know how to remember is it not so tuan  lingard said nothing his shoulders moved imperceptibly he laid his gun across his knees and stared at the flint lock absently  yes went on babalatchi falling again into a mournful mood yes he died in darkness i sat by his side and held his hand but he could not see the face of him who watched the faint breath on his lips she whom he had cursed because of the white man was there too and wept with covered face the white man walked about the courtyard making many noises now and then he would come to the doorway and glare at us who mourned he stared with wicked eyes and then i was glad that he who was dying was blind this is true talk i was glad for a white mans eyes are not good to see when the devil that lives within is looking out through them  devil hey said lingard half aloud to himself as if struck with the obviousness of some novel idea babalatchi went on  at the first hour of the morning he sat uphe so weakand said plainly some words that were not meant for human ears i held his hand tightly but it was time for the leader of brave men to go amongst the faithful who are happy they of my household brought a white sheet and i began to dig a grave in the hut in which he died she mourned aloud the white man came to the doorway and shouted he was angry angry with her because she beat her breast and tore her hair and mourned with shrill cries as a woman should do you understand what i say tuan that white man came inside the hut with great fury and took her by the shoulder and dragged her out yes tuan i saw omar dead and i saw her at the feet of that white dog who has deceived me i saw his face grey like the cold mist of the morning i saw his pale eyes looking down at omars daughter beating her head on the ground at his feet at the feet of him who is abdullas slave yes he lives by abdullas will that is why i held my hand while i saw all this i held my hand because we are now under the flag of the orang blanda and abdulla can speak into the ears of the great we must not have any trouble with white men abdulla has spokenand i must obey  thats it is it growled lingard in his moustache then in malay it seems that you are angry o babalatchi  no i am not angry tuan answered babalatchi descending from the insecure heights of his indignation into the insincere depths of safe humility i am not angry what am i to be angry i am only an orang laut and i have fled before your people many times servant of this oneprotected of another i have given my counsel here and there for a handful of rice what am i to be angry with a white man what is anger without the power to strike but you whites have taken all the land the sea and the power to strike and there is nothing left for us in the islands but your white mens justice your great justice that knows not anger  he got up and stood for a moment in the doorway sniffing the hot air of the courtyard then turned back and leaned against the stay of the ridge pole facing lingard who kept his seat on the chest the torch consumed nearly to the end burned noisily small explosions took place in the heart of the flame driving through its smoky blaze strings of hard round puffs of white smoke no bigger than peas which rolled out of doors in the faint draught that came from invisible cracks of the bamboo walls the pungent taint of unclean things below and about the hut grew heavier weighing down lingards resolution and his thoughts in an irresistible numbness of the brain he thought drowsily of himself and of that man who wanted to see himwho waited to see him who waited night and day waited    a spiteful but vaporous idea floated through his brain that such waiting could not be very pleasant to the fellow well let him wait he would see him soon enough and for how long five secondsfive minutessay nothingsay something what no just give him time to take one good look and then     suddenly babalatchi began to speak in a soft voice lingard blinked cleared his throatsat up straight  you know all now tuan lakamba dwells in the stockaded house of patalolo abdulla has begun to build godowns of plank and stone and now that omar is dead i myself shall depart from this place and live with lakamba and speak in his ear i have served many the best of them all sleeps in the ground in a white sheet with nothing to mark his grave but the ashes of the hut in which he died yes tuan the white man destroyed it himself with a blazing brand in his hand he strode around shouting to me to come outshouting to me who was throwing earth on the body of a great leader yes swearing to me by the name of your god and ours that he would burn me and her in there if we did not make haste    hai the white men are very masterful and wise i dragged her out quickly  oh damn it exclaimed lingardthen went on in malay speaking earnestly listen that man is not like other white men you know he is not he is not a man at all he is    i dont know  babalatchi lifted his hand deprecatingly his eye twinkled and his redstained big lips parted by an expressionless grin uncovered a stumpy row of black teeth filed evenly to the gums  hai hai not like you not like you he said increasing the softness of his tones as he neared the object uppermost in his mind during that muchdesired interview not like you tuan who are like ourselves only wiser and stronger yet he also is full of great cunning and speaks of you without any respect after the manner of white men when they talk of one another  lingard leaped in his seat as if he had been prodded  he speaks what does he say he shouted  nay tuan protested the composed babalatchi what matters his talk if he is not a man i am nothing before youwhy should i repeat words of one white man about another he did boast to abdulla of having learned much from your wisdom in years past other words i have forgotten indeed tuan i have     lingard cut short babalatchis protestations by a contemptuous wave of the hand and reseated himself with dignity  i shall go said babalatchi and the white man will remain here alone with the spirit of the dead and with her who has been the delight of his heart he being white cannot hear the voice of those that died    tell me tuan he went on looking at lingard with curiositytell me tuan do you white people ever hear the voices of the invisible ones  we do not answered lingard because those that we cannot see do not speak  never speak and never complain with sounds that are not words exclaimed babalatchi doubtingly it may be soor your ears are dull we malays hear many sounds near the places where men are buried tonight i heard    yes even i have heard    i do not want to hear any more he added nervously perhaps i was wrong when i    there are things i regret the trouble was heavy in his heart when he died sometimes i think i was wrong    but i do not want to hear the complaint of invisible lips therefore i go tuan let the unquiet spirit speak to his enemy the white man who knows not fear or love or mercyknows nothing but contempt and violence i have been wrong i have hai hai  he stood for awhile with his elbow in the palm of his left hand the fingers of the other over his lips as if to stifle the expression of inconvenient remorse then after glancing at the torch burnt out nearly to its end he moved towards the wall by the chest fumbled about there and suddenly flung open a large shutter of attaps woven in a light framework of sticks lingard swung his legs quickly round the corner of his seat  hallo he said surprised  the cloud of smoke stirred and a slow wisp curled out through the new opening the torch flickered hissed and went out the glowing end falling on the mat whence babalatchi snatched it up and tossed it outside through the open square it described a vanishing curve of red light and lay below shining feebly in the vast darkness babalatchi remained with his arm stretched out into the empty night  there he said you can see the white mans courtyard tuan and his house  i can see nothing answered lingard putting his head through the shutterhole its too dark  wait tuan urged babalatchi you have been looking long at the burning torch you will soon see mind the gun tuan it is loaded  there is no flint in it you could not find a firestone for a hundred miles round this spot said lingard testily foolish thing to load that gun  i have a stone i had it from a man wise and pious that lives in menang kabau a very pious manvery good fire he spoke words over that stone that make its sparks good and the gun is goodcarries straight and far would carry from here to the door of the white mans house i believe tuan  tida apa never mind your gun muttered lingard peering into the formless darkness is that the housethat black thing over there he asked  yes answered babalatchi that is his house he lives there by the will of abdulla and shall live there till    from where you stand tuan you can look over the fence and across the courtyard straight at the doorat the door from which he comes out every morning looking like a man that had seen jehannum in his sleep  lingard drew his head in babalatchi touched his shoulder with a groping hand  wait a little tuan sit still the morning is not far off nowa morning without sun after a night without stars but there will be light enough to see the man who said not many days ago that he alone has made you less than a child in sambir  he felt a slight tremor under his hand but took it off directly and began feeling all over the lid of the chest behind lingards back for the gun  what are you at said lingard impatiently you do worry about that rotten gun you had better get a light  a light i tell you tuan that the light of heaven is very near said babalatchi who had now obtained possession of the object of his solicitude and grasping it strongly by its long barrel grounded the stock at his feet  perhaps it is near said lingard leaning both his elbows on the lower crosspiece of the primitive window and looking out it is very black outside yet he remarked carelessly  babalatchi fidgeted about  it is not good for you to sit where you may be seen he muttered  why not asked lingard  the white man sleeps it is true explained babalatchi softly yet he may come out early and he has arms  ah he has arms said lingard  yes a short gun that fires many timeslike yours here abdulla had to give it to him  lingard heard babalatchis words but made no movement to the old adventurer the idea that fire arms could be dangerous in other hands than his own did not occur readily and certainly not in connection with willems he was so busy with the thoughts about what he considered his own sacred duty that he could not give any consideration to the probable actions of the man of whom he thoughtas one may think of an executed criminalwith wondering indignation tempered by scornful pity while he sat staring into the darkness that every minute grew thinner before his pensive eyes like a dispersing mist willems appeared to him as a figure belonging already wholly to the pasta figure that could come in no way into his life again he had made up his mind and the thing was as well as done in his weary thoughts he had closed this fatal inexplicable and horrible episode in his life the worst had happened the coming days would see the retribution  he had removed an enemy once or twice before out of his path he had paid off some very heavy scores a good many times captain tom had been a good friend to many but it was generally understood from honolulu round about to diego suarez that captain toms enmity was rather more than any man singlehanded could easily manage he would not as he said often hurt a fly as long as the fly left him alone yet a man does not live for years beyond the pale of civilized laws without evolving for himself some queer notions of justice nobody of those he knew had ever cared to point out to him the errors of his conceptions  it was not worth anybodys while to run counter to lingards ideas of the fitness of thingsthat fact was acquired to the floating wisdom of the south seas of the eastern archipelago and was nowhere better understood than in outoftheway nooks of the world in those nooks which he filled unresisted and masterful with the echoes of his noisy presence there is not much use in arguing with a man who boasts of never having regretted a single action of his life whose answer to a mild criticism is a goodnatured shoutyou know nothing about it i would do it again yes sir his associates and his acquaintances accepted him his opinions his actions like things preordained and unchangeable looked upon his manysided manifestations with passive wonder not unmixed with that admiration which is only the rightful due of a successful man but nobody had ever seen him in the mood he was in now nobody had seen lingard doubtful and giving way to doubt unable to make up his mind and unwilling to act lingard timid and hesitating one minute angry yet inactive the next lingard puzzled in a word because confronted with a situation that discomposed him by its unprovoked malevolence by its ghastly injustice that to his rough but unsophisticated palate tasted distinctly of sulphurous fumes from the deepest hell  the smooth darkness filling the shutterhole grew paler and became blotchy with illdefined shapes as if a new universe was being evolved out of sombre chaos then outlines came out defining forms without any details indicating here a tree there a bush a black belt of forest far off the straight lines of a house the ridge of a high roof near by inside the hut babalatchi who lately had been only a persuasive voice became a human shape leaning its chin imprudently on the muzzle of a gun and rolling an uneasy eye over the reappearing world the day came rapidly dismal and oppressed by the fog of the river and by the heavy vapours of the skya day without colour and without sunshine incomplete disappointing and sad  babalatchi twitched gently lingards sleeve and when the old seaman had lifted up his head interrogatively he stretched out an arm and a pointing forefinger towards willems house now plainly visible to the right and beyond the big tree of the courtyard  look tuan he said he lives there that is the doorhis door through it he will appear soon with his hair in disorder and his mouth full of curses that is so he is a white man and never satisfied it is in my mind he is angry even in his sleep a dangerous man as tuan may observe he went on obsequiously his door faces this opening where you condescend to sit which is concealed from all eyes faces itstraightand not far observe tuan not at all far  yes yes i can see i shall see him when he wakes  no doubt tuan when he wakes    if you remain here he can not see you i shall withdraw quickly and prepare my canoe myself i am only a poor man and must go to sambir to greet lakamba when he opens his eyes i must bow before abdulla who has strengtheven more strength than you now if you remain here you shall easily behold the man who boasted to abdulla that he had been your friend even while he prepared to fight those who called you protector yes he plotted with abdulla for that cursed flag lakamba was blind then and i was deceived but you tuan remember he deceived you more of that he boasted before all men  he leaned the gun quietly against the wall close to the window and said softly shall i go now tuan be careful of the gun i have put the firestone in the firestone of the wise man which never fails  lingards eyes were fastened on the distant doorway across his line of sight in the grey emptiness of the courtyard a big fruitpigeon flapped languidly towards the forests with a loud booming cry like the note of a deep gong a brilliant bird looking in the gloom of threatening day as black as a crow a serried flock of white rice birds rose above the trees with a faint scream and hovered swaying in a disordered mass that suddenly scattered in all directions as if burst asunder by a silent explosion behind his back lingard heard a shuffle of feetwomen leaving the hut in the other courtyard a voice was heard complaining of cold and coming very feeble but exceedingly distinct out of the vast silence of the abandoned houses and clearings babalatchi coughed discreetly from under the house the thumping of wooden pestles husking the rice started with unexpected abruptness the weak but clear voice in the yard again urged blow up the embers o brother another voice answered drawling in modulated thin singsong do it yourself o shivering pig and the drawl of the last words stopped short as if the man had fallen into a deep hole babalatchi coughed again a little impatiently and said in a confidential tone  do you think it is time for me to go tuan will you take care of my gun tuan i am a man that knows how to obey even obey abdulla who has deceived me nevertheless this gun carries far and trueif you would want to know tuan and i have put in a double measure of powder and three slugs yes tuan nowperhapsi go  when babalatchi commenced speaking lingard turned slowly round and gazed upon him with the dull and unwilling look of a sick man waking to another day of suffering as the astute statesman proceeded lingards eyebrows came close his eyes became animated and a big vein stood out on his forehead accentuating a lowering frown when speaking his last words babalatchi faltered then stopped confused before the steady gaze of the old seaman  lingard rose his face cleared and he looked down at the anxious babalatchi with sudden benevolence  so thats what you were after he said laying a heavy hand on babalatchis yielding shoulder you thought i came here to murder him hey speak you faithful dog of an arab trader  and what else tuan shrieked babalatchi exasperated into sincerity what else tuan remember what he has done he poisoned our ears with his talk about you you are a man if you did not come to kill tuan then either i am a fool or     he paused struck his naked breast with his open palm and finished in a discouraged whisperor tuan you are  lingard looked down at him with scornful serenity after his long and painful gropings amongst the obscure abominations of willems conduct the logical if tortuous evolutions of babalatchis diplomatic mind were to him welcome as daylight there was something at last he could understandthe clear effect of a simple cause he felt indulgent towards the disappointed sage  so you are angry with your friend o oneeyed one he said slowly nodding his fierce countenance close to babalatchis discomfited face it seems to me that you must have had much to do with what happened in sambir lately hey you son of a burnt father  may i perish under your hand o rajah of the sea if my words are not true said babalatchi with reckless excitement you are here in the midst of your enemies he the greatest abdulla would do nothing without him and i could do nothing without abdulla strike meso that you strike all  who are you exclaimed lingard contemptuouslywho are you to dare call yourself my enemy dirt nothing go out first he went on severely lakas quick march out  he pushed babalatchi through the doorway and followed him down the short ladder into the courtyard the boatmen squatting over the fire turned their slow eyes with apparent difficulty towards the two men then unconcerned huddled close together again stretching forlornly their hands over the embers the women stopped in their work and with uplifted pestles flashed quick and curious glances from the gloom under the house  is that the way asked lingard with a nod towards the little wicketgate of willems enclosure  if you seek death that is surely the way answered babalatchi in a dispassionate voice as if he had exhausted all the emotions he lives there he who destroyed your friends who hastened omars death who plotted with abdulla first against you then against me i have been like a child o shame    but go tuan go there  i go where i like said lingard emphatically and you may go to the devil i do not want you any more the islands of these seas shall sink before i rajah laut serve the will of any of your people tau but i tell you this i do not care what you do with him after today and i say that because i am merciful  tida i do nothing said babalatchi shaking his head with bitter apathy i am in abdullas hand and care not even as you do no no he added turning away i have learned much wisdom this morning there are no men anywhere you whites are cruel to your friends and merciful to your enemieswhich is the work of fools  he went away towards the riverside and without once looking back disappeared in the low bank of mist that lay over the water and the shore lingard followed him with his eyes thoughtfully after awhile he roused himself and called out to his boatmen  haiya there after you have eaten rice wait for me with your paddles in your hands you hear  ada tuan answered ali through the smoke of the morning fire that was spreading itself low and gentle over the courtyardwe hear  lingard opened slowly the little wicketgate made a few steps into the empty enclosure and stopped he had felt about his head the short breath of a puff of wind that passed him made every leaf of the big tree shiverand died out in a hardly perceptible tremor of branches and twigs instinctively he glanced upwards with a seamans impulse above him under the grey motionless waste of a stormy sky drifted low black vapours in stretching bars in shapeless patches in sinuous wisps and tormented spirals over the courtyard and the house floated a round sombre and lingering cloud dragging behind a tail of tangled and filmy streamerslike the dishevelled hair of a mourning woman    chapter three   beware  the tremulous effort and the broken inadequate tone of the faint cry surprised lingard more than the unexpected suddenness of the warning conveyed he did not know by whom and to whom besides himself there was no one in the courtyard as far as he could see  the cry was not renewed and his watchful eyes scanning warily the misty solitude of willems enclosure were met everywhere only by the stolid impassiveness of inanimate things the big sombrelooking tree the shutup sightless house the glistening bamboo fences the damp and drooping bushes further offall these things that condemned to look for ever at the incomprehensible afflictions or joys of mankind assert in their aspect of cold unconcern the high dignity of lifeless matter that surrounds incurious and unmoved the restless mysteries of the everchanging of the neverending life  lingard stepping aside put the trunk of the tree between himself and the house then moving cautiously round one of the projecting buttresses had to tread short in order to avoid scattering a small heap of black embers upon which he came unexpectedly on the other side a thin wizened little old woman who standing behind the tree had been looking at the house turned towards him with a start gazed with faded expressionless eyes at the intruder then made a limping attempt to get away she seemed however to realize directly the hopelessness or the difficulty of the undertaking stopped hesitated tottered back slowly then after blinking dully fell suddenly on her knees amongst the white ashes and bending over the heap of smouldering coals distended her sunken cheeks in a steady effort to blow up the hidden sparks into a useful blaze lingard looked down on her but she seemed to have made up her mind that there was not enough life left in her lean body for anything else than the discharge of the simple domestic duty and apparently she begrudged him the least moment of attention  after waiting for awhile lingard asked  why did you call o daughter  i saw you enter she croaked feebly still grovelling with her face near the ashes and without looking up and i calledthe cry of warning it was her order her order she repeated with a moaning sigh  and did she hear pursued lingard with gentle composure  her projecting shoulderblades moved uneasily under the thin stuff of the tight body jacket she scrambled up with difficulty to her feet and hobbled away muttering peevishly to herself towards a pile of dry brushwood heaped up against the fence  lingard looking idly after her heard the rattle of loose planks that led from the ground to the door of the house he moved his head beyond the shelter of the tree and saw aissa coming down the inclined way into the courtyard after making a few hurried paces towards the tree she stopped with one foot advanced in an appearance of sudden terror and her eyes glanced wildly right and left her head was uncovered a blue cloth wrapped her from her head to foot in close slanting folds with one end thrown over her shoulder a tress of her black hair strayed across her bosom her bare arms pressed down close to her body with hands open and outstretched fingers her slightly elevated shoulders and the backward inclination of her torso gave her the aspect of one defiant yet shrinking from a coming blow she had closed the door of the house behind her and as she stood solitary in the unnatural and threatening twilight of the murky day with everything unchanged around her she appeared to lingard as if she had been made there on the spot out of the black vapours of the sky and of the sinister gleams of feeble sunshine that struggled through the thickening clouds into the colourless desolation of the world  after a short but attentive glance towards the shutup house lingard stepped out from behind the tree and advanced slowly towards her the sudden fixity of hertill thenrestless eyes and a slight twitch of her hands were the only signs she gave at first of having seen him she made a long stride forward and putting herself right in his path stretched her arms across her black eyes opened wide her lips parted as if in an uncertain attempt to speakbut no sound came out to break the significant silence of their meeting lingard stopped and looked at her with stern curiosity after a while he said composedly  let me pass i came here to talk to a man does he hide has he sent you  she made a step nearer her arms fell by her side then she put them straight out nearly touching lingards breast  he knows not fear she said speaking low with a forward throw of her head in a voice trembling but distinct it is my own fear that has sent me here he sleeps  he has slept long enough said lingard in measured tones i am comeand now is the time of his waking go and tell him thisor else my own voice will call him up a voice he knows well  he put her hands down firmly and again made as if to pass by her  do not she exclaimed and fell at his feet as if she had been cut down by a scythe the unexpected suddenness of her movement startled lingard who stepped back  whats this he exclaimed in a wondering whisperthen added in a tone of sharp command stand up  she rose at once and stood looking at him timorous and fearless yet with a fire of recklessness burning in her eyes that made clear her resolve to pursue her purpose even to the death lingard went on in a severe voice  go out of my path you are omars daughter and you ought to know that when men meet in daylight women must be silent and abide their fate  women she retorted with subdued vehemence yes i am a woman your eyes see that o rajah laut but can you see my life i also have heardo man of many fightsi also have heard the voice of firearms i also have felt the rain of young twigs and of leaves cut up by bullets fall down about my head i also know how to look in silence at angry faces and at strong hands raised high grasping sharp steel i also saw men fall dead around me without a cry of fear and of mourning and i have watched the sleep of weary fugitives and looked at night shadows full of menace and death with eyes that knew nothing but watchfulness and she went on with a mournful drop in her voice i have faced the heartless sea held on my lap the heads of those who died raving from thirst and from their cold hands took the paddle and worked so that those with me did not know that one man more was dead i did all this what more have you done that was my life what has been yours  the matter and the manner of her speech held lingard motionless attentive and approving against his will she ceased speaking and from her staring black eyes with a narrow border of white above and below a double ray of her very soul streamed out in a fierce desire to light up the most obscure designs of his heart after a long silence which served to emphasize the meaning of her words she added in the whisper of bitter regret  and i have knelt at your feet and i am afraid  you said lingard deliberately and returning her look with an interested gaze you are a woman whose heart i believe is great enough to fill a mans breast but still you are a woman and to you i rajah laut have nothing to say  she listened bending her head in a movement of forced attention and his voice sounded to her unexpected far off with the distant and unearthly ring of voices that we hear in dreams saying faintly things startling cruel or absurd to which there is no possible reply to her he had nothing to say she wrung her hands glanced over the courtyard with that eager and distracted look that sees nothing then looked up at the hopeless sky of livid grey and drifting black at the unquiet mourning of the hot and brilliant heaven that had seen the beginning of her love that had heard his entreaties and her answers that had seen his desire and her fear that had seen her joy her surrenderand his defeat lingard moved a little and this slight stir near her precipitated her disordered and shapeless thoughts into hurried words  wait she exclaimed in a stifled voice and went on disconnectedly and rapidlystay i have heard men often spoke by the fires    men of my people and they said of youthe first on the seathey said that to mens cries you were deaf in battle but after    no even while you fought your ears were open to the voice of children and women they said    that now i a woman i     she broke off suddenly and stood before him with dropped eyelids and parted lips so still now that she seemed to have been changed into a breathless an unhearing an unseeing figure without knowledge of fear or hope of anger or despair in the astounding repose that came on her face nothing moved but the delicate nostrils that expanded and collapsed quickly flutteringly in interrupted beats like the wings of a snared bird  i am white said lingard proudly looking at her with a steady gaze where simple curiosity was giving way to a pitying annoyance and men you have heard spoke only what is true over the evening fires my ears are open to your prayer but listen to me before you speak for yourself you need not be afraid you can come even now with me and you shall find refuge in the household of syed abdullawho is of your own faith and this also you must know nothing that you may say will change my purpose towards the man who is sleepingor hidingin that house  again she gave him the look that was like a stab not of anger but of desire of the intense overpowering desire to see in to see through to understand everything every thought emotion purpose every impulse every hesitation inside that man inside that whiteclad foreign being who looked at her who spoke to her who breathed before her like any other man but bigger redfaced whitehaired and mysterious it was the future clothed in flesh the tomorrow the day after all the days all the years of her life standing there before her alive and secret with all their good or evil shut up within the breast of that man of that man who could be persuaded cajoled entreated perhaps touched worried frightenedwho knowsif only first he could be understood she had seen a long time ago whither events were tending she had noted the contemptuous yet menacing coldness of abdulla she had heardalarmed yet unbelievingbabalatchis gloomy hints covert allusions and veiled suggestions to abandon the useless white man whose fate would be the price of the peace secured by the wise and good who had no need of him any more and hehimself she clung to him there was nobody else nothing else she would try to cling to him alwaysall the life and yet he was far from her further every day every day he seemed more distant and she followed him patiently hopefully blindly but steadily through all the devious wanderings of his mind she followed as well as she could yet at timesvery often latelyshe had felt lost like one strayed in the thickets of tangled undergrowth of a great forest to her the exclerk of old hudig appeared as remote as brilliant as terrible as necessary as the sun that gives life to these lands the sun of unclouded skies that dazzles and withers the sun beneficent and wickedthe giver of light perfume and pestilence she had watched himwatched him close fascinated by love fascinated by danger he was alone nowbut for her and she sawshe thought she sawthat he was like a man afraid of something was it possible he afraid of what was it of that old white man who was comingwho had come possibly she had heard of that man ever since she could remember the bravest were afraid of him and now what was in the mind of this old old man who looked so strong what was he going to do with the light of her life put it out take it away take it away for everfor everand leave her in darknessnot in the stirring whispering expectant night in which the hushed world awaits the return of sunshine but in the night without end the night of the grave where nothing breathes nothing moves nothing thinksthe last darkness of cold and silence without hope of another sunrise  she criedyour purpose you know nothing i must     he interruptedunreasonably excited as if she had by her look inoculated him with some of her own distress  i know enough  she approached and stood facing him at arms length with both her hands on his shoulders and he surprised by that audacity closed and opened his eyes two or three times aware of some emotion arising within him from her words her tone her contact an emotion unknown singular penetrating and sadat the close sight of that strange woman of that being savage and tender strong and delicate fearful and resolute that had got entangled so fatally between their two liveshis own and that other white mans the abominable scoundrel  how can you know she went on in a persuasive tone that seemed to flow out of her very hearthow can you know i live with him all the days all the nights i look at him i see his every breath every glance of his eye every movement of his lips i see nothing else what else is there and even i do not understand i do not understand himhimmy life him who to me is so great that his presence hides the earth and the water from my sight  lingard stood straight with his hands deep in the pockets of his jacket his eyes winked quickly because she spoke very close to his face she disturbed him and he had a sense of the efforts he was making to get hold of her meaning while all the time he could not help telling himself that all this was of no use  she added after a pausethere has been a time when i could understand him when i knew what was in his mind better than he knew it himself when i felt him when i held him    and now he has escaped  escaped what gone away shouted lingard  escaped from me she said left me alone alone and i am ever near him yet alone  her hands slipped slowly off lingards shoulders and her arms fell by her side listless discouraged as if to herto her the savage violent and ignorant creaturehad been revealed clearly in that moment the tremendous fact of our isolation of the loneliness impenetrable and transparent elusive and everlasting of the indestructible loneliness that surrounds envelopes clothes every human soul from the cradle to the grave and perhaps beyond  aye very well i understand his face is turned away from you said lingard now what do you want  i want    i have lookedfor help    everywhere    against men    all men    i do not know first they came the invisible whites and dealt death from afar    then he came he came to me who was alone and sad he came angry with his brothers great amongst his own people angry with those i have not seen with the people where men have no mercy and women have no shame he was of them and great amongst them for he was great  lingard shook his head slightly she frowned at him and went on in disordered haste  listen i saw him i have lived by the side of brave men    of chiefs when he came i was the daughter of a beggarof a blind man without strength and hope he spoke to me as if i had been brighter than the sunshinemore delightful than the cool water of the brook by which we metmore    her anxious eyes saw some shade of expression pass on her listeners face that made her hold her breath for a second and then explode into pained fury so violent that it drove lingard back a pace like an unexpected blast of wind he lifted both his hands incongruously paternal in his venerable aspect bewildered and soothing while she stretched her neck forward and shouted at him  i tell you i was all that to him i know it i saw it    there are times when even you white men speak the truth i saw his eyes i felt his eyes i tell you i saw him tremble when i came nearwhen i spokewhen i touched him look at me you have been young look at me look rajah laut  she stared at lingard with provoking fixity then turning her head quickly she sent over her shoulder a glance full of humble fear at the house that stood high behind her backdark closed rickety and silent on its crooked posts  lingards eyes followed her look and remained gazing expectantly at the house after a minute or so he muttered glancing at her suspiciously  if he has not heard your voice now then he must be far awayor dead  he is there she whispered a little calmed but still anxioushe is there for three days he waited waited for you night and day and i waited with him i waited watching his face his eyes his lips listening to his wordsto the words i could not understandto the words he spoke in daylight to the words he spoke at night in his short sleep i listened he spoke to himself walking up and down hereby the river by the bushes and i followed i wanted to knowand i could not he was tormented by things that made him speak in the words of his own people speak to himselfnot to me not to me what was he saying what was he going to do was he afraid of youof death what was in his heart    fear    or anger    what desire    what sadness he spoke spoke many words all the time and i could not know i wanted to speak to him he was deaf to me i followed him everywhere watching for some word i could understand but his mind was in the land of his peopleaway from me when i touched him he was angryso  she imitated the movement of some one shaking off roughly an importunate hand and looked at lingard with tearful and unsteady eyes  after a short interval of laboured panting as if she had been out of breath with running or fighting she looked down and went on  day after day night after night i lived watching himseeing nothing and my heart was heavyheavy with the presence of death that dwelt amongst us i could not believe i thought he was afraid afraid of you then i myself knew fear    tell me rajah laut do you know the fear without voicethe fear of silencethe fear that comes when there is no one nearwhen there is no battle no cries no angry faces or armed hands anywhere    the fear from which there is no escape  she paused fastened her eyes again on the puzzled lingard and hurried on in a tone of despair  and i knew then he would not fight you beforemany days agoi went away twice to make him obey my desire to make him strike at his own people so that he could be minemine o calamity his hand was false as your white hearts it struck forward pushed by my desireby his desire of me    it struck that strong hand ando shameit killed nobody its fierce and lying blow woke up hate without any fear round me all was lies his strength was a lie my own people lied to me and to him and to meet youyou the greathe had no one but me but me with my rage my pain my weakness only me and to me he would not even speak the fool  she came up close to lingard with the wild and stealthy aspect of a lunatic longing to whisper out an insane secretone of those misshapen heartrending and ludicrous secrets one of those thoughts that like monsterscruel fantastic and mournful wander about terrible and unceasing in the night of madness lingard looked at her astounded but unflinching she spoke in his face very low  he is all everything he is my breath my light my heart    go away    forget him    he has no courage and no wisdom any more    and i have lost my power    go away and forget there are other enemies    leave him to me he had been a man once    you are too great nobody can withstand you    i tried    i know now     i cry for mercy leave him to me and go away  the fragments of her supplicating sentences were as if tossed on the crest of her sobs lingard outwardly impassive with his eyes fixed on the house experienced that feeling of condemnation deepseated persuasive and masterful that illogical impulse of disapproval which is half disgust half vague fear and that wakes up in our hearts in the presence of anything new or unusual of anything that is not run into the mould of our own conscience the accursed feeling made up of disdain of anger and of the sense of superior virtue that leaves us deaf blind contemptuous and stupid before anything which is not like ourselves  he answered not looking at her at first but speaking towards the house that fascinated him  i go away he wanted me to comehe himself did    you must go away you do not know what you are asking for listen go to your own people leave him he is     he paused looked down at her with his steady eyes hesitated as if seeking an adequate expression then snapped his fingers and said  finish  she stepped back her eyes on the ground and pressed her temples with both her hands which she raised to her head in a slow and ample movement full of unconscious tragedy the tone of her words was gentle and vibrating like a loud meditation she said  tell the brook not to run to the river tell the river not to run to the sea speak loud speak angrily maybe they will obey you but it is in my mind that the brook will not care the brook that springs out of the hillside and runs to the great river he would not care for your words he that cares not for the very mountain that gave him life he that tears the earth from which he springs tears it eats it destroys itto hurry faster to the riverto the river in which he is lost for ever    o rajah laut i do not care  she drew close again to lingard approaching slowly reluctantly as if pushed by an invisible hand and added in words that seemed to be torn out of her  i cared not for my own father for him that died i would have rather    you do not know what i have done    i     you shall have his life said lingard hastily  they stood together crossing their glances she suddenly appeased and lingard thoughtful and uneasy under a vague sense of defeat and yet there was no defeat he never intended to kill the fellownot after the first moment of anger a long time ago the days of bitter wonder had killed anger had left only a bitter indignation and a bitter wish for complete justice he felt discontented and surprised unexpectedly he had come upon a human beinga woman at thatwho had made him disclose his will before its time she should have his life but she must be told she must know that for such men as willems there was no favour and no grace  understand he said slowly that i leave him his life not in mercy but in punishment  she started watched every word on his lips and after he finished speaking she remained still and mute in astonished immobility a single big drop of rain a drop enormous pellucid and heavylike a superhuman tear coming straight and rapid from above tearing its way through the sombre skystruck loudly the dry ground between them in a starred splash she wrung her hands in the bewilderment of the new and incomprehensible fear the anguish of her whisper was more piercing than the shrillest cry  what punishment will you take him away then away from me listen to what i have done    it is i who     ah exclaimed lingard who had been looking at the house  dont you believe her captain lingard shouted willems from the doorway where he appeared with swollen eyelids and bared breast he stood for a while his hands grasping the lintels on each side of the door and writhed about glaring wildly as if he had been crucified there then he made a sudden rush head foremost down the plankway that responded with hollow short noises to every footstep  she heard him a slight thrill passed on her face and the words that were on her lips fell back unspoken into her benighted heart fell back amongst the mud the stonesand the flowers that are at the bottom of every heart    chapter four   when he felt the solid ground of the courtyard under his feet willems pulled himself up in his headlong rush and moved forward with a moderate gait he paced stiffly looking with extreme exactitude at lingards face looking neither to the right nor to the left but at the face only as if there was nothing in the world but those features familiar and dreaded that whitehaired rough and severe head upon which he gazed in a fixed effort of his eyes like a man trying to read small print at the full range of human vision as soon as willems feet had left the planks the silence which had been lifted up by the jerky rattle of his footsteps fell down again upon the courtyard the silence of the cloudy sky and of the windless air the sullen silence of the earth oppressed by the aspect of coming turmoil the silence of the world collecting its faculties to withstand the storm through this silence willems pushed his way and stopped about six feet from lingard he stopped simply because he could go no further he had started from the door with the reckless purpose of clapping the old fellow on the shoulder he had no idea that the man would turn out to be so tall so big and so unapproachable it seemed to him that he had never never in his life seen lingard  he tried to say  do not believe     a fit of coughing checked his sentence in a faint splutter directly afterwards he swallowedas it werea couple of pebbles throwing his chin up in the act and lingard who looked at him narrowly saw a bone sharp and triangular like the head of a snake dart up and down twice under the skin of his throat then that too did not move nothing moved  well said lingard and with that word he came unexpectedly to the end of his speech his hand in his pocket closed firmly round the butt of his revolver bulging his jacket on the hip and he thought how soon and how quickly he could terminate his quarrel with that man who had been so anxious to deliver himself into his handsand how inadequate would be that ending he could not bear the idea of that man escaping from him by going out of life escaping from fear from doubt from remorse into the peaceful certitude of death he held him now and he was not going to let him goto let him disappear for ever in the faint blue smoke of a pistol shot his anger grew within him he felt a touch as of a burning hand on his heart not on the flesh of his breast but a touch on his heart itself on the palpitating and untiring particle of matter that responds to every emotion of the soul that leaps with joy with terror or with anger  he drew a long breath he could see before him the bare chest of the man expanding and collapsing under the wideopen jacket he glanced aside and saw the bosom of the woman near him rise and fall in quick respirations that moved slightly up and down her hand which was pressed to her breast with all the fingers spread out and a little curved as if grasping something too big for its span and nearly a minute passed one of those minutes when the voice is silenced while the thoughts flutter in the head like captive birds inside a cage in rushes desperate exhausting and vain  during that minute of silence lingards anger kept rising immense and towering such as a crested wave running over the troubled shallows of the sands its roar filled his cars a roar so powerful and distracting that it seemed to him his head must burst directly with the expanding volume of that sound he looked at that man that infamous figure upright on its feet still rigid with stony eyes as if its rotten soul had departed that moment and the carcass hadnt had the time yet to topple over for the fraction of a second he had the illusion and the fear of the scoundrel having died there before the enraged glance of his eyes willems eyelids fluttered and the unconscious and passing tremor in that stiffly erect body exasperated lingard like a fresh outrage the fellow dared to stir dared to wink to breathe to exist here right before his eyes his grip on the revolver relaxed gradually as the transport of his rage increased so also his contempt for the instruments that pierce or stab that interpose themselves between the hand and the object of hate he wanted another kind of satisfaction naked hands by heaven no firearms hands that could take him by the throat beat down his defence batter his face into shapeless flesh hands that could feel all the desperation of his resistance and overpower it in the violent delight of a contact lingering and furious intimate and brutal  he let go the revolver altogether stood hesitating then throwing his hands out strode forwardand everything passed from his sight he could not see the man the woman the earth the skysaw nothing as if in that one stride he had left the visible world behind to step into a black and deserted space he heard screams round him in that obscurity screams like the melancholy and pitiful cries of seabirds that dwell on the lonely reefs of great oceans then suddenly a face appeared within a few inches of his own his face he felt something in his left hand his throat    ah the thing like a snakes head that darts up and down    he squeezed hard he was back in the world he could see the quick beating of eyelids over a pair of eyes that were all whites the grin of a drawnup lip a row of teeth gleaming through the drooping hair of a moustache    strong white teeth knock them down his lying throat    he drew back his right hand the fist up to the shoulder knuckles out from under his feet rose the screams of seabirds thousands of them something held his legs    what the devil    he delivered his blow straight from the shoulder felt the jar right up his arm and realized suddenly that he was striking something passive and unresisting his heart sank within him with disappointment with rage with mortification he pushed with his left arm opening the hand with haste as if he had just perceived that he got hold by accident of something repulsiveand he watched with stupefied eyes willems tottering backwards in groping strides the white sleeve of his jacket across his face he watched his distance from that man increase while he remained motionless without being able to account to himself for the fact that so much empty space had come in between them it should have been the other way they ought to have been very close and    ah he wouldnt fight he wouldnt resist he wouldnt defend himself a cur evidently a cur    he was amazed and aggrievedprofoundly bitterlywith the immense and blank desolation of a small child robbed of a toy he shoutedunbelieving  will you be a cheat to the end  he waited for some answer he waited anxiously with an impatience that seemed to lift him off his feet he waited for some word some sign for some threatening stir nothing only two unwinking eyes glittered intently at him above the white sleeve he saw the raised arm detach itself from the face and sink along the body a white clad arm with a big stain on the white sleeve a red stain there was a cut on the cheek it bled the nose bled too the blood ran down made one moustache look like a dark rag stuck over the lip and went on in a wet streak down the clipped beard on one side of the chin a drop of blood hung on the end of some hairs that were glued together it hung for a while and took a leap down on the ground many more followed leaping one after another in close file one alighted on the breast and glided down instantly with devious vivacity like a small insect running away it left a narrow dark track on the white skin he looked at it looked at the tiny and active drops looked at what he had done with obscure satisfaction with anger with regret this wasnt much like an act of justice he had a desire to go up nearer to the man to hear him speak to hear him say something atrocious and wicked that would justify the violence of the blow he made an attempt to move and became aware of a close embrace round both his legs just above the ankles instinctively he kicked out with his foot broke through the close bond and felt at once the clasp transferred to his other leg the clasp warm desperate and soft of human arms he looked down bewildered he saw the body of the woman stretched at length flattened on the ground like a dark blue rag she trailed face downwards clinging to his leg with both arms in a tenacious hug he saw the top of her head the long black hair streaming over his foot all over the beaten earth around his boot he couldnt see his foot for it he heard the short and repeated moaning of her breath he imagined the invisible face close to his heel with one kick into that face he could free himself he dared not stir and shouted down  let go let go let go  the only result of his shouting was a tightening of the pressure of her arms with a tremendous effort he tried to bring his right foot up to his left and succeeded partly he heard distinctly the rub of her body on the ground as he jerked her along he tried to disengage himself by drawing up his foot he stamped he heard a voice saying sharply  steady captain lingard steady  his eyes flew back to willems at the sound of that voice and in the quick awakening of sleeping memories lingard stood suddenly still appeased by the clear ring of familiar words appeased as in days of old when they were trading together when willems was his trusted and helpful companion in outoftheway and dangerous places when that fellow who could keep his temper so much better than he could himself had spared him many a difficulty had saved him from many an act of hasty violence by the timely and goodhumoured warning whispered or shouted steady captain lingard steady a smart fellow he had brought him up the smartest fellow in the islands if he had only stayed with him then all this    he called out to willems  tell her to let me go or     he heard willems shouting something waited for awhile then glanced vaguely down and saw the woman still stretched out perfectly mute and unstirring with her head at his feet he felt a nervous impatience that somehow resembled fear  tell her to let go to go away willems i tell you ive had enough of this he cried  all right captain lingard answered the calm voice of willems she has let go take your foot off her hair she cant get up  lingard leaped aside clean away and spun round quickly he saw her sit up and cover her face with both hands then he turned slowly on his heel and looked at the man willems held himself very straight but was unsteady on his feet and moved about nearly on the same spot like a tipsy man attempting to preserve his balance after gazing at him for a while lingard called rancorous and irritable  what have you got to say for yourself  willems began to walk towards him he walked slowly reeling a little before he took each step and lingard saw him put his hand to his face then look at it holding it up to his eyes as if he had there concealed in the hollow of the palm some small object which he wanted to examine secretly suddenly he drew it with a brusque movement down the front of his jacket and left a long smudge  thats a fine thing to do said willems  he stood in front of lingard one of his eyes sunk deep in the increasing swelling of his cheek still repeating mechanically the movement of feeling his damaged face and every time he did this he pressed the palm to some clean spot on his jacket covering the white cotton with bloody imprints as of some deformed and monstrous hand lingard said nothing looking on at last willems left off staunching the blood and stood his arms hanging by his side with his face stiff and distorted under the patches of coagulated blood and he seemed as though he had been set up there for a warning an incomprehensible figure marked all over with some awful and symbolic signs of deadly import speaking with difficulty he repeated in a reproachful tone  that was a fine thing to do  after all answered lingard bitterly i had too good an opinion of you  and i of you dont you see that i could have had that fool over there killed and the whole thing burnt to the ground swept off the face of the earth you wouldnt have found as much as a heap of ashes had i liked i could have done all that and i wouldnt  youcouldnot you dared not you scoundrel cried lingard  whats the use of calling me names  true retorted lingardtheres no name bad enough for you  there was a short interval of silence at the sound of their rapidly exchanged words aissa had got up from the ground where she had been sitting in a sorrowful and dejected pose and approached the two men she stood on one side and looked on eagerly in a desperate effort of her brain with the quick and distracted eyes of a person trying for her life to penetrate the meaning of sentences uttered in a foreign tongue the meaning portentous and fateful that lurks in the sounds of mysterious words in the sounds surprising unknown and strange  willems let the last speech of lingard pass by seemed by a slight movement of his hand to help it on its way to join the other shadows of the past then he said  you have struck me you have insulted me     insulted you interrupted lingard passionately whowhat can insult you    you     he choked advanced a step  steady steady said willems calmly i tell you i shant fight is it clear enough to you that i shant ishallnotliftafinger  as he spoke slowly punctuating each word with a slight jerk of his head he stared at lingard his right eye open and big the left small and nearly closed by the swelling of one half of his face that appeared all drawn out on one side like faces seen in a concave glass and they stood exactly opposite each other one tall slight and disfigured the other tall heavy and severe  willems went on  if i had wanted to hurt youif i had wanted to destroy you it was easy i stood in the doorway long enough to pull a triggerand you know i shoot straight  you would have missed said lingard with assurance there is under heaven such a thing as justice  the sound of that word on his own lips made him pause confused like an unexpected and unanswerable rebuke the anger of his outraged pride the anger of his outraged heart had gone out in the blow and there remained nothing but the sense of some immense infamyof something vague disgusting and terrible which seemed to surround him on all sides hover about him with shadowy and stealthy movements like a band of assassins in the darkness of vast and unsafe places was there under heaven such a thing as justice he looked at the man before him with such an intensity of prolonged glance that he seemed to see right through him that at last he saw but a floating and unsteady mist in human shape would it blow away before the first breath of the breeze and leave nothing behind  the sound of willems voice made him start violently willems was saying  i have always led a virtuous life you know i have you always praised me for my steadiness you know you have you know also i never stoleif thats what youre thinking of i borrowed you know how much i repaid it was an error of judgment but then consider my position there i had been a little unlucky in my private affairs and had debts could i let myself go under before the eyes of all those men who envied me but thats all over it was an error of judgment ive paid for it an error of judgment  lingard astounded into perfect stillness looked down he looked down at willems bare feet then as the other had paused he repeated in a blank tone  an error of judgment     yes drawled out willems thoughtfully and went on with increasing animation as i said i have always led a virtuous life more so than hudigthan you yes than you i drank a little i played cards a little who doesnt but i had principles from a boy yes principles business is business and i never was an ass i never respected fools they had to suffer for their folly when they dealt with me the evil was in them not in me but as to principles its another matter i kept clear of women its forbiddeni had no timeand i despised them now i hate them  he put his tongue out a little a tongue whose pink and moist end ran here and there like something independently alive under his swollen and blackened lip he touched with the tips of his fingers the cut on his cheek felt all round it with precaution and the unharmed side of his face appeared for a moment to be preoccupied and uneasy about the state of that other side which was so very sore and stiff  he recommenced speaking and his voice vibrated as though with repressed emotion of some kind  you ask my wife when you see her in macassar whether i have no reason to hate her she was nobody and i made her mrs willems a halfcaste girl you ask her how she showed her gratitude to me you ask    never mind that well you came and dumped me here like a load of rubbish dumped me here and left me with nothing to donothing good to rememberand damn little to hope for you left me here at the mercy of that fool almayer who suspected me of something of what devil only knows but he suspected and hated me from the first i suppose because you befriended me oh i could read him like a book he isnt very deep your sambir partner captain lingard but he knows how to be disagreeable months passed i thought i would die of sheer weariness of my thoughts of my regrets and then     he made a quick step nearer to lingard and as if moved by the same thought by the same instinct by the impulse of his will aissa also stepped nearer to them they stood in a close group and the two men could feel the calm air between their faces stirred by the light breath of the anxious woman who enveloped them both in the uncomprehending in the despairing and wondering glances of her wild and mournful eyes    chapter five   willems turned a little from her and spoke lower  look at that he said with an almost imperceptible movement of his head towards the woman to whom he was presenting his shoulder look at that dont believe her what has she been saying to you what i have been asleep had to sleep at last ive been waiting for you three days and nights i had to sleep some time hadnt i i told her to remain awake and watch for you and call me at once she did watch you cant believe her you cant believe any woman who can tell whats inside their heads no one you can know nothing the only thing you can know is that it isnt anything like what comes through their lips they live by the side of you they seem to hate you or they seem to love you they caress or torment you they throw you over or stick to you closer than your skin for some inscrutable and awful reason of their ownwhich you can never know look at herand look at me at meher infernal work what has she been saying  his voice had sunk to a whisper lingard listened with great attention holding his chin in his hand which grasped a great handful of his white beard his elbow was in the palm of his other hand and his eyes were still fixed on the ground he murmured without looking up  she begged me for your lifeif you want to knowas if the thing were worth giving or taking  and for three days she begged me to take yours said willems quickly for three days she wouldnt give me any peace she was never still she planned ambushes she has been looking for places all over here where i could hide and drop you with a safe shot as you walked up its true i give you my word  your word muttered lingard contemptuously  willems took no notice  ah she is a ferocious creature he went on you dont know    i wanted to pass the timeto do somethingto have something to think aboutto forget my troubles till you came back and    look at her    she took me as if i did not belong to myself she did i did not know there was something in me she could get hold of she a savage i a civilized european and clever she that knew no more than a wild animal well she found out something in me she found it out and i was lost i knew it she tormented me i was ready to do anything i resistedbut i was ready i knew that too that frightened me more than anything more than my own sufferings and that was frightful enough i assure you  lingard listened fascinated and amazed like a child listening to a fairy tale and when willems stopped for breath he shuffled his feet a little  what does he say cried out aissa suddenly  the two men looked at her quickly and then looked at one another  willems began again speaking hurriedly  i tried to do something take her away from those people i went to almayer the biggest blind fool that you ever    then abdulla cameand she went away she took away with her something of me which i had to get back i had to do it as far as you are concerned the change here had to happen sooner or later you couldnt be master here for ever it isnt what i have done that torments me it is the why its the madness that drove me to it its that thing that came over me that may come again some day  it will do no harm to anybody then i promise you said lingard significantly  willems looked at him for a second with a blank stare then went on  i fought against her she goaded me to violence and to murder nobody knows why she pushed me to it persistently desperately all the time fortunately abdulla had sense i dont know what i wouldnt have done she held me then held me like a nightmare that is terrible and sweet by and by it was another life i woke up i found myself beside an animal as full of harm as a wild cat you dont know through what i have passed her father tried to kill meand she very nearly killed him i believe she would have stuck at nothing i dont know which was more terrible she would have stuck at nothing to defend her own and when i think that it was memewillems    i hate her tomorrow she may want my life how can i know whats in her she may want to kill me next  he paused in great trepidation then added in a scared tone  i dont want to die here  dont you said lingard thoughtfully  willems turned towards aissa and pointed at her with a bony forefinger  look at her always there always near always watching watching    for something look at her eyes aint they big dont they stare you wouldnt think she can shut them like human beings do i dont believe she ever does i go to sleep if i can under their stare and when i wake up i see them fixed on me and moving no more than the eyes of a corpse while i am still they are still by godshe cant move them till i stir and then they follow me like a pair of jailers they watch me when i stop they seem to wait patient and glistening till i am off my guardfor to do something to do something horrible look at them you can see nothing in them they are big menacingand empty the eyes of a savage of a damned mongrel halfarab halfmalay they hurt me i am white i swear to you i cant stand this take me away i am white all white  he shouted towards the sombre heaven proclaiming desperately under the frown of thickening clouds the fact of his pure and superior descent he shouted his head thrown up his arms swinging about wildly lean ragged disfigured a tall madman making a great disturbance about something invisible a being absurd repulsive pathetic and droll lingard who was looking down as if absorbed in deep thought gave him a quick glance from under his eyebrows aissa stood with clasped hands at the other end of the courtyard the old woman like a vague and decrepit apparition rose noiselessly to look then sank down again with a stealthy movement and crouched low over the small glow of the fire willems voice filled the enclosure rising louder with every word and then suddenly at its very loudest stopped shortlike water stops running from an overturned vessel as soon as it had ceased the thunder seemed to take up the burden in a low growl coming from the inland hills the noise approached in confused mutterings which kept on increasing swelling into a roar that came nearer rushed down the river passed close in a tearing crashand instantly sounded faint dying away in monotonous and dull repetitions amongst the endless sinuosities of the lower reaches over the great forests over all the innumerable people of unstirring treesover all that living people immense motionless and mutethe silence that had rushed in on the track of the passing tumult remained suspended as deep and complete as if it had never been disturbed from the beginning of remote ages then through it after a time came to lingards ears the voice of the running river a voice low discreet and sad like the persistent and gentle voices that speak of the past in the silence of dreams  he felt a great emptiness in his heart it seemed to him that there was within his breast a great space without any light where his thoughts wandered forlornly unable to escape unable to rest unable to die to vanishand to relieve him from the fearful oppression of their existence speech action anger forgiveness all appeared to him alike useless and vain appeared to him unsatisfactory not worth the effort of hand or brain that was needed to give them effect he could not see why he should not remain standing there without ever doing anything to the end of time he felt something something like a heavy chain that held him there this wouldnt do he backed away a little from willems and aissa leaving them close together then stopped and looked at both the man and the woman appeared to him much further than they really were he had made only about three steps backward but he believed for a moment that another step would take him out of earshot for ever they appeared to him slightly under life size and with a great cleanness of outlines like figures carved with great precision of detail and highly finished by a skilful hand he pulled himself together the strong consciousness of his own personality came back to him he had a notion of surveying them from a great and inaccessible height  he said slowly you have been possessed of a devil  yes answered willems gloomily and looking at aissa isnt it pretty  ive heard this kind of talk before said lingard in a scornful tone then paused and went on steadily after a while i regret nothing i picked you up by the waterside like a starving catby god i regret nothing nothing that i have done abdullatwenty othersno doubt hudig himself were after me thats businessfor them but that you should    money belongs to him who picks it up and is strong enough to keep itbut this thing was different it was part of my life    i am an old fool  he was the breath of his words of the very words he spoke fanned the spark of divine folly in his breast the spark that made himthe hardheaded heavyhanded adventurerstand out from the crowd from the sordid from the joyous unscrupulous and noisy crowd of men that were so much like himself  willems said hurriedly it wasnt me the evil was not in me captain lingard  and where else confound you where else interrupted lingard raising his voice did you ever see me cheat and lie and steal tell me that did you hey i wonder where in perdition you came from when i found you under my feet    no matter you will do no more harm  willems moved nearer gazing upon him anxiously lingard went on with distinct deliberation  what did you expect when you asked me to see you what you know me i am lingard you lived with me youve heard men speak you knew what you had done well what did you expect  how can i know groaned willems wringing his hands i was alone in that infernal savage crowd i was delivered into their hands after the thing was done i felt so lost and weak that i would have called the devil himself to my aid if it had been any goodif he hadnt put in all his work already in the whole world there was only one man that had ever cared for me only one white man you hate is better than being alone death is better i expected    anything something to expect something to take me out of this out of her sight  he laughed his laugh seemed to be torn out from him against his will seemed to be brought violently on the surface from under his bitterness his selfcontempt from under his despairing wonder at his own nature  when i think that when i first knew her it seemed to me that my whole life wouldnt be enough to    and now when i look at her she did it all i must have been mad i was mad every time i look at her i remember my madness it frightens me    and when i think that of all my life of all my past of all my future of my intelligence of my work there is nothing left but she the cause of my ruin and you whom i have mortally offended     he hid his face for a moment in his hands and when he took them away he had lost the appearance of comparative calm and gave way to a wild distress  captain lingard    anything    a deserted island    anywhere    i promise     shut up shouted lingard roughly  he became dumb suddenly completely  the wan light of the clouded morning retired slowly from the courtyard from the clearings from the river as if it had gone unwillingly to hide in the enigmatical solitudes of the gloomy and silent forests the clouds over their heads thickened into a low vault of uniform blackness the air was still and inexpressibly oppressive lingard unbuttoned his jacket flung it wide open and inclining his body sideways a little wiped his forehead with his hand which he jerked sharply afterwards then he looked at willems and said  no promise of yours is any good to me i am going to take your conduct into my own hands pay attention to what i am going to say you are my prisoner  willems head moved imperceptibly then he became rigid and still he seemed not to breathe  you shall stay here continued lingard with sombre deliberation you are not fit to go amongst people who could suspect who could guess who could imagine whats in you i couldnt you are my mistake i shall hide you here if i let you out you would go amongst unsuspecting men and lie and steal and cheat for a little money or for some woman i dont care about shooting you it would be the safest way though but i wont do not expect me to forgive you to forgive one must have been angry and become contemptuous and there is nothing in me nowno anger no contempt no disappointment to me you are not willems the man i befriended and helped through thick and thin and thought much of    you are not a human being that may be destroyed or forgiven you are a bitter thought a something without a body and that must be hidden    you are my shame  he ceased and looked slowly round how dark it was it seemed to him that the light was dying prematurely out of the world and that the air was already dead  of course he went on i shall see to it that you dont starve  you dont mean to say that i must live here captain lingard said willems in a kind of mechanical voice without any inflections  did you ever hear me say something i did not mean asked lingard you said you didnt want to die herewell you must live    unless you change your mind he added as if in involuntary afterthought  he looked at willems narrowly then shook his head  you are alone he went on nothing can help you nobody will you are neither white nor brown you have no colour as you have no heart your accomplices have abandoned you to me because i am still somebody to be reckoned with you are alone but for that woman there you say you did this for her well you have her  willems mumbled something and then suddenly caught his hair with both his hands and remained standing so aissa who had been looking at him turned to lingard  what did you say rajah laut she cried  there was a slight stir amongst the filmy threads of her disordered hair the bushes by the river sides trembled the big tree nodded precipitately over them with an abrupt rustle as if waking with a start from a troubled sleepand the breath of hot breeze passed light rapid and scorching under the clouds that whirled round unbroken but undulating like a restless phantom of a sombre sea  lingard looked at her pityingly before he said  i have told him that he must live here all his life    and with you  the sun seemed to have gone out at last like a flickering light away up beyond the clouds and in the stifling gloom of the courtyard the three figures stood colourless and shadowy as if surrounded by a black and superheated mist aissa looked at willems who remained still as though he had been changed into stone in the very act of tearing his hair then she turned her head towards lingard and shouted  you lie you lie    white man like you all do you    whom abdulla made small you lie  her words rang out shrill and venomous with her secret scorn with her overpowering desire to wound regardless of consequences in her womans reckless desire to cause suffering at any cost to cause it by the sound of her own voiceby her own voice that would carry the poison of her thought into the hated heart  willems let his hands fall and began to mumble again lingard turned his ear towards him instinctively caught something that sounded like very wellthen some more mumblingthen a sigh  as far as the rest of the world is concerned said lingard after waiting for awhile in an attentive attitude your life is finished nobody will be able to throw any of your villainies in my teeth nobody will be able to point at you and say here goes a scoundrel of lingards upbringing you are buried here  and you think that i will stay    that i will submit exclaimed willems as if he had suddenly recovered the power of speech  you neednt stay hereon this spot said lingard drily there are the forestsand here is the river you may swim fifteen miles up or forty down at one end you will meet almayer at the other the sea take your choice  he burst into a short joyless laugh then added with severe gravity  there is also another way  if you want to drive my soul into damnation by trying to drive me to suicide you will not succeed said willems in wild excitement i will live i shall repent i may escape    take that woman awayshe is sin  a hooked dart of fire tore in two the darkness of the distant horizon and lit up the gloom of the earth with a dazzling and ghastly flame then the thunder was heard far away like an incredibly enormous voice muttering menaces  lingard said  i dont care what happens but i may tell you that without that woman your life is not worth muchnot twopence there is a fellow here who    and abdulla himself wouldnt stand on any ceremony think of that and then she wont go  he began even while he spoke to walk slowly down towards the little gate he didnt look but he felt as sure that willems was following him as if he had been leading him by a string directly he had passed through the wicketgate into the big courtyard he heard a voice behind his back saying  i think she was right i ought to have shot you i couldnt have been worse off  time yet answered lingard without stopping or looking back but you see you cant there is not even that in you  dont provoke me captain lingard cried willems  lingard turned round sharply willems and aissa stopped another forked flash of lightning split up the clouds overhead and threw upon their faces a sudden burst of lighta blaze violent sinister and fleeting and in the same instant they were deafened by a near single crash of thunder which was followed by a rushing noise like a frightened sigh of the startled earth  provoke you said the old adventurer as soon as he could make himself heard provoke you hey whats there in you to provoke what do i care  it is easy to speak like that when you know that in the whole worldin the whole worldi have no friend said willems  whose fault said lingard sharply  their voices after the deep and tremendous noise sounded to them very unsatisfactorythin and frail like the voices of pigmiesand they became suddenly silent as if on that account from up the courtyard lingards boatmen came down and passed them keeping step in a single file their paddles on shoulder and holding their heads straight with their eyes fixed on the river ali who was walking last stopped before lingard very stiff and upright he said  that oneeyed babalatchi is gone with all his women he took everything all the pots and boxes big heavy three boxes  he grinned as if the thing had been amusing then added with an appearance of anxious concern rain coming  we return said lingard make ready  aye aye sir ejaculated ali with precision and moved on he had been quartermaster with lingard before making up his mind to stay in sambir as almayers head man he strutted towards the landingplace thinking proudly that he was not like those other ignorant boatmen and knew how to answer properly the very greatest of white captains  you have misunderstood me from the first captain lingard said willems  have i its all right as long as there is no mistake about my meaning answered lingard strolling slowly to the landingplace willems followed him and aissa followed willems  two hands were extended to help lingard in embarking he stepped cautiously and heavily into the long and narrow canoe and sat in the canvas foldingchair that had been placed in the middle he leaned back and turned his head to the two figures that stood on the bank a little above him aissas eyes were fastened on his face in a visible impatience to see him gone willems look went straight above the canoe straight at the forest on the other side of the river  all right ali said lingard in a low voice  a slight stir animated the faces and a faint murmur ran along the line of paddlers the foremost man pushed with the point of his paddle canted the fore end out of the dead water into the current and the canoe fell rapidly off before the rush of brown water the stern rubbing gently against the low bank  we shall meet again captain lingard cried willems in an unsteady voice  never said lingard turning half round in his chair to look at willems his fierce red eyes glittered remorselessly over the high back of his seat  must cross the river water less quick over there said ali  he pushed in his turn now with all his strength throwing his body recklessly right out over the stern then he recovered himself just in time into the squatting attitude of a monkey perched on a high shelf and shouted dayong  the paddles struck the water together the canoe darted forward and went on steadily crossing the river with a sideways motion made up of its own speed and the downward drift of the current  lingard watched the shore astern the woman shook her hand at him and then squatted at the feet of the man who stood motionless after a while she got up and stood beside him reaching up to his headand lingard saw then that she had wetted some part of her covering and was trying to wash the dried blood off the mans immovable face which did not seem to know anything about it lingard turned away and threw himself back in his chair stretching his legs out with a sigh of fatigue his head fell forward and under his red face the white beard lay fanlike on his breast the ends of fine long hairs all astir in the faint draught made by the rapid motion of the craft that carried him away from his prisonerfrom the only thing in his life he wished to hide  in its course across the river the canoe came into the line of willems sight and his eyes caught the image followed it eagerly as it glided small but distinct on the dark background of the forest he could see plainly the figure of the man sitting in the middle all his life he had felt that man behind his back a reassuring presence ready with help with commendation with advice friendly in reproof enthusiastic in approbation a man inspiring confidence by his strength by his fearlessness by the very weakness of his simple heart and now that man was going away he must call him back  he shouted and his words which he wanted to throw across the river seemed to fall helplessly at his feet aissa put her hand on his arm in a restraining attempt but he shook it off he wanted to call back his very life that was going away from him he shouted againand this time he did not even hear himself no use he would never return and he stood in sullen silence looking at the white figure over there lying back in the chair in the middle of the boat a figure that struck him suddenly as very terrible heartless and astonishing with its unnatural appearance of running over the water in an attitude of languid repose  for a time nothing on earth stirred seemingly but the canoe which glided upstream with a motion so even and smooth that it did not convey any sense of movement overhead the massed clouds appeared solid and steady as if held there in a powerful grip but on their uneven surface there was a continuous and trembling glimmer a faint reflection of the distant lightning from the thunderstorm that had broken already on the coast and was working its way up the river with low and angry growls willems looked on as motionless as everything round him and above him only his eyes seemed to live as they followed the canoe on its course that carried it away from him steadily unhesitatingly finally as if it were going not up the great river into the momentous excitement of sambir but straight into the past into the past crowded yet empty like an old cemetery full of neglected graves where lie dead hopes that never return  from time to time he felt on his face the passing warm touch of an immense breath coming from beyond the forest like the short panting of an oppressed world then the heavy air round him was pierced by a sharp gust of wind bringing with it the fresh damp feel of the falling rain and all the innumerable treetops of the forests swayed to the left and sprang back again in a tumultuous balancing of nodding branches and shuddering leaves a light frown ran over the river the clouds stirred slowly changing their aspect but not their place as if they had turned ponderously over and when the sudden movement had died out in a quickened tremor of the slenderest twigs there was a short period of formidable immobility above and below during which the voice of the thunder was heard speaking in a sustained emphatic and vibrating roll with violent louder bursts of crashing sound like a wrathful and threatening discourse of an angry god for a moment it died out and then another gust of wind passed driving before it a white mist which filled the space with a cloud of waterdust that hid suddenly from willems the canoe the forests the river itself that woke him up from his numbness in a forlorn shiver that made him look round despairingly to see nothing but the whirling drift of rain spray before the freshening breeze while through it the heavy big drops fell about him with sonorous and rapid beats upon the dry earth he made a few hurried steps up the courtyard and was arrested by an immense sheet of water that fell all at once on him fell sudden and overwhelming from the clouds cutting his respiration streaming over his head clinging to him running down his body off his arms off his legs he stood gasping while the water beat him in a vertical downpour drove on him slanting in squalls and he felt the drops striking him from above from everywhere drops thick pressed and dashing at him as if flung from all sides by a mob of infuriated hands from under his feet a great vapour of broken water floated up he felt the ground become softmelt under himand saw the water spring out from the dry earth to meet the water that fell from the sombre heaven an insane dread took possession of him the dread of all that water around him of the water that ran down the courtyard towards him of the water that pressed him on every side of the slanting water that drove across his face in wavering sheets which gleamed pale red with the flicker of lightning streaming through them as if fire and water were falling together monstrously mixed upon the stunned earth  he wanted to run away but when he moved it was to slide about painfully and slowly upon that earth which had become mud so suddenly under his feet he fought his way up the courtyard like a man pushing through a crowd his head down one shoulder forward stopping often and sometimes carried back a pace or two in the rush of water which his heart was not stout enough to face aissa followed him step by step stopping when he stopped recoiling with him moving forward with him in his toilsome way up the slippery declivity of the courtyard of that courtyard from which everything seemed to have been swept away by the first rush of the mighty downpour they could see nothing the tree the bushes the house and the fencesall had disappeared in the thickness of the falling rain their hair stuck streaming to their heads their clothing clung to them beaten close to their bodies water ran off them off their heads over their shoulders they moved patient upright slow and dark in the gleam clear or fiery of the falling drops under the roll of unceasing thunder like two wandering ghosts of the drowned that condemned to haunt the water for ever had come up from the river to look at the world under a deluge  on the left the tree seemed to step out to meet them appearing vaguely high motionless and patient with a rustling plaint of its innumerable leaves through which every drop of water tore its separate way with cruel haste and then to the right the house surged up in the mist very black and clamorous with the quick patter of rain on its highpitched roof above the steady splash of the water running off the eaves down the plankway leading to the door flowed a thin and pellucid stream and when willems began his ascent it broke over his foot as if he were going up a steep ravine in the bed of a rapid and shallow torrent behind his heels two streaming smudges of mud stained for an instant the purity of the rushing water and then he splashed his way up with a spurt and stood on the bamboo platform before the open door under the shelter of the overhanging eavesunder shelter at last  a low moan ending in a broken and plaintive mutter arrested willems on the threshold he peered round in the halflight under the roof and saw the old woman crouching close to the wall in a shapeless heap and while he looked he felt a touch of two arms on his shoulders aissa he had forgotten her he turned and she clasped him round the neck instantly pressing close to him as if afraid of violence or escape he stiffened himself in repulsion in horror in the mysterious revolt of his heart while she clung to himclung to him as if he were a refuge from misery from storm from weariness from fear from despair and it was on the part of that being an embrace terrible enraged and mournful in which all her strength went out to make him captive to hold him for ever  he said nothing he looked into her eyes while he struggled with her fingers about the nape of his neck and suddenly he tore her hands apart holding her arms up in a strong grip of her wrists and bending his swollen face close over hers he said  it is all your doing you     she did not understand himnot a word he spoke in the language of his peopleof his people that know no mercy and no shame and he was angry alas he was always angry now and always speaking words that she could not understand she stood in silence looking at him through her patient eyes while he shook her arms a little and then flung them down  dont follow me he shouted i want to be alonei mean to be left alone  he went in leaving the door open  she did not move what need to understand the words when they are spoken in such a voice in that voice which did not seem to be his voicehis voice when he spoke by the brook when he was never angry and always smiling her eyes were fixed upon the dark doorway but her hands strayed mechanically upwards she took up all her hair and inclining her head slightly over her shoulder wrung out the long black tresses twisting them persistently while she stood sad and absorbed like one listening to an inward voicethe voice of bitter of unavailing regret the thunder had ceased the wind had died out and the rain fell perpendicular and steady through a great pale clearnessthe light of remote sun coming victorious from amongst the dissolving blackness of the clouds she stood near the doorway he was therealone in the gloom of the dwelling he was there he spoke not what was in his mind now what fear what desire not the desire of her as in the days when he used to smile    how could she know     a sigh coming from the bottom of her heart flew out into the world through her parted lips a sigh faint profound and broken a sigh full of pain and fear like the sigh of those who are about to face the unknown to face it in loneliness in doubt and without hope she let go her hair that fell scattered over her shoulders like a funeral veil and she sank down suddenly by the door her hands clasped her ankles she rested her head on her drawnup knees and remained still very still under the streaming mourning of her hair she was thinking of him of the days by the brook she was thinking of all that had been their loveand she sat in the abandoned posture of those who sit weeping by the dead of those who watch and mourn over a corpse     part v   chapter one  almayer propped alone on the verandah of his house with both his elbows on the table and holding his head between his hands stared before him away over the stretch of sprouting young grass in his courtyard and over the short jetty with its cluster of small canoes amongst which his big whaleboat floated high like a white mother of all that dark and aquatic brood he stared on the river past the schooner anchored in midstream past the forests of the left bank he stared through and past the illusion of the material world  the sun was sinking under the sky was stretched a network of white threads a network fine and closemeshed where here and there were caught thicker white vapours of globular shape and to the eastward above the ragged barrier of the forests surged the summits of a chain of great clouds growing bigger slowly in imperceptible motion as if careful not to disturb the glowing stillness of the earth and of the sky abreast of the house the river was empty but for the motionless schooner higher up a solitary log came out from the bend above and went on drifting slowly down the straight reach a dead and wandering tree going out to its grave in the sea between two ranks of trees motionless and living  and almayer sat his face in his hands looking on and hating all this the muddy river the faded blue of the sky the black log passing by on its first and last voyage the green sea of leavesthe sea that glowed shimmered and stirred above the uniform and impenetrable gloom of the foreststhe joyous sea of living green powdered with the brilliant dust of oblique sunrays  he hated all this he begrudged every dayevery minuteof his life spent amongst all these things he begrudged it bitterly angrily with enraged and immense regret like a miser compelled to give up some of his treasure to a near relation and yet all this was very precious to him it was the present sign of a splendid future  he pushed the table away impatiently got up made a few steps aimlessly then stood by the balustrade and again looked at the riverat that river which would have been the instrument for the making of his fortune if    if     what an abominable brute he said  he was alone but he spoke aloud as one is apt to do under the impulse of a strong of an overmastering thought  what a brute he muttered again  the river was dark now and the schooner lay on it a black a lonely and a graceful form with the slender masts darting upwards from it in two frail and raking lines the shadows of the evening crept up the trees crept up from bough to bough till at last the long sunbeams coursing from the western horizon skimmed lightly over the topmost branches then flew upwards amongst the piledup clouds giving them a sombre and fiery aspect in the last flush of light and suddenly the light disappeared as if lost in the immensity of the great blue and empty hollow overhead the sun had set and the forests became a straight wall of formless blackness above them on the edge of lingering clouds a single star glimmered fitfully obscured now and then by the rapid flight of high and invisible vapours  almayer fought with the uneasiness within his breast he heard ali who moved behind him preparing his evening meal and he listened with strange attention to the sounds the man madeto the short dry bang of the plate put upon the table to the clink of glass and the metallic rattle of knife and fork the man went away now he was coming back he would speak directly and almayer notwithstanding the absorbing gravity of his thoughts listened for the sound of expected words he heard them spoken in english with painstaking distinctness  ready sir  all right said almayer curtly he did not move he remained pensive with his back to the table upon which stood the lighted lamp brought by ali he was thinking where was lingard now halfway down the river probably in abdullas ship he would be back in about three daysperhaps less and then then the schooner would have to be got out of the river and when that craft was gone theyhe and lingardwould remain here alone with the constant thought of that other man that other man living near them what an extraordinary idea to keep him there for ever for ever what did that meanfor ever perhaps a year perhaps ten years preposterous keep him there ten yearsor may be twenty the fellow was capable of living more than twenty years and for all that time he would have to be watched fed looked after there was nobody but lingard to have such notions twenty years why no in less than ten years their fortune would be made and they would leave this place first for bataviayes bataviaand then for europe england no doubt lingard would want to go to england and would they leave that man here how would that fellow look in ten years very old probably well devil take him nina would be fifteen she would be rich and very pretty and he himself would not be so old then     almayer smiled into the night     yes rich why of course captain lingard was a resourceful man and he had plenty of money even now they were rich already but not enough decidedly not enough money brings money that gold business was good famous captain lingard was a remarkable man he said the gold was thereand it was there lingard knew what he was talking about but he had queer ideas for instance about willems now what did he want to keep him alive for why  that scoundrel muttered almayer again  makan tuan ejaculated ali suddenly very loud in a pressing tone  almayer walked to the table sat down and his anxious visage dropped from above into the light thrown down by the lampshade he helped himself absently and began to eat in great mouthfuls     undoubtedly lingard was the man to stick to the man undismayed masterful and ready how quickly he had planned a new future when willems treachery destroyed their established position in sambir and the position even now was not so bad what an immense prestige that lingard had with all those peoplearabs malays and all ah it was good to be able to call a man like that father fine wonder how much money really the old fellow had people talkedthey exaggerated surely but if he had only half of what they said     he drank throwing his head up and fell to again     now if that willems had known how to play his cards well had he stuck to the old fellow he would have been in his position he would be now married to lingards adopted daughter with his future assuredsplendid     the beast growled almayer between two mouthfuls  ali stood rigidly straight with an uninterested face his gaze lost in the night which pressed round the small circle of light that shone on the table on the glass on the bottle and on almayers head as he leaned over his plate moving his jaws     a famous man lingardyet you never knew what he would do next it was notorious that he had shot a white man once for less than willems had done for less    why for nothing so to speak it was not even his own quarrel it was about some malay returning from pilgrimage with wife and children kidnapped or robbed or something a stupid storyan old story and now he goes to see that willems andnothing comes back talking big about his prisoner but after all he said very little what did that willems tell him what passed between them the old fellow must have had something in his mind when he let that scoundrel off and joanna she would get round the old fellow sure then he would forgive perhaps impossible but at any rate he would waste a lot of money on them the old man was tenacious in his hates but also in his affections he had known that beast willems from a boy they would make it up in a year or so everything is possible why did he not rush off at first and kill the brute that would have been more like lingard     almayer laid down his spoon suddenly and pushing his plate away threw himself back in the chair     unsafe decidedly unsafe he had no mind to share lingards money with anybody lingards money was ninas money in a sense and if willems managed to become friendly with the old man it would be dangerous for himalmayer such an unscrupulous scoundrel he would oust him from his position he would lie and slander everything would be lost lost poor nina what would become of her poor child for her sake he must remove that willems must but how lingard wanted to be obeyed impossible to kill willems lingard might be angry incredible but so it was he might     a wave of heat passed through almayers body flushed his face and broke out of him in copious perspiration he wriggled in his chair and pressed his hands together under the table what an awful prospect he fancied he could see lingard and willems reconciled and going away arminarm leaving him alone in this godforsaken holein sambirin this deadly swamp and all his sacrifices the sacrifice of his independence of his best years his surrender to lingards fancies and caprices would go for nothing horrible then he thought of his little daughterhis daughterand the ghastliness of his supposition overpowered him he had a deep emotion a sudden emotion that made him feel quite faint at the idea of that young life spoiled before it had fairly begun his dear childs life lying back in his chair he covered his face with both his hands  ali glanced down at him and said unconcernedlymaster finish  almayer was lost in the immensity of his commiseration for himself for his daughter who wasperhapsnot going to be the richest woman in the worldnotwithstanding lingards promises he did not understand the others question and muttered through his fingers in a doleful tone  what did you say what finish what  clear up meza explained ali  clear up burst out almayer with incomprehensible exasperation devil take you and the table stupid chatterer chelakka get out  he leaned forward glaring at his head man then sank back in his seat with his arms hanging straight down on each side of the chair and he sat motionless in a meditation so concentrated and so absorbing with all his power of thought so deep within himself that all expression disappeared from his face in an aspect of staring vacancy  ali was clearing the table he dropped negligently the tumbler into the greasy dish flung there the spoon and fork then slipped in the plate with a push amongst the remnants of food he took up the dish tucked up the bottle under his armpit and went off  my hammock shouted almayer after him  ada i come soon answered ali from the doorway in an offended tone looking back over his shoulder    how could he clear the table and hang the hammock at the same time yawa those white men were all alike wanted everything done at once like children     the indistinct murmur of his criticism went away faded and died out together with the soft footfall of his bare feet in the dark passage  for some time almayer did not move his thoughts were busy at work shaping a momentous resolution and in the perfect silence of the house he believed that he could hear the noise of the operation as if the work had been done with a hammer he certainly felt a thumping of strokes faint profound and startling somewhere low down in his breast and he was aware of a sound of dull knocking abrupt and rapid in his ears now and then he held his breath unconsciously too long and had to relieve himself by a deep expiration that whistled dully through his pursed lips the lamp standing on the far side of the table threw a section of a lighted circle on the floor where his outstretched legs stuck out from under the table with feet rigid and turned up like the feet of a corpse and his set face with fixed eyes would have been also like the face of the dead but for its vacant yet conscious aspect the hard the stupid the stony aspect of one not dead but only buried under the dust ashes and corruption of personal thoughts of base fears of selfish desires  i will do it  not till he heard his own voice did he know that he had spoken it startled him he stood up the knuckles of his hand somewhat behind him were resting on the edge of the table as he remained still with one foot advanced his lips a little open and thought it would not do to fool about with lingard but i must risk it its the only way i can see i must tell her she has some little sense i wish they were a thousand miles off already a hundred thousand miles i do and if it fails and she blabs out then to lingard she seemed a fool no probably they will get away and if they did would lingard believe me yes i never lied to him he would believe i dont know    perhaps he wont    i must do it must he argued aloud to himself  for a long time he stood still looking before him with an intense gaze a gaze rapt and immobile that seemed to watch the minute quivering of a delicate balance coming to a rest  to the left of him in the whitewashed wall of the house that formed the back of the verandah there was a closed door black letters were painted on it proclaiming the fact that behind that door there was the office of lingard  co the interior had been furnished by lingard when he had built the house for his adopted daughter and her husband and it had been furnished with reckless prodigality there was an office desk a revolving chair bookshelves a safe all to humour the weakness of almayer who thought all those paraphernalia necessary to successful trading lingard had laughed but had taken immense trouble to get the things it pleased him to make his protege his adopted soninlaw happy it had been the sensation of sambir some five years ago while the things were being landed the whole settlement literally lived on the river bank in front of the rajah lauts house to look to wonder to admire    what a big meza with many boxes fitted all over it and under it what did the white man do with such a table and look look o brothers there is a green square box with a gold plate on it a box so heavy that those twenty men cannot drag it up the bank let us go brothers and help pull at the ropes and perchance we may see whats inside treasure no doubt gold is heavy and hard to hold o brothers let us go and earn a recompense from the fierce rajah of the sea who shouts over there with a red face see there is a man carrying a pile of books from the boat what a number of books what were they for    and an old invalided jurumudi who had travelled over many seas and had heard holy men speak in faroff countries explained to a small knot of unsophisticated citizens of sambir that those books were books of magicof magic that guides the white mens ships over the seas that gives them their wicked wisdom and their strength of magic that makes them great powerful and irresistible while they live andpraise be to allahthe victims of satan the slaves of jehannum when they die  and when he saw the room furnished almayer had felt proud in his exultation of an emptyheaded quilldriver he thought himself by the virtue of that furniture at the head of a serious business he had sold himself to lingard for these thingsmarried the malay girl of his adoption for the reward of these things and of the great wealth that must necessarily follow upon conscientious bookkeeping he found out very soon that trade in sambir meant something entirely different he could not guide patalolo control the irrepressible old sahamin or restrain the youthful vagaries of the fierce bahassoen with pen ink and paper he found no successful magic in the blank pages of his ledgers and gradually he lost his old point of view in the saner appreciation of his situation the room known as the office became neglected then like a temple of an exploded superstition at first when his wife reverted to her original savagery almayer now and again had sought refuge from her there but after their child began to speak to know him he became braver for he found courage and consolation in his unreasoning and fierce affection for his daughterin the impenetrable mantle of selfishness he wrapped round both their lives round himself and that young life that was also his  when lingard ordered him to receive joanna into his house he had a truckle bed put into the officethe only room he could spare the big office desk was pushed on one side and joanna came with her little shabby trunk and with her child and took possession in her dreamy slack halfasleep way took possession of the dust dirt and squalor where she appeared naturally at home where she dragged a melancholy and dull existence an existence made up of sad remorse and frightened hope amongst the hopeless disorderthe senseless and vain decay of all these emblems of civilized commerce bits of white stuff rags yellow pink blue rags limp brilliant and soiled trailed on the floor lay on the desk amongst the sombre covers of books soiled grimy but stiffbacked in virtue perhaps of their european origin the biggest set of bookshelves was partly hidden by a petticoat the waistband of which was caught upon the back of a slender book pulled a little out of the row so as to make an improvised clothespeg the folding canvas bedstead stood nearly in the middle of the room stood anyhow parallel to no wall as if it had been in the process of transportation to some remote place dropped casually there by tired bearers and on the tumbled blankets that lay in a disordered heap on its edge joanna sat almost all day with her stockingless feet upon one of the bed pillows that were somehow always kicking about the floor she sat there vaguely tormented at times by the thought of her absent husband but most of the time thinking tearfully of nothing at all looking with swimming eyes at her little sonat the bigheaded pastyfaced and sickly louis willemswho rolled a glass inkstand solid with dried ink about the floor and tottered after it with the portentous gravity of demeanour and absolute absorption by the business in hand that characterize the pursuits of early childhood through the halfopen shutter a ray of sunlight a ray merciless and crude came into the room beat in the early morning upon the safe in the faroff corner then travelling against the sun cut at midday the big desk in two with its solid and cleanedged brilliance with its hot brilliance in which a swarm of flies hovered in dancing flight over some dirty plate forgotten there amongst yellow papers for many a day and towards the evening the cynical ray seemed to cling to the ragged petticoat lingered on it with wicked enjoyment of that misery it had exposed all day lingered on the corner of the dusty bookshelf in a red glow intense and mocking till it was suddenly snatched by the setting sun out of the way of the coming night and the night entered the room the night abrupt impenetrable and allfilling with its flood of darkness the night cool and merciful the blind night that saw nothing but could hear the fretful whimpering of the child the creak of the bedstead joannas deep sighs as she turned over sleepless in the confused conviction of her wickedness thinking of that man masterful fairheaded and stronga man hard perhaps but her husband her clever and handsome husband to whom she had acted so cruelly on the advice of bad people if her own people and of her poor dear deceived mother  to almayer joannas presence was a constant worry a worry unobtrusive yet intolerable a constant but mostly mute warning of possible danger in view of the absurd softness of lingards heart every one in whom lingard manifested the slightest interest was to almayer a natural enemy he was quite alive to that feeling and in the intimacy of the secret intercourse with his inner self had often congratulated himself upon his own wideawake comprehension of his position in that way and impelled by that motive almayer had hated many and various persons at various times but he never had hated and feared anybody so much as he did hate and fear willems even after willems treachery which seemed to remove him beyond the pale of all human sympathy almayer mistrusted the situation and groaned in spirit every time he caught sight of joanna  he saw her very seldom in the daytime but in the short and opaltinted twilights or in the azure dusk of starry evenings he often saw before he slept the slender and tall figure trailing to and fro the ragged tail of its white gown over the dried mud of the riverside in front of the house once or twice when he sat late on the verandah with his feet upon the deal table on a level with the lamp reading the seven months old copy of the north china herald brought by lingard he heard the stairs creak and looking round the paper he saw her frail and meagre form rise step by step and toil across the verandah carrying with difficulty the big fat child whose head lying on the mothers bony shoulder seemed of the same size as joannas own several times she had assailed him with tearful clamour or mad entreaties asking about her husband wanting to know where he was when he would be back and ending every such outburst with despairing and incoherent selfreproaches that were absolutely incomprehensible to almayer on one or two occasions she had overwhelmed her host with vituperative abuse making him responsible for her husbands absence those scenes begun without any warning ended abruptly in a sobbing flight and a bang of the door stirred the house with a sudden a fierce and an evanescent disturbance like those inexplicable whirlwinds that rise run and vanish without apparent cause upon the sunscorched dead level of arid and lamentable plains  but tonight the house was quiet deadly quiet while almayer stood still watching that delicate balance where he was weighing all his chances joannas intelligence lingards credulity willems reckless audacity desire to escape readiness to seize an unexpected opportunity he weighed anxious and attentive his fears and his desires against the tremendous risk of a quarrel with lingard    yes lingard would be angry lingard might suspect him of some connivance in his prisoners escapebut surely he would not quarrel with himalmayerabout those people once they were gonegone to the devil in their own way and then he had hold of lingard through the little girl good what an annoyance a prisoner as if one could keep him in there he was bound to get away some time or other of course a situation like that cant last anybody could see that lingards eccentricity passed all bounds you may kill a man but you mustnt torture him it was almost criminal it caused worry trouble and unpleasantness    almayer for a moment felt very angry with lingard he made him responsible for the anguish he suffered from for the anguish of doubt and fear for compelling himthe practical and innocent almayerto such painful efforts of mind in order to find out some issue for absurd situations created by the unreasonable sentimentality of lingards unpractical impulses  now if the fellow were dead it would be all right said almayer to the verandah  he stirred a little and scratching his nose thoughtfully revelled in a short flight of fancy showing him his own image crouching in a big boat that floated arrestedsay fifty yards offabreast of willems landingplace in the bottom of the boat there was a gun a loaded gun one of the boatmen would shout and willems would answerfrom the bushes the rascal would be suspicious of course then the man would wave a piece of paper urging willems to come to the landingplace and receive an important message from the rajah laut the man would yell as the boat edged inshore and that would fetch willems out wouldnt it rather and almayer saw himself jumping up at the right moment taking aim pulling the triggerand willems tumbling over his head in the waterthe swine  he seemed to hear the report of the shot it made him thrill from head to foot where he stood    how simple    unfortunate    lingard    he sighed shook his head pity couldnt be done and couldnt leave him there either suppose the arabs were to get hold of him againfor instance to lead an expedition up the river goodness only knows what harm would come of it     the balance was at rest now and inclining to the side of immediate action almayer walked to the door walked up very close to it knocked loudly and turned his head away looking frightened for a moment at what he had done after waiting for a while he put his ear against the panel and listened nothing he composed his features into an agreeable expression while he stood listening and thinking to himself i hear her crying eh i believe she has lost the little wits she had and is crying night and day since i began to prepare her for the news of her husbands deathas lingard told me i wonder what she thinks its just like father to make me invent all these stories for nothing at all out of kindness kindness damn    she isnt deaf surely  he knocked again then said in a friendly tone grinning benevolently at the closed door  its me mrs willems i want to speak to you i have    have    important news     what is it  news repeated almayer distinctly news about your husband your husband    damn him he added under his breath  he heard a stumbling rush inside things were overturned joannas agitated voice cried  news what what i am coming out  no shouted almayer put on some clothes mrs willems and let me in its    very confidential you have a candle havent you  she was knocking herself about blindly amongst the furniture in that room the candlestick was upset matches were struck ineffectually the matchbox fell he heard her drop on her knees and grope over the floor while she kept on moaning in maddened distraction  oh my god news yes    yes    ah where    where    candle oh my god    i cant find    dont go away for the love of heaven     i dont want to go away said almayer impatiently through the keyhole but look sharp its coni    its pressing  he stamped his foot lightly waiting with his hand on the doorhandle he thought anxiously the womans a perfect idiot why should i go away she will be off her head she will never catch my meaning shes too stupid  she was moving now inside the room hurriedly and in silence he waited there was a moment of perfect stillness in there and then she spoke in an exhausted voice in words that were shaped out of an expiring sighout of a sigh light and profound like words breathed out by a woman before going off into a dead faint  come in  he pushed the door ali coming through the passage with an armful of pillows and blankets pressed to his breast high up under his chin caught sight of his master before the door closed behind him he was so astonished that he dropped his bundle and stood staring at the door for a long time he heard the voice of his master talking talking to that sirani woman who was she he had never thought about that really he speculated for a while hazily upon things in general she was a sirani womanand ugly he made a disdainful grimace picked up the bedding and went about his work slinging the hammock between two uprights of the verandah    those things did not concern him she was ugly and brought here by the rajah laut and his master spoke to her in the night very well he ali had his work to do sling the hammockgo round and see that the watchmen were awaketake a look at the moorings of the boats at the padlock of the big storehousethen go to sleep to sleep he shivered pleasantly he leaned with both arms over his masters hammock and fell into a light doze  a scream unexpected piercinga scream beginning at once in the highest pitch of a womans voice and then cut short so short that it suggested the swift work of deathcaused ali to jump on one side away from the hammock and the silence that succeeded seemed to him as startling as the awful shriek he was thunderstruck with surprise almayer came out of the office leaving the door ajar passed close to his servant without taking any notice and made straight for the waterchatty hung on a nail in a draughty place he took it down and came back missing the petrified ali by an inch he moved with long strides yet notwithstanding his haste stopped short before the door and throwing his head back poured a thin stream of water down his throat while he came and went while he stopped to drink while he did all this there came steadily from the dark room the sound of feeble and persistent crying the crying of a sleepy and frightened child after he had drunk almayer went in closing the door carefully  ali did not budge that sirani woman shrieked he felt an immense curiosity very unusual to his stolid disposition he could not take his eyes off the door was she dead in there how interesting and funny he stood with open mouth till he heard again the rattle of the doorhandle master coming out he pivoted on his heels with great rapidity and made believe to be absorbed in the contemplation of the night outside he heard almayer moving about behind his back chairs were displaced his master sat down  ali said almayer  his face was gloomy and thoughtful he looked at his head man who had approached the table then he pulled out his watch it was going whenever lingard was in sambir almayers watch was going he would set it by the cabin clock telling himself every time that he must really keep that watch going for the future and every time when lingard went away he would let it run down and would measure his weariness by sunrises and sunsets in an apathetic indifference to mere hours to hours only to hours that had no importance in sambir life in the tired stagnation of empty days when nothing mattered to him but the quality of guttah and the size of rattans where there were no small hopes to be watched for where to him there was nothing interesting nothing supportable nothing desirable to expect nothing bitter but the slowness of the passing days nothing sweet but the hope the distant and glorious hopethe hope wearying aching and precious of getting away  he looked at the watch halfpast eight ali waited stolidly  go to the settlement said almayer and tell mahmat banjer to come and speak to me tonight  ali went off muttering he did not like his errand banjer and his two brothers were bajow vagabonds who had appeared lately in sambir and had been allowed to take possession of a tumbledown abandoned hut on three posts belonging to lingard  co and standing just outside their fence ali disapproved of the favour shown to those strangers any kind of dwelling was valuable in sambir at that time and if master did not want that old rotten house he might have given it to him ali who was his servant instead of bestowing it upon those bad men everybody knew they were bad it was well known that they had stolen a boat from hinopari who was very aged and feeble and had no sons and that afterwards by the truculent recklessness of their demeanour they had frightened the poor old man into holding his tongue about it yet everybody knew of it it was one of the tolerated scandals of sambir disapproved and accepted a manifestation of that base acquiescence in success of that inexpressed and cowardly toleration of strength that exists infamous and irremediable at the bottom of all hearts in all societies whenever men congregate in bigger and more virtuous places than sambir and in sambir also where as in other places one man could steal a boat with impunity while another would have no right to look at a paddle  almayer leaning back in his chair meditated the more he thought the more he felt convinced that banjer and his brothers were exactly the men he wanted those fellows were sea gipsies and could disappear without attracting notice and if they returned nobodyand lingard least of allwould dream of seeking information from them moreover they had no personal interest of any kind in sambir affairshad taken no sideswould know nothing anyway  he called in a strong voice mrs willems  she came out quickly almost startling him so much did she appear as though she had surged up through the floor on the other side of the table the lamp was between them and almayer moved it aside looking up at her from his chair she was crying she was crying gently silently in a ceaseless welling up of tears that did not fall in drops but seemed to overflow in a clear sheet from under her eyelidsseemed to flow at once all over her face her cheeks and over her chin that glistened with moisture in the light her breast and her shoulders were shaken repeatedly by a convulsive and noiseless catching in her breath and after every spasmodic sob her sorrowful little head tied up in a red kerchief trembled on her long neck round which her bony hand gathered and clasped the disarranged dress  compose yourself mrs willems said almayer  she emitted an inarticulate sound that seemed to be a faint a very far off a hardly audible cry of mortal distress then the tears went on flowing in profound stillness  you must understand that i have told you all this because i am your friendreal friend said almayer after looking at her for some time with visible dissatisfaction you his wife ought to know the danger he is in captain lingard is a terrible man you know  she blubbered out sniffing and sobbing together  do you    you    speak    the    the truth now  upon my word of honour on the head of my child protested almayer i had to deceive you till now because of captain lingard but i couldnt bear it think only what a risk i run in telling youif ever lingard was to know why should i do it pure friendship dear peter was my colleague in macassar for years you know  what shall i do    what shall i do she exclaimed faintly looking around on every side as if she could not make up her mind which way to rush off  you must help him to clear out now lingard is away he offended lingard and thats no joke lingard said he would kill him he will do it too said almayer earnestly  she wrung her hands oh the wicked man the wicked wicked man she moaned swaying her body from side to side  yes yes he is terrible assented almayer you must not lose any time i say do you understand me mrs willems think of your husband of your poor husband how happy he will be you will bring him his lifeactually his life think of him  she ceased her swaying movement and now with her head sunk between her shoulders she hugged herself with both her arms and she stared at almayer with wild eyes while her teeth chattered rattling violently and uninterruptedly with a very loud sound in the deep peace of the house  oh mother of god she wailed i am a miserable woman will he forgive me the poor innocent man will he forgive me oh mr almayer he is so severe oh help me    i dare not    you dont know what ive done to him    i darent    i cant    god help me  the last words came in a despairing cry had she been flayed alive she could not have sent to heaven a more terrible a more heartrending and anguished plaint  sh sh hissed almayer jumping up you will wake up everybody with your shouting  she kept on sobbing then without any noise and almayer stared at her in boundless astonishment the idea that maybe he had done wrong by confiding in her upset him so much that for a moment he could not find a connected thought in his head  at last he said i swear to you that your husband is in such a position that he would welcome the devil    listen well to me    the devil himself if the devil came to him in a canoe unless i am much mistaken he added under his breath then again loudly if you have any little difference to make up with him i assure youi swear to youthis is your time  the ardently persuasive tone of his wordshe thoughtwould have carried irresistible conviction to a graven image he noticed with satisfaction that joanna seemed to have got some inkling of his meaning he continued speaking slowly  look here mrs willems i cant do anything darent but i will tell you what i will do there will come here in about ten minutes a bugis manyou know the language you are from macassar he has a large canoe he can take you there to the new rajahs clearing tell him they are three brothers ready for anything if you pay them    you have some money havent you  she stoodperhaps listeningbut giving no sign of intelligence and stared at the floor in sudden immobility as if the horror of the situation the overwhelming sense of her own wickedness and of her husbands great danger had stunned her brain her heart her willhad left her no faculty but that of breathing and of keeping on her feet almayer swore to himself with much mental profanity that he had never seen a more useless a more stupid being  dye hear me he said raising his voice do try to understand have you any money money dollars guilders money whats the matter with you  without raising her eyes she said in a voice that sounded weak and undecided as if she had been making a desperate effort of memory  the house has been sold mr hudig was angry  almayer gripped the edge of the table with all his strength he resisted manfully an almost uncontrollable impulse to fly at her and box her ears  it was sold for money i suppose he said with studied and incisive calmness have you got it who has got it  she looked up at him raising her swollen eyelids with a great effort in a sorrowful expression of her drooping mouth of her whole besmudged and tearstained face she whispered resignedly  leonard had some he wanted to get married and uncle antonio he sat at the door and would not go away and aghostinashe is so poor    and so many many childrenlittle children and luiz the engineer he never said a word against my husband also our cousin maria she came and shouted and my head was so bad and my heart was worse then cousin salvator and old daniel da souza who     almayer had listened to her speechless with rage he thought i must give money now to that idiot must must get her out of the way now before lingard is back he made two attempts to speak before he managed to burst out  i dont want to know their blasted names tell me did all those infernal people leave you anything to you thats what i want to know  i have two hundred and fifteen dollars said joanna in a frightened tone  almayer breathed freely he spoke with great friendliness  that will do it isnt much but it will do now when the man comes i will be out of the way you speak to him give him some money only a little mind and promise more then when you get there you will be guided by your husband of course and dont forget to tell him that captain lingard is at the mouth of the riverthe northern entrance you will remember wont you the northern branch lingard isdeath  joanna shivered almayer went on rapidly  i would have given you money if you had wanted it pon my word tell your husband ive sent you to him and tell him not to lose any time and also say to him from me that we shall meetsome day that i could not die happy unless i met him once more only once i love him you know i prove it tremendous risk to methis business is  joanna snatched his hand and before he knew what she would be at pressed it to her lips  mrs willems dont what are you    cried the abashed almayer tearing his hand away  oh you are good she cried with sudden exaltation you are noble    i shall pray every day    to all the saints    i shall     never mind    never mind stammered out almayer confusedly without knowing very well what he was saying only look out for lingard    i am happy to be able    in your sad situation    believe me     they stood with the table between them joanna looking down and her face in the halflight above the lamp appeared like a soiled carving of old ivorya carving with accentuated anxious hollows of old very old ivory almayer looked at her mistrustful hopeful he was saying to himself how frail she is i could upset her by blowing at her she seems to have got some idea of what must be done but will she have the strength to carry it through i must trust to luck now  somewhere far in the back courtyard alis voice rang suddenly in angry remonstrance  why did you shut the gate o father of all mischief you a watchman you are only a wild man did i not tell you i was coming back you     i am off mrs willems exclaimed almayer that man is herewith my servant be calm try to     he heard the footsteps of the two men in the passage and without finishing his sentence ran rapidly down the steps towards the riverside    chapter two  for the next halfhour almayer who wanted to give joanna plenty of time stumbled amongst the lumber in distant parts of his enclosure sneaked along the fences or held his breath flattened against grass walls behind various outhouses all this to escape alis inconveniently zealous search for his master he heard him talk with the head watchmansometimes quite close to him in the darknessthen moving off coming back wondering and as the time passed growing uneasy  he did not fall into the riversay thou blind watcher ali was growling in a bullying tone to the other man he told me to fetch mahmat and when i came back swiftly i found him not in the house there is that sirani woman there so that mahmat cannot steal anything but it is in my mind the night will be half gone before i rest  he shouted  master o master o mast     what are you making that noise for said almayer with severity stepping out close to them  the two malays leaped away from each other in their surprise  you may go i dont want you any more tonight ali went on almayer is mahmat there  unless the illbehaved savage got tired of waiting those men know not politeness they should not be spoken to by white men said ali resentfully  almayer went towards the house leaving his servants to wonder where he had sprung from so unexpectedly the watchman hinted obscurely at powers of invisibility possessed by the master who often at night    ali interrupted him with great scorn not every white man has the power now the rajah laut could make himself invisible also he could be in two places at once as everybody knew except hethe useless watchmanwho knew no more about white men than a wild pig yawa  and ali strolled towards his hut yawning loudly  as almayer ascended the steps he heard the noise of a door flung to and when he entered the verandah he saw only mahmat there close to the doorway of the passage mahmat seemed to be caught in the very act of slinking away and almayer noticed that with satisfaction seeing the white man the malay gave up his attempt and leaned against the wall he was a short thick broadshouldered man with very dark skin and a wide stained brightred mouth that uncovered when he spoke a close row of black and glistening teeth his eyes were big prominent dreamy and restless he said sulkily looking all over the place from under his eyebrows  white tuan you are great and strongand i a poor man tell me what is your will and let me go in the name of god it is late  almayer examined the man thoughtfully how could he find out whether    he had it lately he had employed that man and his two brothers as extra boatmen to carry stores provisions and new axes to a camp of rattan cutters some distance up the river a three days expedition he would test him now in that way he said negligently  i want you to start at once for the camp with surat for the kavitan one dollar a day  the man appeared plunged in dull hesitation but almayer who knew his malays felt pretty sure from his aspect that nothing would induce the fellow to go he urged  it is importantand if you are swift i shall give two dollars for the last day  no tuan we do not go said the man in a hoarse whisper  why  we start on another journey  where  to a place we know of said mahmat a little louder in a stubborn manner and looking at the floor  almayer experienced a feeling of immense joy he said with affected annoyance  you men live in my house and it is as if it were your own i may want my house soon  mahmat looked up  we are men of the sea and care not for a roof when we have a canoe that will hold three and a paddle apiece the sea is our house peace be with you tuan  he turned and went away rapidly and almayer heard him directly afterwards in the courtyard calling to the watchman to open the gate mahmat passed through the gate in silence but before the bar had been put up behind him he had made up his mind that if the white man ever wanted to eject him from his hut he would burn it and also as many of the white mans other buildings as he could safely get at and he began to call his brothers before he was inside the dilapidated dwelling  alls well muttered almayer to himself taking some loose java tobacco from a drawer in the table now if anything comes out i am clear i asked the man to go up the river i urged him he will say so himself good  he began to charge the china bowl of his pipe a pipe with a long cherry stem and a curved mouthpiece pressing the tobacco down with his thumb and thinking no i shant see her again dont want to i will give her a good start then go in chaseand send an express boat after father yes thats it  he approached the door of the office and said holding his pipe away from his lips  good luck to you mrs willems dont lose any time you may get along by the bushes the fence there is out of repair dont lose time dont forget that it is a matter of    life and death and dont forget that i know nothing i trust you  he heard inside a noise as of a chestlid falling down she made a few steps then a sigh profound and long and some faint words which he did not catch he moved away from the door on tiptoe kicked off his slippers in a corner of the verandah then entered the passage puffing at his pipe entered cautiously in a gentle creaking of planks and turned into a curtained entrance to the left there was a big room on the floor a small binnacle lampthat had found its way to the house years ago from the lumberroom of the flashdid duty for a nightlight it glimmered very small and dull in the great darkness almayer walked to it and picking it up revived the flame by pulling the wick with his fingers which he shook directly after with a grimace of pain sleeping shapes coveredhead and allwith white sheets lay about on the mats on the floor in the middle of the room a small cot under a square white mosquito net stoodthe only piece of furniture between the four wallslooking like an altar of transparent marble in a gloomy temple a woman halflying on the floor with her head dropped on her arms which were crossed on the foot of the cot woke up as almayer strode over her outstretched legs she sat up without a word leaning forward and clasping her knees stared down with sad eyes full of sleep  almayer the smoky light in one hand his pipe in the other stood before the curtained cot looking at his daughterat his little ninaat that part of himself at that small and unconscious particle of humanity that seemed to him to contain all his soul and it was as if he had been bathed in a bright and warm wave of tenderness in a tenderness greater than the world more precious than life the only thing real living sweet tangible beautiful and safe amongst the elusive the distorted and menacing shadows of existence on his face lit up indistinctly by the short yellow flame of the lamp came a look of rapt attention while he looked into her future and he could see things there things charming and splendid passing before him in a magic unrolling of resplendent pictures pictures of events brilliant happy inexpressibly glorious that would make up her life he would do it he would do it he would he wouldfor that child and as he stood in the still night lost in his enchanting and gorgeous dreams while the ascending thin thread of tobacco smoke spread into a faint bluish cloud above his head he appeared strangely impressive and ecstatic like a devout and mystic worshipper adoring transported and mute burning incense before a shrine a diaphanous shrine of a childidol with closed eyes before a pure and vaporous shrine of a small godfragile powerless unconscious and sleeping  when ali roused by loud and repeated shouting of his name stumbled outside the door of his hut he saw a narrow streak of trembling gold above the forests and a pale sky with faded stars overhead signs of the coming day his master stood before the door waving a piece of paper in his hand and shouting excitedlyquick ali quick when he saw his servant he rushed forward and pressing the paper on him objurgated him in tones which induced ali to think that something awful had happened to hurry up and get the whaleboat ready to go immediatelyat once at onceafter captain lingard ali remonstrated agitated also having caught the infection of distracted haste  if must go quick better canoe whaleboat no can catch same as small canoe  no no whaleboat whaleboat you dolt you wretch howled almayer with all the appearance of having gone mad call the men get along with it fly  and ali rushed about the courtyard kicking the doors of huts open to put his head in and yell frightfully inside and as he dashed from hovel to hovel men shivering and sleepy were coming out looking after him stupidly while they scratched their ribs with bewildered apathy it was hard work to put them in motion they wanted time to stretch themselves and to shiver a little some wanted food one said he was sick nobody knew where the rudder was ali darted here and there ordering abusing pushing one then another and stopping in his exertions at times to wring his hands hastily and groan because the whaleboat was much slower than the worst canoe and his master would not listen to his protestations  almayer saw the boat go off at last pulled anyhow by men that were cold hungry and sulky and he remained on the jetty watching it down the reach it was broad day then and the sky was perfectly cloudless almayer went up to the house for a moment his household was all astir and wondering at the strange disappearance of the sirani woman who had taken her child and had left her luggage almayer spoke to no one got his revolver and went down to the river again he jumped into a small canoe and paddled himself towards the schooner he worked very leisurely but as soon as he was nearly alongside he began to hail the silent craft with the tone and appearance of a man in a tremendous hurry  schooner ahoy schooner ahoy he shouted  a row of blank faces popped up above the bulwark after a while a man with a woolly head of hair said  sir  the mate the mate call him steward said almayer excitedly making a frantic grab at a rope thrown down to him by somebody  in less than a minute the mate put his head over he asked surprised  what can i do for you mr almayer  let me have the gig at once mr swanat once i ask in captain lingards name i must have it matter of life and death  the mate was impressed by almayers agitation  you shall have it sir    man the gig there bear a hand serang    its hanging astern mr almayer he said looking down again get into it sir the men are coming down by the painter  by the time almayer had clambered over into the stern sheets four calashes were in the boat and the oars were being passed over the taffrail the mate was looking on suddenly he said  is it dangerous work do you want any help i would come     yes yes cried almayer come along dont lose a moment go and get your revolver hurry up hurry up  yet notwithstanding his feverish anxiety to be off he lolled back very quiet and unconcerned till the mate got in and passing over the thwarts sat down by his side then he seemed to wake up and called out  let golet go the painter  let go the painterthe painter yelled the bowman jerking at it  people on board also shouted let go to one another till it occurred at last to somebody to cast off the rope and the boat drifted rapidly away from the schooner in the sudden silencing of all voices  almayer steered the mate sat by his side pushing the cartridges into the chambers of his revolver when the weapon was loaded he asked  what is it are you after somebody  yes said almayer curtly with his eyes fixed ahead on the river we must catch a dangerous man  i like a bit of a chase myself declared the mate and then discouraged by almayers aspect of severe thoughtfulness said nothing more  nearly an hour passed the calashes stretched forward head first and lay back with their faces to the sky alternately in a regular swing that sent the boat flying through the water and the two sitters very upright in the stern sheets swayed rhythmically a little at every stroke of the long oars plied vigorously  the mate observed the tide is with us  the current always runs down in this river said almayer  yesi know retorted the other but it runs faster on the ebb look by the land at the way we get over the ground a fiveknot current here i should say  hm growled almayer then suddenly there is a passage between two islands that will save us four miles but at low water the two islands in the dry season are like one with only a mud ditch between them still its worth trying  ticklish job that on a falling tide said the mate coolly you know best whether theres time to get through  i will try said almayer watching the shore intently look out now  he tugged hard at the starboard yokeline  lay in your oars shouted the mate  the boat swept round and shot through the narrow opening of a creek that broadened out before the craft had time to lose its way  out oars    just room enough muttered the mate  it was a sombre creek of black water speckled with the gold of scattered sunlight falling through the boughs that met overhead in a soaring restless arc full of gentle whispers passing tremulous aloft amongst the thick leaves the creepers climbed up the trunks of serried trees that leaned over looking insecure and undermined by floods which had eaten away the earth from under their roots and the pungent acrid smell of rotting leaves of flowers of blossoms and plants dying in that poisonous and cruel gloom where they pined for sunshine in vain seemed to lay heavy to press upon the shiny and stagnant water in its tortuous windings amongst the everlasting and invincible shadows  almayer looked anxious he steered badly several times the blades of the oars got foul of the bushes on one side or the other checking the way of the gig during one of those occurrences while they were getting clear one of the calashes said something to the others in a rapid whisper they looked down at the water so did the mate  hallo he exclaimed eh mr almayer look the water is running out see there we will be caught  back back we must go back cried almayer  perhaps better go on  no back back  he pulled at the steering line and ran the nose of the boat into the bank time was lost again in getting clear  give way men give way urged the mate anxiously  the men pulled with set lips and dilated nostrils breathing hard  too late said the mate suddenly the oars touch the bottom already we are done  the boat stuck the men laid in the oars and sat panting with crossed arms  yes we are caught said almayer composedly that is unlucky  the water was falling round the boat the mate watched the patches of mud coming to the surface then in a moment he laughed and pointing his finger at the creek  look he said the blamed river is running away from us heres the last drop of water clearing out round that bend  almayer lifted his head the water was gone and he looked only at a curved track of mudof mud soft and black hiding fever rottenness and evil under its level and glazed surface  we are in for it till the evening he said with cheerful resignation i did my best couldnt help it  we must sleep the day away said the mate theres nothing to eat he added gloomily  almayer stretched himself in the stern sheets the malays curled down between thwarts  well im jiggered said the mate starting up after a long pause i was in a devil of a hurry to go and pass the day stuck in the mud heres a holiday for you well well  they slept or sat unmoving and patient as the sun mounted higher the breeze died out and perfect stillness reigned in the empty creek a troop of longnosed monkeys appeared and crowding on the outer boughs contemplated the boat and the motionless men in it with grave and sorrowful intensity disturbed now and then by irrational outbreaks of mad gesticulation a little bird with sapphire breast balanced a slender twig across a slanting beam of light and flashed in it to and fro like a gem dropped from the sky his minute round eye stared at the strange and tranquil creatures in the boat after a while he sent out a thin twitter that sounded impertinent and funny in the solemn silence of the great wilderness in the great silence full of struggle and death    chapter three  on lingards departure solitude and silence closed round willems the cruel solitude of one abandoned by men the reproachful silence which surrounds an outcast ejected by his kind the silence unbroken by the slightest whisper of hope an immense and impenetrable silence that swallows up without echo the murmur of regret and the cry of revolt the bitter peace of the abandoned clearings entered his heart in which nothing could live now but the memory and hate of his past not remorse in the breast of a man possessed by the masterful consciousness of his individuality with its desires and its rights by the immovable conviction of his own importance of an importance so indisputable and final that it clothes all his wishes endeavours and mistakes with the dignity of unavoidable fate there could be no place for such a feeling as that of remorse  the days passed they passed unnoticed unseen in the rapid blaze of glaring sunrises in the short glow of tender sunsets in the crushing oppression of high noons without a cloud how many days twothreeor more he did not know to him since lingard had gone the time seemed to roll on in profound darkness all was night within him all was gone from his sight he walked about blindly in the deserted courtyards amongst the empty houses that perched high on their posts looked down inimically on him a white stranger a man from other lands seemed to look hostile and mute out of all the memories of native life that lingered between their decaying walls his wandering feet stumbled against the blackened brands of extinct fires kicking up a light black dust of cold ashes that flew in drifting clouds and settled to leeward on the fresh grass sprouting from the hard ground between the shade trees he moved on and on ceaseless unresting in widening circles in zigzagging paths that led to no issue he struggled on wearily with a set distressed face behind which in his tired brain seethed his thoughts restless sombre tangled chilling horrible and venomous like a nestful of snakes  from afar the bleared eyes of the old serving woman the sombre gaze of aissa followed the gaunt and tottering figure in its unceasing prowl along the fences between the houses amongst the wild luxuriance of riverside thickets those three human beings abandoned by all were like shipwrecked people left on an insecure and slippery ledge by the retiring tide of an angry sealistening to its distant roar living anguished between the menace of its return and the hopeless horror of their solitudein the midst of a tempest of passion of regret of disgust of despair the breath of the storm had cast two of them there robbed of everythingeven of resignation the third the decrepit witness of their struggle and their torture accepted her own dull conception of facts of strength and youth gone of her useless old age of her last servitude of being thrown away by her chief by her nearest to use up the last and worthless remnant of flickering life between those two incomprehensible and sombre outcasts a shrivelled an unmoved a passive companion of their disaster  to the river willems turned his eyes like a captive that looks fixedly at the door of his cell if there was any hope in the world it would come from the river by the river for hours together he would stand in sunlight while the sea breeze sweeping over the lonely reach fluttered his ragged garments the keen salt breeze that made him shiver now and then under the flood of intense heat he looked at the brown and sparkling solitude of the flowing water of the water flowing ceaseless and free in a soft cool murmur of ripples at his feet the world seemed to end there the forests of the other bank appeared unattainable enigmatical for ever beyond reach like the stars of heavenand as indifferent above and below the forests on his side of the river came down to the water in a serried multitude of tall immense trees towering in a great spread of twisted boughs above the thick undergrowth great solid trees looking sombre severe and malevolently stolid like a giant crowd of pitiless enemies pressing round silently to witness his slow agony he was alone small crushed he thought of escapeof something to be done what a raft he imagined himself working at it feverishly desperately cutting down trees fastening the logs together and then drifting down with the current down to the sea into the straits there were ships thereships help white men men like himself good men who would rescue him take him away take him far away where there was trade and houses and other men that could understand him exactly appreciate his capabilities where there was proper food and money where there were beds knives forks carriages brass bands cool drinks churches with welldressed people praying in them he would pray also the superior land of refined delights where he could sit on a chair eat his tiffin off a white tablecloth nod to fellowsgood fellows he would be popular always waswhere he could be virtuous correct do business draw a salary smoke cigars buy things in shopshave boots    be happy free become rich o god what was wanted cut down a few trees no one would do they used to make canoes by burning out a tree trunk he had heard yes one would do one tree to cut down    he rushed forward and suddenly stood still as if rooted in the ground he had a pocketknife  and he would throw himself down on the ground by the riverside he was tired exhausted as if that raft had been made the voyage accomplished the fortune attained a glaze came over his staring eyes over his eyes that gazed hopelessly at the rising river where big logs and uprooted trees drifted in the shine of midstream a long procession of black and ragged specks he could swim out and drift away on one of these trees anything to escape anything any risk he could fasten himself up between the dead branches he was torn by desire by fear his heart was wrung by the faltering of his courage he turned over face downwards his head on his arms he had a terrible vision of shadowless horizons where the blue sky and the blue sea met or a circular and blazing emptiness where a dead tree and a dead man drifted together endlessly up and down upon the brilliant undulations of the straits no ships there only death and the river led to it  he sat up with a profound groan  yes death why should he die no better solitude better hopeless waiting alone alone no he was not alone he saw death looking at him from everywhere from the bushes from the cloudshe heard her speaking to him in the murmur of the river filling the space touching his heart his brain with a cold hand he could see and think of nothing else he saw itthe sure deatheverywhere he saw it so close that he was always on the point of throwing out his arms to keep it off it poisoned all he saw all he did the miserable food he ate the muddy water he drank it gave a frightful aspect to sunrises and sunsets to the brightness of hot noon to the cooling shadows of the evenings he saw the horrible form among the big trees in the network of creepers in the fantastic outlines of leaves of the great indented leaves that seemed to be so many enormous hands with big broad palms with stiff fingers outspread to lay hold of him hands gently stirring or hands arrested in a frightful immobility with a stillness attentive and watching for the opportunity to take him to enlace him to strangle him to hold him till he died hands that would hold him dead that would never let go that would cling to his body for ever till it perisheddisappeared in their frantic and tenacious grasp  and yet the world was full of life all the things all the men he knew existed moved breathed and he saw them in a long perspective far off diminished distinct desirable unattainable precious    lost for ever round him ceaselessly there went on without a sound the mad turmoil of tropical life after he had died all this would remain he wanted to clasp to embrace solid things he had an immense craving for sensations for touching pressing seeing handling holding on to all these things all this would remainremain for years for ages for ever after he had miserably died there all this would remain would live would exist in joyous sunlight would breathe in the coolness of serene nights what for then he would be dead he would be stretched upon the warm moisture of the ground feeling nothing seeing nothing knowing nothing he would lie stiff passive rotting slowly while over him under him through himunopposed busy hurriedthe endless and minute throngs of insects little shining monsters of repulsive shapes with horns with claws with pincers would swarm in streams in rushes in eager struggle for his body would swarm countless persistent ferocious and greedytill there would remain nothing but the white gleam of bleaching bones in the long grass in the long grass that would shoot its feathery heads between the bare and polished ribs there would be that only left of him nobody would miss him no one would remember him  nonsense it could not be there were ways out of this somebody would turn up some human beings would come he would speak entreatuse force to extort help from them he felt strong he was very strong he would    the discouragement the conviction of the futility of his hopes would return in an acute sensation of pain in his heart he would begin again his aimless wanderings he tramped till he was ready to drop without being able to calm by bodily fatigue the trouble of his soul there was no rest no peace within the cleared grounds of his prison there was no relief but in the black release of sleep of sleep without memory and without dreams in the sleep coming brutal and heavy like the lead that kills to forget in annihilating sleep to tumble headlong as if stunned out of daylight into the night of oblivion was for him the only the rare respite from this existence which he lacked the courage to endureor to end  he lived he struggled with the inarticulate delirium of his thoughts under the eyes of the silent aissa she shared his torment in the poignant wonder in the acute longing in the despairing inability to understand the cause of his anger and of his repulsion the hate of his looks the mystery of his silence the menace of his rare wordsof those words in the speech of white people that were thrown at her with rage with contempt with the evident desire to hurt her to hurt her who had given herself her lifeall she had to giveto that white man to hurt her who had wanted to show him the way to true greatness who had tried to help him in her womans dream of everlasting enduring unchangeable affection from the short contact with the whites in the crashing collapse of her old life there remained with her the imposing idea of irresistible power and of ruthless strength she had found a man of their raceand with all their qualities all whites are alike but this mans heart was full of anger against his own people full of anger existing there by the side of his desire of her and to her it had been an intoxication of hope for great things born in the proud and tender consciousness of her influence she had heard the passing whisper of wonder and fear in the presence of his hesitation of his resistance of his compromises and yet with a womans belief in the durable steadfastness of hearts in the irresistible charm of her own personality she had pushed him forward trusting the future blindly hopefully sure to attain by his side the ardent desire of her life if she could only push him far beyond the possibility of retreat she did not know and could not conceive anything of hisso exaltedideals she thought the man a warrior and a chief ready for battle violence and treachery to his own peoplefor her what more natural was he not a great strong man those two surrounded each by the impenetrable wall of their aspirations were hopelessly alone out of sight out of earshot of each other each the centre of dissimilar and distant horizons standing each on a different earth under a different sky she remembered his words his eyes his trembling lips his outstretched hands she remembered the great the immeasurable sweetness of her surrender that beginning of her power which was to last until death he remembered the quaysides and the warehouses the excitement of a life in a whirl of silver coins the glorious uncertainty of a money hunt his numerous successes the lost possibilities of wealth and consequent glory she a woman was the victim of her heart of her womans belief that there is nothing in the world but lovethe everlasting thing he was the victim of his strange principles of his continence of his blind belief in himself of his solemn veneration for the voice of his boundless ignorance  in a moment of his idleness of suspense of discouragement she had comethat creatureand by the touch of her hand had destroyed his future his dignity of a clever and civilized man had awakened in his breast the infamous thing which had driven him to what he had done and to end miserably in the wilderness and be forgotten or else remembered with hate or contempt he dared not look at her because now whenever he looked at her his thought seemed to touch crime like an outstretched hand she could only look at himand at nothing else what else was there she followed him with a timorous gaze with a gaze for ever expecting patient and entreating and in her eyes there was the wonder and desolation of an animal that knows only suffering of the incomplete soul that knows pain but knows not hope that can find no refuge from the facts of life in the illusory conviction of its dignity of an exalted destiny beyond in the heavenly consolation of a belief in the momentous origin of its hate  for the first three days after lingard went away he would not even speak to her she preferred his silence to the sound of hated and incomprehensible words he had been lately addressing to her with a wild violence of manner passing at once into complete apathy and during these three days he hardly ever left the river as if on that muddy bank he had felt himself nearer to his freedom he would stay late he would stay till sunset he would look at the glow of gold passing away amongst sombre clouds in a bright red flush like a splash of warm blood it seemed to him ominous and ghastly with a foreboding of violent death that beckoned him from everywhereeven from the sky  one evening he remained by the riverside long after sunset regardless of the night mist that had closed round him had wrapped him up and clung to him like a wet windingsheet a slight shiver recalled him to his senses and he walked up the courtyard towards his house aissa rose from before the fire that glimmered red through its own smoke which hung thickening under the boughs of the big tree she approached him from the side as he neared the plankway of the house he saw her stop to let him begin his ascent in the darkness her figure was like the shadow of a woman with clasped hands put out beseechingly he stoppedcould not help glancing at her in all the sombre gracefulness of the straight figure her limbs featuresall was indistinct and vague but the gleam of her eyes in the faint starlight he turned his head away and moved on he could feel her footsteps behind him on the bending planks but he walked up without turning his head he knew what she wanted she wanted to come in there he shuddered at the thought of what might happen in the impenetrable darkness of that house if they were to find themselves aloneeven for a moment he stopped in the doorway and heard her say  let me come in why this anger why this silence    let me watch    by your side    have i not watched faithfully did harm ever come to you when you closed your eyes while i was by    i have waited   i have waited for your smile for your words    i can wait no more   look at me    speak to me is there a bad spirit in you a bad spirit that has eaten up your courage and your love let me touch you forget all    all forget the wicked hearts the angry faces    and remember only the day i came to you    to you o my heart o my life  the pleading sadness of her appeal filled the space with the tremor of her low tones that carried tenderness and tears into the great peace of the sleeping world all around them the forests the clearings the river covered by the silent veil of night seemed to wake up and listen to her words in attentive stillness after the sound of her voice had died out in a stifled sigh they appeared to listen yet and nothing stirred among the shapeless shadows but the innumerable fireflies that twinkled in changing clusters in gliding pairs in wandering and solitary pointslike the glimmering drift of scattered stardust  willems turned round slowly reluctantly as if compelled by main force her face was hidden in her hands and he looked above her bent head into the sombre brilliance of the night it was one of those nights that give the impression of extreme vastness when the sky seems higher when the passing puffs of tepid breeze seem to bring with them faint whispers from beyond the stars the air was full of sweet scent of the scent charming penetrating and violent like the impulse of love he looked into that great dark place odorous with the breath of life with the mystery of existence renewed fecund indestructible and he felt afraid of his solitude of the solitude of his body of the loneliness of his soul in the presence of this unconscious and ardent struggle of this lofty indifference of this merciless and mysterious purpose perpetuating strife and death through the march of ages for the second time in his life he felt in a sudden sense of his significance the need to send a cry for help into the wilderness and for the second time he realized the hopelessness of its unconcern he could shout for help on every sideand nobody would answer he could stretch out his hands he could call for aid for support for sympathy for reliefand nobody would come nobody there was no one therebut that woman  his heart was moved softened with pity at his own abandonment his anger against her against her who was the cause of all his misfortunes vanished before his extreme need for some kind of consolation perhapsif he must resign himself to his fateshe might help him to forget to forget for a moment in an access of despair so profound that it seemed like the beginning of peace he planned the deliberate descent from his pedestal the throwing away of his superiority of all his hopes of old ambitions of the ungrateful civilization for a moment forgetfulness in her arms seemed possible and lured by that possibility the semblance of renewed desire possessed his breast in a burst of reckless contempt for everything outside himselfin a savage disdain of earth and of heaven he said to himself that he would not repent the punishment for his only sin was too heavy there was no mercy under heaven he did not want any he thought desperately that if he could find with her again the madness of the past the strange delirium that had changed him that had worked his undoing he would be ready to pay for it with an eternity of perdition he was intoxicated by the subtle perfumes of the night he was carried away by the suggestive stir of the warm breeze he was possessed by the exaltation of the solitude of the silence of his memories in the presence of that figure offering herself in a submissive and patient devotion coming to him in the name of the past in the name of those days when he could see nothing think of nothing desire nothingbut her embrace  he took her suddenly in his arms and she clasped her hands round his neck with a low cry of joy and surprise he took her in his arms and waited for the transport for the madness for the sensations remembered and lost and while she sobbed gently on his breast he held her and felt cold sick tired exasperated with his failureand ended by cursing himself she clung to him trembling with the intensity of her happiness and her love he heard her whisperingher face hidden on his shoulderof past sorrow of coming joy that would last for ever of her unshaken belief in his love she had always believed always even while his face was turned away from her in the dark days while his mind was wandering in his own land amongst his own people but it would never wander away from her any more now it had come back he would forget the cold faces and the hard hearts of the cruel people what was there to remember nothing was it not so     he listened hopelessly to the faint murmur he stood still and rigid pressing her mechanically to his breast while he thought that there was nothing for him in the world he was robbed of everything robbed of his passion of his liberty of forgetfulness of consolation she wild with delight whispered on rapidly of love of light of peace of long years    he looked drearily above her head down into the deeper gloom of the courtyard and all at once it seemed to him that he was peering into a sombre hollow into a deep black hole full of decay and of whitened bones into an immense and inevitable grave full of corruption where sooner or later he must unavoidably fall  in the morning he came out early and stood for a time in the doorway listening to the light breathing behind himin the house she slept he had not closed his eyes through all that night he stood swayingthen leaned against the lintel of the door he was exhausted done up fancied himself hardly alive he had a disgusted horror of himself that as he looked at the level sea of mist at his feet faded quickly into dull indifference it was like a sudden and final decrepitude of his senses of his body of his thoughts standing on the high platform he looked over the expanse of low night fog above which here and there stood out the feathery heads of tall bamboo clumps and the round tops of single trees resembling small islets emerging black and solid from a ghostly and impalpable sea upon the faintly luminous background of the eastern sky the sombre line of the great forests bounded that smooth sea of white vapours with an appearance of a fantastic and unattainable shore  he looked without seeing anythingthinking of himself before his eyes the light of the rising sun burst above the forest with the suddenness of an explosion he saw nothing then after a time he murmured with convictionspeaking half aloud to himself in the shock of the penetrating thought  i am a lost man  he shook his hand above his head in a gesture careless and tragic then walked down into the mist that closed above him in shining undulations under the first breath of the morning breeze    chapter four  willems moved languidly towards the river then retraced his steps to the tree and let himself fall on the seat under its shade on the other side of the immense trunk he could hear the old woman moving about sighing loudly muttering to herself snapping dry sticks blowing up the fire after a while a whiff of smoke drifted round to where he sat it made him feel hungry and that feeling was like a new indignity added to an intolerable load of humiliations he felt inclined to cry he felt very weak he held up his arm before his eyes and watched for a little while the trembling of the lean limb skin and bone by god how thin he was    he had suffered from fever a good deal and now he thought with tearful dismay that lingard although he had sent him foodand what food great lord a little rice and dried fish quite unfit for a white manhad not sent him any medicine did the old savage think that he was like the wild beasts that are never ill he wanted quinine  he leaned the back of his head against the tree and closed his eyes he thought feebly that if he could get hold of lingard he would like to flay him alive but it was only a blurred a short and a passing thought his imagination exhausted by the repeated delineations of his own fate had not enough strength left to grip the idea of revenge he was not indignant and rebellious he was cowed he was cowed by the immense cataclysm of his disaster like most men he had carried solemnly within his breast the whole universe and the approaching end of all things in the destruction of his own personality filled him with paralyzing awe everything was toppling over he blinked his eyes quickly and it seemed to him that the very sunshine of the morning disclosed in its brightness a suggestion of some hidden and sinister meaning in his unreasoning fear he tried to hide within himself he drew his feet up his head sank between his shoulders his arms hugged his sides under the high and enormous tree soaring superbly out of the mist in a vigorous spread of lofty boughs with a restless and eager flutter of its innumerable leaves in the clear sunshine he remained motionless huddled up on his seat terrified and still  willems gaze roamed over the ground and then he watched with idiotic fixity half a dozen black ants entering courageously a tuft of long grass which to them must have appeared a dark and a dangerous jungle suddenly he thought there must be something dead in there some dead insect death everywhere he closed his eyes again in an access of trembling pain death everywherewherever one looks he did not want to see the ants he did not want to see anybody or anything he sat in the darkness of his own making reflecting bitterly that there was no peace for him he heard voices now    illusion misery torment who would come who would speak to him what business had he to hear voices    yet he heard them faintly from the river faintly as if shouted far off over there came the words we come back soon    delirium and mockery who would come back nobody ever comes back fever comes back he had it on him this morning that was it    he heard unexpectedly the old woman muttering something near by she had come round to his side of the tree he opened his eyes and saw her bent back before him she stood with her hand shading her eyes looking towards the landingplace then she glided away she had seenand now she was going back to her cooking a woman incurious expecting nothing without fear and without hope  she had gone back behind the tree and now willems could see a human figure on the path to the landingplace it appeared to him to be a woman in a red gown holding some heavy bundle in her arms it was an apparition unexpected familiar and odd he cursed through his teeth    it had wanted only this see things like that in broad daylight he was very badvery bad    he was horribly scared at this awful symptom of the desperate state of his health  this scare lasted for the space of a flash of lightning and in the next moment it was revealed to him that the woman was real that she was coming towards him that she was his wife he put his feet down to the ground quickly but made no other movement his eyes opened wide he was so amazed that for a time he absolutely forgot his own existence the only idea in his head was why on earth did she come here  joanna was coming up the courtyard with eager hurried steps she carried in her arms the child wrapped up in one of almayers white blankets that she had snatched off the bed at the last moment before leaving the house she seemed to be dazed by the sun in her eyes bewildered by her strange surroundings she moved on looking quickly right and left in impatient expectation of seeing her husband at any moment then approaching the tree she perceived suddenly a kind of a driedup yellow corpse sitting very stiff on a bench in the shade and looking at her with big eyes that were alive that was her husband  she stopped dead short they stared at one another in profound stillness with astounded eyes with eyes maddened by the memories of things far off that seemed lost in the lapse of time their looks crossed passed each other and appeared to dart at them through fantastic distances to come straight from the incredible  looking at him steadily she came nearer and deposited the blanket with the child in it on the bench little louis after howling with terror in the darkness of the river most of the night now slept soundly and did not wake willems eyes followed his wife his head turning slowly after her he accepted her presence there with a tired acquiescence in its fabulous improbability anything might happen what did she come for she was part of the general scheme of his misfortune he half expected that she would rush at him pull his hair and scratch his face why not anything might happen in an exaggerated sense of his great bodily weakness he felt somewhat apprehensive of possible assault at any rate she would scream at him he knew her of old she could screech he had thought that he was rid of her for ever she came now probably to see the end     suddenly she turned and embracing him slid gently to the ground  this startled him with her forehead on his knees she sobbed noiselessly he looked down dismally at the top of her head what was she up to he had not the strength to moveto get away he heard her whispering something and bent over to listen he caught the word forgive  that was what she came for all that way women are queer forgive not he    all at once this thought darted through his brain how did she come in a boat boat boat  he shouted boat and jumped up knocking her over before she had time to pick herself up he pounced upon her and was dragging her up by the shoulders no sooner had she regained her feet than she clasped him tightly round the neck covering his face his eyes his mouth his nose with desperate kisses he dodged his head about shaking her arms trying to keep her off to speak to ask her    she came in a boat boat boat    they struggled and swung round tramping in a semicircle he blurted out leave off listen while he tore at her hands this meeting of lawful love and sincere joy resembled fight louis willems slept peacefully under his blanket  at last willems managed to free himself and held her off pressing her arms down he looked at her he had half a suspicion that he was dreaming her lips trembled her eyes wandered unsteadily always coming back to his face he saw her the same as ever in his presence she appeared startled tremulous ready to cry she did not inspire him with confidence he shouted  how did you come  she answered in hurried words looking at him intently  in a big canoe with three men i know everything lingards away i come to save you i know    almayer told me  canoealmayerlies told youyou stammered willems in a distracted manner why youtold what  words failed him he stared at his wife thinking with fear that shestupid womanhad been made a tool in some plan of treachery    in some deadly plot  she began to cry  dont look at me like that peter what have i done i come to begto begforgiveness    savelingarddanger  he trembled with impatience with hope with fear she looked at him and sobbed out in a fresh outburst of grief  oh peter whats the matterare you ill    oh you look so ill     he shook her violently into a terrified and wondering silence  how dare youi am wellperfectly well    wheres that boat will you tell me where that boat isat last the boat i say    you     you hurt me she moaned  he let her go and mastering her terror she stood quivering and looking at him with strange intensity then she made a movement forward but he lifted his finger and she restrained herself with a long sigh he calmed down suddenly and surveyed her with cold criticism with the same appearance as when in the old days he used to find fault with the household expenses she found a kind of fearful delight in this abrupt return into the past into her old subjection  he stood outwardly collected now and listened to her disconnected story her words seemed to fall round him with the distracting clatter of stunning hail he caught the meaning here and there and straightway would lose himself in a tremendous effort to shape out some intelligible theory of events there was a boat a boat a big boat that could take him to sea if necessary that much was clear she brought it why did almayer lie to her so was it a plan to decoy him into some ambush better that than hopeless solitude she had money the men were ready to go anywhere    she said  he interrupted her  where are they now  they are coming directly she answered tearfully directly there are some fishing stakes near herethey said they are coming directly  again she was talking and sobbing together she wanted to be forgiven forgiven what for ah the scene in macassar as if he had time to think of that what did he care what she had done months ago he seemed to struggle in the toils of complicated dreams where everything was impossible yet a matter of course where the past took the aspects of the future and the present lay heavy on his heartseemed to take him by the throat like the hand of an enemy and while she begged entreated kissed his hands wept on his shoulder adjured him in the name of god to forgive to forget to speak the word for which she longed to look at his boy to believe in her sorrow and in her devotionhis eyes in the fascinated immobility of shining pupils looked far away far beyond her beyond the river beyond this land through days weeks months looked into liberty into the future into his triumph    into the great possibility of a startling revenge  he felt a sudden desire to dance and shout he shouted  after all we shall meet again captain lingard  oh no no she cried joining her hands  he looked at her with surprise he had forgotten she was there till the break of her cry in the monotonous tones of her prayer recalled him into that courtyard from the glorious turmoil of his dreams it was very strange to see her therenear him he felt almost affectionate towards her after all she came just in time then he thought that other one i must get away without a scene who knows she may be dangerous    and all at once he felt he hated aissa with an immense hatred that seemed to choke him he said to his wife  wait a moment  she obedient seemed to gulp down some words which wanted to come out he muttered stay here and disappeared round the tree  the water in the iron pan on the cooking fire boiled furiously belching out volumes of white steam that mixed with the thin black thread of smoke the old woman appeared to him through this as if in a fog squatting on her heels impassive and weird  willems came up near and asked where is she  the woman did not even lift her head but answered at once readily as though she had expected the question for a long time  while you were asleep under the tree before the strange canoe came she went out of the house i saw her look at you and pass on with a great light in her eyes a great light and she went towards the place where our master lakamba had his fruit trees when we were many here many many men with arms by their side many    men and talk    and songs     she went on like that raving gently to herself for a long time after willems had left her  willems went back to his wife he came up close to her and found he had nothing to say now all his faculties were concentrated upon his wish to avoid aissa she might stay all the morning in that grove why did those rascally boatmen go he had a physical repugnance to set eyes on her and somewhere at the very bottom of his heart there was a fear of her why what could she do nothing on earth could stop him now he felt strong reckless pitiless and superior to everything he wanted to preserve before his wife the lofty purity of his character he thought she does not know almayer held his tongue about aissa but if she finds out i am lost if it hadnt been for the boy i would    free of both of them    the idea darted through his head not he married    swore solemnly no    sacred tie    looking on his wife he felt for the first time in his life something approaching remorse remorse arising from his conception of the awful nature of an oath before the altar    she mustnt find out    oh for that boat he must run in and get his revolver couldnt think of trusting himself unarmed with those bajow fellows get it now while she is away oh for that boat    he dared not go to the river and hail he thought she might hear me    ill go and get    cartridges    then will be all ready    nothing else no  and while he stood meditating profoundly before he could make up his mind to run to the house joanna pleaded holding to his armpleaded despairingly brokenhearted hopeless whenever she glanced up at his face which to her seemed to wear the aspect of unforgiving rectitude of virtuous severity of merciless justice and she pleaded humblyabashed before him before the unmoved appearance of the man she had wronged in defiance of human and divine laws he heard not a word of what she said till she raised her voice in a final appeal     dont you see i loved you always they told me horrible things about you    my own mother they told meyou have beenyou have been unfaithful to me and i     its a damned lie shouted willems waking up for a moment into righteous indignation  i know i knowbe generousthink of my misery since you went awayoh i could have torn my tongue out    i will never believe anybodylook at the boybe mercifuli could never rest till i found you    saya wordone word    what the devil do you want exclaimed willems looking towards the river wheres that damned boat why did you let them go away you stupid  oh peteri know that in your heart you have forgiven meyou are so generousi want to hear you say so    tell medo you  yes yes said willems impatiently i forgive you dont be a fool  dont go away dont leave me alone here where is the danger i am so frightened    are you alone here sure    let us go away  thats sense said willems still looking anxiously towards the river  she sobbed gently leaning on his arm  let me go he said  he had seen above the steep bank the heads of three men glide along smoothly then where the shore shelved down to the landingplace appeared a big canoe which came slowly to land  here they are he went on briskly i must get my revolver  he made a few hurried paces towards the house but seemed to catch sight of something turned short round and came back to his wife she stared at him alarmed by the sudden change in his face he appeared much discomposed he stammered a little as he began to speak  take the child walk down to the boat and tell them to drop it out of sight quick behind the bushes do you hear quick i will come to you there directly hurry up  peter what is it i wont leave you there is some danger in this horrible place  will you do what i tell you said willems in an irritable whisper  no no no i wont leave you i will not lose you again tell me what is it  from beyond the house came a faint voice singing willems shook his wife by the shoulder  do what i tell you run at once  she gripped his arm and clung to him desperately he looked up to heaven as if taking it to witness of that womans infernal folly  the song grew louder then ceased suddenly and aissa appeared in sight walking slowly her hands full of flowers  she had turned the corner of the house coming out into the full sunshine and the light seemed to leap upon her in a stream brilliant tender and caressing as if attracted by the radiant happiness of her face she had dressed herself for a festive day for the memorable day of his return to her of his return to an affection that would last for ever the rays of the morning sun were caught by the oval clasp of the embroidered belt that held the silk sarong round her waist the dazzling white stuff of her body jacket was crossed by a bar of yellow and silver of her scarf and in the black hair twisted high on her small head shone the round balls of gold pins amongst crimson blossoms and white starshaped flowers with which she had crowned herself to charm his eyes those eyes that were henceforth to see nothing in the world but her own resplendent image and she moved slowly bending her face over the mass of pure white champakas and jasmine pressed to her breast in a dreamy intoxication of sweet scents and of sweeter hopes  she did not seem to see anything stopped for a moment at the foot of the plankway leading to the house then leaving her highheeled wooden sandals there ascended the planks in a light run straight graceful flexible and noiseless as if she had soared up to the door on invisible wings willems pushed his wife roughly behind the tree and made up his mind quickly for a rush to the house to grab his revolver and    thoughts doubts expedients seemed to boil in his brain he had a flashing vision of delivering a stunning blow of tying up that flower bedecked woman in the dark housea vision of things done swiftly with enraged hasteto save his prestige his superioritysomething of immense importance    he had not made two steps when joanna bounded after him caught the back of his ragged jacket tore out a big piece and instantly hooked herself with both hands to the collar nearly dragging him down on his back although taken by surprise he managed to keep his feet from behind she panted into his ear  that woman whos that woman ah thats what those boatmen were talking about i heard them    heard them    heard    in the night they spoke about some woman i dared not understand i would not ask    listen    believe how could i then its true no say no    whos that woman  he swayed tugging forward she jerked at him till the button gave way and then he slipped half out of his jacket and turning round remained strangely motionless his heart seemed to beat in his throat he chokedtried to speakcould not find any words he thought with fury i will kill both of them  for a second nothing moved about the courtyard in the great vivid clearness of the day only down by the landingplace a waringantree all in a blaze of clustering red berries seemed alive with the stir of little birds that filled with the feverish flutter of their feathers the tangle of overloaded branches suddenly the variegated flock rose spinning in a soft whirr and dispersed slashing the sunlit haze with the sharp outlines of stiffened wings mahmat and one of his brothers appeared coming up from the landingplace their lances in their hands to look for their passengers  aissa coming now emptyhanded out of the house caught sight of the two armed men in her surprise she emitted a faint cry vanished back and in a flash reappeared in the doorway with willems revolver in her hand to her the presence of any man there could only have an ominous meaning there was nothing in the outer world but enemies she and the man she loved were alone with nothing round them but menacing dangers she did not mind that for if death came no matter from what hand they would die together  her resolute eyes took in the courtyard in a circular glance she noticed that the two strangers had ceased to advance and now were standing close together leaning on the polished shafts of their weapons the next moment she saw willems with his back towards her apparently struggling under the tree with some one she saw nothing distinctly and unhesitating flew down the plankway calling out i come  he heard her cry and with an unexpected rush drove his wife backwards to the seat she fell on it he jerked himself altogether out of his jacket and she covered her face with the soiled rags he put his lips close to her asking  for the last time will you take the child and go  she groaned behind the unclean ruins of his upper garment she mumbled something he bent lower to hear she was saying  i wont order that woman away i cant look at her  you fool  he seemed to spit the words at her then making up his mind spun round to face aissa she was coming towards them slowly now with a look of unbounded amazement on her face then she stopped and stared at himwho stood there stripped to the waist bareheaded and sombre  some way off mahmat and his brother exchanged rapid words in calm undertones    this was the strong daughter of the holy man who had died the white man is very tall there would be three women and the child to take in the boat besides that white man who had the money     the brother went away back to the boat and mahmat remained looking on he stood like a sentinel the leafshaped blade of his lance glinting above his head  willems spoke suddenly  give me this he said stretching his hand towards the revolver  aissa stepped back her lips trembled she said very low your people  he nodded slightly she shook her head thoughtfully and a few delicate petals of the flowers dying in her hair fell like big drops of crimson and white at her feet  did you know she whispered  no said willems they sent for me  tell them to depart they are accursed what is there between them and youand you who carry my life in your heart  willems said nothing he stood before her looking down on the ground and repeating to himself i must get that revolver away from her at once at once i cant think of trusting myself with those men without firearms i must have it  she asked after gazing in silence at joanna who was sobbing gently  who is she  my wife answered willems without looking up my wife according to our white law which comes from god  your law your god murmured aissa contemptuously  give me this revolver said willems in a peremptory tone he felt an unwillingness to close with her to get it by force  she took no notice and went on  your law    or your lies what am i to believe i camei ran to defend you when i saw the strange men you lied to me with your lips with your eyes you crooked heart    ah she added after an abrupt pause she is the first am i then to be a slave  you may be what you like said willems brutally i am going  her gaze was fastened on the blanket under which she had detected a slight movement she made a long stride towards it willems turned half round his legs seemed to him to be made of lead he felt faint and so weak that for a moment the fear of dying there where he stood before he could escape from sin and disaster passed through his mind in a wave of despair  she lifted up one corner of the blanket and when she saw the sleeping child a sudden quick shudder shook her as though she had seen something inexpressibly horrible she looked at louis willems with eyes fixed in an unbelieving and terrified stare then her fingers opened slowly and a shadow seemed to settle on her face as if something obscure and fatal had come between her and the sunshine she stood looking down absorbed as though she had watched at the bottom of a gloomy abyss the mournful procession of her thoughts  willems did not move all his faculties were concentrated upon the idea of his release and it was only then that the assurance of it came to him with such force that he seemed to hear a loud voice shouting in the heavens that all was over that in another five ten minutes he would step into another existence that all this the woman the madness the sin the regrets all would go rush into the past disappear become as dust as smoke as drifting cloudsas nothing yes all would vanish in the unappeasable past which would swallow up alleven the very memory of his temptation and of his downfall nothing mattered he cared for nothing he had forgotten aissa his wife lingard hudigeverybody in the rapid vision of his hopeful future  after a while he heard aissa saying  a child a child what have i done to be made to devour this sorrow and this grief and while your manchild and the mother lived you told me there was nothing for you to remember in the land from which you came and i thought you could be mine i thought that i would     her voice ceased in a broken murmur and with it in her heart seemed to die the greater and most precious hope of her new life  she had hoped that in the future the frail arms of a child would bind their two lives together in a bond which nothing on earth could break a bond of affection of gratitude of tender respect she the firstthe only one but in the instant she saw the son of that other woman she felt herself removed into the cold the darkness the silence of a solitude impenetrable and immensevery far from him beyond the possibility of any hope into an infinity of wrongs without any redress  she strode nearer to joanna she felt towards that woman anger envy jealousy before her she felt humiliated and enraged she seized the hanging sleeve of the jacket in which joanna was hiding her face and tore it out of her hands exclaiming loudly  let me see the face of her before whom i am only a servant and a slave yawa i see you  her unexpected shout seemed to fill the sunlit space of cleared grounds rise high and run on far into the land over the unstirring treetops of the forests she stood in sudden stillness looking at joanna with surprised contempt  a sirani woman she said slowly in a tone of wonder  joanna rushed at willemsclung to him shrieking defend me peter defend me from that woman  be quiet there is no danger muttered willems thickly  aissa looked at them with scorn god is great i sit in the dust at your feet she exclaimed jeeringly joining her hands above her head in a gesture of mock humility before you i am as nothing she turned to willems fiercely opening her arms wide what have you made of me she cried you lying child of an accursed mother what have you made of me the slave of a slave dont speak your words are worse than the poison of snakes a sirani woman a woman of a people despised by all  she pointed her finger at joanna stepped back and began to laugh  make her stop peter screamed joanna that heathen woman heathen heathen beat her peter  willems caught sight of the revolver which aissa had laid on the seat near the child he spoke in dutch to his wife without moving his head  snatch the boyand my revolver there see run to the boat i will keep her back nows the time  aissa came nearer she stared at joanna while between the short gusts of broken laughter she raved fumbling distractedly at the buckle of her belt  to her to herthe mother of him who will speak of your wisdom of your courage all to her i have nothing nothing take take  she tore the belt off and threw it at joannas feet she flung down with haste the armlets the gold pins the flowers and the long hair released fell scattered over her shoulders framing in its blackness the wild exaltation of her face  drive her off peter drive off the heathen savage persisted joanna she seemed to have lost her head altogether she stamped clinging to willems arm with both her hands  look cried aissa look at the mother of your son she is afraid why does she not go from before my face look at her she is ugly  joanna seemed to understand the scornful tone of the words as aissa stepped back again nearer to the tree she let go her husbands arm rushed at her madly slapped her face then swerving round darted at the child who unnoticed had been wailing for some time and snatching him up flew down to the waterside sending shriek after shriek in an access of insane terror  willems made for the revolver aissa passed swiftly giving him an unexpected push that sent him staggering away from the tree she caught up the weapon put it behind her back and cried  you shall not have it go after her go to meet danger    go to meet death    go unarmed    go with empty hands and sweet words    as you came to me    go helpless and lie to the forests to the sea    to the death that waits for you     she ceased as if strangled she saw in the horror of the passing seconds the halfnaked wildlooking man before her she heard the faint shrillness of joannas insane shrieks for help somewhere down by the riverside the sunlight streamed on her on him on the mute land on the murmuring riverthe gentle brilliance of a serene morning that to her seemed traversed by ghastly flashes of uncertain darkness hate filled the world filled the space between themthe hate of race the hate of hopeless diversity the hate of blood the hate against the man born in the land of lies and of evil from which nothing but misfortune comes to those who are not white and as she stood maddened she heard a whisper near her the whisper of the dead omars voice saying in her ear kill kill  she cried seeing him move  do not come near me    or you die now go while i remember yet    remember     willems pulled himself together for a struggle he dared not go unarmed he made a long stride and saw her raise the revolver he noticed that she had not cocked it and said to himself that even if she did fire she would surely miss go too high it was a stiff trigger he made a step nearersaw the long barrel moving unsteadily at the end of her extended arm he thought this is my time    he bent his knees slightly throwing his body forward and took off with a long bound for a tearing rush  he saw a burst of red flame before his eyes and was deafened by a report that seemed to him louder than a clap of thunder something stopped him short and he stood aspiring in his nostrils the acrid smell of the blue smoke that drifted from before his eyes like an immense cloud    missed by heaven    thought so    and he saw her very far off throwing her arms up while the revolver very small lay on the ground between them    missed    he would go and pick it up now never before did he understand as in that second the joy the triumphant delight of sunshine and of life his mouth was full of something salt and warm he tried to cough spat out    who shrieks in the name of god he dieshe dieswho diesmust pick upnightwhat    night already             many years afterwards almayer was telling the story of the great revolution in sambir to a chance visitor from europe he was a roumanian half naturalist half orchidhunter for commercial purposes who used to declare to everybody in the first five minutes of acquaintance his intention of writing a scientific book about tropical countries on his way to the interior he had quartered himself upon almayer he was a man of some education but he drank his gin neat or only at most would squeeze the juice of half a small lime into the raw spirit he said it was good for his health and with that medicine before him he would describe to the surprised almayer the wonders of european capitals while almayer in exchange bored him by expounding with gusto his unfavourable opinions of sambirs social and political life they talked far into the night across the deal table on the verandah while between them clearwinged small and flabby insects dissatisfied with moonlight streamed in and perished in thousands round the smoky light of the evilsmelling lamp  almayer his face flushed was saying  of course i did not see that i told you i was stuck in the creek on account of fatherscaptain lingardssusceptible temper i am sure i did it all for the best in trying to facilitate the fellows escape but captain lingard was that kind of manyou knowone couldnt argue with just before sunset the water was high enough and we got out of the creek we got to lakambas clearing about dark all very quiet i thought they were gone of course and felt very glad we walked up the courtyardsaw a big heap of something lying in the middle out of that she rose and rushed at us by god    you know those stories of faithful dogs watching their masters corpses    dont let anybody approach    got to beat them offand all that    well pon my word we had to beat her off had to she was like a fury wouldnt let us touch him deadof course should think so shot through the lung on the left side rather high up and at pretty close quarters too for the two holes were small bullet came out through the shoulderblade after we had overpowered heryou cant imagine how strong that woman was it took three of uswe got the body into the boat and shoved off we thought she had fainted then but she got up and rushed into the water after us well i let her clamber in what could i do the rivers full of alligators i will never forget that pull upstream in the night as long as i live she sat in the bottom of the boat holding his head in her lap and now and again wiping his face with her hair there was a lot of blood dried about his mouth and chin and for all the six hours of that journey she kept on whispering tenderly to that corpse    i had the mate of the schooner with me the man said afterwards that he wouldnt go through it againnot for a handful of diamonds and i believed himi did it makes me shiver do you think he heard no i mean somebodysomethingheard     i am a materialist declared the man of science tilting the bottle shakily over the emptied glass  almayer shook his head and went on  nobody saw how it really happened but that man mahmat he always said that he was no further off from them than two lengths of his lance it appears the two women rowed each other while that willems stood between them then mahmat says that when joanna struck her and ran off the other two seemed to become suddenly mad together they rushed here and there mahmat saysthose were his very words i saw her standing holding the pistol that fires many times and pointing it all over the campong i was afraidlest she might shoot me and jumped on one side then i saw the white man coming at her swiftly he came like our master the tiger when he rushes out of the jungle at the spears held by men she did not take aim the barrel of her weapon went like thisfrom side to side but in her eyes i could see suddenly a great fear there was only one shot she shrieked while the white man stood blinking his eyes and very straight till you could count slowly one two three then he coughed and fell on his face the daughter of omar shrieked without drawing breath till he fell i went away then and left silence behind me these things did not concern me and in my boat there was that other woman who had promised me money we left directly paying no attention to her cries we are only poor menand had but a small reward for our trouble thats what mahmat said never varied you ask him yourself hes the man you hired the boats from for your journey up the river  the most rapacious thief i ever met exclaimed the traveller thickly  ah he is a respectable man his two brothers got themselves spearedserved them right they went in for robbing dyak graves gold ornaments in them you know serve them right but he kept respectable and got on aye everybody got onbut i and all through that scoundrel who brought the arabs here  de mortuis nil ni    num muttered almayers guest  i wish you would speak english instead of jabbering in your own language which no one can understand said almayer sulkily  dont be angry hiccoughed the other its latin and its wisdom it means dont waste your breath in abusing shadows no offence there i like you you have a quarrel with providenceso have i i was meant to be a professor whilelook  his head nodded he sat grasping the glass almayer walked up and down then stopped suddenly  yes they all got on but i why i am better than any of them lakamba calls himself a sultan and when i go to see him on business sends that oneeyed fiend of hisbabalatchito tell me that the ruler is asleep and shall sleep for a long time and that babalatchi he is the shahbandar of the stateif you please oh lord shahbandar the pig a vagabond i wouldnt let come up these steps when he first came here    look at abdulla now he lives here becausehe sayshere he is away from white men but he has hundreds of thousands has a house in penang ships what did he not have when he stole my trade from me he knocked everything here into a cocked hat drove father to goldhuntingthen to europe where he disappeared fancy a man like captain lingard disappearing as though he had been a common coolie friends of mine wrote to london asking about him nobody ever heard of him there fancy never heard of captain lingard  the learned gatherer of orchids lifted his head  he was a sensentimental old bucbuccaneer he stammered out i like him im senttal myself  he winked slowly at almayer who laughed  yes i told you about that gravestone yes another hundred and twenty dollars thrown away wish i had them now he would do it and the inscription ha ha ha peter willems delivered by the mercy of god from his enemy what enemyunless captain lingard himself and then it has no sense he was a great manfather wasbut strange in many ways    you havent seen the grave on the top of that hill there on the other side of the river i must show you we will go there  not i said the other no interestin the suntoo tiring    unless you carry me there  as a matter of fact he was carried there a few months afterwards and his was the second white mans grave in sambir but at present he was alive if rather drunk he asked abruptly  and the woman  oh lingard of course kept her and her ugly brat in macassar sinful waste of moneythat devil only knows what became of them since father went home i had my daughter to look after i shall give you a word to mrs vinck in singapore when you go back you shall see my nina there lucky man she is beautiful and i hear so accomplished so     i have heard already twenty    a hundred times about your daughter what ababoutthatthat other one aissa  she oh we kept her here she was mad for a long time in a quiet sort of way father thought a lot of her he gave her a house to live in in my campong she wandered about speaking to nobody unless she caught sight of abdulla when she would have a fit of fury and shriek and curse like anything very often she would disappearand then we all had to turn out and hunt for her because father would worry till she was brought back found her in all kinds of places once in the abandoned campong of lakamba sometimes simply wandering in the bush she had one favourite spot we always made for at first it was ten to one on finding her therea kind of a grassy glade on the banks of a small brook why she preferred that place i cant imagine and such a job to get her away from there had to drag her away by main force then as the time passed she became quieter and more settled like still all my people feared her greatly it was my nina that tamed her you see the child was naturally fearless and used to have her own way so she would go to her and pull at her sarong and order her about as she did everybody finally she i verily believe came to love the child nothing could resist that little oneyou know she made a capital nurse once when the little devil ran away from me and fell into the river off the end of the jetty she jumped in and pulled her out in no time i very nearly died of fright now of course she lives with my serving girls but does what she likes as long as i have a handful of rice or a piece of cotton in the store she shant want for anything you have seen her she brought in the dinner with ali  what that doubledup crone  ah said almayer they age quickly here and long foggy nights spent in the bush will soon break the strongest backsas you will find out yourself soon  dis    disgusting growled the traveller  he dozed off almayer stood by the balustrade looking out at the bluish sheen of the moonlit night the forests unchanged and sombre seemed to hang over the water listening to the unceasing whisper of the great river and above their dark wall the hill on which lingard had buried the body of his late prisoner rose in a black rounded mass upon the silver paleness of the sky almayer looked for a long time at the cleancut outline of the summit as if trying to make out through darkness and distance the shape of that expensive tombstone when he turned round at last he saw his guest sleeping his arms on the table his head on his arms  now look here he shouted slapping the table with the palm of his hand  the naturalist woke up and sat all in a heap staring owlishly  here went on almayer speaking very loud and thumping the table i want to know you who say you have read all the books just tell me    why such infernal things are ever allowed here i am done harm to nobody lived an honest life    and a scoundrel like that is born in rotterdam or some such place at the other end of the world somewhere travels out here robs his employer runs away from his wife and ruins me and my ninahe ruined me i tell youand gets himself shot at last by a poor miserable savage that knows nothing at all about him really wheres the sense of all this wheres your providence wheres the good for anybody in all this the worlds a swindle a swindle why should i suffer what have i done to be treated so  he howled out his string of questions and suddenly became silent the man who ought to have been a professor made a tremendous effort to articulate distinctly  my dear fellow dontdont you see that the babare facthe fact of your existence is offoffensive    ii like youlike     he fell forward on the table and ended his remarks by an unexpected and prolonged snore  almayer shrugged his shoulders and walked back to the balustrade  he drank his own trade gin very seldom but when he did a ridiculously small quantity of the stuff could induce him to assume a rebellious attitude towards the scheme of the universe and now throwing his body over the rail he shouted impudently into the night turning his face towards that faroff and invisible slab of imported granite upon which lingard had thought fit to record gods mercy and willems escape  father was wrongwrong he yelled i want you to smart for it you must smart for it where are you willems hey    hey    where there is no mercy for youi hope  hope repeated in a whispering echo the startled forests the river and the hills and almayer who stood waiting with a smile of tipsy attention on his lips heard no other answer
