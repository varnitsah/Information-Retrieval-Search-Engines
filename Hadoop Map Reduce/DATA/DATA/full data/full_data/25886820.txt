it     authors preface   the title of this work is an index of the performance it is a collection of useful instructions for a young tradesman the world is grown so wise of late or if you will fancy themselves so are so opiniatre as the french well express it so selfwise that i expect some will tell us beforehand they know every thing already and want none of my instructions and to such indeed these instructions are not written  had i not in a few years experience seen many young tradesmen miscarry for want of those very cautions which are here given i should have thought this work needless and i am sure had never gone about to write it but as the contrary is manifest i thought and think still the world greatly wanted it  and be it that those unfortunate creatures that have thus blown themselves up in trade have miscarried for want of knowing or for want of practising what is here offered for their direction whether for want of wit or by too much wit the thing is the same and the direction is equally needful to both  an old experienced pilot sometimes loses a ship by his assurance and over confidence of his knowledge as effectually as a young pilot does by his ignorance and want of experiencethis very thing as i have been informed was the occasion of the fatal disaster in which sir cloudesley shovel and so many hundred brave fellows lost their lives in a moment upon the rocks of scilly1  he that is above informing himself when he is in danger is above pity when he miscarriesa young tradesman who sets up thus full of himself and scorning advice from those who have gone before him like a horse that rushes into the battle is only fearless of danger because he does not understand it  if there is not something extraordinary in the temper and genius of the tradesmen of this age if there is not something very singular in their customs and methods their conduct and behaviour in business also if there is not something different and more dangerous and fatal in the common road of trading and tradesmens management now than ever was before what is the reason that there are so many bankrupts and broken tradesmen now among us more than ever were known before i make no doubt but there is as much trade now and as much gotten by trading as there ever was in this nation at least in our memory and if we will allow other people to judge they will tell us there is much more trade and trade is much more gainful what then must be the reason that the tradesmen cannot live on their trades cannot keep open their shops cannot maintain themselves and families as well now as they could before something extraordinary must be the case  there must be some failure in the tradesmanit can be nowhere elseeither he is less sober and less frugal less cautious of what he does whom he trusts how he lives and how he behaves than tradesmen used to be or he is less industrious less diligent and takes less care and pains in his business or something is the matter it cannot be but if he had the same gain and but the same expense which the former ages suffered tradesmen to thrive with he would certainly thrive as they did there must be something out of order in the foundation he must fail in the essential part or he would not fail in his trade the same causes would have the same effects in all ages the same gain and but the same expense would just leave him in the same place as it would have left his predecessor in the same shop and yet we see one grow rich and the other starve under the very same circumstances  the temper of the times explains the case to every body that pleases but to look into it the expenses of a family are quite different now from what they have been tradesmen cannot live as tradesmen in the same class used to live custom and the manner of all the tradesmen round them command a difference and he that will not do as others do is esteemed as nobody among them and the tradesman is doomed to ruin by the fate of the times  in short there is a fate upon a tradesman either he must yield to the snare of the times or be the jest of the times the young tradesman cannot resist it he must live as others do or lose the credit of living and be run down as if he were bankrupt in a word he must spend more than he can afford to spend and so be undone or not spend it and so be undone  if he lives as others do he breaks because he spends more than he gets if he does not he breaks too because he loses his credit and that is to lose his trade what must he do2  the following directions are calculated for this exigency and to prepare the young tradesman to stem the attacks of those fatal customs which otherwise if he yields to them will inevitably send him the way of all the thoughtless tradesmen that have gone before him  here he will be effectually we hope encouraged to set out well to begin wisely and prudently and to avoid all those rocks which the gay race of tradesmen so frequently suffer shipwreck upon and here he will have a true plan of his own prosperity drawn out for him by which if it be not his own fault he may square his conduct in an unerring manner and fear neither bad fortune nor bad friends i had purposed to give a great many other cautions and directions in this work but it would have spun it out too far and have made it tedious i would indeed have discoursed of some branches of home trade which necessarily embarks the inland tradesman in some parts of foreign business and so makes a merchant of the shopkeeper almost whether he will or no for example almost all the shopkeepers and inland traders in seaport towns or even in the waterside part of london itself are necessarily brought in to be owners of ships and concerned at least in the vessel if not in the voyage some of their trades perhaps relate to or are employed in the building or fitting or furnishing out ships as is the case at shoreham at ipswich yarmouth hull whitby newcastle and the like others are concerned in the cargoes as in the herring fishery at yarmouth and the adjacent ports the colliery at newcastle sunderland c and the like in many other cases  in this case the shopkeeper is sometimes a merchant adventurer whether he will or not and some of his business runs into seaadventures as in the salt trade at sheffield in northumberland and durham and again at limington and again in the coal trade from whitehaven in cumberland to ireland and the like  these considerations urged me to direct due cautions to such tradesmen and such as would be particular to them especially not to launch out in adventures beyond the compass of their stocks3 and withal to manage those things with due wariness but this work had not room for those things and as that sort of amphibious tradesmen for such they are trading both by water and by land are not of the kind with those particularly aimed at in these sheets i thought it was better to leave them quite out than to touch but lightly upon them  i had also designed one chapter or letter to my inland tradesmen upon the most important subject of borrowing money upon interest which is one of the most dangerous things a tradesman is exposed to it is a pleasant thing to a tradesman to see his credit rise and men offer him money to trade with upon so slender a consideration as five per cent interest when he gets ten per cent perhaps twice in the year but it is a snare of the most dangerous kind in the event and has been the ruin of so many tradesmen that though i had not room for it in the work i could not let it pass without this notice in the preface  1 interestmoney eats deep into the tradesmans profits because it is a payment certain whether the tradesman gets or loses and as he may often get double so sometimes he loses and then his interest is a double payment it is a partner with him under this unhappy circumstance namely that it goes halves when he gains but not when he loses  2 the lender calls for his money when he pleases and often comes for it when the borrower can ill spare it and then having launched out in trade on the supposition of so much in stock he is left to struggle with the enlarged trade with a contracted stock and thus he sinks under the weight of it cannot repay the money is dishonoured prosecuted and at last undone by the very loan which he took in to help him interest of money is a dead weight upon the tradesman and as the interest always keeps him low the principal sinks him quite down when that comes to be paid out again payment of interest to a tradesman is like cicero bleeding to death in a warm bath4 the pleasing warmth of the bath makes him die in a kind of dream and not feel himself decay till at last he is exhausted falls into convulsions and expires  a tradesman held up by money at interest is sure to sink at last by the weight of it like a man thrown into the sea with a stone tied about his neck who though he could swim if he was loose drowns in spite of all his struggle  indeed this article would require not a letter but a book by itself and the tragical stories of tradesmen undone by usury are so many and the variety so great that they would make a history by themselves but it must suffice to treat it here only in general and give the tradesmen a warning of it as the trinityhouse pilots warn sailors of a sand by hanging a buoy upon it or as the eddystone lighthouse upon a sunk rock which as the poet says bids men stand off and live come near and die  for a tradesman to borrow money upon interest i take to be like a man going into a house infected with the plague it is not only likely that he may be infected and die but next to a miracle if he escapes  this part being thus hinted at i think i may say of the following sheets that they contain all the directions needful to make the tradesman thrive and if he pleases to listen to them with a temper of mind willing to be directed he must have some uncommon ill luck if he miscarries  footnotes  1

much reason for receiving all such complaints as the above with caution the extravagance of the present in contrast with the frugality of a past age has always been a favourite topic of declamation and appears to have no other foundation than whim indeed it is next to impossible that any great body of men could exist in the circumstances described in the text  3 stock is in this book invariably used for what we express by the term capital  4 cicero is here given by mistake for seneca who thus suffered death by order of the tyrant nero     introduction   being to direct this discourse to the tradesmen of this nation it is needful in order to make the substance of this work and the subject of it agree together that i should in a few words explain the terms and tell the reader who it is we understand by the word tradesman and how he is to be qualified in order to merit the title of complete  this is necessary because the said term tradesman is understood by several people and in several places in a different manner for example in the north of britain and likewise in ireland when you say a tradesman you are understood to mean a mechanic such as a smith a carpenter a shoemaker and the like such as here we call a handicraftsman in like manner abroad they call a tradesman such only as carry goods about from town to town and from market to market or from house to house to sell these in england we call petty chapmen in the north pethers and in our ordinary speech pedlars  but in england and especially in london and the south parts of britain we take it in another sense and in general all sorts of warehousekeepers shopkeepers whether wholesale dealers or retailers of goods are called tradesmen or to explain it by another word trading men such are whether wholesale or retail our grocers mercers linen and woollen drapers blackwellhall factors tobacconists haberdashers whether of hats or small wares glovers hosiers milliners booksellers stationers and all other shopkeepers who do not actually work upon make or manufacture the goods they sell  on the other hand those who make the goods they sell though they do keep shops to sell them are not called tradesmen but handicrafts such as smiths shoemakers founders joiners carpenters carvers turners and the like others who only make or cause to be made goods for other people to sell are called manufacturers and artists c thus distinguished i shall speak of them all as occasion requires taking this general explication to be sufficient and i thus mention it to prevent being obliged to frequent and further particular descriptions as i go on  as there are several degrees of people employed in trade below these such as workmen labourers and servants so there is a degree of traders above them which we call merchants where it is needful to observe that in other countries and even in the north of britain and ireland as the handicraftsmen and artists are called tradesmen so the shopkeepers whom we here call tradesmen are all called merchants nay even the very pedlars are called travelling merchants5 but in england the word merchant is understood of none but such as carry on foreign correspondences importing the goods and growth of other countries and exporting the growth and manufacture of england to other countries or to use a vulgar expression because i am speaking to and of those who use that expression such as trade beyond sea these in england and these only are called merchants by way of honourable distinction these i am not concerned with in this work nor is any part of it directed to them  as the tradesmen are thus distinguished and their several occupations divided into proper classes so are the trades the general commerce of england as it is the most considerable of any nation in the world so that part of it which we call the home or inland trade is equal if not superior to that of any other nation though some of those nations are infinitely greater than england and more populous also as france and germany in particular  i insist that the trade of england is greater and more considerable than that of any other nation for these reasons 1 because england produces more goods as well for home consumption as for foreign exportation and those goods all made of its own produce or manufactured by its own inhabitants than any other nation in the world 2 because england consumes within itself more goods of foreign growth imported from the several countries where they are produced or wrought than any other nation in the world and3 because for the doing this england employs more shipping and more seamen than any other nation and some think than all the other nations of europe  hence besides the great number of wealthy merchants who carry on this great foreign negoce negotium latin business and who by their corresponding with all parts of the world import the growth of all countries hitheri say besides these we have a very great number of considerable dealers whom we call tradesmen who are properly called warehousekeepers who supply the merchants with all the several kinds of manufactures and other goods of the produce of england for exportation and also others who are called wholesalemen who buy and take off from the merchants all the foreign goods which they import these by their corresponding with a like sort of tradesmen in the country convey and hand forward those goods and our own also among those country tradesmen into every corner of the kingdom however remote and by them to the retailers and by the retailer to the last consumer which is the last article of all trade these are the tradesmen understood in this work and for whose service these sheets are made public  having thus described the person whom i understand by the english tradesman it is then needful to inquire into his qualifications and what it is that renders him a finished or complete man in his business  1 that he has a general knowledge of not his own particular trade and business onlythat part indeed well denominates a handicraftsman to be a complete artist but our complete tradesman ought to understand all the inland trade of england so as to be able to turn his hand to any thing or deal in any thing or every thing of the growth and product of his own country or the manufacture of the people as his circumstances in trade or other occasions may require and may if he sees occasion lay down one trade and take up another when he pleases without serving a new apprenticeship to learn it  2 that he not only has a knowledge of the species or kinds of goods but of the places and peculiar countries where those goods whether product or manufacture are to be found that is to say where produced or where made and how to come at them or deal in them at the first hand and to his best advantage  3 that he understands perfectly well all the methods of correspondence returning money or goods for goods to and from every county in england in what manner to be done and in what manner most to advantage what goods are generally bought by barter and exchange and what by payment of money what for present money and what for time what are sold by commission from the makers what bought by factors and by giving commission to buyers in the country and what bought by orders to the maker and the like what markets are the most proper to buy every thing at and where and when and what fairs are proper to go to in order to buy or sell or meet the country dealer at such as sturbridge bristol chester exeter or what marts such as beverly lynn boston gainsborough and the like  in order to complete the english tradesman in this manner the first thing to be done is lay down such general maxims of trade as are fit for his instruction and then to describe the english or british product being the fund of its inland trade whether we mean its produce as the growth of the country or its manufactures as the labour of her people then to acquaint the tradesman with the manner of the circulation where those things are found how and by what methods all those goods are brought to london and from london again conveyed into the country where they are principally bought at best hand and most to the advantage of the buyer and where the proper markets are to dispose of them again when bought  these are the degrees by which the complete tradesman is brought up and by which he is instructed in the principles and methods of his commerce by which he is made acquainted with business and is capable of carrying it on with success after which there is not a man in the universe deserves the title of a complete tradesman like the english shopkeeper  footnotes  5 this misuse of the term merchant continues to exist in scotland to the present day     chapter i  the tradesman in his preparations while an apprentice   the first part of a traders beginning is ordinarily when he is very young i mean when he goes as an apprentice and the notions of trade are scarcely got into his head for boys go apprentices while they are but boys to talk to them in their first three or four years signifies nothing they are rather then to be taught submission to families and subjection to their masters and dutiful attendance in their shops or warehouses and this is not our present business  but after they have entered the fifth or sixth year they may then be entertained with discourses of another nature and as they begin then to look forward beyond the time of their servitude and think of setting up and being for themselves i think then is the time to put them upon useful preparations for the work and to instruct them in such things as may qualify them best to enter upon the world and act for themselves when they are so entered  the first thing a youth in the latter part of his time is to do is to endeavour to gain a good judgment in the wares of all kinds that he is likely to deal inas for example if a draper the quality of cloths if a stationer the quality of papers if a grocer the quality of sugars teas c and so on with all other trades during the first years of a young mans time he of course learns to weigh and measure either liquids or solids to pack up and make bales trusses packages c and to do the coarser and laborious part of business but all that gives him little knowledge in the species and quality of the goods much less a nice judgment in their value and sorts which however is one of the principal things that belong to trade  it is supposed that by this time if his master is a man of considerable business his man is become the eldest apprentice and is taken from the counter and from sweeping the warehouse into the countinghouse where he among other things sees the bills of parcels of goods bought and thereby knows what every thing costs at first hand what gain is made of them and if a miscarriage happens he knows what loss too by which he is led of course to look into the goodness of the goods and see the reason of things if the goods are not to expectation and consequently do not answer the price he sees the reason of that loss and he looks into the goods and sees where and how far they are deficient and in what this if he be careful to make his observations brings him naturally to have a good judgment in the goods  if a young man neglects this part and passes over the season for such improvement he very rarely ever recovers it for this part has its season and that more remarkable than in many other cases and that season lost never comes again a judgment in goods taken in early is never lost and a judgment taken in late is seldom good  if the youth slips this occasion and not minding what is before him goes out of his time without obtaining such a skill as this in the goods he is to deal in he enters into trade without his most useful tools and must use spectacles before his time  for want of this knowledge of the goods he is at a loss in the buying part and is liable to be cheated and imposed upon in the most notorious manner by the sharpsighted world for his want of judgment is a thing that cannot be hid the merchants or manufacturers of whom he buys presently discover him the very boys in the wholesalemens warehouses and in merchants warehouses will play upon him sell him one thing for another show him a worse sort when he calls for a better and asking a higher price for it persuade him it is better and when they have thus bubbled him they triumph over his ignorance when he is gone and expose him to the last degree  besides for want of judgment in the goods he is to buy he often runs a hazard of being cheated to a very great degree and perhaps some time or other a tradesman may be ruined by it or at least ruin his reputation  when i lived abroad i had once a commission sent me from a merchant in london to buy a large parcel of brandy the goods were something out of my way having never bought any in that country before however it happened that i had frequently bought and imported brandies in england and had some judgment in them so much that i ventured to buy without taking a cooper with me which was not usual in that place the first parcel of brandy i saw was very good and i bought freely to the value of about £600 and shipped them for england where they gave very good satisfaction to my employer but i could not complete my commission to my mind in that parcel some days after some merchants who had seen me buy the other and thought me a novice in the business and that i took no cooper to taste the brandy laid a plot for me which indeed was such a plot as i was not in the least aware of and had not the little judgment which i had in the commodity prevented i had been notoriously abused the case was thusthey gave me notice by the same person who helped me to the sight of the first brandy that there was a cellar of extraordinary good brandy at such a place and invited me to see it accordingly i went in an afternoon and tasted the brandy being a large parcel amounting to about £460  i liked the goods very well but the merchant as they called him that is to say the knave appointed to cheat the poor stranger was cunningly out of the way so that no bargain was to be made that night but as i had said that i liked the brandy the same person who brought me an account of them comes to my lodgings to treat with me about the price we did not make many words i bade him the current price which i had bought for some days before and after a few struggles for five crowns atun more he came to my price and his next word was to let me know the gage of the cask and as i had seen the goods already he thought there was nothing to do but to make a bargain and order the goods to be delivered  but young as i was i was too old for that too and told him i could not tell positively how many i should take but that i would come in the afternoon and taste them again and mark out what i wanted he seemed uneasy at that and pretended he had two merchants waiting to see them and he could sell them immediately and i might do him a prejudice if i made him wait and put them off who perhaps might buy in the mean time  i answered him coldly i would not hinder him selling them by any means if he could have a better chapman that i could not come sooner and that i would not be obliged to take the whole parcel nor would i buy any of them without tasting them again he argued much to have me buy them seeing as he said i had tasted them before and liked them very well  i did so said i but i love to have my palate confirm one day what it approved the day before perhaps says he you would have some other persons judgment of them and you are welcome to do so sir with all my heart send any body you please but still he urged for a bargain when the person sent should make his report and then he had his agents ready i understood afterwards to manage the persons i should send  i answered him frankly i had no great judgment but that such as it was i ventured to trust to it i thought i had honest men to deal with and that i should bring nobody to taste them for me but myself  this pleased him and was what he secretly wished and now instead of desiring me to come immediately he told me that seeing i would not buy without seeing the goods again and would not go just then he could not be in the way in the afternoon and so desired i would defer it till next morning which i readily agreed to  in the morning i went but not so soon as i had appointed upon which when i came he seemed offended and said i had hindered himthat he could have sold the whole parcel c i told him i could not have hindered him for that i had told him he should not wait for me but sell them to the first good customer he found he told me he had indeed sold two or three casks but he would not disoblige me so much as to sell the whole parcel before i came this i mention because he made it a kind of a bite upon me that i should not be alarmed at seeing the casks displaced in the cellar  when i came to taste the brandy i began to be surprised i saw the very same casks which i had touched with the markingiron when i was there before but i did not like the brandy by any means but did not yet suspect the least foul play  i went round the whole cellar and i could not mark above three casks which i durst venture to buy the rest apparently showed themselves to be mixed at least i thought so i marked out the three casks and told him my palate had deceived me that the rest of the brandy was not for my turn  i saw the man surprised and turn pale and at first seemed to be very angry that i should as he called it disparage the goodsthat sure i did not understand brandy and the likeand that i should have brought somebody with me that did understand it i answered coldly that if i ventured my money upon my own judgment the hazard was not to the seller but to the buyer and nobody had to do with that if i did not like his goods another whose judgment was better might like them and so there was no harm done in a word he would not let me have the three casks i had marked unless i took more and i would take no moreso we parted but with no satisfaction on his side and i afterwards came to hear that he had sat up all the night with his coopers mixing spirits in every cask whence he drew off a quantity of the right brandy and corrupted it concluding that as i had no judgment to choose by but my own i could not discover it and it came out by his quarrelling with the person who brought me to him for telling him i did not understand the goods upon which presumption he ventured to spoil the whole parcel  i give you this story as a just caution to a young tradesman and to show how necessary it is that a tradesman should have judgment in the goods he buys and how easily he may be imposed upon and abused if he offers to buy upon his own judgment when really it is defective i could enlarge this article with many like examples but i think this may suffice  the next thing i recommend to an apprentice at the conclusion of his time is to acquaint himself with his masters chapmen6 i mean of both kinds as well those he sells to as those he buys of and if he is a factor with his masters employers but what i aim at now is the chapmen and customers whom his master chiefly sells to i need not explain myself not to mean by this the chance customers of a retailers shop for there can be no acquaintance or very little made with them i mean the country shopkeepers or others who buy in parcels and who buy to sell again or export as merchants if the young man comes from his master and has formed no acquaintance or interest among the customers whom his master dealt with he has in short slipt or lost one of the principal ends and reasons of his being an apprentice in which he has spent seven years and perhaps his friends given a considerable sum of money  for a young man coming out of his time to have his shop or warehouse stocked with goods and his customers all to seek will make his beginning infinitely more difficult to him than it would otherwise be and he not only has new customers to seek but has their characters to seek also and knows not who is good and who not till he buys that knowledge by his experience and perhaps sometimes pays too dear for it  it was an odd circumstance of a tradesman in this city a few years ago who being out of his time and going to solicit one of his masters customers to trade with him the chapman did not so much as know him or remember that he had ever heard his name except as he had heard his master call his apprentice jacob i know some masters diligently watch to prevent their apprentices speaking to their customers and to keep them from acquainting themselves with the buyers that when they come out of their times they may not carry the trade away with them  to hinder an apprentice from an acquaintance with the dealers of both sorts is somewhat like labans usage of jacob namely keeping back the beloved rachel whom he served his seven years time for and putting him off with a bleareyed leah in her stead it is indeed a kind of robbing him taking from him the advantage which he served his time for and sending him into the world like a man out of a ship set on shore among savages who instead of feeding him are indeed more ready to eat him up and devour him7  an apprentice who has served out his time faithfully and diligently ought to claim it as a debt to his indentures that his master should let him into an open acquaintance with his customers he does not else perform his promise to teach him the art and mystery of his trade he does not make him master of his business or enable him as he ought to set up in the world for as buying is indeed the first so selling is the last end of trade and the faithful apprentice ought to be fully made acquainted with them both  next to being acquainted with his masters customers and chapmen the apprentice when his time is near expiring ought to acquaint himself with the books that is to say to see and learn his masters method of bookkeeping that he may follow it if the method is good and may learn a better method in time if it is not  the tradesman should not be at a loss how to keep his books when he is to begin his trade that would be to put him to school when he is just come from school his apprenticeship is and ought in justice to be a school to him where he ought to learn every thing that should qualify him for his business at least every thing that his master can teach him and if he finds his master either backward or unwilling to teach him he should complain in time to his own friends that they may some how or other supply the defect  a tradesmans books are his repeating clock which upon all occasions are to tell him how he goes on and how things stand with him in the world there he will know when it is time to go on or when it is time to give over and upon his regular keeping and fully acquainting himself with his books depends at least the comfort of his trade if not the very trade itself if they are not duly posted and if every thing is not carefully entered in them the debtors accounts kept even the cash constantly balanced and the credits all stated the tradesman is like a ship at sea steered without a helm he is all in confusion and knows not what he does or where he is he may be a rich man or a bankruptfor in a word he can give no account of himself to himself much less to any body else  his books being so essential to his trade he that comes out of his time without a perfect knowledge of the method of bookkeeping like a bride undrest is not fit to be married he knows not what to do or what step to take he may indeed have served his time but he has not learned his trade nor is he fit to set up and be the fault in himself for not learning or in his master for not teaching him he ought not to set up till he has gotten some skilful person to put him in a way to do it and make him fully to understand it  it is true there is not a great deal of difficulty in keeping a tradesmans books especially if he be a retailer only but yet even in the meanest trades they ought to know how to keep books but the advice is directed to those who are above the retailer as well as to them if the bookkeeping be small it is the sooner learned and the apprentice is the more to blame if he neglects it besides the objection is much more trifling than the advice the tradesman cannot carry on any considerable trade without books and he must during his apprenticeship prepare himself for business by acquainting himself with every thing needful for his going on with his trade among which that of bookkeeping is absolutely necessary  the last article and in itself essential to a young tradesman is to know how to buy if his master is kind and generous he will consider the justice of this part and let him into the secret of it of his own free will and that before his time is fully expired but if that should not happen as often it does not let the apprentice know that it is one of the most needful things to him that can belong to his apprenticeship and that he ought not to let his time run over his head without getting as much insight into it as possible that therefore he ought to lose no opportunity to get into it even whether his master approves of it or no for as it is a debt due to him from his master to instruct him in it it is highly just he should use all proper means to come at it  indeed the affair in this age between masters and their apprentices stands in a different view from what the same thing was a few years past the state of our apprenticeship is not a state of servitude now and hardly of subjection and their behaviour is accordingly more like gentlemen than tradesmen more like companions to their masters than like servants on the other hand the masters seem to have made over their authority to their apprentices for a sum of money the money taken now with apprentices being most exorbitantly great compared to what it was in former times  now though this does not at all exempt the servant or apprentice from taking care of himself and to qualify himself for business while he is an apprentice yet it is evident that it is no furtherance to apprentices the liberties they take towards the conclusion of their time are so much employed to worse purposes that apprentices do not come out of their times better finished for business and trade than they did formerly but much the worse and though it is not the proper business and design of this work to enlarge on the injustice done both to master and servant by this change of custom yet to bring it to my present purpose it carries this force with it namely that the advice to apprentices to endeavour to finish themselves for business during the time of the indenture is so much the more needful and seasonable  nor is this advice for the service of the master but of the apprentice for if the apprentice neglects this advice if he omits to qualify himself for business as above if he neither will acquaint himself with the customers nor the books nor with the buying part nor gain judgment in the wares he is to deal in the loss is his own not his mastersand indeed he may be said to have served not himself but his masterand both his money and his seven years are all thrown away  footnotes  6 individuals dealt with  7 it would be hard to doubt that defore was sincere in this pleading of the rights of the apprentice but its morality is certainly far from clear the master may have gained customers with difficulty by the exercise of much ingenuity patience and industry or through some peculiar merit of his own indeed it is always to be presumed that a tradesmans customers are attached to him from some of these causes of course it would be hard if his apprentices instead of collecting customers for themselves by the same means seduced away those of his master the true and direct object of an apprenticeship is to acquire a trade not to acquire customers     chapter ii  the tradesmans writing letters   as plainness and a free unconstrained way of speaking is the beauty and excellence of speech so an easy free concise way of writing is the best style for a tradesman he that affects a rumbling and bombast style and fills his letters with long harangues compliments and flourishes should turn poet instead of tradesman and set up for a wit not a shopkeeper hark how such a young tradesman writes out of the country to his wholesaleman in london upon his first setting up  sirthe destinies having so appointed it and my dark stars concurring that i who by nature was framed for better things should be put out to a trade and the gods having been so propitious to me in the time of my servitude that at length the days are expired and i am launched forth into the great ocean of business i thought fit to acquaint you that last month i received my fortune which by my fathers will had been my due two years past at which time i arrived to mans estate and became major whereupon i have taken a house in one of the principal streets of the town of where i am entered upon my business and hereby let you know that i shall have occasion for the goods hereafter mentioned which you may send to me by the carrier  this fine flourish and which no doubt the young fellow dressed up with much application and thought was very well done put his correspondent in london into a fit of laughter and instead of sending him the goods he wrote for put him either first upon writing down into the country to inquire after his character and whether he was worth dealing with or else it obtained to be filed up among such letters as deserved no answer  the same tradesman in london received by the post another letter from a young shopkeeper in the country to the purpose following  being obliged sir by my late masters decease to enter immediately upon his business and consequently open my shop without coming up to london to furnish myself with such goods as at present i want i have here sent you a small order as underwritten i hope you will think yourself obliged to use me well and particularly that the goods may be good of the sorts though i cannot be at london to look them out myself i have enclosed a bill of exchange for £75 on messrs ab and company payable to you or your order at oneandtwenty days sight be pleased to get it accepted and if the goods amount to more than that sum i shall when i have your bill of parcels send you the remainder i repeat my desire that you will send me the goods well sorted and well chosen and as cheap as possible that i may be encouraged to a further correspondence i am your humble servant  ck  this was writing like a man that understood what he was doing and his correspondent in london would presently saythis young man writes like a man of business pray let us take care to use him well for in all probability he will be a very good chapman  the sum of the matter is this a tradesmans letters should be plain concise and to the purpose no quaint expressions no bookphrases no flourishes and yet they must be full and sufficient to express what he means so as not to be doubtful much less unintelligible i can by no means approve of studied abbreviations and leaving out the needful copulatives of speech in trading letters they are to an extreme affected no beauty to the style but on the contrary a deformity of the grossest nature they are affected to the last degree and with this aggravation that it is an affectation of the grossest nature for in a word it is affecting to be thought a man of more than ordinary sense by writing extraordinary nonsense and affecting to be a man of business by giving orders and expressing your meaning in terms which a man of business may not think himself bound by for example a tradesman at hull writes to his correspondent at london the following letter  sir yours received have at present little to reply last post you had bills of loading with invoice of what had loaden for your account in hamburgh factor bound for said port what have farther orders for shall be dispatched with expedition markets slacken much on this side cannot sell the iron for more than 37s wish had your orders if shall part with it at that rate no ships since the 11th london fleet may be in the roads before the late storm so hope they are safe if have not insured please omit the same till hear farther the weather proving good hope the danger is over  my last transmitted three bills exchange import £315 please signify if are come to hand and accepted and give credit in account current to your humble servant  i pretend to say there is nothing in all this letter though appearing to have the face of a considerable dealer but what may be taken any way pro or con the hamburgh factor may be a ship or a horsebe bound to hamburgh or london what shall be dispatched may be one thing or any thing or every thing in a former letter no ships since the 11th may be no ships come in or no ships gone out the london fleet being in the roads it may be the london fleet from hull to london or from london to hull both being often at sea together the roads may be yarmouth roads or grimsby or indeed any where  by such a way of writing no orders can be binding to him that gives them or to him they are given to a merchant writes to his factor at lisbon  please to send per first ship 150 chests best seville and 200 pipes best lisbon white may value yourself per exchange £1250 sterling for the account of above orders suppose you can send the sloop to seville for the ordered chests c i am  here is the order to send a cargo with a please to send so the factor may let it alone if he does not please8 the order is 150 chests seville it is supposed he means oranges but it may be 150 chests orangetrees as well or chests of oil or any thing lisbon white may be wine or any thing else though it is supposed to be wine he may draw £1250 but he may refuse to accept it if he pleases for any thing such an order as that obliges him  on the contrary orders ought to be plain and explicit and he ought to have assured him that on his drawing on him his bills should be honouredthat is accepted and paid  i know this affectation of style is accounted very grand looks modish and has a kind of majestic greatness in it but the best merchants in the world are come off from it and now choose to write plain and intelligibly much less should country tradesmen citizens and shopkeepers whose business is plainness and mere trade make use of it  i have mentioned this in the beginning of this work because indeed it is the beginning of a tradesmans business when a tradesman takes an apprentice the first thing he does for him after he takes him from behind his counter after he lets him into his countinghouse and his books and after trusting him with his more private businessi say the first thing is to let him write letters to his dealers and correspond with his friends and this he does in his masters name subscribing his letters thus       i am for my master ab and company your      humble servant cd and beginning thussir       i am ordered by my master ab to advise you that  or thus       sir by my masters order i am to signify to you that  orders for goods ought to be very explicit and particular that the dealer may not mistake especially if it be orders from a tradesman to a manufacturer to make goods or to buy goods either of such a quality or to such a pattern in which if the goods are made to the colours and of a marketable goodness and within the time limited the person ordering them cannot refuse to receive them and make himself debtor to the maker on the contrary if the goods are not of a marketable goodness or not to the patterns or are not sent within the time the maker ought not to expect they should be received for example  the tradesman or warehouseman or what else we may call him writes to his correspondent at devizes in wiltshire thus  sirthe goods you sent me last week are not at all for my purpose being of a sort which i am at present full of however if you are willing they should lie here i will take all opportunities to sell them for your account otherwise on your first orders they shall be delivered to whoever you shall direct and as you had no orders from me for such sorts of goods you cannot take this ill but i have here enclosed sent you five patterns as under marked 1 to 5 if you think fit to make me fifty pieces of druggets of the same weight and goodness with the fifty pieces no ab which i had from you last october and mixed as exactly as you can to the enclosed patterns ten to each pattern and can have the same to be delivered here any time in february next i shall take them at the same price which i gave you for the last and one month after the delivery you may draw upon me for the money which shall be paid to your content your friend and servant  ps let me have your return per next post intimating that you can or cannot answer this order that i may govern myself accordingly to mr hg clothier devizes  the clothier accordingly gives him an answer the next post as follows  siri have the favour of yours of the 22d past with your order for fifty fine druggets to be made of the like weight and goodness with the two packs no ab which i made for you and sent last october as also the five patterns enclosed marked 1 to 5 for my direction in the mixture i give you this trouble according to your order to let you know i have already put the said fifty pieces in hand and as i am always willing to serve you to the best of my power and am thankful for your favours you may depend upon them within the time that is to say some time in february next and that they shall be of the like fineness and substance with the other and as near to the patterns as possible but in regard our poor are very craving and money at this time very scarce i beg you will give me leave twenty or thirty pieces of them being finished and delivered to you at any time before the remainder to draw fifty pounds on you for present occasion for which i shall think myself greatly obliged and shall give you any security you please that the rest shall follow within the time  as to the pack of goods in your hands which were sent up without your order i am content they remain in your hands for sale on my account and desire you will sell them as soon as you can for my best advantage i am c  here is a harmony of business and every thing exact the order is given plain and express the clothier answers directly to every point here can be no defect in the correspondence the diligent clothier applies immediately to the work sorts and dyes his wool mixes his colours to the patterns puts the wool to the spinners sends his yarn to the weavers has the pieces brought home then has them to the thicking or fullingmill dresses them in his own workhouse and sends them up punctually by the time perhaps by the middle of the month having sent up twenty pieces five weeks before the warehousekeeper to oblige him pays his bill of £50 and a month after the rest are sent in he draws for the rest of the money and his bills are punctually paid the consequence of this exact writing and answering is this  the warehousekeeper having the order from his merchant is furnished in time and obliges his customer then says he to his servant well this hg of devizes is a clever workman understands his business and may be depended on i see if i have an order to give that requires any exactness and honest usage he is my man he understands orders when they are sent goes to work immediately and answers them punctually  again the clothier at devizes says to his head man or perhaps his son this mr h is a very good employer and is worth obliging his orders are so plain and so direct that a man cannot mistake and if the goods are made honestly and to his time theres ones money bills are cheerfully accepted and punctually paid ill never disappoint him whoever goes without goods he shall not  on the contrary when orders are darkly given they are doubtfully observed and when the goods come to town the merchant dislikes them the warehouseman shuffles them back upon the clothier to lie for his account pretending they are not made to his order the clothier is discouraged and for want of his money discredited and all their correspondence is confusion and ends in loss both of money and credit  footnotes  8 the practice of trade now sanctions courteous expressions of this kind     chapter iii  the trading style   in the last chapter i gave my thoughts for the instruction of young tradesmen in writing letters with orders and answering orders and especially about the proper style of a tradesmans letters which i hinted should be plain and easy free in language and direct to the purpose intended give me leave to go on with the subject a little farther as i think it is useful in another part of the tradesmans correspondence  i might have made some apology for urging tradesmen to write a plain and easy style let me add that the tradesmen need not be offended at my condemning them as it were to a plain and homely styleeasy plain and familiar language is the beauty of speech in general and is the excellency of all writing on whatever subject or to whatever persons they are we write or speak the end of speech is that men might understand one anothers meaning certainly that speech or that way of speaking which is most easily understood is the best way of speaking if any man were to ask me which would be supposed to be a perfect style or language i would answer that in which a man speaking to five hundred people of all common and various capacities idiots or lunatics excepted should be understood by them all in the same manner with one another and in the same sense which the speaker intended to be understoodthis would certainly be a most perfect style  all exotic sayings dark and ambiguous speakings affected words and as i said in the last chapter abridgement or words cut off as they are foolish and improper in business so indeed are they in any other things hard words and affectation of style in business is like bombast in poetry a kind of rumbling nonsense and nothing of the kind can be more ridiculous  the nicety of writing in business consists chiefly in giving every species of goods their trading names for there are certain peculiarities in the trading language which are to be observed as the greatest proprieties and without which the language your letters are written in would be obscure and the tradesmen you write to would not understand youfor example if you write to your factor at lisbon or at cadiz to make you returns in hardware he understands you and sends you so many bags of pieces of eight so if a merchant comes to me to hire a small ship of me and tells me it is for the pipin trade or to buy a vessel and tells me he intends to make a pipiner of her the meaning is that she is to run to seville for oranges or to malaga for lemons if he says he intends to send her for a lading of fruit the meaning is she is to go to alicant denia or xevia on the coast of spain for raisins of the sun or to malaga for malaga raisins thus in the home trade in england if in kent a man tells me he is to go among the nightriders his meaning is he is to go acarrying wool to the seashorethe people that usually run the wool off in boats are called owlersthose that steal customs smugglers and the like in a word there is a kind of slang in trade which a tradesman ought to know as the beggars and strollers know the gipsy cant which none can speak but themselves and this in letters of business is allowable and indeed they cannot understand one another without it  a brickmaker being hired by a brewer to make some bricks for him at his countryhouse wrote to the brewer that he could not go forward unless he had two or three loads of spanish and that otherwise his bricks would cost him six or seven chaldrons of coals extraordinary and the bricks would not be so good and hard neither by a great deal when they were burnt  the brewer sends him an answer that he should go on as well as he could for three or four days and then the spanish should be sent him accordingly the following week the brewer sends him down two carts loaded with about twelve hogsheads or casks of molasses which frighted the brickmaker almost out of his senses the case was thisthe brewers formerly mixed molasses with their ale to sweeten it and abate the quantity of malt molasses being at that time much cheaper in proportion and this they called spanish not being willing that people should know it again the brickmakers all about london do mix seacoal ashes or laystalstuff as we call it with the clay of which they make bricks and by that shift save eight chaldrons of coals out of eleven in proportion to what other people use to burn them with and these ashes they call spanish  thus the received terms of art in every particular business are to be observed of which i shall speak to you in its turn i name them here to intimate that when i am speaking of plain writing in matters of business it must be understood with an allowance for all these thingsand a tradesman must be not only allowed to use them in his style but cannot write properly without themit is a particular excellence in a tradesman to be able to know all the terms of art in every separate business so as to be able to speak or write to any particular handicraft or manufacturer in his own dialect and it is as necessary as it is for a seaman to understand the names of all the several things belonging to a ship this therefore is not to be understood when i say that a tradesman should write plain and explicit for these things belong to and are part of the language of trade  but even these terms of art or customary expressions are not to be used with affectation and with a needless repetition where they are not called for  nor should a tradesman write those outoftheway words though it is in the way of the business he writes about to any other person who he knows or has reason to believe does not understand themi say he ought not to write in those terms to such because it shows a kind of ostentation and a triumph over the ignorance of the person they are written to unless at the very same time you add an explanation of the terms so as to make them assuredly intelligible at the place and to the person to whom they are sent  a tradesman in such cases like a parson should suit his language to his auditory and it would be as ridiculous for a tradesman to write a letter filled with the peculiarities of this or that particular trade which trade he knows the person he writes to is ignorant of and the terms whereof he is unacquainted with as it would be for a minister to quote the chrysostome and st austin and repeat at large all their sayings in the greek and the latin in a country church among a parcel of ploughmen and farmers thus a sailor writing a letter to a surgeon told him he had a swelling on the northeast side of his facethat his windward leg being hurt by a bruise it so put him out of trim that he always heeled to starboard when he made fresh way and so run to leeward till he was often forced aground then he desired him to give him some directions how to put himself into a sailing posture again of all which the surgeon understood little more than that he had a swelling on his face and a bruise in his leg  it would be a very happy thing if tradesmen had all their lexicon technicum at their fingers ends i mean for pray remember that i observe my own rule not to use a hard word without explaining it that every tradesman would study so the terms of art of other trades that he might be able to speak to every manufacturer or artist in his own language and understand them when they talked one to another this would make trade be a kind of universal language and the particular marks they are obliged to would be like the notes of music an universal character in which all the tradesmen in england might write to one another in the language and characters of their several trades and be as intelligible to one another as the minister is to his people and perhaps much more  i therefore recommend it to every young tradesman to take all occasions to converse with mechanics of every kind and to learn the particular language of their business not the names of their tools only and the way of working with their instruments as well as hands but the very cant of their trade for every trade has its nostrums and its little made words which they often pride themselves in and which yet are useful to them on some occasion or other  there are many advantages to a tradesman in thus having a general knowledge of the terms of art and the cant as i call it of every business and particularly this that they could not be imposed upon so easily by other tradesmen when they came to deal with them  if you come to deal with a tradesman or handicraft man and talk his own language to him he presently supposes you understand his business that you know what you come about that you have judgment in his goods or in his art and cannot easily be imposed upon accordingly he treats you like a man that is not to be cheated comes close to the point and does not crowd you with words and rattling talk to set out his wares and to cover their defects he finds you know where to look or feel for the defect of things and how to judge their worth for example  what trade has more hard words and peculiar ways attending it than that of a jockey or horsecourser as we call them they have all the parts of the horse and all the diseases attending him necessary to be mentioned in the market upon every occasion of buying or bargaining a jockey will know you at first sight when you do but go round a horse or at the first word you say about him whether you are a dealer as they call themselves or a stranger if you begin well if you take up the horses foot right if you handle him in the proper places if you bid his servant open his mouth or go about it yourself like a workman if you speak of his shapes or goings in the proper wordsoh says the jockey to his fellow he understands a horse he speaks the language then he knows you are not to be cheated or at least not so easily but if you go awkwardly to work whisper to your man you bring with you to ask every thing for you cannot handle the horse yourself or speak the language of the trade he falls upon you with his flourishes and with a flux of horse rhetoric imposes upon you with oaths and asseverations and in a word conquers you with the mere clamour of his trade  thus if you go to a garden to buy flowers plants trees and greens if you know what you go about know the names of flowers or simples or greens know the particular beauties of them when they are fit to remove and when to slip and draw and when not what colour is ordinary and what rare when a flower is rare and when ordinarythe gardener presently talks to you as to a man of art tells you that you are a lover of art a friend to a florist shows you his exotics his greenhouse and his stores what he has set out and what he has budded or enarched and the like but if he finds you have none of the terms of art know little or nothing of the names of plants or the nature of planting he picks your pocket instantly shows you a fine trimmed fuzbush for a juniper sells you common pinks for painted ladies an ordinary tulip for a rarity and the like thus i saw a gardener sell a gentleman a large yellow auricula that is to say a running away for a curious flower and take a great price it seems the gentleman was a lover of a good yellow and it is known that when nature in the auricula is exhausted and has spent her strengh in showing a fine flower perhaps some years upon the same root she faints at last and then turns into a yellow which yellow shall be bright and pleasant the first year and look very well to one that knows nothing of it though another year it turns pale and at length almost white this the gardeners call a run flower and this they put upon the gentleman for a rarity only because he discovered at his coming that he knew nothing of the matter the same gardener sold another person a root of white painted thyme for the right marum syriacum and thus they do every day  a person goes into a brickmakers field to view his clamp and buy a load of bricks he resolves to see them loaded because he would have good ones but not understanding the goods and seeing the workmen loading them where they were hard and well burnt but looked white and grey which to be sure were the best of the bricks and which perhaps they would not have done if he had not been there to look at them they supposing he understood which were the best but he in the abundance of his ignorance finds fault with them because they were not a good colour and did not look red the brickmakers men took the hint immediately and telling the buyer they would give him red bricks to oblige him turned their hands from the grey hard wellburnt bricks to the soft sammel9 halfburnt bricks which they were glad to dispose of and which nobody that had understood them would have taken off their hands  i mention these lower things because i would suit my writing to the understanding of the meanest people and speak of frauds used in the most ordinary trades but it is the like in almost all the goods a tradesman can deal in if you go to warwickshire to buy cheese you demand the cheese of the first make because that is the best if you go to suffolk to buy butter you refuse the butter of the first make because that is not the best but you bargain for the right rowing butter which is the butter that is made when the cows are turned into the grounds where the grass has been mowed and the hay carried off and grown again and so in many other cases these things demonstrate the advantages there are to a tradesman in his being thoroughly informed of the terms of art and the peculiarities belonging to every particular business which therefore i call the language of trade  as a merchant should understand all languages at least the languages of those countries which he trades to or corresponds with and the customs and usages of those countries as to their commerce so an english tradesman ought to understand all the languages of trade within the circumference of his own country at least and particularly of such as he may by any of the consequences of his commerce come to be any way concerned with  especially it is his business to acquaint himself with the terms and trading style as i call it of those trades which he buys of as to those he sells to supposing he sells to those who sell again it is their business to understand him not his to understand them and if he finds they do not understand him he will not fail to make their ignorance be his advantage unless he is honester and more conscientious in his dealings than most of the tradesmen of this age seem to be  footnotes  9 sammel is a term of art the brickmakers use for those bricks which are not well burnt and which generally look of a pale red colour and as fair as the other but are soft     chapter iv  of the tradesman acquainting himself with all business in general   it is the judgment of some experienced tradesmen that no man ought to go from one business to another and launch out of the trade or employment he was bred to tractent fabrilia fabrievery man to his own business and they tell us men never thrive when they do so  i will not enter into that dispute here i know some good and encouraging examples of the contrary and which stand as remarkable instances or as exceptions to the general rule but let that be as it will sometimes providence eminently calls upon men out of one employ into another out of a shop into a warehouse out of a warehouse into a shop out of a single hand into a partnership and the like and they trade one time here another time there and with very good success too but i say be that as it will a tradesman ought so far to acquaint himself with business that he should not be at a loss to turn his hand to this or that trade as occasion presents whether in or out of the way of his ordinary dealing as we have often seen done in london and other places and sometimes with good success  this acquainting himself with business does not intimate that he should learn every trade or enter into the mystery of every employment that cannot well be but that he should have a true notion of business in general and a knowledge how and in what manner it is carried on that he should know where every manufacture is made and how bought at first hand that he should know which are the proper markets and what the particular kinds of goods to exchange at those markets that he should know the manner how every manufacture is managed and the method of their sale  it cannot be expected that he should have judgment in the choice of all kinds of goods though in a great many he may have judgment too but there is a general understanding in trade which every tradesman both may and ought to arrive to and this perfectly qualifies him to engage in any new undertaking and to embark with other persons better qualified than himself in any new trade which he was not in before in which though he may not have a particular knowledge and judgment in the goods they are to deal in or to make yet having the benefit of the knowledge his new partner is master of and being himself apt to take in all additional lights he soon becomes experienced and the knowledge of all the other parts of business qualifies him to be a sufficient partner for exampleab was bred a drysalter and he goes in partner with with cd a scarletdyer called a bowdyer at wandsworth  as a salter ab has had experience enough in the materials for dyeing as well scarlets as all other colours and understands very well the buying of cochineal indigo galls shumach logwood fustick madder and the like so that he does his part very well cd is an experienced scarletdyer but now doubling their stock they fall into a larger work and they dye bays and stuffs and other goods into differing colours as occasion requires and this brings them to an equality in the business and by hiring good experienced servants they go on very well together  the like happens often when a tradesman turns his hand from one trade to another and when he embarks either in partnership or out of it in any new business it is supposed he seldom changes hands in such a manner without some such suitable person to join with or that he has some experienced head workman to direct him which if that workman proves honest is as well as a partner on the other hand his own application and indefatigable industry supply the want of judgment thus i have known several tradesmen turn their hands from one business to another or from one trade entirely to another and very often with good success for example i have seen a confectioner turn a sugarbaker another a distiller an apothecary turn chemist and not a few turn physicians and prove very good physicians too but that is a step beyond what i am speaking of  but my argument turns upon thisthat a tradesman ought to be able to turn his hand to any thing that is to say to lay down one trade and take up another if occasion leads him to it and if he sees an evident view of profit and advantage in it and this is only done by his having a general knowledge of trade so as to have a capacity of judging and by but just looking upon what is offered or proposed he sees as much at first view as others do by long inquiry and with the judgment of many advisers  when i am thus speaking of the tradesmans being capable of making judgment of things it occurs with a force not to be resisted that i should add he is hereby fenced against bubbles and projects and against those fatal people called projectors who are indeed among tradesmen as birds of prey are among the innocent fowlsdevourers and destroyers a tradesman cannot be too well armed nor too much cautioned against those sort of people they are constantly surrounded with them and are as much in jeopardy from them as a man in a crowd is of having his pocket pickednay almost as a man is when in a crowd of pickpockets  nothing secures the tradesman against those men so well as his being thoroughly knowing in business having a judgment to weigh all the delusive schemes and the fine promises of the wheedling projector and to see which are likely to answer or which not to examine all his specious pretences his calculations and figures and see whether they are as likely to answer the end as he takes upon him to say they will to make allowances for all his fine flourishes and outsides and then to judge for himself a projector is to a tradesman a kind of incendiary he is in a constant plot to blow him up or set fire to him for projects are generally as fatal to a tradesman as fire in a magazine of gunpowder  the honest tradesman is always in danger and cannot be too wary and therefore to fortify his judgment that he may be able to guard against such people as these is one of the most necessary things i can do for him  in order then to direct the tradesman how to furnish himself thus with a needful stock of trading knowledge first i shall propose to him to converse with tradesmen chiefly he that will be a tradesman should confine himself within his own sphere never was the gazette so full of the advertisements of commissions of bankrupt as since our shopkeepers are so much engaged in parties formed into clubs to hear news and read journals and politics in short when tradesmen turn statesmen they should either shut up their shops or hire somebody else to look after them  the known story of the upholsterer is very instructive10 who in his abundant concern for the public ran himself out of his business into a jail and even when he was in prison could not sleep for the concern he had for the liberties of his dear country the man was a good patriot but a bad shopkeeper and indeed should rather have shut up his shop and got a commission in the army and then he had served his country in the way of his calling but i may speak to this more in its turn  my present subject is not the negative what he should not do but the affirmative what he should do i say he should take all occasions to converse within the circuit of his own sphere that is dwell upon the subject of trade in his conversation and sort with and converse among tradesmen as much as he can as writing teaches to writescribendo discis scribereso conversing among tradesmen will make him a tradesman i need not explain this so critically as to tell you i do not mean he should confine or restrain himself entirely from all manner of conversation but among his own class i shall speak to that in its place also a tradesman may on occasion keep company with gentlemen as well as other people nor is a trading man if he is a man of sense unsuitable or unprofitable for a gentleman to converse with as occasion requires and you will often find that not private gentlemen only but even ministers of state privycouncillors members of parliament and persons of all ranks in the government find it for their purpose to converse with tradesmen and are not ashamed to acknowledge that a tradesman is sometimes qualified to inform them in the most difficult and intricate as well as the most urgent affairs of government and this has been the reason why so many tradesmen have been advanced to honours and dignities above their ordinary rank as sir charles duncombe a goldsmith sir henry furnese who was originally a retail hosier sir charles cook late one of the board of trade a merchant sir josiah child originally a very mean tradesman the late mr lowndes bred a scrivener and many others too many to name  but these are instances of men called out of their lower sphere for their eminent usefulness and their known capacities being first known to be diligent and industrious men in their private and lower spheres such advancements make good the words of the wise manseest thou a man diligent in his calling he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men11  in the mean time the tradesmans proper business is in his shop or warehouse and among his own class or rank of people there he sees how other men go on and there he learns how to go on himself there he sees how other men thrive and learns to thrive himself there he hears all the trading newsas for state news and politics it is none of his business there he learns how to buy and there he gets oftentimes opportunities to sell there he hears of all the disasters in trade who breaks and why what brought such and such a man to misfortunes and disasters and sees the various ways how men go down in the world as well as the arts and management by which others from nothing arise to wealth and estates  here he sees the scripture itself thwarted and his neighbour tradesman a wholesale haberdasher in spite of a good understanding in spite of a good beginning and in spite of the most indefatigable industry sink in his circumstances lose his credit then his stock and then break and become bankrupt while the man takes more pains to be poor than others do to grow rich  there on the other hand he sees gd a plodding weakheaded but laborious wretch of a confined genius and that cannot look a quarter of a mile from his shopdoor into the world and beginning with little or nothing yet rises apace in the mere road of business in which he goes on like the millers horse who being tied to the post is turned round by the very wheel which he turns round himself and this fellow shall get money insensibly and grow rich even he knows not how and no body else knows why  here he sees fm ruined by too much trade and there he sees mf starved for want of trade and from all these observations he may learn something useful to himself and fit to guide his own measures that he may not fall into the same mischiefs which he sees others sink under and that he may take the advantage of that prudence which others rise by  all these things will naturally occur to him in his conversing among his fellowtradesmen a settled little society of trading people who understand business and are carrying on trade in the same manner with himself no matter whether they are of the very same trades or no and perhaps better not of the samesuch a society i say shall if due observations are made from it teach the tradesman more than his apprenticeship for there he learned the operation here he learns the progression his apprenticeship is his grammarschool this is his university behind his masters counter or in his warehouse he learned the first rudiments of trade but here he learns the trading sciences here he comes to learn the arcana speak the language understand the meaning of every thing of which before he only learned the beginning the apprenticeship inducts him and leads him as the nurse the child this finishes him there he learned the beginning of trade here he sees it in its full extent in a word there he learned to trade here he is made a complete tradesman  let no young tradesman object that in the conversation i speak of there are so many gross things said and so many ridiculous things argued upon there being always a great many weak empty heads among the shopkeeping trading world this may be granted without any impeachment of what i have advancedfor where shall a man converse and find no fools in the societyand where shall he hear the weightiest things debated and not a great many empty weak things offered out of which nothing can be learned and from which nothing can be deducedfor out of nothing nothing can come  but notwithstanding let me still insist upon it to the tradesman to keep company with tradesmen let the fool run on in his own way let the talkative greenapron rattle in his own way let the manufacturer and his factor squabble and brangle the grave selfconceited puppy who was born a boy and will die before he is a man chatter and say a great deal of nothing and talk his neighbours to deathout of every one you will learn somethingthey are all tradesmen and there is always something for a young tradesman to learn from them if understanding but a little french you were to converse every day a little among some frenchmen in your neighbourhood and suppose those frenchmen you thus kept company with were every one of them fools mere ignorant empty foolish fellows there might be nothing learnt from their sense but you would still learn french from them if it was no more than the tone and accent and the ordinary words usual in conversation  thus among your silly empty tradesmen let them be as foolish and empty other ways as you can suggest though you can learn no philosophy from them you may learn many things in trade from them and something from every one for though it is not absolutely necessary that every tradesman should be a philosopher yet every tradesman in his way knows something that even a philosopher may learn from  i knew a philosopher that was excellently skilled in the noble science or study of astronomy who told me he had some years studied for some simile or proper allusion to explain to his scholars the phenomena of the suns motion round its own axis and could never happen upon one to his mind till by accident he saw his maid betty trundling her mop surprised with the exactness of the motion to describe the thing he wanted he goes into his study calls his pupils about him and tells them that betty who herself knew nothing of the matter could show them the sun revolving about itself in a more lively manner than ever he could accordingly betty was called and bidden bring out her mop when placing his scholars in a dueposition opposite not to the face of the maid but to her left side so that they could see the end of the mop when it whirled round upon her arm they took it immediatelythere was the broadheaded nail in the centre which was as the body of the sun and the thrums whisking round flinging the water about every way by innumerable little streams describing exactly the rays of the sun darting light from the centre to the whole system  if ignorant betty by the natural consequences of her operation instructed the astronomer why may not the meanest shoemaker or pedlar by the ordinary sagacity of his trading wit though it may be indeed very ordinary coarse and unlooked for communicate something give some useful hint dart some sudden thought into the mind of the observing tradesman which he shall make his use of and apply to his own advantage in trade when at the same time he that gives such hint shall himself like betty and her mop know nothing of the matter  every tradesman is supposed to manage his business his own way and generally speaking most tradesmen have some ways peculiar and particular to themselves which they either derived from the masters who taught them or from the experience of things or from something in the course of their business which had not happened to them before  and those little nostrums are oftentime very properly and with advantage communicated from one to another one tradesman finds out a nearer way of buying than another another finds a vent for what is bought beyond what his neighbour knows of and these in time come to be learned of them by their ordinary conversation  i am not for confining the tradesman from keeping better company as occasion and leisure requires i allow the tradesman to act the gentleman sometimes and that even for conversation at least if his understanding and capacity make him suitable company to them but still his business is among those of his own rank the conversation of gentlemen and what they call keeping good company may be used as a diversion or as an excursion but his stated society must be with his neighbours and people in trade men of business are companions for men of business with gentlemen he may converse pleasantly but here he converses profitably tradesmen are always profitable to one another as they always gain by trading together so they never lose by conversing together if they do not get money they gain knowledge in business improve their experience and see farther and farther into the world  a man of but an ordinary penetration will improve himself by conversing in matters of trade with men of trade by the experience of the old tradesmen they learn caution and prudence and by the rashness and the miscarriages of the young they learn what are the mischiefs that themselves may be exposed to  again in conversing with men of trade they get trade men first talk together then deal togethermany a good bargain is made and many a pound gained where nothing was expected by mere casual coming to talk together without knowing any thing of the matter before they met the tradesmens meetings are like the merchants exchange where they manage negociate and indeed beget business with one another  let no tradesman mistake me in this part i am not encouraging them to leave their shops and warehouses to go to taverns and alehouses and spend their time there in unnecessary prattle which indeed is nothing but sotting and drinking this is not meeting to do business but to neglect business of which i shall speak fully afterwards  but the tradesmen conversing with one another which i mean is the taking suitable occasions to discourse with their fellow tradesmen meeting them in the way of their business and improving their spare hours together to leave their shops and quit their counters in the proper seasons for their attendance there would be a preposterous negligence would be going out of business to gain business and would be cheating themselves instead of improving themselves the proper hours of business are sacred to the shop and the warehouse he that goes out of the order of trade let the pretence of business be what it will loses his business not increases it and will if continued lose the credit of his conduct in business also  footnotes  10 the story of the political upholsterer forms the subject of several amusing papers by addison in the tatler  11 to stand in the presence of a prince is the highest mark of honour in the east as to sit is with us     chapter v  diligence and application in business   solomon was certainly a friend to men of business as it appears by his frequent good advice to them in prov xviii 9 he says he that is slothful in business is brother to him that is a great waster and in another place the sluggard shall be clothed in rags prov xxiii 1 or to that purpose on the contrary the same wise man by way of encouragement tells them the diligent hand maketh rich prov x 4 and the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute  nothing can give a greater prospect of thriving to a young tradesman than his own diligence it fills himself with hope and gives him credit with all who know him without application nothing in this world goes forward as it should do let the man have the most perfect knowledge of his trade and the best situation for his shop yet without application nothing will go on what is the shop without the master what the books without the bookkeeper what the credit without the man hark how the people talk of such conduct as the slothful negligent trader discovers in his way  such a shop says the customer stands well and there is a good stock of goods in it but there is nobody to serve but a prenticeboy or two and an idle journeyman one finds them always at play together rather than looking out for customers and when you come to buy they look as if they did not care whether they showed you any thing or no one never sees a master in the shop if we go twenty times nor anything that bears the face of authority then it is a shop always exposed it is perfectly haunted with thieves and shoplifters they see nobody but raw boys in it that mind nothing and the diligent devils never fail to haunt them so that there are more outcries of stop thief at their door and more constables fetched to that shop than to all the shops in the row there was a brave trade at that shop in mrs time he was a true shopkeeper like the quack doctor you never missed him from seven in the morning till twelve and from two till nine at night and he throve accordinglyhe left a good estate behind him but i dont know what these people are they say there are two partners of them but there had as good be none for they are never at home nor in their shop one wears a long wig and a sword i hear and you see him often in the mall and at court but very seldom in his shop or waiting on his customers and the other they say lies abed till eleven oclock every day just comes into the shop and shows himself then stalks about to the tavern to take a whet then to childs coffeehouse to hear the news comes home to dinner at one takes a long sleep in his chair after it and about four oclock comes into the shop for half an hour or thereabouts then to the tavern where he stays till two in the morning gets drunk and is led home by the watch and so lies till eleven again and thus he walks round like the hand of a dial and what will it all come totheyll certainly break that you may be sure of they cant hold it long  this is the towns way of talking where they see an example of it in the manner as is described nor are the inferences unjust any more than the description is unlike for such certainly is the end of such management and no shop thus neglected ever made a tradesman rich  on the contrary customers love to see the masters face in the shop and to go to a shop where they are sure to find him at home when he does not sell or cannot take the price offered yet the customers are not disobliged and if they do not deal now they may another time if they do deal the master generally gets a better price for his goods than a servant can besides that he gives better content and yet the customers always think they buy cheaper of the master too  i seem to be talking now of the mercer or draper as if my discourse were wholly bent and directed to them but it is quite contrary for it concerns every tradesmanthe advice is general and every tradesman claims a share in it the nature of trade requires it it is an old anglicism such a man drives a trade the allusion is to a carter that with his voice his hands his whip and his constant attendance keeps the team always going helps himself lifts at the wheel in every slough doubles his application upon every difficulty and in a word to complete the simile if he is not always with his horses either the wagon is set in a hole or the team stands still or which is worst of all the load is spoiled by the waggon overthrowing  it is therefore no improper speech to say such a man drives his trade for in short if trade is not driven it will not go  trade is like a handmill it must always be turned about by the diligent hand of the master or if you will like the pumphouse at amsterdam where they put offenders in for petty matters especially beggars if they will work and keep pumping they sit well and dry and safe and if they work very hard one hour or two they may rest perhaps a quarter of an hour afterwards but if they oversleep themselves or grow lazy the water comes in upon them and wets them and they have no dry place to stand in much less to sit down in and in short if they continue obstinately idle they must sink so that it is nothing but pump or drown and they may choose which they like best  he that engages in trade and does not resolve to work at it is felo de se it is downright murdering himself that is to say in his trading capacity he murders his credit he murders his stock and he starves which is as bad as murdering his family  trade must not be entered into as a thing of light concern it is called business very properly for it is a business for life and ought to be followed as one of the great businesses of lifei do not say the chief but one of the great businesses of life it certainly istrade must i say be worked at not played with he that trades in jest will certainly break in earnest and this is one reason indeed why so many tradesmen come to so hasty a conclusion of their affairs  there was another old english saying to this purpose which shows how much our old fathers were sensible of the duty of a shopkeeper speaking of the tradesman as just opening his shop and beginning a dialogue with it the result of which is that the shop replies to the tradesman thus keep me and i will keep thee it is the same with driving the trade if the shopkeeper will not keep that is diligently attend to his shop the shop will not keep that is maintain him and in the other sense it is harsher to him if he will not drive his trade the trade will drive him that is drive him out of the shop drive him away  all these old sayings have this monitory substance in them namely they all concur to fill a young tradesman with true notions of what he is going about and that the undertaking of a trade is not a sport or game in which he is to meet with diversions only and entertainment and not to be in the least troubled or disturbed trade is a daily employment and must be followed as such with the full attention of the mind and full attendance of the person nothing but what are to be called the necessary duties of life are to intervene and even these are to be limited so as not to be prejudicial to business  and now i am speaking of the necessary things which may intervene and which may divide the time with our business or trade i shall state the manner in a few words that the tradesman may neither give too much nor take away too much to or from any respective part of what may be called his proper employment but keep as due a balance of his time as he should of his books or cash  the life of man is or should be a measure of allotted time as his time is measured out to him so the measure is limited must end and the end of it is appointed  the purposes for which time is given and life bestowed are very momentous no time is given uselessly and for nothing time is no more to be unemployed than it is to be ill employed three things are chiefly before us in the appointment of our time 1 necessaries of nature 2 duties of religion or things relating to a future life 3 duties of the present life namely business and calling  i necessities of nature such as eating and drinking rest or sleep and in case of disease a recess from business all which have two limitations on them and no more namely that they be  1 referred to their proper seasons  2 used with moderation  both these might give me subject to write many letters upon but i study brevity and desire rather to hint than dwell upon things which are serious and grave because i would not tire you  ii duties of religion these may be called necessities too in their kind and that of the sublimest nature and they ought not to be thrust at all out of their place and yet they ought to be kept in their place too  iii duties of life that is to say business or employment or calling which are divided into three kinds  1 labour or servitude  2 employment  3 trade  by labour i mean the poor manualist whom we properly call the labouring man who works for himself indeed in one respect but sometimes serves and works for wages as a servant or workman  by employment i mean men in business which yet is not properly called trade such as lawyers physicians surgeons scriveners clerks secretaries and such like and  by trade i mean merchants and inlandtraders such as are already described in the introduction to this work  to speak of time it is divided among these even in them all there is a just equality of circumstances to be preserved and as diligence is required in one and necessity to be obeyed in another so duty is to be observed in the third and yet all these with such a due regard to one another as that one duty may not jostle out another and every thing going on with an equality and just regard to the nature of the thing the tradesman may go on with a glad heart and a quiet conscience  this article is very nice as i intend to speak to it and it is a dangerous thing indeed to speak to lest young tradesmen treading on the brink of duty on one side and duty on the other side should pretend to neglect their duty to heaven on pretence that i say they must not neglect their shops but let them do me justice and they will do themselves no injury nor do i fear that my arguing on this point should give them any just cause to go wrong if they will go wrong and plead my argument for their excuse it must be by their abusing my directions and taking them in pieces misplacing the words and disjointing the sense and by the same method they may make blasphemy of the scripture  the duties of life i say must not interfere with one another must not jostle one another out of the place or so break in as to be prejudicial to one another it is certainly the duty of every christian to worship god to pay his homage morning and evening to his maker and at all other proper seasons to behave as becomes a sincere worshipper of god nor must any avocation either of business or nature however necessary interfere with this duty either in public or in private this is plainly asserting the necessity of the duty so no man can pretend to evade that  but the duties of nature and religion also have such particular seasons and those seasons so proper to themselves and so stated as not to break in or trench upon one another that we are really without excuse if we let any one be pleaded for the neglect of the other food sleep rest and the necessities of nature are either reserved for the night which is appointed for man to rest or take up so little room in the day that they can never be pleaded in bar of either religion or employment  he indeed who will sleep when he should work and perhaps drink when he should sleep turns nature bottom upwards inverts the appointment of providence and must account to himself and afterwards to a higher judge for the neglect  the devilif it be the devil that tempts for i would not wrong satan himselfplays our duties often one against another and to bring us if possible into confusion in our conduct subtly throws religion out of its place to put it in our way and to urge us to a breach of what we ought to do besides this subtle tempterfor as above i wont charge it all upon the devilwe have a great hand in it ourselves but let it be who it will i say this subtle tempter hurries the wellmeaning tradesman to act in all manner of irregularity that he may confound religion and business and in the end may destroy both  when the tradesman well inclined rises early in the morning and is moved as in duty to his maker he ought to pay his morning vows to him either in his closet or at the church where he hears the six oclock bell ring to call his neighbours to the same dutythen the secret hint comes across his happy intention that he must go to such or such a place that he may be back time enough for such other business as has been appointed overnight and both perhaps may be both lawful and necessary so his diligence oppresses his religion and away he runs to transact his business and neglects his morning sacrifice to his maker  on the other hand and at another time being in his shop or his countinghouse or warehouse a vast throng of business upon his hands and the world in his head when it is highly his duty to attend it and shall be to his prejudice to absent himselfthen the same deceiver presses him earnestly to go to his closet or to the church to prayers during which time his customer goes to another place the neighbours miss him in his shop his business is lost his reputation suffers and by this turned into a practice the man may say his prayers so long and so unseasonably till he is undone and not a creditor he has i may give it him from experience will use him the better or show him the more favour when a commission of bankrupt comes out against him  thus i knew once a zealous pious religious tradesman who would almost shut up his shop every day about nine or ten oclock to call all his family together to prayers and yet he was no presbyterian i assure you i say he would almost shut up his shop for he would suffer none of his servants to be absent from his family worship  this man had certainly been right had he made all his family get up by six oclock in the morning and called them to prayers before he had opened his shop but instead of that he first suffered sleep to interfere with religion and lying abed to postpone and jostle out his prayersand then to make god almighty amends upon himself wounds his family by making his prayers interfere with his trade and shuts his customers out of his shop the end of which was the poor good man deceived himself and lost his business  another tradesman whom i knew personally well was raised in the morning very early by the outcries of his wife to go and fetch a midwife it was necessary in his way to go by a church where there was always on that day of the week a morning sermon early for the supplying the devotion of such early christians as he so the honest man seeing the door open steps in and seeing the minister just gone up into the pulpit sits down joins in the prayers hears the sermon and goes very gravely home again in short his earnestness in the worship and attention to what he had heard quite put the errand he was sent about out of his head and the poor woman in travail after having waited long for the return of her husband with the midwife was obliged having run an extreme hazard by depending on his expedition to dispatch other messengers who fetched the midwife and she was come and the work over long before the sermon was done or that any body heard of the husband at last he was met coming gravely home from the church when being upbraided with his negligence in a dreadful surprise he struck his hands together and cried out how is my wife i profess i forgot it  what shall we say now to this illtimed devotion and who must tempt the poor man to this neglect certainly had he gone for the midwife it had been much more his duty than to go to hear a sermon at that time  i knew also another tradesman who was such a sermonhunter and as there are lectures and sermons preached in london either in the churches or meetinghouses almost every day in the week used so assiduously to hunt out these occasions that whether it was in a church or meetinghouse or both he was always abroad to hear a sermon at least once every day and sometimes more and the consequence was that the man lost his trade his shop was entirely neglected the time which was proper for him to apply to his business was misapplied his trade fell off and the man broke  now it is true and i ought to take notice of it also that though these things happen and may wrong a tradesman yet it is oftener ten times for once that tradesmen neglect their shop and business to follow the track of their vices and extravagencesome by taverns others to the gaminghouses others to balls and masquerades plays harlequins and operas very few by too much religion  but my inference is still sound and the more effectually so as to that part for if our business and trades are not to be neglected no not for the extraordinary excursions of religion and religious duties much less are they to be neglected for vices and extravagances  this is an age of gallantry and gaiety and never was the city transposed to the court as it is now the playhouses and balls are now filled with citizens and young tradesmen instead of gentlemen and families of distinction the shopkeepers wear a differing garb now and are seen with their long wigs and swords rather than with aprons on as was formerly the figure they made  but what is the difference in the consequences you did not see in those days acts of grace for the relief of insolvent debtors almost every session of parliament and yet the jails filled with insolvents before the next year though ten or twelve thousand have been released at a time by those acts  nor did you hear of so many commissions of bankrupt every week in the gazette as is now the case in a word whether you take the lower sort of tradesman or the higher where there were twenty that failed in those days i believe i speak within compass if i say that five hundred turn insolvent now it is as i said above an age of pleasure and as the wise man said long ago he that loves pleasure shall be a poor manso it is now it is an age of drunkenness and extravagance and thousands ruin themselves by that it is an age of luxurious and expensive living and thousands more undo themselves by that but among all our vices nothing ruins a tradesman so effectually as the neglect of his business it is true all those things prompt men to neglect their business but the more seasonable is the advice either enter upon no trade undertake no business or having undertaken it pursue it diligently drive your trade that the world may not drive you out of trade and ruin and undo you without diligence a man can never thoroughly understand his business and how should a man thrive when he does not perfectly know what he is doing or how to do it application to his trade teaches him how to carry it on as much as his going apprentice taught him how to set it up certainly that man shall never improve in his trading knowledge that does not know his business or how to carry it on the diligent tradesman is always the knowing and complete tradesman  now in order to have a man apply heartily and pursue earnestly the business he is engaged in there is yet another thing necessary namely that he should delight in it to follow a trade and not to love and delight in it is a slavery a bondage not a business the shop is a bridewell and the warehouse a house of correction to the tradesman if he does not delight in his trade while he is bound as we say to keep his shop he is like the galleyslave chained down to the oar he tugs and labours indeed and exerts the utmost of his strength for fear of the strapado and because he is obliged to do it but when he is on shore and is out from the bank he abhors the labour and hates to come to it again  to delight in business is making business pleasant and agreeable and such a tradesman cannot but be diligent in it which according to solomon makes him certainly rich and in time raises him above the world and able to instruct and encourage those who come after him     chapter vi  overtrading   it is an observation indeed of my own but i believe it will hold true almost in all the chief trading towns in england that there are more tradesmen undone by having too much trade than for want of trade overtrading is among tradesmen as overlifting is among strong men such people vain of the strengh and their pride prompting them to put it to the utmost trial at last lift at something too heavy for them overstrain their sinews break some of natures bands and are cripples ever after  i take overtrading to be to a shopkeeper as ambition is to a prince the late king of france the great king louis ambition led him to invade the dominions of his neighbours and while upon the empire here or the statesgeneral there or the spanish netherlands on another quarter he was an overmatch for every one and in their single capacity he gained from them all but at last pride made him think himself a match for them all together and he entered into a declared war against the emperor and the empire the kings of spain and great britain and the states of holland all at once and what was the consequence they reduced him to the utmost distress he lost all his conquests was obliged by a dishonourable peace to quit what he had got by encroachment to demolish his invincible towns such as pignerol dunkirk c the two strongest fortresses in europe and in a word like a bankrupt monarch he may in many cases be said to have died a beggar  thus the strong man in the fable who by main strength used to rive a tree undertook one at last which was too strong for him and it closed upon his fingers and held him till the wild beasts came and devoured him though the story is a fable the moral is good to my present purpose and is not at all above my subject i mean that of a tradesman who should be warned against overtrading as earnestly and with as much passion as i would warn a dealer in gunpowder to be wary of fire or a distiller or rectifier of spirits to moderate his furnace lest the heads of his stills fly off and he should be scalded to death  for a young tradesman to overtrade himself is like a young swimmer going out of his depth when if help does not come immediately it is a thousand to one but he sinks and is drowned all rash adventures are condemned by the prudent part of mankind but it is as hard to restrain youth in trade as it is in any other thing where the advantage stands in view and the danger out of sight the profits of trade are baits to the avaricious shopkeeper and he is forward to reckon them up to himself but does not perhaps cast up the difficulty which there may be to compass it or the unhappy consequences of a miscarriage  for want of this consideration the tradesman oftentimes drowns as i may call it even within his depththat is he sinks when he has really the substance at bottom to keep him upand this is all owing to an adventurous bold spirit in trade joined with too great a gust of gain avarice is the ruin of many people besides tradesmen and i might give the late south sea calamity for an example in which the longest heads were most overreached not so much by the wit or cunning of those they had to deal with as by the secret promptings of their own avarice wherein they abundantly verified an old proverbial speech or saying namely all covet all lose so it was there indeed and the cunningest wisest sharpest men lost the most money  there are two things which may be properly called overtrading in a young beginner and by both which tradesmen are often overthrown  1 trading beyond their stock  2 giving too large credit  a tradesman ought to consider and measure well the extent of his own strengh his stock of money and credit is properly his beginning for credit is a stock as well as money he that takes too much credit is really in as much danger as he that gives too much credit and the danger lies particularly in this if the tradesman overbuys himself that is buys faster than he can sell buying upon credit the payments perhaps become due too soon for him the goods not being sold he must answer the bills upon the strength of his proper stockthat is pay for them out of his own cash if that should not hold out he is obliged to put off his bills after they are due or suffer the impertinence of being dunned by the creditor and perhaps by servants and apprentices and that with the usual indecencies of such kind of people  this impairs his credit and if he comes to deal with the same merchant or clothier or other tradesman again he is treated like one that is but an indifferent paymaster and though they may give him credit as before yet depending that if he bargains for six months he will take eight or nine in the payment they consider it in the price and use him accordingly and this impairs his gain so that loss of credit is indeed loss of money and this weakens him both ways  a tradesman therefore especially at his beginning ought to be very wary of taking too much credit he had much better slip the occasion of buying now and then a bargain to his advantage for that is usually the temptation than buying a greater quantity of goods than he can pay for run into debt and be insulted and at last ruined merchants and wholesale dealers to put off their goods are very apt to prompt young shopkeepers and young tradesmen to buy great quantities of goods and take large credit at first but it is a snare that many a young beginner has fallen into and been ruined in the very bud for if the young beginner does not find a vent for the quantity he is undone for at the time of payment the merchant expects his money whether the goods are sold or not and if he cannot pay he is gone at once  the tradesman that buys warily always pays surely and every young beginner ought to buy cautiously if he has money to pay he need never fear goods to be had the merchants warehouses are always open and he may supply himself upon all occasions as he wants and as his customers call  it may pass for a kind of an objection here that there are some goods which a tradesman may deal in which are to be bought at such and such markets only and at such and such fairs only that is to say are chiefly bought there as the cheesemongers buy their stocks of cheese and of butter the cheese at several fairs in warwickshire as at atherston fair in particular or at fair in gloucestershire and at sturbridge fair near cambridge and their butter at ipswich fair in suffolk and so of many other things but the answer is plain those things which are generally bought thus are ready money goods and the tradesman has a sure rule for buying namely his cash but as i am speaking of taking credit so i must be necessarily supposed to speak of such goods as are bought upon credit as the linendraper buys of the hamburgh and dutch merchants the woollendraper of the blackwellhall men the haberdasher of the thread merchants the mercer of the weavers and italian merchants the silkman of the turkey merchants and the like here they are under no necessity of running deep into debt but may buy sparingly and recruit again as they sell off  i know some tradesmen are very fond of seeing their shops wellstocked and their warehouses full of goods and this is a snare to them and brings them to buy in more goods than they want but this is a great error either in their judgment or their vanity for except in retailers shops and that in some trades where they must have a great choice of goods or else may want a trade otherwise a wellexperienced tradesman had rather see his warehouse too empty than too full if it be too empty he can fill it when he pleases if his credit be good or his cash strong but a thronged warehouse is a sign of a want of customers and of a bad market whereas an empty warehouse is a sign of a nimble demand12  let no young tradesman value himself upon having a very great throng of goods in hand having just a necessary supply to produce a choice of new and fashionable goodsnay though he be a mercer for they are the most under the necessity of a large stock of goods but i say supposing even the mercer to have a tolerable show and choice of fashionable goods that gives his shop a reputation he derives no credit at all from a throng of old shopkeepers as they call them namely outoffashion things but in other trades it is much more a needful caution a few goods and a quick sale is the beauty of a tradesmans warehouse or shop either and it is his wisdom to keep himself in that posture that his payments may come in on his front as fast as they go out in his rear that he may be able to answer the demands of his merchants or dealers and if possible let no man come twice for his money  the reason of this is plain and leads me back to where i began credit is stock and if well supported is as good as a stock and will be as durable a tradesman whose credit is good untouched unspotted and who as above has maintained it with care shall in many cases buy his goods as cheap at three or four months time of payment as another man shall with ready moneyi say in some cases and in goods which are ordinarily sold for time as all our manufactures the bay trade excepted generally are  he then that keeps his credit unshaken has a double stocki mean it is an addition to his real stock and often superior to it nay i have known several considerable tradesmen in this city who have traded with great success and to a very considerable degree and yet have not had at bottom one shilling real stock but by the strength of their reputation being sober and diligent and having with care preserved the character of honest men and the credit of their business by cautious dealing and punctual payments they have gone on till the gain of their trade has effectually established them and they have raised estates out of nothing  but to return to the dark side namely overtrading the second danger is the giving too much credit he that takes credit may give credit but he must be exceedingly watchful for it is the most dangerous state of life that a tradesman can live in for he is in as much jeopardy as a seaman upon a leeshore  if the people he trusts fail or fail but of a punctual compliance with him he can never support his own credit unless by the caution i am now giving that is to be very sure not to give so much credit as he takes  by the word so much i must be understood thuseither he must sell for shorter time than he takes or in less quantity the last is the safest namely that he should be sure not to trust out so much as he is trusted with if he has a real stock indeed besides the credit he takes that indeed makes the case differ and a man that can pay his own debts whether other people pay him or no that man is out of the questionhe is past danger and cannot be hurt but if he trusts beyond the extent of his stock and credit even he may be overthrown too  there were many sad examples of this in the time of the late war13 and in the days when the public credit was in a more precarious condition that it has been sincei say sad examples namely when tradesmen in flourishing circumstances and who had indeed good estates at bottom and were in full credit themselves trusted the public with too great sums which not coming in at the time expected either by the deficiency of the funds given by parliament and the parliament themselves not soon making good those deficiencies or by other disasters of those times i say their money not coming in to answer their demands they were ruined at least their credit wounded and some quite undone who yet had they been paid could have paid all their own debts and had good sums of money left  others who had ability to afford it were obliged to sell their tallies and orders at forty or fifty per cent loss from whence proceeded that black trade of buying and selling navy and victualling bills and transport debts by which the brokers and usurers got estates and many thousands of tradesmen were brought to nothing even those that stood it lost great sums of money by selling their tallies but credit cannot be bought too dear and the throwing away one half to save the other was much better than sinking under the burden like sailors in a storm who to lighten the ship wallowing in the trough of the sea will throw the choicest goods overboard even to half the cargo in order to keep the ship above water and save their lives  these were terrible examples of overtrading indeed the men were tempted by the high price which the government gave for their goods and which they were obliged to give because of the badness of the public credit at that time but this was not sufficient to make good the loss sustained in the sale of the tallies so that even they that sold and were able to stand without ruin were yet great sufferers and had enough to do to keep up their credit  this was the effect of giving overmuch credit for though it was the government itself which they trusted yet neither could the government itself keep up the sinking credit of those whom it was indebted to and indeed how should it when it was not able to support its own credit but that by the way i return to the young tradesman whom we are now speaking about  it is his greatest prudence therefore after he has considered his own fund and the stock he has to rest uponi say his next business is to take care of his credit and next to limiting his buyingliberty let him be sure to limit his selling could the tradesman buy all upon credit and sell all for ready money he might turn usurer and put his own stock out to interest or buy land with it for he would have no occasion for one shilling of it but since that is not expected nor can be done it is his business to act with prudence in both partsi mean of taking and giving creditand the best rule to be given him for it is never to give so much credit as he takes by at least onethird part  by giving credit i do not mean that even all the goods which he buys upon credit may not be sold upon credit perhaps they are goods which are usually sold so and no otherwise but the alternative is before him thuseither he must not give so much credit in quantity of goods or not so long credit in relation to timefor example  suppose the young tradesman buys ten thousand pounds value of goods on credit and this ten thousand pounds are sold for eleven thousand pounds likewise on credit if the time given be the same the man is in a state of apparent destruction and it is a hundred to one but he is blown up perhaps he owes the ten thousand pounds to twenty men perhaps the eleven thousand pounds is owing to him by two hundred menit is scarce possible that these two hundred petty customers of his should all so punctually comply with their payments as to enable him to comply with his and if two or three thousand pounds fall short the poor tradesman unless he has a fund to support the deficiency must be undone  but if the man had bought ten thousand pounds at six or eight months credit and had sold them all again as above to his two hundred customers at three months and four months credit then it might be supposed all or the greatest part of them would have paid time enough to make his payments good if not all would be lost still  but on the other hand suppose he had sold but three thousand pounds worth of the ten for ready money and had sold the rest for six months credit it might be supposed that the three thousand pounds in cash and what else the two hundred debtors might pay in time might stop the months of the tradesmans creditors till the difference might be made good  so easy a thing is it for a tradesman to lose his credit in trade and so hard is it once upon such a blow to retrieve it again what need then is there for the tradesman to guard himself against running too far into debt or letting other people run too far into debt to him for if they do not pay him he cannot pay others and the next thing is a commission of bankrupt and so the tradesman may be undone though he has eleven thousand pounds to pay ten with  it is true it is not possible in a country where there is such an infinite extent of trade as we see managed in this kingdom that either on one hand or another it can be carried on without a reciprocal credit both taken and given but it is so nice an article that i am of opinion as many tradesmen break with giving too much credit as break with taking it the danger indeed is mutual and very great whatever then the young tradesman omits let him guard against both his giving and taking too much credit  but there are divers ways of overtrading besides this of taking and giving too much credit and one of these is the running out into projects and heavy undertakings either out of the common road which the tradesman is already engaged in or grasping at too many undertakings at once and having as it is vulgarly expressed too many irons in the fire at a time in both which cases the tradesman is often wounded and that deeply sometimes too deep to recover  the consequences of those adventures are generally such as these first that they stockstarve the tradesman and impoverish him in his ordinary business which is the main support of his family they lessen his strength and while his trade is not lessened yet his stock is lessened and as they very rarely add to his credit so if they lessen the mans stock they weaken him in the main and he must at last faint under it  secondly as they lessen his stock so they draw from it in the most sensible partthey wound him in the tenderest and most nervous part for they always draw away his ready money and what follows the money which was before the sinews of his business the life of his trade maintained his shop and kept up his credit in the full extent of it being drawn off like the blood let out of the veins his trade languishes his credit by degrees flags and goes off and the tradesman falls under the weight  thus i have seen many a flourishing tradesman sensibly decay his credit has first a little suffered then for want of that credit trade has declinedthat is to say he has been obliged to trade for less and less till at last he is wasted and reduced if he has been wise enough and wary enough to draw out betimes and avoid breaking he has yet come out of trade like an old invalid soldier out of the wars maimed bruised sick reduced and fitter for an hospital than a shopsuch miserable havoc has launching out into projects and remote undertakings made among tradesmen  but the safe tradesman is he that avoiding all such remote excursions keeps close within the verge of his own affairs minds his shop or warehouse and confining himself to what belongs to him there goes on in the road of his business without launching into unknown oceans and content with the gain of his own trade is neither led by ambition or avarice and neither covets to be greater nor richer by such uncertain and hazardous attempts  footnotes  12 the keeping of a half empty shop will not suit the necessities of trade in modern times instead of following the advice of defoe therefore the young tradesman is recommended to keep a sufficient stock of every kind of goods in which he professes to deal a shopkeeper can hardly commit a greater blunder than allow himself to be out of any article of his trade one of his chief duties ought to consist in keeping up a fresh stock of every article which there is a chance of being sought for and while avoiding the imprudence of keeping too large a stock of goodswhich comes nearest to defoes meaningit is certain that by having on hand an abundant choice the shop gains a name and has the best chance of securing a concourse of customers  13 the war of the spanish succession concluded by the treaty of utrecht 1713     chapter vii  of the tradesman in distress and becoming bankrupt   in former times it was a dismal and calamitous thing for a tradesman to break where it befell a family it put all into confusion and distraction the man in the utmost terror fright and distress ran away with what goods he could get off as if the house were on fire to get into the friars14 or the mint the family fled one one way and one another like people in desperation the wife to her father and mother if she had any and the children some to one relation some to another a statute so they vulgarly call a commission of bankrupt came and swept away all and oftentimes consumed it too and left little or nothing either to pay the creditors or relieve the bankrupt this made the bankrupt desperate and made him fly to those places of shelter with his goods where hardened by the cruelty of the creditors he chose to spend all the effects which should have paid the creditors and at last perished in misery  but now the case is altered men make so little of breaking that many times the family scarce removes for it a commission of bankrupt is so familiar a thing that the debtor oftentimes causes it to be taken out in his favour that he may sooner be effectually delivered from all his creditors at once the law obliging him only to give a full account of himself upon oath to the commissioners who when they see his integrity may effectually deliver him from all further molestation give him a part even of the creditors estate and so he may push into the world again and try whether he cannot retrieve his fortunes by a better management or with better success for the future  some have said this law is too favourable to the bankrupt that it makes tradesmen careless that they value not breaking at all but run on at all hazards venturing without forecast and without consideration knowing they may come off again so cheap and so easy if they miscarry but though i cannot enter here into a long debate upon that subject yet i may have room to say that i differ from those people very much for though the terror of the commission is in some measure abated as indeed it ought to be because it was before exorbitant and unreasonable yet the terror of ruining a mans family sinking his fortunes blasting his credit and throwing him out of business and into the worst of disgrace that a tradesman can fall into this is not taken away or abated at all and this to an honest trading man is as bad as all the rest ever was or could be  nor can a man be supposed in the rupture of his affairs to receive any comfort or to see through his disasters into the little relief which he may and at the same time cannot be sure he shall receive at the end of his troubles from the mercy of the commission  these are poor things and very trifling for a tradesman to entertain thoughts of a breach from especially with any prospect of satisfaction nor can any tradesman with the least shadow of principle entertain any thought of breaking but with the utmost aversion and even abhorrence for the circumstances of it are attended with so many mortifications and so many shocking things contrary to all the views and expectations that a tradesman can begin the world with that he cannot think of it but as we do of the grave with a chillness upon the blood and a tremor in the spirits breaking is the death of a tradesman he is mortally stabbed or as we may say shot through the head in his trading capacity his shop is shut up as it is when a man is buried his credit the life and blood of his trade is stagnated and his attendance which was the pulse of his business is stopped and beats no more in a word his fame and even name as to trade is buried and the commissioners that act upon him and all their proceedings are but like the executors of the defunct dividing the ruins of his fortune and at last his certificate is a kind of performing the obsequies for the dead and praying him out of purgatory  did ever tradesman set up on purpose to break did ever a man build himself a house on purpose to have it burnt down i can by no means grant that any tradesman at least in his senses can entertain the least satisfaction in his trading or abate any thing of his diligence in trade from the easiness of breaking or the abated severities of the bankrupt act  i could argue it from the nature of the act itself which indeed was made and is effectual chiefly for the relief of creditors not debtors to secure the bankrupts effects for the use of those to whom it of right belongs and to prevent the extravagant expenses of the commission which before were such as often devoured all ruining both the bankrupt and his creditors too this the present law has providently put a stop to and the creditors now are secure in this point that what is to be had what the poor tradesman has left they are sure to have preserved for and divided among them which indeed before they were not the case is so well known and so recent in every tradesmans memory that i need not take up any more of your time about it  as to the encouragements in the act for the bankrupt they are only thesenamely that upon his honest and faithful surrender of his affairs he shall be set at liberty and if they see cause they the creditors may give him back a small gratification for his discovering his effects and assisting to the recovery of them and all this which amounts to very little is upon his being as i have said entirely honest and having run through all possible examinations and purgations and that it is at the peril of his life if he prevaricates  are these encouragements to tradesmen to be negligent and careless of the event of things will any man in his wits fail in his trade break his credit and shut up his shop for these prospects or will he comfort himself in case he is forced to faili say will he comfort himself with these little benefits and make the matter easy to himself on that account he must have a very mean spirit that can do this and must act upon very mean principles in life who can fall with satisfaction on purpose to rise no higher than this it is like a man going to bed on purpose to rise naked pleasing himself with the thoughts that though he shall have no clothes to put on yet he shall have the liberty to get out of bed and shift for himself  on these accounts and some others too long to mention here i think it is out of doubt that the easiness of the proceedings on commissions of bankrupt can be no encouragement to any tradesman to break or so much as to entertain the thoughts of it with less horror and aversion than he would have done before this law was made  but i must come now to speak of the tradesman in his real state of mortification and under the inevitable necessity of a blow upon his affairs he has had losses in his business such as are too heavy for his stock to support he has perhaps launched out in trade beyond his reach either he has so many bad debts that he cannot find by his books he has enough left to pay his creditors or his debts lie out of his reach and he cannot get them in which in one respect is as bad he has more bills running against him than he knows how to pay and creditors dunning him whom it is hard for him to comply with and this by degrees sinks his credit  now could the poor unhappy tradesman take good advice now would be his time to prevent his utter ruin and let his case be better or worse his way is clear  if it be only that he has overshot himself in trade taken too much credit and is loaded with goods or given too much credit and cannot get his debts in but that upon casting up his books he finds his circumstances good at bottom though his credit has suffered by his effects being out of his hands let him endeavour to retrench let him check his career in tradeimmediately take some extraordinary measures to get in his debts or some extraordinary measures if he can to raise money in the meantime till those debts come in that he may stop the crowd of present demands if this will not do let him treat with some of his principal creditors showing them a true and faithful state of his affairs and giving them the best assurances he can of payment that they may be easy with him till he can get in his debts and then with the utmost care draw in his trade within the due compass of his stock and be sure never to run out again farther than he is able to answer let the prospect of advantage be what it will and by this method he may perhaps recover his credit again at least he may prevent his ruin but this is always supposing the man has a firm bottom that he is sound in the main and that his stock is at least sufficient to pay all his debts  but the difficulty which i am proposing to speak of is when the poor tradesman distressed as above in point of credit looking into his affairs finds that his stock is diminished or perhaps entirely sunkthat in short he has such losses and such disappointments in his business that he is not sound at bottom that he has run too far and that his own stock being wasted or sunk he has not really sufficient to pay his debts what is this mans businessand what course shall he take  i know the ordinary course with such tradesmen is thisit is true says the poor man i am running down and i have lost so much in such a place and so much by such a chapman that broke and in short so much that i am worse than nothing but come i have such a thing before me or i have undertaken such a project or i have such an adventure abroad if it suceeds i may recover again ill try my utmost ill never drown while i can swim ill never fall while i can stand who knows but i may get over it in a word the poor man is loth to come to the fatal day loth to have his name in the gazette and see his wife and family turned out of doors and the like who can blame him or who is not in the like case apt to take the like measuresfor it is natural to us all to put the evil day far from us at least to put it as far off as we can though the criminal believes he shall be executed at last yet he accepts of every reprieve as it puts him within the possibility of an escape and that as long as there is life there is hope but at last the dead warrant comes down then he sees death unavoidable and gives himself up to despair  indeed the malefactor was in the right to accept as i say of every reprieve but it is quite otherwise in the tradesmans case and if i may give him a rule safe and in its end comfortable in proportion to his circumstances but to be sure out of question just honest and prudent it is this  when he perceives his case as above and knows that if his new adventures or projects should fail he cannot by any means stand or support himself i not only give it as my advice to all tradesmen as their interest but insist upon it as they are honest men they should break that is stop in time fear not to do that which necessity obliges you to do but above all fear not to do that early which if omitted necessity will oblige you to do late  first let me argue upon the honesty of it and next upon the prudence of it certainly honesty obliges every man when he sees that his stock is gone that he is below the level and eating into the estate of other men to put a stop to it and to do it in time while something is left it has been a fault without doubt to break in upon other mens estates at all but perhaps a plea may be made that it was ignorantly done and they did not think they were run so far as to be worse than nothing or some sudden disaster may have occasioned it which they did not expect and it may be could not foresee both which may indeed happen to a tradesman though the former can hardly happen without his fault because he ought to be always acquainting himself with his books stating his expenses and his profits and casting things up frequently at least in his head so as always to know whether he goes backward or forward the latter namely sudden disaster may happen so to any tradesman as that he may be undone and it may not be his fault for ruin sometimes falls as suddenly as unavoidably upon a tradesman though there are but very few incidents of that kind which may not be accounted for in such a manner as to charge it upon his prudence  some cases may indeed happen some disasters may befall a tradesman which it was not possible he should foresee as fire floods of water thieves and many suchand in those cases the disaster is visible the plea is open every body allows it the man can have no blame a prodigious tide from the sea joined with a great fresh or flood in the river dee destroyed the new wharf below the roodee at west chester and tore down the merchants warehouses there and drove away not only all the goods but even the buildings and altogether into the sea now if a poor shopkeeper in chester had a large parcel of goods lying there perhaps newly landed in order to be brought up to the city but were all swept away if i say the poor tradesman were ruined by the loss of those goods on that occasion the creditors would see reason in it that they should every one take a share in the loss the tradesman was not to blame  likewise in the distress of the late fire which began in thames street near bear quay a grocer might have had a quantity of goods in a warehouse thereabouts or his shop might be there and the goods perhaps might be sugars or currants or tobacco or any other goods in his way which could not be easily removed this fire was a surprise it was a blast of powder it was at noonday when no person coud foresee it the man may have been undone and be in no fault himself one way or other no man can reasonably say to him why did you keep so many goods upon your hands or in such a place for it was his proper business both to have a stock of goods and to have them in such a place every thing was in the right position and in the order which the nature of his trade required  on the other hand if it was the breaking of a particular chapman or an adventure by sea the creditors would perhaps reflect on his prudence why should any man trust a single chapman so much or adventure so much in one single bottom and uninsured as that the loss of it would be his undoing  but there are other cases however which may happen to a tradesman and by which he may be at once reduced below his proper stock and have nothing left to trade on but his credit that is to say the estates of his creditors in such a case i question whether it can be honest for any man to continue trading for first it is making his creditors run an unjust hazard without their consent indeed if he discovers his condition to one or two of them who are men of capital stocks and will support him they giving him leave to pay others off and go on at their risks that alters the case or if he has a ready money trade that will apparently raise him again and he runs no more hazards but is sure he shall at least run out no farther in these two cases and i do not know another he may with honesty continue  on the contrary when he sees himself evidently running out and declining and has only a shift here and a shift there to lay hold on as sinking men generally do and knows that unless something extraordinary happen which perhaps also is not probable he must fall for such a man to go on and trade in the ordinary way notwithstanding losses and hazardsin such a case i affirm he cannot act the honest man he cannot go on with justice to his creditors or his family he ought to call his creditors together lay his circumstances honestly before them and pay as far as it will go if his creditors will do any thing generously for him to enable him to go on again well and good but he cannot honestly oblige them to run the risk of his unfortunate progress and to venture their estates on his bottom after his bottom is really nothing at all but their money  but i pass from the honesty to the prudence of itfrom what regards his creditors to what regards himselfand i affirm nothing can be more imprudent and impolite as it regards himself and his family than to go on after he sees his circumstances irrecoverable if he has any consideration for himself or his future happiness he will stop in time and not be afraid of meeting the mischief which he sees follows too fast for him to escape be not so afraid of breaking as not to break till necessity forces you and that you have nothing left in a word i speak it to every declining tradesman if you love yourself your family or your reputation and would ever hope to look the world in the face again break in time  by breaking in time you will first obtain the character of an honest though unfortunate man it is owing to the contrary course which is indeed the ordinary practice of tradesmen namely not to break till they run the bottom quite out and have little or nothing left to pay i say it is owing to this that some people think all men that break are knaves the censure it is true is unjust but the cause is owing to the indiscretion to call it no worse of the poor tradesmen who putting the mischief as far from them as they can trade on to the last gasp till a throng of creditors coming on them together or being arrested and not able to get bail or by some such public blow to their credit they are brought to a stop or breach of course like a man fighting to the last gasp who is knocked down and laid on the ground and then his resistance is at an end for indeed a tradesman pushing on under irresistable misfortunes is but fighting with the world to the last drop and with such unequal odds that like the soldier surrounded with enemies he must be killed so the debtor must sink it cannot be prevented  it is true also the man that thus struggles to the last brings upon him an universal reproach and a censure that is not only unavoidable but just which is worse but when a man breaks in time he may hold up his face to his creditors and tell them that he could have gone on a considerable while longer but that he should have had less left to pay them with and that he has chosen to stop while he may be able to give them so considerable a sum as may convince them of his integrity  we have a great clamour among us of the cruelty of creditors and it is a popular clamour that goes a great way with some people but let them tell us when ever creditors were cruel when the debtor came thus to them with fifteen shillings in the pound in his offer perhaps when the debtor has run to the utmost and there appears to be little or nothing left he has been used roughly and it is enough to provoke a creditor indeed to be offered a shilling or halfacrown in the pound for a large debt when had the debtor been honest and broke in time he might have received perhaps twothirds of his debt and the debtor been in better condition too  break then in time young tradesman if you see you are going down and that the hazard of going on is doubtful you will certainly be received by your creditors with compassion and with a generous treatment and whatever happens you will be able to begin the world again with the title of an honest maneven the same creditors will embark with you again and be more forward to give you credit than before  it is true most tradesmen that break merit the name of knave or dishonest man but it is not so with all the reason of the difference lies chiefly in the manner of their breakingnamely whether sooner or later it is possible he may be an honest man who cannot but he can never be honest that can and will not pay his debts now he that being able to pay fifteen shillings in the pound will struggle on till he sees he shall not be able to pay halfacrown in the pound this man was able to pay but would not and therefore as above cannot be an honest man  in the next place what shall we say to the peace and satisfaction of mind in breaking which the tradesman will always have when he acts the honest part and breaks betimes compared to that guilt and chagrin of the mind occasioned by a running on as i said to the last gasp when they have little to pay then indeed the tradesman can expect no quarter from his creditors and will have no quiet in himself  i might instance here the miserable anxious perplexed life which the poor tradesman lives under the distresses and extremities of his declining state how harassed and tormented for money what shifts he is driven to for supporting himself how many little mean and even wicked things will even the religious tradesman stoop to in his distress to deliver himselfeven such things as his very soul would abhor at another time and for which he goes perhaps with a wounded conscience all his life after  by giving up early all this which is the most dreadful part of all the rest would be prevented i have heard many an honest unfortunate man confess this and repent even with tears that they had not learned to despair in trade some years sooner than they did by which they had avoided falling into many foul and foolish actions which they afterwards had been driven to by the extremity of their affairs  footnotes  14 whitefriars in the neighbourhood of the temple london this and the mint were sanctuaries for debtors     chapter viii  the ordinary occasions of the ruin of tradesmen   since i have given advice to tradesmen when they fell into difficulties and find they are run behindhand to break in time before they run on too far and thereby prevent the consequences of a fatal running on to extremity it is but just i should give them some needful directions to avoid if possible breaking at all  in order to this i will briefly inquire what are the ordinary originals of a tradesmans ruin in business to say it is negligence when i have already pressed to a close application and diligence that it is launching into and grasping at more business than their stock or perhaps their understandings are able to manage when i have already spoken of the fatal consequences of overtrading to say it is trusting carelessly people unable to pay and running too rashly into debt when i have already spoken of taking and giving too much creditthis would all be but saying the same thing over againand i am too full of particulars in this important case to have any need of tautologies and repetitions but there are a great many ways by which tradesmen precipitate themselves into ruin besides those and some that need explaining and enlarging upon  1 some especially retailers ruin themselves by fixing their shops in such places as are improper for their business in most towns but particularly in the city of london there are places as it were appropriated to particular trades and where the trades which are placed there succeed very well but would do very ill any where else or any other trades in the same places as the orangemerchants and wetsalters about billingsgate and in thames street the costermongers at the three cranes the wholesale cheesemongers in thames street the mercers and drapers in the high streets such as cheapside ludgate street cornhill round court and gracechurch street c  pray what would a bookseller make of his business at billingsgate or a mercer in tower street or near the customhouse or a draper in thames street or about queenhithe many trades have their peculiar streets and proper places for the sale of their goods where people expect to find such shops and consequently when they want such goods they go thither for them as the booksellers in st pauls churchyard about the exchange temple and the strand c the mercers on both sides ludgate in round court and gracechurch and lombard streets the shoemakers in st martins le grand and shoemaker row the coachmakers in longacre queen street and bishopsgate butchers in eastcheap and such like  for a tradesman to open his shop in a place unresorted to or in a place where his trade is not agreeable and where it is not expected it is no wonder if he has no trade what retail trade would a milliner have among the fishmongers shops on fishstreethill or a toyman about queenhithe when a shop is ill chosen the tradesman starves he is out of the way and business will not follow him that runs away from it suppose a shipchandler should set up in holborn or a blockmaker in whitecross street an anchorsmith at moorgate or a coachmaker in redriff and the like  it is true we have seen a kind of fate attend the very streets and rows where such trades have been gathered together and a street famous some years ago shall in a few years after be quite forsaken as paternoster row for mercers st pauls churchyard for woollendrapers both the eastcheaps for butchers and now you see hardly any of those trades left in those places  i mention it for this reason and this makes it to my purpose in an extraordinary manner that whenever the principal shopkeepers remove from such a street or settled place where the principal trade used to be the rest soon followknowing that if the fame of the trade is not there the customers will not resort thither and that a tradesmans business is to follow wherever the trade leads for a mercer to set up now in paternoster row or a woollendraper in st pauls churchyard the one among the sempstresses and the other among the chairmakers would be the same thing as for a country shopkeeper not to set up in or near the marketplace15  the place therefore is to be prudently chosen by the retailer when he first begins his business that he may put himself in the way of business and then with gods blessing and his own care he may expect his share of trade with his neighbours  2 he must take an especial care to have his shop not so much crowded with a large bulk of goods as with a wellsorted and wellchosen quantity proper for his business and to give credit to his beginning in order to this his buying part requires not only a good judgment in the wares he is to deal in but a perfect government of his judgment by his understanding to suit and sort his quantities and proportions as well to his shop as to the particular place where his shop is situated for example a particular trade is not only proper for such or such a part of the town but a particular assortment of goods even in the same way suits one part of the town or one town and not another as he that sets up in the strand or near the exchange is likely to sell more rich silks more fine hollands more fine broadcloths more fine toys and trinkets than one of the same trade setting up in the skirts of the town or at ratcliff or wapping or redriff and he that sets up in the capital city of a county than he that is placed in a private markettown in the same county and he that is placed in a markettown than he that is placed in a country village a tradesman in a seaport town sorts himself different from one of the same trade in an inland town though larger and more populous and this the tradesman must weigh very maturely before he lays out his stock  sometimes it happens a tradesman serves his apprenticeship in one town and sets up in another and sometimes circumstances altering he removes from one town to another the change is very important to him for the goods which he is to sell in the town he removes to are sometimes so different from the sorts of goods which he sold in the place he removed from though in the same way of trade that he is at a great loss both in changing his hand and in the judgment of buying this made me insist in a former chapter that a tradesman should take all occasions to extend his knowledge in every kind of goods that which way soever he may turn his hand he may have judgment in every thing  in thus changing his circumstances of trade he must learn as well as he can how to furnish his shop suitable to the place he is to trade in and to sort his goods to the demand which he is like to have there otherwise he will not only lose the customers for want of proper goods but will very much lose by the goods which he lays in for sale there being no demand for them where he is going  when merchants send adventures to our british colonies it is usual with them to make up to each factor what they call a sortable cargo that is to say they want something of every thing that may furnish the tradesmen there with parcels fit to fill their shops and invite their customers and if they fail and do not thus sort their cargoes the factors there not only complain as being ill sorted but the cargo lies by unsold because there is not a sufficient quantity of sorts to answer the demand and make them all marketable together  it is the same thing here if the tradesmans shop is not well sorted it is not suitably furnished or fitted to supply his customers and nothing dishonours him more than to have people come to buy things usual to be had in such shops and go away without them the next thing they say to one another is i went to that shop but i could not be furnished they are not stocked there for a trade one seldom finds any thing there that is new or fashionable and so they go away to another shop and not only go away themselves but carry others away with themfor it is observable that the buyers or retail customers especially the ladies follow one another as sheep follow the flock and if one buys a beautiful silk or a cheap piece of holland or a newfashioned thing of any kind the next inquiry is where it was bought and the shop is presently recommended for a shop well sorted and for a place where things are to be had not only cheap and good but of the newest fashion and where they have always great choice to please the curious and to supply whatever is called for and thus the trade runs away insensibly to the shops which are best sorted  3 the retail tradesman in especial but even every tradesman in his station must furnish himself with a competent stock of patience i mean that patience which is needful to bear with all sorts of impertinence and the most provoking curiosity that it is possible to imagine the buyers even the worst of them are or can be guilty of a tradesman behind his counter must have no flesh and blood about him no passions no resentment he must never be angry no not so much as seem to be so if a customer tumbles him five hundred pounds worth of goods and scarce bids money for any thingnay though they really come to his shop with no intent to buy as many do only to see what is to be sold and if they cannot be better pleased than they are at some other shop where they intend to buy it is all one the tradesman must take it and place it to the account of his calling that it is his business to be ill used and resent nothing and so must answer as obligingly to those that give him an hour or twos trouble and buy nothing as he does to those who in half the time lay out ten or twenty pounds the case is plain it is his business to get money to sell and please and if some do give him trouble and do not buy others make him amends and do buy and as for the trouble it is the business of his shop  i have heard that some ladies and those too persons of good note have taken their coaches and spent a whole afternoon in ludgate street or covent garden only to divert themselves in going from one mercers shop to another to look upon their fine silks and to rattle and banter the journeymen and shopkeepers and have not so much as the least occasion much less intention to buy any thing nay not so much as carrying any money out with them to buy anything if they fancied it yet this the mercers who understand themselves know their business too well to resent nor if they really knew it would they take the least notice of it but perhaps tell the ladies they were welcome to look upon their goods that it was their business to show them and that if they did not come to buy now they might perhaps see they were furnished to please them when they might have occasion  on the other hand i have been told that sometimes those sorts of ladies have been caught in their own snare that is to say have been so engaged by the good usage of the shopkeeper and so unexpectedly surprised with some fine thing or other that has been shown them that they have been drawn in by their fancy against their design to lay out money whether they had it or no that is to say to buy and send home for money to pay for it  but let it be how and which way it will whether mercer or draper or what trade you please the man that stands behind the counter must be all courtesy civility and good manners he must not be affronted or any way moved by any manner of usage whether owing to casualty or design if he sees himself ill used he must wink and not see ithe must at least not appear to see it nor any way show dislike or distaste if he does he reproaches not only himself but his shop and puts an ill name upon the general usuage of customers in it and it is not to be imagined how in this gossiping teadrinking age the scandal will run even among people who have had no knowledge of the person first complaining such a shop says a certain lady to a citizens wife in conversation as they were going to buy clothes i am resolved i wont go to it the fellow that keeps it is saucy and rude if i lay out my money i expect to be well used if i dont lay it out i expect to be well treated  why madam says the citizen did the man of the shop use your ladyship ill  ladyno i cant say he used me ill for i never was in his shop  cithow does your ladyship know he does so then  ladywhy i know he used another lady saucily because she gave him a great deal of trouble as he called it and did not buy  citwas it the lady that told you so herself madam  ladyi dont know really i have forgot who it was but i have such a notion in my head and i dont care to try for i hate the sauciness of shopkeepers when they dont understand themselves  citwell but madam perhaps it may be a mistakeand the lady that told you was not the person neither  ladyoh madam i remember now who told me it was my lady tattle when i was at mrs whymsys on a visiting day it was the talk of the whole circle and all the ladies took notice of it and said they would take care to shun that shop  citsure madam the lady was strangely used did she tell any of the particulars  ladyno i did not understand that she told the particulars for it seems it was not to her but to some other lady a friend of hers but it was all one the company took as much notice of it as if it had been to her and resented it as much i assure you  cityet and without examining the truth of the fact  ladywe did not doubt the story  citbut had no other proof of it madam than her relation  ladywhy thats true nobody asked for a proof it was enough to tell the story  citwhat though perhaps the lady did not know the person or whether it was true or no and perhaps had it from a third or fourth handyour ladyship knows any bodys credit may be blasted at that rate  ladywe dont inquire so nicely you know into the truth of stories at a teatable  citno madam thats true but when reputation is at stake we should be a little careful too  ladywhy thats true too but why are you so concerned about it madam do you know the man that keeps the shop  citno otherwise madam than that i have often bought there and i always found them the most civil obliging people in the world  ladyit may be they know you madam  citi am persuaded they dont for i seldom went but i saw new faces for they have a great many servants and journeymen in the shop  ladyit may be you are easy to be pleased you are goodhumoured yourself and cannot put their patience to any trial  citindeed madam just the contrary i believe i made them tumble two or three hundred pounds worth of goods one day and bought nothing and yet it was all one they used me as well as if i had laid out twenty pounds  ladywhy so they ought  cityes madam but then it is a token they do as they ought and understand themselves  ladywell i dont know much of it indeed but thus i was told  citwell but if your ladyship would know the truth of it you would do a piece of justice to go and try them  ladynot i besides i have a mercer of my acquaintance  citwell madam ill wait on your ladyship to your own mercer and if you cant find any thing to your liking will you go and try the other shop  ladyoh i am sure i shall deal if i go to my mercer  citwell but if you should let us go for a frolic and give the other as much trouble as we can for nothing and see how hell behave for i want to be satisfied if i find them as your ladyship has been told ill never go there any more  ladyupon that condition i agreei will go with you but i will go and lay out my money at my own mercers first because i wont be tempted  citwell madam ill wait on your ladyship till you have laid out your money  after this discourse they drove away to the mercers shop where the lady used to buy and when they came there the lady was surprisedthe shop was shut up and nobody to be seen the next door was a lacemans and the journeyman being at the door the lady sent her servant to desire him to speak a word or two to her and when he came says the lady to him  pray how long has mrs shop been shut up  lacemanabout a month madam  ladywhat is mrdead  lacemanno madam he is not dead  ladywhat then pray  lacemansomething worse madam he has had some misfortunes  ladyi am very sorry to hear it indeed so her ladyship made her bow and her coachman drove away  the short of the story was her mercer was broke upon which the city lady prevailed upon her ladyship to go to the other shop which she did but declared beforehand she would buy nothing but give the mercer all the trouble she could and so said the other and to make the thing more sure she would have them go into the shop single because she fancied the mercer knew the city lady and therefore would behave more civilly to them both on that account the other having laid out her money there several times well they went in and the lady asked for such and such rich things and had them shown her to a variety that she was surprised at but not the best or richest things they could show her gave her any satisfactioneither she did not like the pattern or the colours did not suit her fancy or they were too dear and so she prepares to leave the shop her coach standing at a distance which she ordered that they might not guess at her quality  but she was quite deceived in her expectation for the mercer far from treating her in the manner as she had heard used her with the utmost civility and good manners she treated him on the contrary as she said herself even with a forced rudeness she gave him all the impertinent trouble she was able as above and pretending to like nothing he showed turned away with an air of contempt intimating that his shop was ill furnished and that she should be easily served she doubted not at another  he told her he was very unhappy in not having any thing that suited her fancythat if she knew what particular things would please her he would have them in two hours time for her if all the french and italian merchants warehouses in london or all the weavers looms in spitalfields could furnish them but when that would not do she comes forward from his back shop where she had plagued him about an hour and a half and makes him the slight compliment of in a kind of a scornful tone too i am sorry i have given you so much trouble  the trouble madam is nothing it is my misfortune not to please you but as to trouble my business is to oblige the ladies my customers if i show my goods i may sell them if i do not show them i cannot if it is not a trouble to you ill show you every piece of goods in my shop if you do not buy now you may perhaps buy another time and thus in short he pursued her with all the good words in the world and waited on her towards the door  as she comes forward there she spied the city lady who had just used the partner as the lady had used the chief master and there as if it had been by mere chance she salutes her with your servant cousin pray what brought you here the cousin answers madam i am mighty glad to see your ladyship here i have been haggling here a good while but this gentleman and i cannot bargain and i was just going away  why then says the lady you have been just such another customer as i for i have troubled the gentleman mercer this two hours and i cannot meet with any thing to my mind so away they go together to the door and the lady gets the mercer to send one of his servants to bid her coachman drive to the door showing him where the fellow stood  while the boy was gone she takes the city lady aside and talking softly the mercer and his partner seeing them talk together withdrew but waited at a distance to be ready to hand them to the coach so they began a new discourse as follows  ladywell i am satisfied this man has been ill used in the world  citwhy madam how does your ladyship find him  ladyonly the most obliging most gentlemanlike man of a tradesman that ever i met with in my life  citbut did your ladyship try him as you said you would  ladytry him i believe he has tumbled three thousand pounds worth of goods for me  citdid you oblige him to do so  ladyi forced him to it indeed for i liked nothing  citis he well stocked with goods  ladyi told him his shop was ill furnished  citwhat did he say to that  ladysay why he carried me into another inner shop or warehouse where he had goods to a surprising quantity and value i confess  citand what could you say then  ladysay in truth i was ashamed to say any more but still was resolved not to be pleased and so came away as you see  citand he has not disobliged you at all has he  ladyjust the contrary indeed here she repeated the words the mercer had said to her and the modesty and civility he had treated her with  citwell madam i assure you i have been faithful to my promise for you cannot have used him so ill as i have used his partnerfor i have perfectly abused him for having nothing to please mei did as good as tell him i believed he was going to break and that he had no choice  ladyand how did he treat you  citjust in the same manner as his partner did your ladyship all mild and mannerly smiling and in perfect temper for my part if i was a young wench again i should be in love with such a man  ladywell but what shall we do now  citwhy be gone i think we have teazed them enough it would be cruel to bearbait them any more  ladyno i am not for teazing them any more but shall we really go away and buy nothing  citnay that shall be just as your ladyship pleasesyou know i promised you i would not buy that is to say unless you discharge me of that obligation  ladyi cannot for shame go out of this shop and lay out nothing  citdid your ladyship see any thing that pleased you  ladyi only saw some of the finest things in englandi dont think all the city of paris can outdo him  citwell madam if you resolve to buy let us go and look again  ladycome then and upon that the lady turning to the mercercome sir says she i think i will look upon that piece of brocade again i cannot find in my heart to give you all this trouble for nothing  madam says the mercer i shall be very glad if i can be so happy as to please you but i beseech your ladyship dont speak of the trouble for that is the duty of our trade we must never think our business a trouble  upon this the ladies went back with him into his inner shop and laid out between sixty and seventy pounds for they both bought rich suits of clothes and used his shop for many years after  the short inference from this long discourse is this that here you see and i could give many examples very like this how and in what manner a shopkeeper is to behave himself in the way of his businesswhat impertinences what taunts flouts and ridiculous things he must bear in his business and must not show the least return or the least signal of disgusthe must have no passions no fire in his temperhe must be all soft and smooth nay if his real temper be naturally fiery and hot he must show none of it in his shophe must be a perfect complete hypocrite if he will be a complete tradesman16  it is true natural tempers are not to be always counterfeitedthe man cannot easily be a lamb in his shop and a lion in himself but let it be easy or hard it must be done and it is done there are men who have by custom and usage brought themselves to it that nothing could be meeker and milder than they when behind the counter and yet nothing be more furious and raging in every other part of lifenay the provocations they have met with in their shops have so irritated their rage that they would go upstairs from their shop and fall into phrensies and a kind of madness and beat their heads against the wall and mischief themselves if not prevented till the violence of it had gotten vent and the passions abate and cool nay i heard once of a shopkeeper that behaved himself thus to such an extreme that when he was provoked by the impertinence of the customers beyond what his temper could bear he would go upstairs and beat his wife kick his children about like dogs and be as furious for two or three minutes as a man chained down in bedlam and when the heat was over would sit down and cry faster then the children he had abused and after the fit was over he would go down into his shop again and be as humble as courteous and as calm as any man whateverso absolute a government of his passions had he in the shop and so little out of it in the shop a soulless animal that can resent nothing and in the family a madman in the shop meek like the lamb but in the family outrageous like a lybian lion  the sum of the matter is this it is necessary for a tradesman to subject himself by all the ways possible to his business his customers are to be his idols so far as he may worship idols by allowance he is to bow down to them and worship them17 at least he is not any way to displease them or show any disgust or distaste at any thing they say or do the bottom of it all is that he is intending to get money by them and it is not for him that gets money by them to offer the least inconvenience to them by whom he gets it but he is to consider that as solomon says the borrower is servant to the lender so the seller is servant to the buyer  when a tradesman has thus conquered all his passions and can stand before the storm of impertinence he is said to be fitted up for the main article namely the inside of the counter  on the other hand we see that the contrary temper nay but the very suggestion of it hurries people on to ruin their trade to disoblige the customers to quarrel with them and drive them away we see by the lady above after having seen the ways she had taken to put this man out of temperi say we see it conquered her temper and brought her to lay out her money cheerfully and be his customer ever after  a sour morose dogmatic temper would have sent these ladies both away with their money in their pockets but the mans patience and temper drove the lady back to lay out her money and engaged her entirely  footnotes  15 paternoster row has long been the chief seat of the bookselling and publishing trade in london and there are now some splendid shops of mercers or haberdashers in st pauls churchyard also in ludgate hill adjoining  16 the necessity here insisted on seems a hard one and scarcely consistent with a just morality yet if the tradesman takes a right view of his situation he will scarcely doubt the propriety of defoes advice he must consider that in his shop he is as it were acting a part he performs a certain character in the drama of our social arrangements one which requires all the civility and forbearance above insisted on he is not called upon in such circumstances to feel speak and act as he would find himself in honour required to do in his private or absolutely personal capacityin his own house for instance or in any public place where he mingled on a footing of equality with his fellowcitizens accordingly there is such a general sense of the justifiableness of his conducting himself in this submissive spirit that no one would think of imputing it to him as a fault but he would be more apt to be censured or ridiculed if he had so little sense as to take offence in his capacity of tradesman at any thing which it would only concern him to resent if it were offered to him in his capacity as a private citizen  an incident somewhat like that so dramatically related by defoe occurred a few years ago in the northern capital a lady had through whim pestered a mercer in the manner related in the text turning over all his goods and only treating him with rudeness in return when she finally turned to leave the shop to inquire as she said for better and cheaper goods elsewhere she found that a shower was falling against which she had no protection the tradesman who had politely shown her to the door observing her hesitate on the threshold at sight of the rain requested her to wait a moment and stepping backwards for his umbrella instantly returned and in the kindest accents requested her to accept the loan of it she took it and went away but in a few minutes returned it in a totally different frame of spirit and not only purchased extensively on this occasion but became a constant customer for the future  another tradesman in the same city was so remarkable for his imperturbable civility that it became the subject of a betan individual undertaking to irritate him or if he failed to forfeit a certain sum he went to the shop and caused an immense quantity of the finest silks to be turned over after which he coolly asked for a pennyworth of a certain splendid piece of satin by all means said the discreet trader allow me sir to have your penny the coin was handed to him and taking up the piece of satin and placing the penny on the end of it he cut round with his scissors thus detaching a little bit of exactly the size and shape of the piece of money which was to purchase it this with the most polite air imaginable he handed to his customer whose confusion may be imagined  17 it appears to the editor that the case is here somewhat overstated while imperterbable good temper and civility are indispensible in the shopkeeper it is not impossible that he may also err in displaying a too great obsequiousness of manner this by disgusting the common sense and good taste of customers may do as much harm as want of civility a too pressing manner likewise does harm by causing the customer to feel as if he were obliged to purchase the medium of an easy obliging and goodhumoured manner is perhaps what suits best but here as in many other things it is not easy to lay down any general rule much must be left to the goos sense and tact of the trader     chapter ix  of other reasons for the tradesmans disasters and first of innocent diversions   a few directions seasonably given and wisely received will be sufficient to guide a tradesman in a right management of his business so as that if he observes them he may secure his prosperity and success but it requires a long and serious caveat to warn him of the dangers he meets with in his way trade is a straight and direct way if they will but keep in it with a steady foot and not wander and launch out here and there as a loose head and giddy fancy will prompt them to do  the road i say is straight and direct but there are many turnings and openings in it both to the right hand and to the left in which if a tradesman but once ventures to step awry it is ten thousand to one but he loses himself and very rarely finds his way back again at least if he does it is like a man that has been lost in a wood he comes out with a scratched face and torn clothes tired and spent and does not recover himself in a long while after  in a word one steady motion carries him up but many things assist to pull him down there are many ways open to his ruin but few to his rising and though employment is said to be the best fence against temptations and he that is busy heartily in his business temptations to idleness and negligence will not be so busy about him yet tradesmen are as often drawn from their business as other men and when they are so it is more fatal to them a great deal than it is to gentlemen and persons whose employments do not call for their personal attendance so much as a shop does  among the many turnings and byelanes which as i say are to be met with in the straight road of trade there are two as dangerous and fatal to their prosperity as the worst though they both carry an appearance of good and promise contrary to what they perform these are  i pleasures and diversions especially such as they will have us call innocent diversions  ii projects and adventures and especially such as promise mountains of profit in nubibus in the clouds and are therefore the more likely to ensnare the poor eager avaricious tradesman  1 i am now to speak of the first namely pleasures and diversions i cannot allow any pleasures to be innocent when they turn away either the body or the mind of a tradesman from the one needful thing which his calling makes necessary and that necessity makes his dutyi mean the application both of his hands and head to his business those pleasures and diversions may be innocent in themselves which are not so to him there are very few things in the world that are simply evil but things are made circumstantially evil when they are not so in themselves killing a man is not simply sinful on the contrary it is not lawful only but a duty when justice and the laws of god or man require it but when done maliciously from any corrupt principle or to any corrupted end is murder and the worst of crimes  pleasures and diversions are thus made criminal when a man is engaged in duty to a full attendance upon such business as those pleasures and diversions necessarily interfere with and interrupt those pleasures though innocent in themselves become a fault in him because his legal avocations demand his attendance in another place thus those pleasures may be lawful to another man which are not so to him because another man has not the same obligation to a calling the same necessity to apply to it the same cry of a family whose bread may depend upon his diligence as a tradesman has  solomon the royal patron of industry tells us he that is a lover of pleasure shall be a poor man i must not doubt but solomon is to be understood of tradesmen and working men such as i am writing of whose time and application is due to their business and who in pursuit of their pleasures are sure to neglect their shops or employments and i therefore render the words thus to the present purposethe tradesman that is a lover of pleasure shall be a poor man i hope i do not wrest the scripture in my interpretation of it i am sure it agrees with the whole tenor of the wise mans other discourses  when i see young shopkeepers keep horses ride ahunting learn doglanguage and keep the sportsmens brogue upon their tongues i will not say i read their destiny for i am no fortuneteller but i do say i am always afraid for them especially when i know that either their fortunes and beginnings are below it or that their trades are such as in a particular manner to require their constant attendance as to see a barber abroad on a saturday a cornfactor abroad on a wednesday and friday or a blackwellhall man on a thursday you may as well say a country shopkeeper should go ahunting on a marketday or go afeasting at the fair day of the town where he lives and yet riding and hunting are otherwise lawful diversions and in their kind very good for exercise and health  i am not for making a galleyslave of a shopkeeper and have him chained down to the oar but if he be a wise a prudent and a diligent tradesman he will allow himself as few excursions as possible  business neglected is business lost it is true there are some businesses which require less attendance than others and give a man less occasion of application but in general that tradesman who can satisfy himself to be absent from his business must not expect success if he is above the character of a diligent tradesman he must then be above the business too and should leave it to somebody that having more need of it will think it worth his while to mind it better  nor indeed is it possible a tradesman should be master of any of the qualifications which i have set down to denominate him complete if he neglects his shop and his time following his pleasures and diversions  i will allow that the man is not vicious and wicked that he is not addicted to drunkenness to women to gaming or any such things as those for those are not woundings but murder downright killing a man may wound and hurt himself sometimes in the rage of an ungoverned passion or in a phrensy or fever and intend no more but if he shoots himself through the head or hangs himself we are sure then he intended to kill and destroy himself and he dies inevitably  for a tradesman to follow his pleasures which indeed is generally attended with a slighting of his business leaving his shop to servants or others it is evident to me that he is indifferent whether it thrives or no and above all it is evident that his heart is not in his business that he does not delight in it or look on it with pleasure to a complete tradesman there is no pleasure equal to that of being in his business no delight equal to that of seeing himself thrive to see trade flow in upon him and to be satisfied that he goes on prosperously he will never thrive that cares not whether he thrives or no as trade is the chief employment of his life and is therefore called by way of eminence his business so it should be made the chief delight of his life the tradesman that does not love his business will never give it due attendance  pleasure is a bait to the mind and the mind will attract the body where the heart is the object shall always have the bodys company the great objection i meet with from young tradesmen against this argument is they follow no unlawful pleasures they do not spend their time in taverns and drinking to excess they do not spend their money in gaming and so stockstarve their business and rob the shop to supply the extravagant losses of play or they do not spend their hours in ill company and debaucheries all they do is a little innocent diversion in riding abroad now and then for the air and for their health and to ease their thoughts of the throng of other affairs which are heavy upon them c  these i say are the excuses of young tradesmen and indeed they are young excuses and i may say truly have nothing in them it is perhaps true or i may grant it so for the present purpose that the pleasure the tradesman takes is as he says not unlawful and that he follows only a little innocent diversion but let me tell him the words are ill put together and the diversion is rather recommended from the word little than from the word innocent if it be indeed but little it may be innocent but the case is quite altered by the extent of the thing and the innocence lies here not in the nature of the thing not in the diversion or pleasure that is taken but in the time it takes for if the man spends the time in it which should be spent in his shop or warehouse and his business suffers by his absence as it must do if the absence is long at a time or often practisedthe diversion so taken becomes criminal to him though the same diversion might be innocent in another  thus i have heard a young tradesman who loved his bottle excuse himself and say it is true i have been at the tavern but i was treated it cost me nothing and this he thinks clears him of all blame not considering that when he spends no money yet he spends five times the value of the money in time another says why indeed i was at the tavern yesterday all the afternoon but i could not help it and i spent but sixpence but at the same time perhaps it might be said he spent five pounds worth of time his business being neglected his shop unattended his books not posted his letters not written and the likefor all those things are works necessary to a tradesman as well as the attendance on his shop and infinitely above the pleasure of being treated at the expense of his time all manner of pleasures should buckle and be subservient to business he that makes his pleasure be his business will never make his business be a pleasure innocent pleasures become sinful when they are used to excess and so it is here the most innocent diversion becomes criminal when it breaks in upon that which is the due and just employment of the mans life pleasures rob the tradesman and how then can he call them innocent diversions they are downright thieves they rob his shop of his attendance and of the time which he ought to bestow there they rob his family of their due support by the mans neglecting that business by which they are to be supported and maintained and they oftentimes rob the creditors of their just debts the tradesman sinking by the inordinate use of those innocent diversions as he calls them as well by the expense attending them as the loss of his time and neglect of his business by which he is at last reduced to the necessity of shutting up shop in earnest which was indeed as good as shut before a shop without a master is like the same shop on a middling holiday half shut up and he that keeps it long so need not doubt but he may in a little time more shut it quite up  in short pleasure is a thief to business how any man can call it innocent let him answer that does so it robs him every way as i have said above and if the tradesman be a christian and has any regard to religion and his duty i must tell him that when upon his disasters he shall reflect and see that he has ruined himself and his family by following too much those diversions and pleasures which he thought innocent and which perhaps in themselves were really so he will find great cause to repent of that which he insisted on as innocent he will find himself lost by doing lawful things and that he made those innocent things sinful and those lawful things unlawful to him thus as they robbed his family and creditors before of their just debtsfor maintenance is a tradesmans just debt to his family and a wife and children are as much a tradesmans real creditors as those who trusted him with their goodsi say as his innocent pleasures robbed his family and creditors before they will rob him now of his peace and of all that calm of soul which an honest industrious though unfortunate tradesman meets with under his disasters  i am asked here perhaps how much pleasure an honestmeaning tradesman may be allowed to take for it cannot be supposed i should insist that all pleasure is forbidden him that he must have no diversion no spare hours no intervals from hurry and fatigue that would be to pin him down to the very floor of his shop as john sheppard was locked down to the floor of his prison  the answer to this question every prudent tradesman may make for himself if his pleasure is in his shop and in his business there is no danger of him but if he has an itch after exotic diversionsi mean such as are foreign to his shop and to his business and which i therefore call exoticlet him honestly and fairly state the case between his shop and his diversions and judge impartially for himself so much pleasure and no more may be innocently taken as does not interfere with or do the least damage to his business by taking him away from it  every moment that his trade wants him in his shop or warehouse it is his duty to be there it is not enough to say i believe i shall not be wanted or i believe i shall suffer no loss by my absence he must come to a point and not deceive himself if he does the cheat is all his own if he will not judge sincerely at first he will reproach himself sincerely at last for there is no fraud against his own reflections a man is very rarely a hypocrite to himself  the rule may be in a few words thus those pleasures or diversions and those only can be innocent which the man may or does use or allow himself to use without hindrance of or injury to his business and reputation  let the diversions or pleasures in question be what they will and how innocent soever they are in themselves they are not so to him because they interrupt or interfere with his business which is his immediate duty i have mentioned the circumstance which touches this part too namely that there may be a time when even the needful duties of religion may become faults and unseasonable when another more needful attendance calls for us to apply to it much more then those things which are only barely lawful there is a visible difference between the things which we may do and the things which we must do pleasures at certain seasons are allowed and we may give ourselves some loose to them but business i mean to the man of business is that needful thing of which it is not to be said it may but it must be done  again those pleasures which may not only be lawful in themselves but which may be lawful to other men yet are criminal and unlawful to him to gentlemen of fortunes and estates who being born to large possessions and have no avocations of this kind it is certainly lawful to spend their spare hours on horseback with their hounds or hawks pursuing their game or on foot with their gun and their net and their dogs to kill the hares or birds call which we call sport these are the men that can with a particular satisfaction when they come home say they have only taken an innocent diversion and yet even in these there are not wanting some excesses which take away the innocence of them and consequently the satisfaction in their reflection and therefore it was i said it was lawful to them to spend their spare hoursby which i am to be understood those hours which are not due to more solemn and weighty occasions such as the duties of religion in particular but as this is not my present subject i proceed for i am not talking to gentlemen now but to tradesmen  the prudent tradesman will in time consider what he ought or ought not to do in his own particular case as to his pleasuresnot what another man may or may not do in short nothing of pleasure or diversion can be innocent to him whatever it may be to another if it injures his business if it takes either his time or his mind or his delight or his attendance from his business nor can all the little excuses of its being for his health and for the needful unbending the bow of the mind from the constant application of business for all these must stoop to the great article of his shop and business though i might add that the bare taking the air for health and for a recess to the mind is not the thing i am talking ofit is the taking an immoderate liberty and spending an immoderate length of time and that at unseasonable and improper hours so as to make his pleasures and diversions be prejudicial to his businessthis is the evil i object to and this is too much the ruin of the tradesmen of this age and thus any man who calmly reads these papers will see i ought to be understood  nor do i confine this discourse to the innocent diversions of a horse and riding abroad to take the air things which as above are made hurtful and unlawful to him only as they are hindrances to his business and are more or less so as they rob his shop or warehouse or business or his attendance and time and cause him to draw his affections off from his calling  but we see other and new pleasures daily crowding in upon the tradesman and some which no age before this have been in danger ofi mean not to such an excess as is now the case and consequently there were fewer tradesmen drawn into the practice  the present age is a time of gallantry and gaiety nothing of the present pride and vanity was known or but very little of it in former times the baits which are every where laid for the corruption of youth and for the ruin of their fortunes were never so many and so mischievous as they are now  we scarce now see a tradesmans apprentice come to his fifth year but he gets a long wig and a sword and a set of companions suitable and this wig and sword being left at proper and convenient places are put on at night after the shop is shut or when they can slip out to go araking in and when they never fail of company ready to lead them into all manner of wickedness and debauchery and from this cause it is principally that so many apprentices are ruined and run away from their masters before they come out of their timesmore i am persuaded now than ever were to be found before  nor as i said before will i charge the devil with having any hand in the ruin of these young fellowsindeed he needs not trouble himself about them they are his own by early choicethey anticipate temptation and are as forward as the devil can desire them to be these may be truly said to be drawn aside of their own lusts and enticedthey need no tempter  but of these i may also say they seldom trouble the tradesmens class they get ruined early and finish the tradesman before they begin so my discourse is not at present directed much to them indeed they are past advice before they come in my way  indeed i knew one of these sort of gentlemenapprentices make an attempt to begin and set up his tradehe was a dealer in what they call crookedlane wares he got about £300 from his father an honest plain countryman to set him up and his said honest father exerted himself to the utmost to send him up so much money  when he had gotten the money he took a shop near the place where he had served his time and entering upon the shop he had it painted and fitted up and some goods he bought in order to furnish it but before that he was obliged to pay about £70 of the money to little debts which he had contracted in his apprenticeship at two or three alehouses for drink and eatables treats and junketings and at the barbers for long perukes at the sempstresss for fine hollandshirts turnovers white gloves c to make a beau of him and at several other places  when he came to dip into this and found that it wanted still £30 or £40 to equip him for the company which he had learned to keep he took care to do this first and being delighted with his new dress and how like a gentleman he looked he was resolved before he opened a shop to take his swing a little in the town so away he went with two of his neighbours apprentices to the playhouse thence to the tavern not far from his dwelling and there they fell to cards and sat up all nightand thus they spent about a fortnight the rest just creeping into their masters houses by the connivance of their fellowservants and he getting a bed in the tavern where what he spent to be sure made them willing enough to oblige himthat is to say to encourage him to ruin himself  they then changed their course indeed and went to the ball and that necessarily kept them out the most part of the night always having their supper dressed at the tavern at their return and thus in a few words he went on till he made way through all the remaining money he had left and was obliged to call his creditors together and break before he so much as opened his shopi say his creditors for great part of the goods which he had furnished his shop with were unpaid for perhaps some few might be bought with ready money  this man indeed is the only tradesman that ever i met with that set up and broke before his shop was open others i have indeed known make very quick work of it  but this part rather belongs to another head i am at present not talking of madmen as i hope indeed i am not writing to madmen but i am talking of tradesmen undone by lawful things by what they call innocent and harmless thingssuch as riding abroad or walking abroad to take the air and to divert themselves dogs gun countrysport and cityrecreation these things are certainly lawful and in themselves very innocent nay they may be needful for health and to give some relaxation to the mind hurried with too much business but the needfulness of them is so much made an excuse and the excess of them is so injurious to the tradesmans business and to his time which should be set apart for his shop and his trade that there are not a few tradesmen thus lawfully ruined as i may call itin a word lawful or unlawful their shop is neglected their business goes behindhand and it is all one to the subject of breaking and to the creditor whether the man was undone by being a knave or by being a fool it is all one whether he lost his trade by scandalous immoral negligence or by sober or religious negligence  in a word business languishes while the tradesman is absent and neglects it be it for his health or for his pleasure be it in good company or in bad be it from a good or an ill design and if the business languishes the tradesman will not be long before he languishes too for nothing can support the tradesman but his supporting his trade by a due attendance and application18  footnotes  18 in the above admirable series of plainspoken advices the author has omitted one weighty reason why young tradesmen should not spend their evenings in frivolous or otherwise improper company the actual loss of time and of money incurred by such courses of conduct is generally of less consequence than the losses arising from habitual distraction of mind and the acquisition of an acquaintanceship with a set of idle or silly companions it is of the utmost importance that young tradesmen should spend their leisure hours in a way calculated to soothe the feelings and enlarge the mind and in the present day from the prevalance of literature and other rational means for amusement they have ample opportunities of doing so     chapter x  of extravagant and expensive living another step to a tradesmans disaster   hitherto i have written of tradesmen ruined by lawful and innocent diversions and indeed these are some of the most dangerous pits for a tradesman to fall into because men are so apt to be insensible of the danger a ship may as well be lost in a calm smooth sea and an easy fair gale of wind as in a storm if they have no pilot or the pilot be ignorant or unwary and disasters of that nature happen as frequently as any others and are as fatal when rocks are apparent and the pilot bold and wilful runs directly upon them without fear or wit we know the fate of the shipit must perish and all that are in it will inevitably be lost but in a smooth sea a bold shore an easy gale the unseen rocks or shoals are the only dangers and nothing can hazard them but the skilfulness of the pilot and thus it is in trade open debaucheries and extravagances and a profusion of expense as well as a general contempt of business these are open and current roads to a tradesmans destruction but a silent going on in pursuit of innocent pleasures a smooth and calm but sure neglect of his shop and time and business will as effectually and as surely ruin the tradesman as the other and though the means are not so scandalous the effect is as certain but i proceed to the other  next to immoderate pleasures the tradesman ought to be warned against immoderate expense this is a terrible article and more particularly so to the tradesman as custom has now as it were on purpose for their undoing introduced a general habit of and as it were a general inclination among all sorts of people to an expensive way of living to which might be added a kind of necessity of it for that even with the greatest prudence and frugality a man cannot now support a family with the ordinary expense which the same family might have been maintained with some few years ago there is now 1 a weight of taxes upon almost all the necessaries of life bread and flesh excepted as coals salt malt candles soap leather hops wine fruit and all foreign consumptions 2 a load of pride upon the temper of the nation which in spite of taxes and the unusual dearess of every thing yet prompts people to a profusion in their expenses  this is not so properly called a tax upon the tradesmen i think rather it may be called a plague upon them for there is first the dearness of every necessary thing to make living expensive and secondly an unconquerable aversion to any restraint so that the poor will be like the rich and the rich like the great and the great like the greatestand thus the world runs on to a kind of distraction at this time where it will end time must discover  now the tradesman i speak of if he will thrive he must resolve to begin as he can go on and if he does so in a word he must resolve to live more under restraint than ever tradesmen of his class used to do for every necessary thing being as i have said grown dearer than before he must entirely omit all the enjoyment of the unnecessaries which he might have allowed himself before or perhaps be obliged to an expense beyond the income of his trade and in either of these cases he has a great hardship upon him  when i talk of immoderate expenses i must be understood not yet to mean the extravagances of wickedness and debaucheries there are so many sober extravagances and so many grave sedate ways for a tradesmans ruin and they are so much more dangerous than those hairbrained desperate ways of gaming and debauchery that i think it is the best service i can do the tradesmen to lay before them those sunk rocks as the seamen call them those secret dangers in the first place that they may know how to avoid them and as for the other common ways common discretion will supply them with caution for those and their senses will be their protection  the dangers to the tradesmen whom i am directing myself to are from lawful things and such as before are called innocent for i am speaking to the sober part of tradesmen who yet are often ruined and overthrown in trade and perhaps as many such miscarry as of the mad and extravagant particularly because their number far exceeds them expensive living is a kind of slow fever it is not so open so threatening and dangerous as the ordinary distemper which goes by that name but it preys upon the spirits and when its degrees are increased to a height is as fatal and as sure to kill as the other it is a secret enemy that feeds upon the vitals and when it has gone its full length and the languishing tradesman is weakened in his solid part i mean his stock then it overwhelms him at once  expensive living feeds upon the life and blood of the tradesman for it eats into the two most essential branches of his trade namely his credit and his cash the first is its triumph and the last is its food nothing goes out to cherish the exorbitance but the immediate money expenses seldom go on trust they are generally supplied and supported with ready money whatever are not  this expensive way of living consists in several things which are all indeed in their degree ruinous to the tradesman such as        1 expensive housekeeping or family extravagance       2 expensive dressing or the extravagance of fine clothes       3 expensive company or keeping company above himself       4 expensive equipages making a show and ostentation of      figure in the world  i might take them all in bulk and say what has a young tradesman to do with these and yet where is there a tradesman now to be found who is not more or less guilty it is as i have said the general vice of the times the whole nation are more or less in the crime what with necessity and inclination where is the man or the family that lives as such families used to live  in short good husbandry and frugality is quite out of fashion and he that goes about to set up for the practice of it must mortify every thing about him that has the least tincture of frugality it is the mode to live high to spend more than we get to neglect trade contemn care and concern and go on without forecast or without consideration and in consequence it is the mode to go on to extremity to break become bankrupt and beggars and so going off the trading stage leave it open for others to come after us and do the same19  to begin with housekeeping i have already hinted that every thing belonging to the family subsistence bears a higher price than usual i may say than ever at the same time i can neither undertake to prove that there is more got by selling or more ways to get it i mean to a tradesman than there was formerly the consequence then must be that the tradesmen do not grow rich faster than formerly at least we may venture to say this of tradesmen and their families comparing them with former times namely that there is not more got and i am satisfied there is less laid up than was then or if you will have it that tradesmen get less and spend more than they ever did how they should be richer than they were in those times is very hard to say  that all things are dearer than formerly to a housekeeper needs little demonstration the taxes necessarily infer it from the weight of them and the many things charged for besides the things enumerated above we find all articles of foreign importation are increased by the high duties laid on them such as linen especially fine linen silk especially foreign wrought silk every thing eatable drinkable and wearable are made heavy to us by high and exorbitant customs and excises as brandies tobacco sugar deals and timber for building oil wine spice raw silks calico chocolate coffee tea on some of these the duties are more than doubled and yet that which is most observable is that such is the expensive humour of the times that not a family no hardly of the meanest tradesman but treat their friends with wine or punch or fine ale and have their parlours set off with the teatable and the chocolatepottreats and liquors all exotic foreign and new among tradesmen and terrible articles in their modern expenses which have nothing to be said for them either as to the expense of them or the helps to health which they boast of on the contrary they procure us rheumatic bodies and consumptive purses and can no way pass with me for necessaries but being needless they add to the expense by sending us to the doctors and apothecaries to cure the breaches which they make in our health and are themselves the very worst sort of superfluities  but i come back to necessaries and even in them familyexpenses are extremely risen provisions are higher ratedno provisions that i know of except only bread mutton and fish but are made dearer than everhouserent in almost all the cities and towns of note in england is excessively and extremely dearer and that in spite of such innumerable buildings as we see almost everywhere raised up as well in the country as in london and the parts adjacent  add to the rents of houses the wages of servants a tradesman be he ever so much inclined to good husbandry cannot always do his kitchenwork himself suppose him a bachelor or can his wife suppose him married and suppose her to have brought him any portion be his bedfellow and his cook too these maidservants then are to be considered and are an exceeding tax upon housekeepers those who were formerly hired at three pounds to four pounds ayear wages now demand five six and eight pounds ayear nor do they double anything upon us but their wages and their pride for instead of doing more work for their advance of wages they do less and the ordinary work of families cannot now be performed by the same number of maids which in short is a tax upon the upper sort of tradesmen and contributes very often to their disasters by the extravagant keeping three or four maidservants in a house nay sometimes five where two formerly were thought sufficient this very extravagance is such that talking lately with a man very well experienced in this matter he told me he had been making his calculations on that very particular and he found by computation that the number of servants kept by all sorts of people tradesmen as well as others was so much increased that there are in london and the towns within ten miles of it take it every way above a hundred thousand more maidservants and footmen at this time in place than used to be in the same compass of ground thirty years ago20 and that their wages amounted to above forty shillings ahead per annum more than the wages of the like number of servants did amount to at the same length of time past the advance to the whole body amounting to no less than two hundred thousand pounds ayear  indeed it is not easy to guess what the expense of wages to servants amounts to in a year in this nation and consequently we cannot easily determine what the increase of that expense amounts to in england but certainly it must rise to many hundred thousand pounds ayear in the whole  the tradesmen bear their share of this expense and indeed too great a share very ordinary tradesmen in london keeping at least two maids and some more and some a footman or two besides for it is an ordinary thing to see the tradesmen and shopkeepers of london keep footmen as well as the gentlemen witness the infinite number of blue liveries which are so common now that they are called the tradesmens liveries and few gentlemen care to give blue to their servants for that very reason  in proportion to their servants the tradesmen now keep their tables which are also advanced in their proportion of expense to other things indeed the citizens and tradesmens tables are now the emblems not of plenty but of luxury not of good housekeeping but of profusion and that of the highest kind of extravagance insomuch that it was the opinion of a gentleman who had been not a traveller only but a nice observer of such things abroad that there is at this time more waste of provisions in england than in any other nation in the world of equal extent of ground and that england consumes for their whole subsistence more flesh than half europe besides that the beggars of london and within ten miles round it eat more white bread than the whole kingdom of scotland21 and the like  but this is an observation only though i believe it is very just i am bringing it in here only as an example of the dreadful profusion of this age and how an extravagant way of expensive living perfectly negligent of all degrees of frugality or good husbandry is the reigning vice of the people i could enlarge upon it and very much to the purpose here but i shall have occasion to speak of it again  the tradesman whom i am speaking to by way of direction will not i hope think this the way for him to thrive or find it for his convenience to fall in with this common height of living presently in his beginning if he comes gradually into it after he has gotten something considerable to lay by i say if he does it then it is early enough and he may be said to be insensibly drawn into it by the necessity of the times because forsooth it is a received notion we must be like other folks i say if he does fall into it then when he will pretend he cannot help it it is better than worse and if he can afford it well and good but to begin thus to set up at this rate when he first looks into the world i can only say this he that begins in such a manner it will not be difficult to guess where he will end for a tradesmans pride certainly precedes his destruction and an expensive living goes before his fall  we are speaking now to a tradesman who it is supposed must live by his business a young man who sets up a shop or warehouse and expects to get money one that would be a rich tradesman rather than a poor fine gay man a grave citizen not a peacocks feather for he that sets up for a sir fopling flutter instead of a complete tradesman is not to be thought capable of relishing this discourse neither does this discourse relish him for such men seem to be among the incurables and are rather fit for an hospital of fools so the french call our bedlam than to undertake trade and enter upon business  trade is not a ball where people appear in masque and act a part to make sport where they strive to seem what they really are not and to think themselves best dressed when they are least known but it is a plain visible scene of honest life shown best in its native appearance without disguise supported by prudence and frugality and like strong stiff clay land grows fruitful only by good husbandry culture and manuring  a tradesman dressed up fine with his long wig and sword may go to the ball when he pleases for he is already dressed up in the habit like a piece of counterfeit money he is brass washed over with silver and no tradesman will take him for current with money in his hand indeed he may go to the merchants warehouse and buy any thing but no body will deal with him without it he may write upon his edged hat as a certain tradesman after having been once broke and set up again i neither give nor take credit and as others set up in their shops no trust by retail so he may say no trust by wholesale in short thus equipped he is truly a tradesman in masquerade and must pass for such wherever he is known how long it may be before his dress and he may suit it not hard to guess  some will have it that this expensive way of living began among the tradesmen first that is to say among the citizens of london and that their eager resolved pursuit of that empty and meanest kind of pride called imitation namely to look like the gentry and appear above themselves drew them into it it has indeed been a fatal custom but it has been too long a city vanity if men of quality lived like themselves men of no quality would strive to live not like themselves if those had plenty these would have profusion if those had enough these would have excess if those had what was good these would have what was rare and exotic i mean as to season and consequently dear and this is one of the ways that have worn out so many tradesmen before their time  this extravagance wherever it began had its first rise among those sorts of tradesmen who scorning the society of their shops and customers applied themselves to rambling to courts and plays kept company above themselves and spent their hours in such company as lives always above them this could not but bring great expense along with it and that expense would not be confined to the bare keeping such company abroad but soon showed itself in a living like them at home whether the tradesmen could support it or no  keeping high company abroad certainly brings on visitings and high treatings at home and these are attended with costly furniture rich clothes and dainty tables how these things agree with a tradesmans income it is easy to suggest and that in short these measures have sent so many tradesmen to the mint and to the fleet where i am witness to it that they have still carried on their expensive living till they have come at last to starving and misery but have been so used to it they could not abate it or at least not quite leave it off though they wanted the money to pay for it  nor is the expensive dressing a little tax upon tradesmen as it is now come up to an excess not formerly known to tradesmen and though it is true that this particularly respects the ladies for the tradesmens wives now claim that title as they do by their dress claim the appearance yet to do justice to them and not to load the women with the reproach as if it were wholly theirs it must be acknowledged the men have their share in dress as the times go now though it is true not so antic and gay as in former days but do we not see fine wigs fine holland shirts of six to seven shillings an ell and perhaps laced also all lately brought down to the level of the apron and become the common wear of tradesmennay i may say of tradesmens apprenticesand that in such a manner as was never known in england before  if the tradesman is thriving and can support this and his credit too that makes the case differ though even then it cannot be said to be suitable but for a tradesman to begin thus is very imprudent because the expense of this as i said before drains the very lifeblood of his trade taking away his ready money only and making no return but the worst of return poverty and reproach and in case of miscarriage infinite scandal and offence  i am loth to make any part of my writing a satire upon the women nor indeed does the extravagance either of dress or housekeeping lie all or always at the door of the tradesmens wivesthe husband is often the prompter of it at least he does not let his wife into the detail of his circumstances he does not make her mistress of her own condition but either flatters her with notions of his wealth his profits and his flourishing circumstances and so the innocent woman spends high and lives great believing that she is in a condition to afford it and that her husband approves of it at least he does not offer to retrench or restrain her but lets her go on and indeed goes on with her to the ruin of both  i cannot but mention one thing here though i purpose to give you one discourse on that subject by itself namely the great and indispensable obligation there is upon a tradesman always to acquaint his wife with the truth of his circumstances and not to let her run on in ignorance till she falls with him down the precipice of an unavoidable ruina thing no prudent woman would do and therefore will never take amiss a husbands plainness in that particular case but i reserve this to another place because i am rather directing my discourse at this time to the tradesman at his beginning and as it may be supposed unmarried  next to the expensive dressing i place the expensive keeping company as one thing fatal to a tradesman and which if he would be a complete tradesman he should avoid with the utmost diligence it is an agreeable thing to be seen in good company for a man to see himself courted and valued and his company desired by men of fashion and distinction is very pleasing to any young tradesman and it is really a snare which a young tradesman if he be a man of sense can very hardly resist there is in itself indeed nothing that can be objected against or is not very agreeable to the nature of man and that not to his vicious part merely but even to his best faculties for who would not value himself upon being as above rendered acceptable to men both in station and figure above themselves and it is really a piece of excellent advice which a learned man gave to his son always to keep company with men above himself not with men below himself  but take me now to be talking as i really am not to the man merely but to his circumstances if he were a man of fortune and had the view of great things before him it would hold good but if he is a young tradesman such as i am now speaking of who is newly entered into business and must depend upon his said business for his subsistence and support and hopes to raise himself by iti say if i am talking to such a one i must say to him that keeping company as above with men superior to himself in knowledge in figure and estate is not his business for first as such conversation must necessarily take up a great deal of his time so it ordinarily must occasion a great expense of money and both destructive of his prosperity nay sometimes the first may be as fatal to him as the last and it is oftentimes true in that sense of trade that while by keeping company he is drawn out of his business his absence from his shop or warehouse is the most fatal to him and while he spends one crown in the tavern he spends forty crowns worth of his time and with this difference too which renders it the worse to the tradesman namely that the money may be recovered and gotten up again but the time cannot for example  1 perhaps in that very juncture a person comes to his warehouse suppose the tradesman to be a warehousekeeper who trades by commission and this person being a clothier in the country comes to offer him his business the commission of which might have been worth to him thirty to forty or fifty pounds per annum but finding him abroad or rather not finding him at home and in his business goes to another and fixes with him at once i once knew a dealer lose such an occasion as this for an afternoons pleasure he being gone afishing into hackneymarsh this loss can never be restored this expense of time was a fatal expense of money and no tradesman will deny but they find many such things as this happen in the course of trade either to themselves or others  2 another tradesman is invited to dinner by his great friend for i am now speaking chiefly upon the subject of keeping high company and what the tradesman sometimes suffers by it it is true that there he finds a most noble entertainment the person of quality and that professes a friendship for him treats him with infinite respect is fond of him makes him welcome as a princefor i am speaking of the acquaintance as really valuable and good in itselfbut then see it in its consequences the tradesman on this occasion misses his change that is omits going to the exchange for that one day only and not being found there a merchant with whom he was in treaty for a large parcel of foreign goods which would have been to his advantage to have bought sells them to another more diligent man in the same way and when he comes home he finds to his great mortification that he has lost a bargain that would have been worth a hundred pounds buying and now being in want of the goods he is forced to entreat his neighbour who bought them to part with some of them at a considerable advance of price and esteem it a favour too who now paid dearest for the visit to a person of figurethe gentleman who perhaps spent twenty shillings extraordinary to give him a handsome dinner or the tradesman who lost a bargain worth a hundred pounds buying to go to eat it  3 another tradesman goes to change in the ordinary course of his business intending to speak with some of the merchants his customers as is usual and get orders for goods or perhaps an appointment to come to his warehouse to buy but a snare of the like kind falls in his way and a couple of friends who perhaps have little or no business at least with him lay hold of him and they agree to go off change to the tavern together by complying with this invitation he omits speaking to some of those merchants as above who though he knew nothing of their minds yet it had been his business to have shown himself to them and have put himself in the way of their call but omitting this he goes and drinks a bottle of wine as above and though he stays but an hour or as we say but a little while yet unluckily in that interim the merchant not seeing him on the exchange calls at his warehouse as he goes from the exchange but not finding him there either he goes to another warehouse and gives his orders to the value of £300 or £400 to a more diligent neighbour of the same business by which he the warehousekeeper not only loses the profit of selling that parcel or serving that order but the merchant is shown the way to his neighbours warehouse who being more diligent than himself fails not to cultivate his interest obliges him with selling low even to little or no gain for the first parcel and so the unhappy tradesman loses not his selling that parcel only but loses the very customer which was as it were his peculiar property before  all these things and many more such are the consequences of a tradesmans absence from his business and i therefore say the expense of time on such light occasions as these is one of the worst sorts of extravagance and the most fatal to the tradesman because really he knows not what he loses  above all things the tradesman should take care not to be absent in the season of business as i have mentioned above for the warehousekeeper to be absent from change which is his market or from his warehouse at the times when the merchants generally go about to buy he had better be absent all the rest of the day  i know nothing is more frequent than for the tradesman when company invites or an excursion from business presses to say well come i have nothing to do there is no business to hinder there is nothing neglected i have no letters to write and the like and away he goes to take the air for the afternoon or to sit and enjoy himself with a friendall of them things innocent and lawful in themselves but here is the crisis of a tradesmans prosperity in that very moment business presents a valuable customer comes to buy an unexpected bargain offers to be sold another calls to pay money and the like nay i would almost say but that i am loth to concern the devil in more evils than he is guilty ofthat the devil frequently draws a man out of his business when something extraordinary is just at hand for his advantage  but not as i have said to charge the devil with what he is not guilty of the tradesman is generally his own tempter his head runs off from his business by a secret indolence company and the pleasure of being well received among gentlemen is a cursed snare to a young tradesman and carries him away from his business for the mere vanity of being caressed and complimented by men who mean no ill and perhaps know not the mischief they do to the man they show respect to and this the young tradesman cannot resist and that is in time his undoing  the tradesmans pleasure should be in his business his companions should be his books and if he has a family he makes his excursions up stairs and no farther when he is there a bell or a call brings him down and while he is in his parlour his shop or his warehouse never misses him his customers never go away unserved his letters never come in and are unanswered none of my cautions aim at restraining a tradesman from diverting himself as we call it with his fireside or keeping company with his wife and children there are so few tradesmen ruin themselves that way and so few ill consequences happen upon an uxorious temper that i will not so much as rank it with the rest nor can it be justly called one of the occasions of a tradesmans disasters on the contrary it is too often that the want of a due complacency there the want of taking delight there estranges the man from not his parlour only but his warehouse and shop and every part of business that ought to engross both his mind and his time that tradesman who does not delight in his family will never long delight in his business for as one great end of an honest tradesmans diligence is the support of his family and the providing for the comfortable subsistence of his wife and children so the very sight of and above all his tender and affectionate care for his wife and children is the spur of his diligence that is it puts an edge upon his mind and makes him hunt the world for business as hounds hunt the woods for their game when he is dispirited or discouraged by crosses and disappointments and ready to lie down and despair the very sight of his family rouses him again and he flies to his business with a new vigour i must follow my business says he or we must all starve my poor children must perish in a word he that is not animated to diligence by the very sight and thought of his wife and children being brought to misery and distress is a kind of a deaf adder that no music will charm or a turkish mute that no pity can move in a word he is a creature not to be called human a wretch hardened against all the passions and affections that nature has furnished to other animals and as there is no rhetoric of use to such a kind of man as that so i am not talking to such a one he must go among the incurables for where nature cannot work what can argument assist  footnotes  19 now as in defoes time a common observer is apt to be impressed with the idea that expenses with a large part of the community exceed gains certainly this is true at all times with a certain portion of society but probably at no time with a large portion there is a tendency to great selfdeception in all such speculations and no one ever thinks of bringing them to the only true teststatistical facts the reader ought therefore to pay little attention to the complaints in the text as to an increased extravagance in the expenses of tradesmen and only regard the general recommendation and the reasons by which that recommendation is enforced to live within income  20 there can be little doubt that the calculation of this experienced gentleman is grossly inconsistent with the truth nevertheless this part of defoes work contains some curious traits of manners which are probably not exaggerated  21 defoe from his having been employed for several years in scotland at the time of the union must have well known how rare was then the use of white or wheaten bread in that country     chapter xi  of the tradesmans marrying too soon   it was a prudent provision which our ancestors made in the indenture of tradesmens apprentices that they should not contract matrimony during their apprenticeship and they bound it with a penalty that was then thought sufficient however custom has taken off the edge of it since namely that they who did thus contract matrimony should forfeit their indentures that is to say should lose the benefit of their whole service and not be made free  doubtless our forefathers were better acquainted with the advantages of frugality than we are and saw farther into the desperate consequences of expensive living in the beginning of a tradesmans setting out into the world than we do at least it is evident they studied more and practised more of the prudential part in those cases than we do  hence we find them very careful to bind their youth under the strongest obligations they could to temperance modesty and good husbandry as the grand foundations of their prosperity in trade and to prescribe to them such rules and methods of frugality and good husbandry as they thought would best conduce to their prosperity  among these rules this was one of the chiefnamely that they should not wed before they had sped it is an old homely rule and coarsely expressed but the meaning is evident that a young beginner should never marry too soon while he was a servant he was bound from it as above and when he had his liberty he was persuaded against it by all the arguments which indeed ought to prevail with a considering mannamely the expenses that a family necessarily would bring with it and the care he ought to take to be able to support the expense before he brought it upon himself  on this account it is i say our ancestors took more of their youth than we now do at least i think they studied well the best methods of thriving and were better acquainted with the steps by which a young tradesman ought to be introduced into the world than we are and of the difficulties which those people would necessarily involve themselves in who despising those rules and methods of frugality involved themselves in the expense of a family before they were in a way of gaining sufficient to support it  a married apprentice will always make a repenting tradesman and those stolen matches a very few excepted are generally attended with infinite broils and troubles difficulties and cross events to carry them on at first by way of intrigue to conceal them afterwards under fear of superiors to manage after that to keep off scandal and preserve the character as well of the wife as of the husband and all this necessarily attended with a heavy expense even before the young man is out of his time before he has set a foot forward or gotten a shilling in the world so that all this expense is out of his original stock even before he gets it and is a sad drawback upon him when it comes  nay this unhappy and dirty part is often attended with worse consequences still for this expense coming upon him while he is but a servant and while his portion or whatever it is to be called is not yet come into his hand he is driven to terrible exigencies to supply this expense if his circumstances are mean and his trade mean he is frequently driven to wrong his master and rob his shop or his till for money if he can come at it and this as it begins in madness generally ends in destruction for often he is discovered exposed and perhaps punished and so the man is undone before he begins if his circumstances are good and he has friends that are able and expectations that are considerable then his expense is still the greater and ways and means are found out or at least looked for to supply the expense and conceal the fact that his friends may not know it till he has gotten the blessing he expects into his hands and is put in a way to stand upon his own legs and then it comes out with a great many grieving aggravations to a parent to find himself tricked and defeated in the expectations of his sons marrying handsomely and to his advantage instead of which he is obliged to receive a dishclout for a daughterinlaw and see his family propagated by a race of beggars and yet perhaps as haughty as insolent and as expensive as if she had blessed the family with a lady of fortune and brought a fund with her to have supported the charge of her posterity  when this happens the poor young mans case is really deplorable before he is out of his time he is obliged to borrow of friends if he has any on pretence his father does not make him a sufficient allowance or he trenches upon his masters cash which perhaps he being the eldest apprentice is in his hands and this he does depending that when he is out of his time and his father gives him wherewith to set up he will make good the deficiency and all this happens accordingly so that his reputation as to his master is preserved and he comes off clear as to dishonesty in his trust  but what a sad chasm does it make in his fortune i knew a certain young tradesman whose father knowing nothing of his sons measures gave him £2000 to set up with straining himself to the utmost for the well introducing his son into the world but who when he came to set up having near a year before married the servantmaid of the house where he lodged and kept her privately at a great expense had above £600 of his stock already wasted and sunk before he began for himself the consequence of which was that going in partner with another young man who had likewise £2000 to begin with he was instead of half of the profits obliged to make a private article to accept of a third of the trade and the beggarwife proving more expensive by far than the partners wife who married afterwards and doubled his fortune the first young man was obliged to quit the trade and with his remaining stock set up by himself in which case his expenses continuing and his stock being insufficient he sank gradually and then broke and died poor in a word he broke the heart of his father wasted what he had and could never recover it and at last it broke his own heart too  but i shall bring it a little farther suppose the youth not to act so grossly neither not to marry in his apprenticeship not to be forced to keep a wife privately and eat the bread he never got but suppose him to be entered upon the world that he has set up opened shop or fitted up his warehouse and is ready to trade the next thing in the ordinary course of the world at this time is a wife nay i have met with some parents who have been indiscreet enough themselves to prompt their sons to marry as soon as they are set up and the reason they give for it is the wickedness of the age that youth are drawn in a hundred ways to ruinous matches or debaucheries and are so easily ruined by the mere looseness of their circumstances that it is needful to marry them to keep them at home and to preserve them diligent and bind them close to their business  this be it just or not is a bad cure of an ill disease it is ruining the young man to make him sober and making him a slave for life to make him diligent be it that the wife he shall marry is a sober frugal housewifely woman and that nothing is to be laid to her charge but the mere necessary addition of a family expense and that with the utmost moderation yet at the best he cripples his fortune stockstarves his business and brings a great expense upon himself at first before by his success in trade he had laid up stock enough to support the charge  first it is reasonable to suppose that at his beginning in the world he cannot expect to get so good a portion with a wife as he might after he had been set up a few years and by his diligence and frugality joined to a small expense in housekeeping had increased both his stock in trade and the trade itself then he would be able to look forward boldly and would have some pretence for insisting on a fortune when he could make out his improvements in trade and show that he was both able to maintain a wife and able to live without her when a young tradesman in holland or germany goes acourting i am told the first question the young woman asks of him or perhaps her friends for her is are you able to pay the charges that is to say in english are you able to keep a wife when you have got her the question is a little gothic indeed and would be but a kind of gross way of receiving a lover here according to our english good breeding but there is a great deal of reason in the inquiry that must be confessed and he that is not able to pay the charges should never begin the journey for be the wife what she will the very state of life that naturally attends the marrying a woman brings with it an expense so very considerable that a tradesman ought to consider very well of it before he engages  but it is to be observed too that abundance of young tradesmen especially in england not only marry early but by the so marrying they are obliged to take up with much less fortunes in their haste than when they allow themselves longer time of consideration as it stands now generally speaking the wife and the shop make their first show together but how few of these early marriages succeedhow hard such a tradesman finds it to stand and support the weight that attends iti appeal to the experience of those who having taken this wrong step and being with difficulty got over it are yet good judges of that particular circumstance in others that come after them22  i know it is a common cry that is raised against the woman when her husband fails in business namely that it is the wife has ruined him it is true in some particular cases it may be so but in general it is wrong placedthey may say marrying has ruined the man when they cannot say his wife has done it for the woman was not in fault but her husband  when a tradesman marries there are necessary consequences i mean of expenses which the wife ought not be charged with and cannot be made accountable forsuch as first furnishing the house and let this be done with the utmost plainness so as to be decent yet it must be done and this calls for ready money and that ready money by so much diminishes his stock in trade nor is the wife at all to be charged in this case unless she either put him to more charge than was needful or showed herself dissatisfied with things needful and required extravagant gaiety and expense secondly servants if the man was frugal before it may be he shifted with a shop and a servant in it an apprentice or journeyman or perhaps without one at first and a lodging for himself where he kept no other servant and so his expenses went on small and easy or if he was obliged to take a house because of his business and the situation of his shop he then either let part of the house out to lodgers keeping himself a chamber in it or at the worst left it unfurnished and without any one but a maidservant to dress his victuals and keep the house clean and thus he goes on when a bachelor with a middling expense at most  but when he brings home a wife besides the furnishing his house he must have a formal housekeeping even at the very first and as children come on more servants that is maids or nurses that are as necessary as the bread he eatsespecially if he multiplies apace as he ought to suppose he mayin this case let the wife be frugal and managing let her be unexceptionable in her expense yet the man finds his charge mount high and perhaps too high for his gettings notwithstanding the additional stock obtained by her portion and what is the end of this but inevitable decay and at last poverty and ruin  nay the more the woman is blameless the more certain is his overthrow for if it was an expense that was extravagant and unnecessary and that his wife ran him out by her high living and gaiety he might find ways to retrench to take up in time and prevent the mischief that is in view a woman may with kindness and just reasoning be easily convinced that her husband cannot maintain such an expense as she now lives at and let tradesmen say what they will and endeavour to excuse themselves as much as they will by loading their wives with the blame of their miscarriage as i have known some do and as old father adam though in another case did before them i must say so much in the womans behalf at a venture it will be very hard to make me believe that any woman that was not fit for bedlam if her husband truly and timely represented his case to her and how far he was or was not able to maintain the expense of their way of living would not comply with her husbands circumstances and retrench her expenses rather than go on for a while and come to poverty and misery let then the tradesman lay it early and seriously before his wife and with kindness and plainness tell her his circumstances or never let him pretend to charge her with being the cause of his ruin let him tell her how great his annual expense is for a woman who receives what she wants as she wants it that only takes it with one hand and lays it out with another does not and perhaps cannot always keep an account or cast up how much it comes to by the year let her husband therefore i say tell her honestly how much his expense for her and himself amounts to yearly and tell her as honestly that it is too much for him that his income in trade will not answer it that he goes backward and the last year his family expenses amounted to so much say £400for that is but an ordinary sum now for a tradesman to spend whatever it has been esteemed formerlyand that his whole trade though he made no bad debts and had no losses brought him in but £320 the whole year so that he was £80 that year a worse man than he was before that this coming year he had met with a heavy loss already having had a shopkeeper in the country broke in his debt £200 and that he offered but eight shillings in the pound so that he should lose £120 by him and that this added to the £80 run out last year came to £200 and that if they went on thus they should be soon reduced  what could the woman say to so reasonable a discourse if she was a woman of any sense but to reply she would do any thing that lay in her to assist him and if her way of living was too great for him to support she would lessen it as he should direct or as much as he thought was reasonableand thus going hand in hand she and he together abating what reason required they might bring their expenses within the compass of their gettings and be able to go on again comfortably  but now when the man finding his expenses greater than his income and yet when he looks into those expenses finds that his wife is frugal too and industrious and applies diligently to the managing her family and bringing up her children spends nothing idly saves every thing that can be saved that instead of keeping too many servants is a servant to every body herself and that in short when he makes the strictest examination finds she lays out nothing but what is absolutely necessary what now must this man do he is ruined inevitablyfor all his expense is necessary there is no retrenching no abating any thing  this i say is the worst case of the two indeed and this man though he may say he is undone by marrying yet cannot blame the woman and say he is undone by his wife this is the very case i am speaking of the man should not have married so soon he should have staid till he had by pushing on his trade and living close in his expense increased his stock and been what we call beforehand in the world and had he done thus he had not been undone by marrying  it is a little hard to say it but in this respect it is very true there is many a young tradesman ruined by marrying a good wifein which pray take notice that i observe my own just distinction i do not say they are ruined or undone by a good wife or by their wives being good but by their marryingtheir unseasonable early and hasty marryingbefore they had cast up the cost of one or the income of the otherbefore they had inquired into the necessary charge of a wife and a family or seen the profits of their business whether it would maintain them or no and whether as above they could pay the charges the increasing necessary charge of a large and growing family how to persuade young men to consider this in time and beware and avoid the mischief of it that is a question by itself  let no man then when he is brought to distress by this early rashness turn short upon his wife and reproach her with being the cause of his ruin unless at the same time he can charge her with extravagant living needless expense squandering away his money spending it in trifles and toys and running him out till the shop could not maintain the kitchen much less the parlour nor even then unless he had given her timely notice of it and warned her that he was not able to maintain so large a family or so great an expense and that therefore she would do well to consider of it and manage with a straiter hand and the like if indeed he had done so and she had not complied with him then she had been guilty and without excuse too but as the woman cannot judge of his affairs and he sees and bears a share in the riotous way of their living and does not either show his dislike of it or let her know by some means or other that he cannot support it the woman cannot be charged with being his ruinno though her way of extravagant expensive living were really the cause of it i met with a short dialogue the other day between a tradesman and his wife upon such a subject as this some part of which may be instructing in the case before us  the tradesman was very melancholy for two or three days and had appeared all that time to be pensive and sad and his wife with all her arts entreaties anger and tears could not get it out of him only now and then she heard him fetch a deep sigh and at another time say he wished he was dead and the like expressions at last she began the discourse with him in a respectful obliging manner but with the utmost importunity to get it out of him thus  wifemy dear what is the matter with you  husbnothing  wifenay dont put me off with an answer that signifies nothing tell me what is the matter for i am sure something extraordinary is the casetell me i say do tell me then she kisses him  husbprithee dont trouble me  wifei will know what is the matter  husbi tell you nothing is the matterwhat should be the matter  wifecome my dear i must not be put off so i am sure if it be any thing ill i must have my share of it and why should i not be worthy to know it whatever it is before it comes upon me  husbpoor woman he kisses her  wifewell but let me know what it is come dont distract yourself alone let me bear a share of your grief as well as i have shared in your joy  husbmy dear let me alone you trouble me now indeed  still he keeps her off  wifethen you will not trust your wife with knowing what touches you so sensibly  husbi tell you it is nothing it is a trifle it is not worth talking of  wifedont put me off with such stuff as that i tell you it is not for nothing that you have been so concerned and that so long too i have seen it plain enough why you have drooped upon it for this fortnight past and above  husbay this twelvemonth and more  wifevery well and yet it is nothing  husbit is nothing that you can help me in  wifewell but how do you know that let me see and judge whether i can or no  husbi tell you you cannot  wifesure it is some terrible thing then why must not i know it what are you going to break come tell me the worst of it  husbbreak no no i hope notbreak no ill never break  wifeas good as you have broke dont presume no man in trade can say he wont break  husbyes yes i can say i wont break  wifei am glad to hear it i hope you have a knack then beyond other tradesmen  husbno i have not neither any man may say so as well as i and no man need break if he will act the part of an honest man  wifehow is that pray  husbwhy give up all faithfully to his creditors as soon as he finds there is a deficiency in his stock and yet that there is enough left to pay them  wifewell i dont understand those things but i desire you would tell me what it is troubles you now and if it be any thing of that kind yet i think you should let me know it  husbwhy should i trouble you with it  wifeit would be very unkind to let me know nothing till it comes and swallows you up and me too all on a sudden i must know it then pray tell it me now  husbwhy then i will tell you indeed i am not going to break and i hope i am in no danger of it at least not yet  wifei thank you my dear for that but still though it is some satisfaction to me to be assured of so much yet i find there is something in it and your way of speaking is ambiguous and doubtful i entreat you be plain and free with me what is at the bottom of itwhy wont you tell mewhat have i done that i am not to be trusted with a thing that so nearly concerns me  husbi have told you my dear pray be easy i am not going to break i tell you  wifewell but let us talk a little more seriously of it you are not going to break that is not just now not yet you said but my dear if it is then not just at hand but may happen or is in view at some distance may not some steps be taken to prevent it for the present and to save us from it at last too  husbwhat steps could you think of if that were the case  wifeindeed it is not much that is in a wifes power but i am ready to do what lies in me and what becomes me and first pray let us live lower do you think i would live as i do if i thought your income would not bear it no indeed  husbyou have touched me in the most sensible part my dear you have found out what has been my grief you need make no further inquiries  wifewas that your griefand would you never be so kind to your wife as to let her know it  husbhow could i mention so unkind a thing to you  wifewould it not have been more unkind to have let things run on to destruction and left your wife to the reproach of the world as having ruined you by her expensive living  husbthats true my dear and it may be i might have spoke to you at last but i could not do it now it looks so cruel and so hard to lower your figure and make you look little in the eyes of the world for you know they judge all by outsides that i could not bear it  wifeit would be a great deal more cruel to let me run on and be really an instrument to ruin my husband when god knows i thought i was within the compass of your gettings and that a great way and you know you always prompted me to go fine to treat handsomely to keep more servants and every thing of that kind could i doubt but that you could afford it very well  husbthats true but i see it is otherwise now and though i cannot help it i could not mention it to you nor for ought i know should i ever have done it  wifewhy you said just now you should have done it  husbay at last perhaps i might when things had been past recovery  wifethat is to say when you were ruined and undone and could not show your head i should know it or when a statute of bankrupt had come out and the creditors had come and turned us out of doors then i should have known itthat would have been a barbarous sort of kindness  husbwhat could i do i could not help it  wifejust so our old acquaintance gwdid his poor wife knew not one word of it nor so much as suspected it but thought him in as flourishing circumstances as ever till on a sudden he was arrested in an action for a great sum so great that he could not find bail and the next day an execution on another action was served in the house and swept away the very bed from under her and the poor lady that brought him £3000 portion was turned into the street with five small children to take care of  husbher case was very sad indeed  wifebut was not he a barbarous wretch to her to let her know nothing of her circumstances she was at the ball but the day before in her velvet suit and with her jewels on and they reproach her with it every day  husbshe did go too fine indeed  wifedo you think she would have done so if she had known any thing of his circumstances  husbit may be not  wifeno no she is a lady of too much sense to allow us to suggest it  husband why did he not let her have some notice of it  wifewhy he makes the same dull excuse you speak of he could not bear to speak to her of it and it looked so unkind to do any thing to straiten her he could not do it it would break his heart and the like and now he has broke her heart  husbi know it is hard to break in upon ones wife in such a manner where there is any true kindness and affection but  wifebut but what were there really a true kindness and affection as is the pretence it would be quite otherwise he would not break his own heart forsooth but chose rather to break his wifes heart he could not be so cruel to tell her of it and therefore left her to be cruelly and villanously insulted as she was by the bailiffs and creditors was that his kindness to her  husbwell my dear i have not brought you to that i hope  wifeno my dear and i hope you will not however you shall not say i will not do every thing i can to prevent it and if it lies on my side you are safe  husbwhat will you do to prevent it come lets see what can you do  wifewhy first i keep five maids you see and a footman i shall immediately give three of my maids warning and the fellow also and save you that part of the expense  husbhow can you do thatyou cant do your business  wifeyes yes theres nobody knows what they can do till they are tried two maids may do all my housebusiness and ill look after my children myself and if i live to see them grown a little bigger ill make them help one another and keep but one maid i hope that will be one step towards helping it  husband what will all your friends and acquaintance and the world say to it  wifenot half so much as they would to see you break and the world believe it be by my high living keeping a house full of servants and do nothing myself  husbthey will say i am going to break upon your doing thus and thats the way to make it so  wifei had rather a hundred should say you were going to break than one could say you were really broke already  husbbut it is dangerous to have it talked of i say  wifeno no they will say we are taking effectual ways to prevent breaking  husbbut it will put a slur upon yourself too i cannot bear any mortifications upon you any more than i can upon myself  wifedont tell me of mortifications it would be a worse mortification a thousand times over to have you ruined and have your creditors insult me with being the occasion of it  husbit is very kind in you my dear and i must always acknowledge it but however i would not have you straiten yourself too much neither  wifenay this will not be so much a mortification as the natural consequence of other things for in order to abate the expense of our living i resolve to keep less company i assure you i will lay down all the state of living as well as the expense of it and first i will keep no visiting days secondly ill drop the greatest part of the acquaintance i have thirdly i will lay down our treats and entertainments and the like needless occasions of expense and then i shall have no occasion for so many maids  husbbut this my dear i say will make as much noise almost as if i were actually broke  wifeno no leave that part to me  husbbut you may tell me how you will manage it then  wifewhy ill go into the country  husbthat will but bring them after you as it used to do  wifebut ill put off our usual lodgings at hampstead and give out that i am gone to spend the summer in bedfordshire at my aunts where every body knows i used to go sometimes they cant come after me thither  husbbut when you return they will all visit you  wifeyes and i will make no return to all those i have a mind to drop and theres an end of all their acquaintance at once  husband what must i do  wifenay my dear it is not for me to direct that part you know how to cure the evil which you sensibly feel the mischief of if i do my part i dont doubt you know how to do yours  husbyes i know but it is hard very hard  wifenay i hope it is no harder for you than it is for your wife  husbthat is true indeed but ill see  wifethe question to me is not whether it is hard but whether it is necessary  husbnay it is necessary that is certain  wifethen i hope it is as necessary to you as to your wife  husbi know not where to begin  wifewhy you keep two horses and a groom you keep rich high company and you sit long at the fleece every evening i need say no more you know where to begin well enough  husbit is very hard i have not your spirit my dear  wifei hope you are not more ashamed to retrench than you would be to have your name in the gazette  husbit is sad work to come down hill thus  wifeit would be worse to fall down at one blow from the top better slide gently and voluntarily down the smooth part than to be pushed down the precipice and be dashed all in pieces  there was more of this dialogue but i give the part which i think most to the present purpose and as i strive to shorten the doctrine so i will abridge the application also the substance of the case lies in a few particulars thus  i the man was melancholy and oppressed with the thoughts of his declining circumstances and yet had not any thought of letting his wife know it whose way of living was high and expensive and more than he could support but though it must have ended in ruin he would rather let it have gone on till she was surprised in it than to tell her the danger that was before her  his wife very well argues the injustice and unkindness of such usage and how hard it was to a wife who being of necessity to suffer in the fall ought certainly to have the most early notice of itthat if possible she might prevent it or at least that she might not be overwhelmed with the suddenness and the terror of it  ii upon discovering it to his wife or rather her drawing the discovery from him by her importunity she immediately and most readily and cheerfully enters into measures to retrench her expenses and as far as she was able to prevent the blow which was otherwise apparent and unavoidable  hence it is apparent that the expensive living of most tradesmen in their families is for want of a serious acquainting their wives with their circumstances and acquainting them also in time for there are very few ladies so unreasonable who if their husbands seriously informed them how things stood with them and that they could not support their way of living would not willingly come into measures to prevent their own destruction  iii that it is in vain as well as unequal for a tradesman to preach frugality to his wife and to bring his wife to a retrenching of her expenses and not at the same time to retrench his own seeing that keeping horses and high company is every way as great and expensive and as necessary to be abated as any of the family extravagances let them be which they will  all this relates to the duty of a tradesman in preventing his family expenses being ruinous to his business but the true method to prevent all this and never to let it come so far is still as i said before not to marry too soon not to marry till by a frugal industrious management of his trade in the beginning he has laid a foundation for maintaining a wife and bringing up a family and has made an essay by which he knows what he can and cannot do and also before he has laid up and increased his stock that he may not cripple his fortune at first and be ruined before he has begun to thrive  footnotes  22 defoes views on the subject of the too early marrying of young tradesmen are in every particular sound though there are instances of premature marriages followed by no evil result but rather the contrary there can be no doubt that the only prudent course is to wait till a settlement in life and a regular income have been secured a young man anxious for other reasons to marry is sometimes heard to express his conviction that he might live more cheaply married than single there could be no assertion more inconsistent with all common experience even if no positively ruinous consequences arise from an overearly marriage it almost always occasions much hardship it saddens a period of life which nature has designed to be peculiarly cheerful the whole life of such a man becomes like a year in which there has been no may or june the grave cares of matrimony do not appear to be naturally suitable to the human character till the man has approached his thirtieth and the woman her twentyfourth year     chapter xii  of the tradesmans leaving his business to servants   it is the ordinary excuse of the gentlemen tradesmen of our times that they have good servants and that therefore they take more liberty to be out of their business than they would otherwise do oh says the shopkeeper i have an apprenticeit is an estate to have such a servant i am as safe in him as if i had my eye upon the business from morning till night let me be where i will i am always satisfied he is at home if i am at the tavern i am sure he is in the countinghouse or behind the counter he is never out of his post  and then for my other servants the younger apprentices says he it is all one as if i were there myselfthey would be idle it may be but he wont let them i assure you they must stick close to it or he will make them do it he tells them boys do not come apprentices to play but to work not to sit idle and be doing nothing but to mind their masters business that they may learn how to do their own  very well and you think sir this young man being so much in the shop and so diligent and faithful is an estate to you and so indeed it is but are your customers as well pleased with this man too as you are or are they as well pleased with him as they would be if you were there yourself  yes they are says the shopkeeper nay abundance of the customers take him for the master of the shop and dont know any other and he is so very obliging and pleases so well giving content to every body that if i am at any other part of the shop and see him serving a customer i never interrupt them unless sometimes he is so modest he will call me and turning to the ladies say theres my master madam if you think he will abate you any thing ill call him and sometimes they will look a little surprised and say is that your master indeed we thought you had been the master of the shop yourself  well said i and you think yourself very happy in all this dont you pray how long has this young gentleman to serve how long is it before his time will be out oh he has almost a year and a half to serve says the shopkeeper i hope then said i you will take care to have him knocked on the head as soon as his time is out god forbid says the honest man what do you mean by that mean said i why if you dont he will certainly knock your trade on the head as soon as the year and a half comes to be up either you must dispose of him as i say or take care that he does not set up near you no not in the same street if you do your customers will all run thither when they miss him in the shop they will presently inquire for him and as you say they generally take him for the master they will ask whether the gentleman is removed that kept the shop before  all my shopkeeper could say was that he had got a salve for that sore and that was that when timothy was out of his time he resolved to take him in partner  a very good thing indeed so you must take timothy into half the trade when he is out of his time for fear he should run away with threequarters of it when he sets up for himself but had not the master much better have been timothy himselfthen he had been sure never to have the customers take timothy for the master and when he went away and set up perhaps at next door leave the shop and run after him  it is certain a good servant a faithful industrious obliging servant is a blessing to a tradesman and as he said is an estate to his master but the master by laying the stress of his business upon him divests himself of all the advantages of such a servant and turns the blessing into a blast for by giving up the shop as it were to him and indulging himself in being abroad and absent from his business the apprentice gets the mastery of the business the fame of the shop depends upon him and when he sets up certainly follows him such a servant would with the masters attendance too be very helpful and yet not be dangerous such a servant is well when he is visibly an assistant to the master but is ruinous when he is taken for the master there is a great deal of difference between a servants being the stay of his master and his being the stay of his trade when he is the first the master is served by him and when he is gone he breeds up another to follow his steps but when he is the last he carries the trade with him and does his master infinitely more hurt than good  a good tradesman has a great deal of trouble with a bad servant but must take heed that he is not wounded by a good onethe extravagant idle vagrant servant hurts himself but the diligent servant endangers his master the greater reputation the servant gets in his business the more care the master has upon him lest he gets within him and worms him out of his business  the only way to prevent this and yet not injure a diligent servant is that the master be as diligent as the servant that the master be as much at the shop as the man he that will keep in his business need never fear keeping his business let his servant be as diligent as he will it is a hard thing that a tradesman should have the blessing of a good servant and make it a curse to him by his appearing less capable than his man  let your apprentice be in the business but let the master be at the head of the business at all times there is a great deal of difference between being diligent in the business in the shop and leading the whole business of the shop an apprentice who is diligent may be master of his business but should never be master of the shop the one is to be useful to his master the other is to be master of his master and indeed this shows the absolute necessity of diligence and application in a tradesman and how for want of it that very thing which is the blessing of another tradesmans business is the ruin of his  servants especially apprentices ought to be considered as they really are in their moveable station that they are here with you but seven years and that then they act or move in a sphere or station of their own their diligence is now for you but ever after it is for themselves that the better servants they have been while they were with you the more dangerous they will be to you when you part that therefore though you are bound in justice to them to let them into your business in every branch of it yet you are not bound to give your business away to them the diligence therefore of a good servant in the masters business should be a spur to the masters diligence to take care of himself  there is a great deal of difference also between trusting a servant in your business and trusting him with your business the first is leaving your business with him the other is leaving your business to him he that trusts a servant in his business leaves his shop only to him but he that leaves his business to his servant leaves his wife and children at his disposalin a word such a trusting or leaving the business to the servant is no less than a giving up all to him abandoning the care of his shop and all his affairs to him and when such a servant is out of his time the master runs a terrible risk such as indeed it is not fit any tradesman should runnamely of losing the best of his business  what i have been now saying is of the tradesman leaving his business to his apprentices and servants when they prove good when they are honest and diligent faithful and industrious and if there are dangers even in trusting good servants and such as do their duty perfectly well what then must it be when the business is left to idle negligent and extravagant servants who both neglect their masters business and their own who neither learn their trade for themselves nor regard it for the interest of their masters if the first are a blessing to their masters and may only be made dangerous by their carrying away the trade with them when they go these are made curses to their masters early for they lose the trade for themselves and their masters too the first carry the customers away with them the last drive the customers away before they go what signifies going to such a shop say the ladies either speaking of a mercer or a draper or any other trade there is nothing to be met with there but a crew of saucy boys that are always at play when you come in and can hardly refrain it when you are there one hardly ever sees a master in the shop and the young rude boys hardly mind you when you are looking on their goods they talk to you as if they cared not whether you laid out your money or no and as if they had rather you were gone that they might go to play again i will go there no more not i  if this be not the case then you are in danger of worse still and that is that they are often thievesidle ones are seldom honest onesnay they cannot indeed be honest in a strict sense if they are idle but by dishonest i mean downright thieves and what is more dangerous than for an apprentice to whom the whole business the cash the books and all is committed to be a thief  for a tradesman therefore to commit his business thus into the hand of a false a negligent and a thievish servant is like a man that travels a journey and takes a highwayman into the coach with him such a man is sure to be robbed and to be fully and effectually plundered because he discovers where he hides his treasure thus the tradesman places his confidence in the thief and how should he avoid being robbed  it is answered that generally tradesmen who have any considerable trust to put into the hands of an apprentice take security of them for their honesty by their friends when their indentures are signed and it is their fault then if they are not secure true it is often so but in a retail business if the servant be unfaithful there are so many ways to defraud a master besides that of merely not balancing the cash that it is impossible to detect them till the tradesman declining insensibly by the weight of the loss is ruined and undone  what need then has the tradesman to give a close attendance and preserve himself from plunder by acquainting himself in and with his business and servants by which he makes it very difficult for them to deceive him and much easier to him to discover it if he suspects them but if the tradesman lives abroad keeps at his countryhouse or lodgings and leaves his business thus in the hands of his servants committing his affairs to them as is often the case if they prove thieves negligent careless and idle what is the consequencehe is insensibly wronged his substance wasted his business neglected and how shall a tradesman thrive under such circumstances nay how is it possible he should avoid ruin and destructioni mean as to his business for in short every such servant has his hand in his masters pocket and may use him as he pleases  again if they are not thieves yet if they are idle and negligent it is in some cases the same thing and i wish it were well recommended to all such servants as call themselves honest that it is as criminal to neglect their masters business as to rob him and he is as really a thief who robs him of his time as he that robs him of his money  i know as servants are now this is a principle they will not allow neither does one servant in fifty act by it but if the master be absent the servant is at his heelsthat is to say is as soon out of doors as his master and having none but his conscience to answer to he makes shift to compound with himself like a bankrupt with his creditor to pay half the debtthat is to say half the time to his master and half to himself and think it good pay too  the point of conscience indeed seems to be out of the question now between master and servant and as few masters concern themselves with the souls nay scarce with the morals of their servants either to instruct them or inform them of their duty either to god or man much less to restrain them by force or correct them as was anciently practised so few servants concern themselves in a conscientious discharge of their duty to their mastersso that the great law of subordination is destroyed and the relative duties on both sides are neglected all which as i take it is owing to the exorbitant sums of money which are now given with servants to the masters as the present or condition of their apprenticeship which as it is extravagant in itself so it gives the servant a kind of a different figure in the family places him above the ordinary class of servants hired for wages and exempts him from all the laws of family government so that a master seems now to have nothing to do with his apprentice any other than in what relates to his business  and as the servant knows this so he fails not to take the advantage of it and to pay no more service than he thinks is due and the hours of his shop business being run out he claims all the rest for himself without the above restraint nor will the servants in these times bear any examinations with respect to the disposing of their waste time or with respect to the company they keep or the houses or places they go to  the use i make of it is this and herein it is justly applicable to the case in hand by how much the apprentices and servants in this age are loose wild and ungovernable by so much the more should a master think himself obliged not to depend upon them much less to leave his business to them and dispense with his own attendance in it if he does he must have much better luck then his neighbours if he does not find himself very much wronged and abused seeing as i said above the servants and apprentices of this age do very rarely act from a principle of conscience in serving their masters interest which however i do not see they can be good christians without  i knew one very considerable tradesman in this city and who had always five or six servants in his business apprentices and journeymen who lodged in his house and having a little more the spirit of government in him than most masters i now meet with he took this method with them when he took apprentices he told them beforehand the orders of his family and which he should oblige them to particularly that they should none be absent from his business without leave nor out of the house after nine oclock at night and that he would not have it thought hard if he exacted three things of them  1 that if they had been out he should ask them where they had been and in what company and that they should give him a true and direct answer  2 that if he found reason to forbid them keeping company with any particular person or in any particular house or family they should be obliged to refrain from such company  3 that in breach of any of those two after being positively charged with it he would on their promising to amend it forgive them only acquainting their friends of it but the second time he would dismiss them his service and not be obliged to return any of the money he had with them and to these he made their parents consent when they were bound and yet he had large sums of money with them too not less than £200 each and sometimes more  as to his journeymen he conditioned with them as follows  1 they should never dine from home without leave asked and obtained and telling where if required  2 after the shutting in of the shop they were at liberty to go where they pleased only not to be out of the house after nine oclock at night  3 never to be in drink or to swear on pain of being immediately dismissed without the courtesy usual with such servants namely of a months warning  these were excellent household laws but the question is how shall a master see them punctually obeyed for the life of all laws depends upon their being well executed and we are famous in england for being remiss in that very point and that we have the best laws the worst executed of any nation in the world  but my friend was a man who knew as well how to make his laws be well executed as he did how to make the laws themselves his case was thus he kept a countryhouse about two miles from london in the summertime for the air of his wife and children and there he maintained them very comfortably but it was a rule with him that he who expects his servants to obey his orders must be always upon the spot with them to see it done to this purpose he confined himself to lie always at home though his family was in the country and every afternoon he walked out to see them and to give himself the air too but always so ordered his diversions that he was sure to be at home before nine at night that he might call over his family and see that they observed orders that is that they were all at home at their time and all sober  as this was indeed the only way to have good servants and an orderly family so he had both but it was owing much if not all to the exactness of his government and would all masters take the same method i doubt not they would have the like success but what servants can a man expect when he leaves them to their own government not regarding whether they serve god or the devil  now though this man had a very regular family and very good servants yet he had this particular qualification too for a good tradesman namely that he never left his business entirely to them nor could any of them boast that they were trusted to more than another  this is certainly the way to have regular servants and to have business thrive but this is not practised by one master to a thousand at this timeif it were we should soon see a change in the families of tradesmen and that very much for the better nor indeed would this family government be good for the tradesman only but it would be the servants advantage too and such a practice we may say would in time reform all the next age and make them ashamed of us that went before them  if then the morals of servants are thus loose and debauched and that it is a general and epidemic evil how much less ought tradesmen of this age to trust them and still less to venture their all upon them leave their great design the event of all their business with them and go into the country in pursuit of their pleasure  the case of tradesmen differs extremely in this age from those in the last with respect to their apprentices and servants and the difference is all to the disadvantage of the present age namely in the last age that is to say fifty or sixty years ago for it is not less servants were infinitely more under subjection than they are now and the subordination of mankind extended effectually to them they were content to submit to family government and the just regulations which masters made in their houses were not scorned and contemned as they are now family religion also had some sway upon them and if their masters did keep good orders and preserve the worship of god in their houses the apprentices thought themselves obliged to attend at the usual hours for such services nay it has been known where such orders have been observed that if the master of the family has been sick or indisposed or out of town the eldest apprentice has read prayers to the family in his place  how ridiculous to speak in the language of the present times would it be for any master to expect this of a servant in our days and where is the servant that would comply with it nay it is but very rarely now that masters themselves do it it is rather thought now to be a low step and beneath the character of a man in business as if worshipping god were a disgrace and not an honour to a family or to the master of a family and i doubt not but in a little while more either the worship of god will be quite banished out of families or the better sort of tradesmen and such as have any regard to it will keep chaplains as other persons of quality do it is confessed the first is most probable though the last as i am informed is already begun in the city in some houses where the reader of the parish is allowed a small additional salary to come once aday namely every evening to read prayers in the house  but i am not talking on this subject i am not directing myself to citizens or townsmen as masters of families but as heads of trade and masters in their business the other part would indeed require a whole book by itself and would insensibly run me into a long satirical discourse upon the loss of all family government among us in which indeed the practice of housekeepers and heads of families is grown not remiss only in all serious things but even scandalous in their own morals and in the personal examples they show to their servants and all about them  but to come back to my subject namely that the case of tradesmen differs extremely from what it was formerly the second head of difference is this that whereas in former times the servants were better and humbler than they are now submitted more to family government and to the regulations made by their masters and masters were more moral set better examples and kept better order in their houses and by consequence of it all servants were soberer and fitter to be trusted than they are now yet on the other hand notwithstanding all their sobriety masters did not then so much depend upon them leave business to them and commit the management of their affairs so entirely to their servants as they do now  all that i meet with which masters have to say to this is contained in two heads and these in my opinion amount to very little  i that they have security for their servants honesty which in former times they had not  ii that they receive greater premiums or presentmoney now with their apprentices than they did formerly  the first of these is of no moment for first it does not appear that apprentices in those former days gave no security to their masters for their integrity which though perhaps not so generally as now yet i have good reason to know was then practised among tradesmen of note and is not now among inferior tradesmen but secondly this security extends to nothing but to make the master satisfaction for any misapplications or embezzlements which are discovered and can be proved but extend to no secret concealed mischiefs neither thirdly do those securities reach to the negligence idleness or debaucheries of servants but which is still more than all the rest they do not reach to the worst of robbery between the servant and his master i mean the loss of his time so that still there is as much reason for the masters inspection both into his servants and their business as ever  but least of all does this security reach to make the master any satisfaction for the loss of his business the ill management of his shop the disreputation brought upon it by being committed to servants and those servants behaving ill slighting neglecting or disobliging customers this does not relate to securities given or taken nor can the master make himself any amends upon his servant or upon his securities for this irrecoverable damage he therefore that will keep up the reputation of his shop or of his business and preserve his trade to his own advantage must resolve to attend it himself and not leave it to servants whether good or bad if he leaves it to good servants they improve it for themselves and carry the trade away with them when they go if to bad servants they drive his customers away bring a scandal upon his shop and destroy both their master and themselves  secondly as to the receiving great premiums with their apprentices which indeed is grown up to a strange height in this age beyond whatever it was before it is an unaccountable excess which is the ruin of more servants at this time than all the other excesses they are subject to nay in some respect it is the cause of it all and on the contrary is far from being an equivalent to their masters for the defect of their service but is an unanswerable reason why the master should not leave his business to their management  this premium was originally not a condition of indenture but was a kind of usual or customary present to the tradesmans wife to engage her to be kind to the youth and take a motherly care of him being supposed to be young when first put out  by length of time this compliment or present became so customary as to be made a debt and to be conditioned for as a demand but still was kept within bounds and thirty or forty pounds was sufficient to a very good merchant which now is run up to five hundred nay to a thousand pounds with an apprentice a thing which formerly would have been thought monstrous and not to be named  the ill consequences of giving these large premiums are such and so many that it is not to be entered upon in such a small tract as this nor is it the design of this work but it is thus far to the purpose herenamely as it shows that this sets up servants into a class of gentlemen above their masters and above their business and they neither have a sufficient regard to one or other and consequently are the less fit to be trusted by the master in the essential parts of his business and this brings it down to the case in hand  upon the whole the present state of things between masters and servants is such that now more than ever the caution is needful and just that he that leaves his business to the management of his servants it is ten to one but he ruins his business and his servants too  ruining his business is indeed my present subject but ruining his servants also is a consideration that an honest conscientious master ought to think is of weight with him and will concern himself about servants out of government are like soldiers without an officer fit for nothing but to rob and plunder without order and without orders they neither know what to do or are directed how to do it  besides it is letting loose his apprentices to levity and liberty in that particular critical time of life when they have the most need of government and restraint when should laws and limits be useful to mankind but in their youth when unlimited liberty is most fatal to them and when they are least capable of governing themselves to have youth left without government is leaving fire in a magazine of powder which will certainly blow it all up at last and ruin all the houses that are near it  if there is any duty on the side of a master to his servant any obligation on him as a christian and as a trustee for his parents it lies hereto limit and restrain them if possible in the liberty of doing evil and this is certainly a debt due to the trust reposed in masters by the parents of the youth committed to them if he is let loose here he is undone of course and it may be said indeed he was ruined by his master and if the master is afterwards ruined by such a servant what can be said for it but this he could expect no other  to leave a youth without government is indeed unworthy of any honest master he cannot discharge himself as a master for instead of taking care of him he indeed casts him off abandons him and to put it into scripture words he leads him into temptation nay he goes farther to use another scripture expression he delivers him over to satan  it is confessedand it is fatal both to masters and servants at this timethat not only servants are made haughty and above the government of their masters and think it below them to submit to any family government or any restraints of their masters as to their morals and religion but masters also seem to have given up all family government and all care or concern for the morals and manners as well as for the religion of their servants thinking themselves under no obligation to meddle with those things or to think any thing about them so that their business be but done and their shop or warehouse duly looked after  but to bring it all home to the point in hand if it is so with the master and servant there is the less room still for the master of such servants to leave any considerable trust in the hands of such apprentices or to expect much from them to leave the weight of their affairs with them and living at their country lodgings and taking their own diversions depend upon such servants for the success of their business this is indeed abandoning their business throwing it away and committing themselves families and fortunes to the conduct of those who they have all the reason in the world to believe have no concern upon them for their good or care one farthing what becomes of them     chapter xiii  of tradesmen making composition with debtors or with creditors   there is an alternative in the subject of this chapter which places the discourse in the two extremes of a tradesmans fortunes  i the fortunate tradesman called upon by his poor unfortunate neighbour who is his debtor and is become insolvent to have compassion on him and to compound with him for part of his debt and accept his offer in discharge of the whole  ii the unfortunate tradesman become insolvent and bankrupt himself and applying himself to his creditor to accept of a composition in discharge of his debt  i must confess a tradesman let his circumstances be what they will has the most reason to consider the disasters of the unfortunate and be compassionate to them under their pressures and disasters of any other men because they know notno not the most prosperous of themwhat may be their own fate in the world there is a scripture proverb if i may call it so very necessary to a tradesman in this case let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall  nb it is not said let him that standeth take heed but him that thinketh he standeth men in trade can but think they stand and there are so many incidents in a tradesmans circumstances that sometimes when he thinks himself most secure of standing he is in most danger of falling  if then the contingent nature of trade renders every man liable to disaster that is engaged in it it seems strange that tradesmen should be outrageous and unmerciful to one another when they fall and yet so it is that no creditor is so furious upon an unhappy insolvent tradesman as a brothertradesman of his own class and who is at least liable to the same disaster in the common event of his business  nay i have lived to seesuch is the uncertainty of human affairs and especially in tradethe furious and outrageous creditor become bankrupt himself in a few years or perhaps months after and begging the same mercy of others which he but just before denied to his not more unfortunate fellowtradesman and making the same exclamations at the cruelty and hardheartedness of his creditors in refusing to comply with him when at the same time his own heart must reproach him with his former conduct how inexorable he was to all the entreaties and tears of his miserable neighbour and his distressed family who begged his compassion with the lowest submission who employed friends to solicit and entreat for them laying forth their misery in the most lively expressions and using all the arguments which the most moving distress could dictate but in vain  the tradesman is certainly wrong in this as compassion to the miserable is a debt of charity due from all mankind to their fellowcreatures and though the purseproud tradesman may be able to say he is above the fear of being in the like circumstances as some may be yet even then he might reflect that perhaps there was a time when he was not so and he ought to pay that debt of charity in acknowledgement of the mercy that has set him above the danger  and yet speaking in the ordinary language of men who are subject to vicissitudes of fortune where is the man that is sure he shall meet with no shock and how have we seen men who have today been immensely rich be tomorrow as it were reduced to nothing what examples were made in this city of such precipitations within the memory of some living when the exchequer shutting up ruined the great bankers of lombard street23 to what fell sir robert vinerthe great alderman backwellthe three brothers of the name of forth of whom king charles ii made that severe pun that threefourths of the city were broke  to what have we seen men of prodigious bulk in trade reducedas sir thomas cook sir basil firebrass sheppard coggs and innumerable bankers moneyscriveners and merchants who thought themselves as secure against the shocks of trade as any men in the world could be not to instance our late south sea directors and others reduced by the terrible fate of bubbles whose names i omit because they yet live though sinking still under the oppression of their fortunes and whose weight i would be far from endeavouring to make heavier  why then should any tradesman presuming on his own security and of his being out of the reach of disaster harden his heart against the miseries and distresses of a fellowtradesman who sinks as it were by his side and refuse to accept his offer of composition at least if he cannot object against the integrity of his representations and cannot charge him with fraud and deceit breaking with a wicked design to cheat and delude his creditors and to get money by a pretended breach i say why should any tradesman harden his heart in such a case and not with a generous pity comply with a reasonable and fair proposal while it is to be had  i do acknowledge if there is an evident fraud if he can detect the bankrupt in any wicked design if he can prove he has effects sufficient to pay his debts and that he only breaks with a purpose to cheat his creditors and he conceals a part of his estate when he seems to offer a sincere surrender if this be the case and it can be made appear to be sofor in such a case too we ought to be very sure of the factthen indeed no favour is due and really none ought to be shown  and therefore it was a very righteous clause which was inflicted on the fraudulent bankrupt in a late act of parliament namely that in case he concealed his effects and that it appeared he had though upon his oath not given in a full account of his estate but willingly and knowingly concealed it or any part of it with design to defraud his creditors he should be put to death as a felon the reason and justice of which clause was this and it was given as the reason of it when the act was passed in the house of commons namely that the act was made for the relief of the debtor as well as of the creditor and to procure for him a deliverance on a surrender of his effects but then it was made also for the relief of the creditor too that he might have as much of his debt secured to him as possible and that he should not discharge the debtor with his estate in his pocket suffering him to run away with his the creditors money before his face  also it was objected that the act without a penalty would be only an act to encourage perjury and would deliver the hardmouthed knave that could swear what he pleased and ruin and reject the modest conscientious tradesman that was willing and ready to give up the utmost farthing to his creditors on this account the clause was accepted and the act passed which otherwise had been thrown out  now when the poor insolvent has thus surrendered his all stript himself entirely upon oath and that oath taken on the penalty of death if it be false there seems to be a kind of justice due to the bankrupt he has satisfied the law and ought to have his liberty given him as a prey as the text calls it jer xxxix 18 that he may try the world once again and see if possible to recover his disasters and get his bread and it is to be spoken in honour of the justice as well as humanity of that law for delivering bankrupts that there are more tradesmen recover themselves in this age upon their second endeavours and by setting up again after they have thus failed and been delivered than ever were known to do so in ten times the number of years before  to break or turn bankrupt before this was like a man being taken by the turks he seldom recovered liberty to try his fortune again but frequently languished under the tyranny of the commissioners of bankrupt or in the mint or friars or rules of the fleet till he wasted the whole estate and at length his life and so his debts were all paid at once  nor was the case of the creditor much betteri mean as far as respected his debt for it was very seldom that any considerable dividend was made on the other hand large contributions were called for before people knew whether it was likely any thing would be made of the debtors effects or no and oftentimes the creditor lost his whole debt contributionmoney and all so that while the debtor was kept on the rack as above being held in suspense by the creditors or by the commissioners or both he spent the creditors effects and subsisted at their expense till the estate being wasted the loss fell heavy on every side and generally most on those who were least able to bear it  by the present state of things this evil is indeed altered and the ruin of the creditors effects is better prevented the bankrupt can no more skulk behind the door of the mint and rules and prevent the commissioners inspection he must come forth be examined give in an account and surrender himself and effects too or fly his country and be seen here no more and if he does come in he must give a full account upon oath on the penalty of his neck  when the effects are thus surrendered the commissioners proceedings are short and summary the assignees are obliged to make dividends and not detain the estate in their own hands as was the case in former days till sometimes they became bankrupts themselves so that the creditors are sure now what is put into the hands of the assignees shall in due time and without the usual delay be fairly divided on the other hand the poor debtor having honestly discharged his part and no objection lying against the sincerity of the discovery has a certificate granted him which being allowed by the lord chancellor he is a clear man and may begin the world again as i have said above  the creditor being thus satisfied that the debtor has been faithful does not answer the end of the act of parliament if he declines to assent to the debtors certificate nor can any creditor decline it but on principles which no man cares to ownnamely that of malice and the highest resentment which are things a christian tradesman will not easily act upon  but i come now to the other part of the case and this is supposing a debtor fails and the creditors do not think fit to take out a commission of bankrupt against him as sometimes is the case at least where they see the offers of the debtor are any thing reasonable my advice in such case is and i speak it from long experience in such things that they should always accept the first reasonable proposal of the debtor and i am not in this talking on the foot of charity and mercy to the debtor but of the real and undoubted interest of the creditor nor could i urge it by such arguments as i shall bring upon any other foundation for if i speak in behalf of the debtor i must argue commiseration to the miserable compassion and pity of his family and a reflection upon the sad changes which human life exposes us all to and so persuade the creditor to have pity upon not him only but upon all families in distress  but i say i argue now upon a different foundation and insist that it is the creditors true interest as i hinted before that if he finds the debtor inclined to be honest and he sees reason to believe he makes the best offer he can he should accept the first offer as being generally the best the debtor can make24 and indeed if the debtor be wise as well as honest he will make it so and generally it is found to be so and there are indeed many reasons why the first offers of the debtor are generally the best and why no commission of bankrupt ordinarily raises so much notwithstanding all its severities as the bankrupt offers before it is sued outnot reckoning the time and expense which notwithstanding all the new methods attend such things and are inevitable for example  when the debtor first looking into his affairs sees the necessity coming upon him of making a stop in trade and calling his creditors together the first thought which by the consequence of the thing comes to be considered is what offers he can make to them to avoid the having a commission sued out against him and to which end common prudence as well as honest principles move him to make the best offers he can if he be a man of sense and according to what i mentioned in another chapter has prudently come to a stop in time before things are run to extremities and while he has something left to make an offer of that may be considerable he will seldom meet with creditors so weak or so blind to their own interest not to be willing to end it amicably rather than to proceed to a commission and as this is certainly best both for the debtor and the creditor so as i argued with the debtor that he should be wise enough as well as honest enough to break betimes and that it was infinitely best for his own interest so i must add on the other hand to the creditor that it is always his interest to accept the first offer and i never knew a commission make more of an estate where the debtor has been honest than he the debtor proposed to give them without it  it is true there are cases where the issuing out a commission may be absolutely necessary for example  1 where the debtor is evidently knavish and discovers himself to be so by endeavours to carry off his effects or alter the property of the estate confessing judgments or any the usual ways of fraud which in such cases are ordinarily practised or  2 where some creditors by such judgments or by attachments of debts goods delivered effects made over or any other way have gotten some of the estate into their hands or securities belonging to it whereby they are in a better state as to payment than the rest or  3 where some people are brought in as creditors whose debts there is reason to believe are not real but who place themselves in the room of creditors in order to receive a dividend for the use of the bankrupt or some of his family  in these and such like cases a commission is inevitable and must be taken out nor does the man merit to be regarded upon the foot of what i call compassion and commiseration at all but ought to be treated like a rapparee25 or plunderer who breaks with a design to make himself whole by the composition and as many did formerly who were beggars when they broke be made rich by the breach it was to provide against such harpies as these that the act of parliament was made and the only remedy against them is a commission in which the best thing they can do for their creditors is to come in and be examined give in a false account upon oath be discovered convicted of it and sent to the gallows as they deserve  but i am speaking of honest men the reverse of such thieves as these who being brought into distress by the ordinary calamities of trade are willing to do the utmost to satisfy their creditors when such as these break in the tradesmans debt let him consider seriously my advice and he shall findi might say he shall always find but i do affirm he shall generally findthe first offer the best and that he will never lose by accepting it to refuse it is but pushing the debtor to extremities and running out some of the effects to secure the rest  first as to collecting in the debts supposing the man is honest and they can trust him it is evident no man can make so much of them as the bankrupt 1 he knows the circumstances of the debtors and how best to manage them he knows who he may best push at and who best forbear 2 he can do it with the least charge the commissioners or assignees must employ other people such as attorneys solicitors c and they are paid dear the bankrupt sits at home and by letters into the country or by visiting them if in town can make up every account answer every objection judge of every scruple and in a word with ease compared to what others must do brings them to comply  next as to selling off a stock of goods the bankrupt keeps open the shop disperses or disposes of the goods with advantage whereas the commission brings all to a sale or an outcry or an appraisement and all sinks the value of the stock so that the bankrupt can certainly make more of the stock than any other person always provided he is honest as i said before and much more than the creditors can do  for these reasons and many others the bankrupt is able to make a better offer upon his estate than the creditors can expect to raise any other way and therefore it is their interest always to take the first offer if they are satisfied there is no fraud in it and that the man has offered any thing near the extent of what he has left in the world to offer from  if then it be the tradesmans interest to accept of the offer made there needs no stronger argument to be used with him for the doing it and nothing is more surprising to me than to see tradesmen the hardest to come into such compositions and to push on severities against other tradesmen as if they were out of the reach of the shocks of fortune themselves or that it was impossible for them ever to stand in need of the same mercythe contrary to which i have often seen  to what purpose should tradesmen push things to extremities against tradesmen if nothing is to be gotten by it and if the insolvent tradesman will take proper measures to convince the creditor that his intentions are honest the law was made for offenders there needs no law for innocent men commissions are granted to manage knaves and hamper and entangle cunning and designing rogues who seek to raise fortunes out of their creditors estates and exalt themselves by their own downfall they are not designed against honest men neither indeed is there any need of them for such  let no man mistake this part therefore and think that i am moving tradesmen to be easy and compassionate to rogues and cheats i am far from it and have given sufficient testimony of the contrary having i assure you been the only person who actually formed drew up and first proposed that very cause to the house of commons which made it felony to the bankrupt to give in a false account it cannot therefore be suggested without manifest injustice that i would with one breath prompt creditors to be easy to rogues and to cheating fraudulent bankrupts and with another make a proposal to have them hanged  but i move the creditor on account of his own interest always to take the first offer if he sees no palpable fraud in it or sees no reason to suspect such fraud and my reason is good namely because i believe as i said before it is generally the best  i know there is a new method of putting an end to a tradesmans troubles by that which was formerly thought the greatest of all troubles i mean a fraudulent method or what they call taking out friendly statutes that is when tradesmen get statutes taken out against themselves moved first by some person in kindness to them and done at the request of the bankrupt himself this is generally done when the circumstances of the debtor are very low and he has little or nothing to surrender and the end is that the creditors may be obliged to take what there is and the man may get a full discharge  this is indeed a vile corruption of a good law and turning the edge of the act against the creditor not against the debtor and as he has nothing to surrender they get little or nothing and the man is as effectually discharged as if he had paid twenty shillings in the pound and so he is in a condition to set up again take fresh credit break again and have another commission against him and so round as often as he thinks fit this indeed is a fraud upon the act and shows that all human wisdom is imperfect that the law wants some repairs and that it will in time come into consideration again to be made capable of disappointing the people that intend to make such use of it  i think there is also wanting a law against twice breaking and that all second commissions should have some penalty upon the bankrupt and a third a farther penalty and if the fourth brought the man to the gallows it could not be thought hard for he that has set up and broke and set up again and broke again and the like a third time i think merits to be hanged if he pretends to venture any more  most of those crimes against which any laws are published in particular and which are not capital have generally an addition of punishment upon a repetition of the crime and so ona further punishment to a further repetition i do not see why it should not be so here and i doubt not but it would have a good effect upon tradesmen to make them cautious and to warn them to avoid such scandalous doings as we see daily practised breaking three or four or five times over and we see instances of some such while i am writing this very chapter  to such therefore i am so far from moving for any favour either from the law or from their creditors that i think the only deficiency of the law at this time is that it does not reach to inflict a corporal punishment in such a case but leaves such insolvents to fare well in common with those whose disasters are greater and who being honest and conscientious merit more favour but do not often find it  footnotes  23 this event took place in 1671 charles ii finding it necessary to suspend the national payments for a year  24 the truth of this continues to be matter of daily observation in our own times  25 a name applied in the seventeenth century to a certain class of robbers in ireland     chapter xiv  of the unfortunate tradesman compounding with his creditors   this is what in the last chapter i called an alternative to that of the fortunate tradesman yielding to accept the composition of his insolvent debtor  the poor unhappy tradesman having long laboured in the fire and finding it is in vain to struggle but that whether he strives or not strives he must break that he does but go backward more and more and that the longer he holds out he shall have the less to offer and be the harder thought of as well as the harder dealt withresolves to call his creditors together in time while there is something considerable to offer them and while he may have some just account to give of himself and of his conduct and that he may not be reproached with having lived on the spoil and consumed their estates and thus being satisfied that the longer he puts the evil day from him the heavier it will fall when it comes i say he resolves to go no farther and so gets a friend to discourse with and prepare them and then draws up a state of his case to lay before them  first he assures them that he has not wasted his estate either by vice and immorality or by expensive and riotous living luxury extravagance and the like  secondly he makes it appear that he has met with great losses such as he could not avoid and yet such and so many that he has not been able to support the weight of them  thirdly that he could have stood it out longer but that he was sensible if he did he should but diminish the stock which considering his debts was properly not his own and that he was resolved not to spend one part of their debts as he had lost the other  fourthly that he is willing to show them his books and give up every farthing into their hands that they might see he acted the part of an honest man to them and  fifthly that upon his doing so they will find that there is in goods and good debts sufficient to pay them fifteen shillings in the pound after which and when he has made appear that they have a faithful and just account of every thing laid before them he hopes they will give him his liberty that he may try to get his bread and to maintain his family in the best manner he can and if possible to pay the remainder of the debt  you see i go all the way upon the suggestion of the poor unfortunate tradesman being critically honest and showing himself so to the full satisfaction of his creditors that he shows them distinctly a true state of his case and offers his books and vouchers to confirm every part of his account  upon the suggestion of his being thus sincerely honest and allowing that the state of his account comes out so well as to pay fifteen shillings in the pound what and who but a parcel of outrageous hotheaded men would reject such a man what would they be called nay what would they say of themselves if they should reject such a composition and should go and take out a commission of bankrupt against such a man i never knew but one of the like circumstances that was refused by his creditors and that one held them out till they were all glad to accept of half what they said should be first paid them so may all those be served who reject such wholesome advice and the season for accepting a good offer when it was made them but i return to the debtor  when he looks into his books he finds himself declined his own fortune lost and his creditors stock in his hands wasted in part and still wasting his

stating which account he sees to his affliction that he has sunk all his own fortune and his wifes and is a thousand pounds worse than nothing in the world and that being obliged to live in the same house for the sake of his business and warehouse though the rent is too great for him his trade being declined his credit sunk and his family being large he sees evidently he cannot go on and that it will only be bringing things from bad to worse and above all the rest being greatly perplexed in his mind that he is spending other peoples estates and that the bread he eats is not his own he resolves to call his creditors all together lay before them the true state of his case and lie at their mercy for the rest  the account of his present and past fortune standing as it did and as appears above the result is as follows namely that he has not sufficient to pay all his creditors though his debts should prove to be all good and the goods in his warehouse should be fully worth the price they cost which being liable to daily contingencies add to the reasons which pressed him before to make an offer of surrender to his creditors both of his goods and debts and to give up all into their hands  the state of his case as to his debts and credits stands as follows       his debts esteemed good as by the ledger are         £1357   8   0      his goods in the warehouse                               672  12   0                                                                                                                         £2030   0   0       his creditors demands as by the same ledger      appears are                                           £3036   0   0  this amounts to fifteen shillings in the pound upon all his debts which if the creditors please to appoint an assignee or trustee to sell the goods and collect the debts he is willing to surrender wholly into their hands hoping they will as a favour give him his household goods as in the account for his family use and his liberty that he may seek out for some employment to get his bread  the account being thus clear the books exactly agreeing and the man appearing to have acted openly and fairly the creditors meet and after a few consultations agree to accept his proposals and the man is a free man immediately gets fresh credit opens his shop again and doubling his vigilance and application in business he recovers in a few years grows rich then like an honest man still he calls all his creditors together again tells them he does not call them now to a second composition but to tell them that having with gods blessing and his own industry gotten enough to enable him he was resolved to pay them the remainder of his old debt and accordingly does so to the great joy of his creditors to his own very great honour and to the encouragement of all honest men to take the same measures it is true this does not often happen but there have been instances of it and i could name several within my own knowledge  but here comes an objection in the way as follows it is true this man did very honestly and his creditors had a great deal of reason to be satisfied with his just dealing with them but is every man bound thus to strip himself naked perhaps this man at the same time had a family to maintain and had he no debt of justice to them but to beg his household goods back of them for his poor family and that as an almsand would he not have fared as well if he had offered his creditors ten shillings in the pound and took all the rest upon himself and then he had reserved to himself sufficient to have supported himself in any new undertaking  the answer to this is short and plain and no debtor can be at a loss to know his way in it for otherwise people may make difficulties where there are none the observing the strict rules of justice and honesty will chalk out his way for him  the man being deficient in stock and his estate run out to a thousand pounds worse than nothing by his losses c it is evident all he has left is the proper estate of his creditors and he has no right to one shilling of it he owes it them it is a just debt to them and he ought to discharge it fairly by giving up all into their hands or at least to offer to do so  but to put the case upon a new foot as he is obliged to make an offer as above to put all his effects books and goods into their power so he may add an alternative to them thus namelythat if on the other hand they do not think proper to take the trouble or run the risk of collecting the debts and selling the goods which may be difficult if they will leave it to him to do it he will undertake to pay themshillings in the pound and stand to the hazard both of debts and goods  having thus offered the creditors their choice if they accept the proposal of a certain sum as sometimes i know they have chosen to do rather than to have the trouble of making assignees and run the hazard of the debts when put into lawyers hands to collect and of the goods to sell them by appraisement if i say they choose this and offer to discharge the debtor upon payment suppose it be of ten or twelve shillings in the pound in money within a certain time or on giving security for the payment then indeed the debtor is discharged in conscience and may lawfully and honestly take the remainder as a gift given him by his creditors for undertaking their business or securing the remainder of their debt to themi say the debtor may do this with the utmost satisfaction to his conscience  but without thus putting it into the creditors choice it is a force upon them to offer them any thing less than the utmost farthing that he is able to pay and particularly to pretend to make an offer as if it were his utmost and as is usual make protestations that it is the most he is able to pay indeed every offer of a composition is a kind of protestation that the debtor is not able to pay any morei say to offer thus and declare he offers as much as possible and as much as the effects he has left will produce if his effects are able to produce more he is then a cheat for he acts then like one that stands at bay with his creditors make an offer and if the creditors do not think fit to accept of it they must take what methods they think they can take to get more that is to say he bids open defiance to their statutes and commissions of bankrupt and any other proceedings like a town besieged which offers to capitulate and to yield upon such and such articles which implies that if those articles are not accepted the garrison will defend themselves to the last extremity and do all the mischief to the assailants that they can  now this in a garrisontown i say may be lawful and fair but in a debtor to his creditor it is quite another thing for as i have said above the debtor has no property in the effects which he has in his hands they are the goods and the estate of the creditor and to hold out against the creditor keep his estate by violence and make him accept of a small part of it when the debtor has a larger part in his power and is able to give itthis is not fair much less is it honest and conscientious but it is still worse to do this and at the same time to declare that it is the utmost the debtor can do this i say is still more dishonest because it is not true and is adding falsehood to the other injustice  thus i think i have stated the case clearly for the conduct of the debtor and indeed this way of laying all before the creditors and putting it into their choice seems a very happy method for the comfort of the debtor cast down and dejected with the weight of his circumstances and it may be with the reproaches of his own conscience too that he has not done honestly in running out the effects of his creditors and making other families suffer by him and perhaps poor families tooi say this way of giving up all with an honest and single desire to make all the satisfaction he is able to his creditors greatly heals the breach in his peace which his circumstances had made before for by now doing all that is in his power he makes all possible amends for what is past i mean as to men and they are induced by this open frank usage to give him the reward of his honesty and freely forgive him the rest of the debt  there is a manifest difference to the debtor in point of conscience between surrendering his whole effects or estate to his creditors for satisfaction of their debts and offering them a composition unless as i have said the composition is offered as above to the choice of the creditor by surrendering the whole estate the debtor acknowledges the creditors right to all he has in his possession and gives it up to them as their own putting it in their full power to dispose of it as they please  but by a composition the debtor as i have said above stands at bay with the creditors and keeping their estates in his hands capitulates with them as it were sword in hand telling them he can give them no more when perhaps and too often it is the case it is apparent that he is in condition to offer more now let the creditors consent to these proposals be what it will and however voluntary it may be pretended to be it is evident that a force is the occasion of it and the creditor complies and accepts the proposal upon the supposition that no better conditions can be had it is the plain language of the thing for no man accepts of less than he thinks he can get if he believed he could have more he would certainly get it if he could  and if the debtor is able to pay one shilling more than he offers it is a cheat a palpable fraud and of so much he actually robs his creditor but in a surrender the case is altered in all its parts the debtor says to his creditors gentlemen there is a full and faithful account of all i have left it is your own and there it is i am ready to put it into your hands or into the hands of whomsoever you shall appoint to receive it and to lie at your mercy this is all the man is able to do and therefore is so far honest whether the methods that reduced him were honest or no that is a question by itself if on this surrender he finds the creditors desirous rather to have it digested into a composition and that they will voluntarily come into such a proposal then as above they being judges of the equity of the composition and of what ability the debtor is to perform it and above all of what he may or may not gain by it if they accept of such a composition instead of the surrender of his effects then the case alters entirely and the debtor is acquitted in conscience because the creditor had a fair choice and the composition is rather their proposal to the debtor than the debtors proposal to them  thus i think i have stated the case of justice and conscience on the debtors behalf and cleared up his way in case of a necessity to stop trading that he may break without wounding his conscience as well as his fortunes and he that thinks fit to act thus will come off with the reputation of an honest man and will have the favour of his creditors to begin again with whatever he may have as to stock and sometimes that favour is better to him than a stock and has been the raising of many a broken tradesman so that his latter end has been better than his beginning     chapter xv  of tradesmen ruining one another by rumour and clamour by scandal and reproach   i have dwelt long upon the tradesmans management of himself in order to his due preserving both his business and his reputation let me bestow one chapter upon the tradesman for his conduct among his neighbours and fellowtradesmen  credit is so much a tradesmans blessing that it is the choicest ware he deals in and he cannot be too chary of it when he has it or buy it too dear when he wants it it is a stock to his warehouse it is current money in his cashchest it accepts all his bills for it is on the fund of his credit that he has any bills to accept demands would else be made upon the spot and he must pay for his goods before he has themtherefore i say it accepts all his bills and oftentimes pays them too in a word it is the life and soul of his trade and it requires his utmost vigilance to preserve it  if then his own credit should be of so much value to him and he should be so nice in his concern about it he ought in some degree to have the same care of his neighbours religion teaches us not to slander and defame our neighbour that is to say not to raise or promote any slander or scandal upon his good name as a good name is to another man and which the wise man says is better than life the same is credit to a tradesmanit is the life of his trade and he that wounds a tradesmans credit without cause is as much a murderer in trade as he that kills a man in the dark is a murderer in matters of blood  besides there is a particular nicety in the credit of a tradesman which does not reach in other cases a man is slandered in his character or reputation and it is injurious and if it comes in the way of a marriage or of a preferment or post it may disappoint and ruin him but if this happens to a tradesman he is immediately and unavoidably blasted and undone a tradesman has but two sorts of enemies to encounter with namely thieves breaking open his shop and ill neighbours blackening and blasting his reputation and the latter are the worst thieves of the two by a great deal and therefore people should indeed be more chary of their discourse of tradesmen than of other men and that as they would not be guilty of murder i knew an author of a book who was drawn in unwarily and without design to publish a scandalous story of a tradesman in london he the author was imposed upon by a set of men who did it maliciously and he was utterly ignorant of the wicked design nor did he know the person but rashly published the thing being himself too fond of a piece of news which he thought would be grateful to his readers nor yet did he publish the persons name so cautious he was though that was not enough as it proved for the person was presently published by those who had maliciously done it  the scandal spread the tradesman a flourishing man and a considerable dealer was run upon by it with a torrent of malice a match which he was about with a considerable fortune was blasted and prevented and that indeed was the malicious end of the people that did it nor did it stop thereit brought his creditors upon him it ruined him it brought out a commission of bankrupt against him it broke his heart and killed him and after his death his debts and effects coming in there appeared to be seven shillings in the pound estate clear and good over and above all demands all his debts discharged and all the expenses of the statute paid  it was to no purpose that the man purged himself of the crime laid to his chargethat the author who had ignorantly and rashly published the scandal declared himself ignorant the man was run down by a torrent of reproach scandal oppressed him he was buried alive in the noise and dust raised both against his morals and his credit and yet his character was proved good and his bottom in trade was so too as i have said above  it is not the least reason of my publishing this to add that even the person who was ignorantly made the instrument of publishing the scandal was not able to retrieve it or to prevent the mans ruin by all the public reparation he could make in print and by all the acknowledgement he could make of his having been ignorantly drawn in to do it and this i mention for the honest tradesmans caution and to put him in mind that when he has unwarily let slip anything to the wounding the reputation of his neighbour tradesman whether in his trading credit or the credit of his morals it may not be in his power to unsay it again that is so as to prevent the ruin of the person and though it may grieve him as long as he lives as the like did the author i mention yet it is not in his power to recall it or to heal the wound he has given and that he should consider very well of beforehand  a tradesmans credit and a virgins virtue ought to be equally sacred from the tongues of men and it is a very unhappy truth that as times now go they are neither of them regarded among us as they ought to be  the teatable among the ladies and the coffeehouse among the men seem to be places of new invention for a depravation of our manners and morals places devoted to scandal and where the characters of all kinds of persons and professions are handled in the most merciless manner where reproach triumphs and we seem to give ourselves a loose to fall upon one another in the most unchristian and unfriendly manner in the world  it seems a little hard that the reputation of a young lady or of a newmarried couple or of people in the most critical season of establishing the characters of their persons and families should lie at the mercy of the teatable nor is it less hard that the credit of a tradesman which is the same thing in its nature as the virtue of a lady should be tossed about shuttlecocklike from one table to another in the coffeehouse till they shall talk all his creditors about his ears and bring him to the very misfortune which they reported him to be near when at the same time he owed them nothing who raised the clamour and owed nothing to all the world but what he was able to pay  and yet how many tradesmen have been thus undone and how many more have been put to the full trial of their strength in trade and have stood by the mere force of their good circumstances whereas had they been unfurnished with cash to have answered their whole debts they must have fallen with the rest  we need go no farther than lombard street for an exemplification of this truth there was a time when lombard street was the only bank and the goldsmiths there were all called bankers the credit of their business was such that the like has not been seen in england since in private hands some of those bankers as i have had from their own mouths have had near two millions of paper credit upon them at a time that is to say have had bills under their hands running abroad for so much at a time  on a sudden like a clap of thunder king charles ii shut up the exchequer which was the common centre of the overplus cash these great bankers had in their hands what was the consequence not only the bankers who had the bulk of their cash there but all lombard street stood still the very report of having money in the exchequer brought a run upon the goldsmiths that had no money there as well as upon those that had and not only sir robert viner alderman backwell farringdon forth and others broke and failed but several were ruined who had not a penny of money in the exchequer and only sunk by the rumour of it that rumour bringing a run upon the whole street and giving a check to the paper credit that was run up to such an exorbitant height  i remember a shopkeeper who one time took the liberty foolish liberty with himself in public company in a coffeehouse to say that he was broke i assure you says he that i am broke and tomorrow i resolve to shut up my shop and call my creditors together his meaning was that he had a brother just dead in his house and the next day was to be buried when in civility to the deceased he kept his shop shut and several people whom he dealt with and owed money to were the next day invited to the funeral so that he did actually shut up his shop and call some of his creditors together  but he sorely repented the jest which he put upon himself are you broke says one of his friends to him that was in the coffeehouse then i wish i had the little money you owe me which however it seems was not much says the other still carrying on his jest i shall pay nobody till as i told you i have called my people together the other did not reach his jest which at best was but a dull one but he reached that part of it that concerned himself and seeing him continue carelessly sitting in the shop slipped out and fetching a couple of sergeants arrested him the other was a little surprised but however the debt being no great sum he paid it and when he found his mistake told his friends what he meant by his being broke  but it did not end there for other people of his neighbours who were then in the coffeehouse and heard his discourse and had thought nothing more of it yet in the morning seeing his shop shut concluded the thing was so indeed and immediately it went over the whole street that such a one was broke from thence it went to the exchange and from thence into the country among all his dealers who came up in a throng and a fright to look after him in a word he had as much to do to prevent his breaking as any man need to desire and if he had not had very good friends as well as a very good bottom he had inevitably been ruined and undone  so small a rumour will overset a tradesman if he is not very careful of himself and if a word in jest from himself which though indeed no man that had considered things or thought before he spoke would have said and on the other hand no man who had been wise and thinking would have taken as it was takeni say if a word taken from the tradesmans own mouth could be so fatal and run such a dangerous length what may not words spoken slyly and secretly and maliciously be made to do  a tradesmans reputation is of the nicest nature imaginable like a blight upon a fine flower if it is but touched the beauty of it or the flavour of it or the seed of it is lost though the noxious breath which touched it might not reach to blast the leaf or hurt the root the credit of a tradesman at least in his beginning is too much at the mercy of every enemy he has till it has taken root and is established on a solid foundation of good conduct and success it is a sad truth that every idle tongue can blast a young shopkeeper and therefore though i would not discourage any young beginner yet it is highly beneficial to alarm them and to let them know that they must expect a storm of scandal and reproach upon the least slip they make if they but stumble fame will throw them down it is true if they recover she will set them up as fast but malice generally runs before and bears down all with it and there are ten tradesmen who fall under the weight of slander and an ill tongue to one that is lifted up again by the common hurry of report  to say i am broke or in danger of breaking is to break me and though sometimes the malicious occasion is discovered and the author detected and exposed yet how seldom is it so and how much oftener are ill reports raised to ruin and run down a tradesman and the credit of a shop and like an arrow that flies in the dark it wounds unseen the authors no nor the occasion of these reports are never discovered perhaps or so much as rightly guessed at and the poor tradesman feels the wound receives the deadly blow and is perhaps mortally stabbed in the vitals of his trade i mean his trading credit and never knows who hurt him  i must say in the tradesmans behalf that he is in such a case to be esteemed a sacrifice to the worst and most hellish of all secret crimes i mean envy which is made up of every hateful vice a complication of crimes which nothing but the worst of gods reasonable world can be guilty of and he will indeed merit and call for every honest mans pity and concern but what relief is this to him for in the meantime though the devil himself were the raiser of the scandal yet it shall go about the blow shall take and every man though at the same time expressing their horror and aversion at the thing shall yet not be able no not themselves to say they receive no impression from it  though i know the clamour or rumour was raised maliciously and from a secret envy at the prosperity of the man yet if i deal with him it will in spite of all my abhorrence of the thing in spite of all my willingness to do justice i say it will have some little impression upon me it will be some shock to my confidence in the man and though i know the devil is a liar a slanderer a calumniator and that his name devil is derived from it and that i knew if that as i said were possible that the devil in his proper person raised and began and carried on this scandal upon the tradesman yet there is a secret lurking doubt about him which hangs about me concerning him the devil is a liar but he may happen to speak truth just then he may chance to be right and i know not what there may be in it and whether there may be any thing or no but i will have a little care c  thus insensibly and involuntarily nay in spite of friendship good wishes and even resolution to the contrary it is almost impossible to prevent our being shocked by rumour and we receive an impression whether we will or not and that from the worst enemy there is such a powerful sympathy between our thoughts and our interest that the first being but touched and that in the lightest manner imaginable we cannot help it caution steps on in behalf of the last and the man is jealous and afraid in spite of all the kindest and best intentions in the world  nor is it only dangerous in case of false accusations and false charges for those indeed are to be expected fatal but even just and true things may be as fatal as false for the truth is not always necessary to be said of a tradesman many things a tradesman may perhaps allow himself to do and may be lawfully done but if they should be known to be part of his character it would sink deep into his trading fame his credit would suffer by it and in the end it might be his ruin so that he that would not set his hand to his neighbours ruin should as carefully avoid speaking some truths as raising some forgeries upon him  of what fatal consequence then is the raising rumours and suspicions upon the credit and characters of young tradesmen and how little do those who are forward to raise such suspicions and spread such rumours consult conscience or principle or honour in what they do how little do they consider that they are committing a trading murder and that in respect to the justice of it they may with much more equity break open the tradesmans house and rob his cashchest or his shop and what they can carry away thence will not do him half the injury that robbing his character of what is due to it from an upright and diligent conduct would do the loss of his money or goods is easily made up and may be sometimes repaired with advantage but the loss of credit is never repaired the one is breaking open his house but the other is burning it down the one carries away some goods but the other shuts goods out from coming in one is hurting the tradesman but the other is undoing him  credit is the tradesmans life it is as the wise man says marrow to his bones it is by this that all his affairs go on prosperously and pleasantly if this be hurt wounded or weakened the tradesman is sick hangs his head is dejected and discouraged and if he does go on it is heavily and with difficulty as well as with disadvantage he is beholding to his fund of cash not his friends and he may be truly said to stand upon his own legs for nothing else can do it  and therefore on the other hand if such a man is any way beholding to his credit if he stood before upon the foundation of his credit if he owes any thing considerable it is a thousand to one but he sinks under the oppression of it that is to say it brings every body upon himi mean every one that has any demand upon himfor in pushing for their own especially in such cases men have so little mercy and are so universally persuaded that he that comes first is first served that i did not at all wonder that in the story of the tradesman who so foolishly exposed himself in the coffeehouse as above his friend whom he said the words to began with him that very night and before he went out of the coffeehouse it was rather a wonder to me he did not go out and bring in halfadozen more upon him the same evening  it is very rarely that men are wanting to their own interest and the jealousy of its being but in danger is enough to make men forget not friendship only and generosity but good manners civility and even justice itself and fall upon the best friends they have in the world if they think they are in the least danger of suffering by them  on these accounts it is and many more that a tradesman walks in continual jeopardy from the looseness and inadvertency of mens tongues ay and womens too for though i am all along very tender of the ladies and would do justice to the sex by telling you they were not the dangerous people whom i had in view in my first writing upon this subject yet i must be allowed to say that they are sometimes fully even with the men for ill usage when they please to fall upon them in this nice article in revenge for any slight or but pretended slight put upon them  it was a terrible revenge a certain lady who was affronted by a tradesman in london in a matter of love took upon him in this very article it seems a tradesman had courted her some time and it was become public as a thing in a manner concluded when the tradesman left the lady a little abruptly without giving a good reason for it and indeed she afterwards discovered that he had left her for the offer of another with a little more money and that when he had done so he reported that it was for another reason which reflected a little on the person of the lady and in this the tradesman did very unworthily indeed and deserved her resentment but as i said it was a terrible revenge she took and what she ought not to have done  first she found out who it was that her former pretended lover had been recommended to and she found means to have it insinuated to her by a womanfriend that he was not only rakish and wicked but in short that he had a particular illness and went so far as to produce letters from him to a quackdoctor for directions to him how to take his medicines and afterwards a receipt for money for the cure though both the letters and receipt also as afterwards appeared were forged in which she went a dismal length in her revenge as you may see  then she set two or three female instruments to discourse her case in all their gossips companies and at the teatables wherever they came and to magnify the ladys prudence in refusing such a man and what an escape she had had in being clear of him  why says a lady to one of these emissaries what was the matter i thought she was like to be very well married  oh no madam by no means says the emissary  why madam says another lady we all know mr h he is a very pretty sort of a man  ay madam says the emissary again but you know a pretty man is not all that is required  nay says the lady again i dont mean so he is no beauty no rarity that way but i mean a clever good sort of a man in his business such as we call a pretty tradesman  ay says the lady employed but that is not all neither  why says the other lady he has a very good trade too and lives in good credit  yes says malice he has some of the first but not too much of the last i suppose  no says the lady i thought his credit had been very good  if it had i suppose says the first the match had not been broke off  why says the lady i understood it was broken off on his side  and so did i says another  and so did i indeed says a third  oh madam says the tool nothing like it i assure you  indeed says another i understood he had quitted mrs because she had not fortune enough for him and that he courted another certain lady whom we all know  then the ladies fell to talking of the circumstances of his leaving her and how he had broken from her abruptly and unmannerly and had been too free with her character at which the first lady that is to say the emissary or tool as i call her took it up a little warmly thus  1 ladywell you see ladies how easily a ladys reputation may be injured i hope you will not go away with it so  2 ladynay we have all of us a respect for mrs and some of us visit there sometimes i believe none of us would be willing to injure her  1 ladybut indeed ladies she is very much injured in that story  2 ladyindeed it is generally understood so and every body believes it  1 ladyi can assure you it is quite otherwise in fact  2 ladyi believe he reports it so himself and that with some very odd things about the lady too  1 ladythe more base unworthy fellow he  2 ladyespecially if he knows it to be otherwise  1 ladyespecially if he knows the contrary to be true madam  2 ladyis that possible did he not refuse her then  1 ladynothing like it madam but just the contrary  2 ladyyou surprise me  3 ladyi am very glad to hear it for her sake  1 ladyi can assure you madam she had refused him and that he knows well enough which has been one of the reasons that has made him abuse her as he has done  2 ladyindeed she has been used very ill by him or somebody for him  1 ladyyes he has reported strange things but they are all lies  2 ladywell but pray madam what was the reason if we may be so free that she turned him off after she had entertained him so long  1 ladyoh madam reason enough i wonder he should pretend when he knew his own circumstances too to court a lady of her fortune  2 ladywhy are not his circumstances good then  1 ladyno madam good alas he has no bottom  2 ladyno bottom why you surprise me we always looked upon him to be a man of substance and that he was very well in the world  1 ladyit is all a cheat madam theres nothing in it when it came to be made out nothing at all in it  2 ladythat cannot be madam mr  has lived always in good reputation and good credit in his business  1 ladyit is all sunk again then if it was so i dont know  2 ladywhy did she entertain him so long then  1 ladyalas madam how could she know poor lady till her friends inquired into things but when they came to look a little narrowly into it they soon found reason to give her a caution that he was not the man she took him for  2 ladywell it is very strange i am sure he passed for another man among us  1 ladyit must be formerly then for they tell me his credit has been sunk these three or four years he had need enough indeed to try for a greater fortune he wants it enough  2 ladyit is a sad thing when men look out for fortunes to heal their tradebreaches with and make the poor wife patch up their old bankrupt credit  1 ladyespecially madam when they know themselves to be gone so far that even with the addition they can stand but a little while and must inevitably bring the lady to destruction with them  2 ladywell i could never have thought mr  was in such circumstances  3 ladynor i we always took him for a ten thousand pound man  1 ladythey say he was deep in the bubbles madam  2 ladynay if he was gotten into the south sea that might hurt him indeed as it has done many a gentleman of better estates than he  1 ladyi dont know whether it was the south sea or some other bubbles but he was very near making a bubble of her and £3000 into the bargain  2 ladyi am glad she has escaped him if it be so it is a sign her friends took a great deal of care of her  1 ladyhe wont hold it long he will have his desert i hope i dont doubt but we shall see him in the gazette quickly for a bankrupt  2 ladyif he does not draw in some innocent young thing that has her fortune in her own hands to patch him up  1 ladyi hope not madam i hear he is blown where he went since and there they say they have made another discovery of him in a worse circumstance than the other  2 ladyhow pray  1 ladynothing madam but a particular kind of illness c i need say no more  2 ladyyou astonish me why i always thought him a very civil honest sober man  1 ladythis is a sad world madam men are seldom known now till it is too late but sometimes murder comes out seasonably and so i understand it is here for the lady had not gone so far with him but that she could go off again  2 ladynay it was time to go off again if it were so  1 ladynay madam i do not tell this part of my own knowledge i only heard so but i am afraid there is too much in it  thus ended this piece of hellish wildfire upon the character and credit of a tradesman the truth of all which was no more than thisthat the tradesman disliking his first lady left her and soon after though not presently courted another of a superior fortune indeed though not for that reason and the first lady provoked at being cast off and as she called it slighted raised all this clamour upon him and persecuted him with it wherever she was able  such a discourse as this at a teatable it could not be expected would be long a secret it ran from one tittletattle society to another and in every company snowball like it was far from lessening and it went on till at length it began to meet with some contradiction and the tradesman found himself obliged to trace it as far and as well as he could  but it was to no purpose to confront it when one was asked and another was asked they only answered they heard so and they heard it in company in such a place and in such a place and some could remember where they had it and some could not and the poor tradesman though he was really a man of substance sank under it prodigiously his new mistress whom he courted refused him and would never hear any thing in his favour or trouble herself to examine whether it were true or noit was enough she said to her that he was laden with such a report and if it was unjust she was sorry for it but the misfortune must be his and he must place it to the account of his having made some enemies which she could not help  as to his credit the slander of the first ladys raising was spread industriously and with the utmost malice and bitterness and did him an inexpressible prejudice every man he dealt with was shy of him every man he owed any thing to came for it and as he said he was sure he should see the last penny demanded it was his happiness that he had wherewith to pay for had his circumstances been in the least perplexed the man had been undone nay as i have observed in another case as his affairs might have lain he might have been able to have paid forty shillings in the pound and yet have been undone and been obliged to break and shut up his shop  it is true he worked through it and he carried it so far as to fix the malice of all the reports pretty much upon the first lady and particularly so far as to discover that she was the great reason of his being so positively rejected by the other but he could never fix it so upon her as to recover any damages of her only to expose her a little and that she did not value having as she said wickedly had her full revenge of him and so indeed she had  the sum of the matter is and it is for this reason i tell you the story that the reputation of a tradesman is too much at the mercy of mens tongues or womens either and a story raised upon a tradesman however malicious however false and however frivolous the occasion is not easily suppressed but if it touches his credit as a flash of fire it spreads over the whole air like a sheet there is no stopping it  my inference from all this shall be very brief if the tongues of every illdisposed envious gossip whether mangossip or womangossip for there are of both sorts may be thus mischievous to the tradesman and he is so much at the mercy of the tattling slandering part of the world how much more should tradesmen be cautious and wary how they touch or wound the credit and character of one another there are but a very few tradesmen who can say they are out of the reach of slander and that the malice of enemies cannot hurt them with the tongue here and there one and those ancient and well established may be able to defy the world but there are so many others that i think i may warn all tradesmen against making havoc of one anothers reputation as they would be tenderly used in the same case  and yet i cannot but say it is too much a tradesmans crime i mean to speak slightly and contemptibly of other tradesman their neighbours or perhaps rivals in trade and to run them down in the characters they give of them when inquiry may be made of them as often is the case the reputation of tradesmen is too often put into the hands of their fellowtradesmen when ignorant people think to inform themselves of their circumstances by going to those whose interest it is to defame and run them down  i know no case in the world in which there is more occasion for the golden rule do as you would be done unto and though you may be established as you may think and be above the reach of the tongues of others yet the obligation of the rule is the same for you are to do as you would be done unto supposing that you were in the same condition or on a level with the person  it is confessed that tradesmen do not study this rule in the particular case i am now speaking of no men are apter to speak slightly and coldly of a fellowtradesman than his fellowtradesmen and to speak unjustly so too the reasons for which cannot be good unless it can be pleaded for upon the foundation of a just and impartial concern in the interest of the inquirer and even then nothing must be said but what is consistent with strict justice and truth all that is more than that is mere slander and envy and has nothing of the christian in it much less of the neighbour or friend it is true that friendship may be due to the inquirer but still so much justice is due to the person inquired of that it is very hard to speak in such cases and not be guilty of raising dust as they call it upon your neighbour and at least hurting if not injuring him  it is indeed so difficult a thing that i scarce know what stated rule to lay down for the conduct of a tradesman in this casea tradesman at a distance is going to deal with another tradesman my neighbour and before he comes to bargain or before he cares to trust him he goes weakly enough perhaps to inquire of him and of his circumstances among his neighbours and fellowtradesmen perhaps of the same profession or employment and who among other things it may be are concerned by their interest that this tradesmans credit should not rise too fast what must be done in this case  if i am the person inquired of what must i do if i would have this man sink in his reputation or be discredited and if it is for my interest to have him cried down in the world it is a sore temptation to me to put in a few words to his disadvantage and yet if i do it in gratification of my private views or interest or upon the foot of resentment of any kind whatever and let it be from what occasion it will nay however just and reasonable the resentment is or may be it is utterly unjust and unlawful and is not only unfair as a man but unchristian and is neither less nor more than a secret revenge which is forbidden by the laws of god and man  if on the other hand i give a good character of the man or of his reputation i mean of his credit in business in order to have the inquirer trust him and at the same time know or believe that he is not a sound and good man that is as to trade for it is his character in trade that i am speaking of what am i doing then it is plain i lay a snare for the inquirer and am at least instrumental to his loss without having really any design to hurt him for it is to be supposed before he came to me to inquire i had no view of acting any thing to his prejudice  again there is no medium for to refuse or decline giving a character of the man is downright giving him the worst character i canit is in short shooting him through the head in his trade a man comes to me for a character of my neighbouring tradesman i answer him with a repulse to his inquiry thus  agood sir do not ask me the character of my neighboursi resolve to meddle with nobodys character pray do not inquire of me  bwell but sir you know the gentleman you live next door to him you can tell me if you please all that i desire to know whether he is a man in credit and fit to be trusted or no in the way of his business  ai tell you sir i meddle with no mans business i will not give characters of my neighboursit is an ill officea man gets no thanks for it and perhaps deserves none  bbut sir you would be willing to be informed and advised if it were your own case  ait may be so but i cannot oblige people to inform me  bbut you would entreat it as a favour and so i come to you  abut you may go to any body else  bbut you are a man of integrity i can depend upon what you say i know you will not deceive me and therefore i beg of you to satisfy me  abut i desire you to excuse me for it is what i never doi cannot do it  bbut sir i am in a great strait i am just selling him a great parcel of goods and i am willing to sell them too and yet i am willing to be safe as you would yourself if you were in my case  ai tell you sir i have always resolved to forbear meddling with the characters of my neighboursit is an ill office besides i mind my own business i do not enter into the inquiries after other peoples affairs  bwell sir i understand you then i know what i have to do  awhat do you mean by that  bnothing sir but what i suppose you would have me understand by it  ai would have you understand what i saynamely that i will meddle with nobodys business but my own  band i say i understand you i know you are a good man and a man of charity and loth to do your neighbours any prejudice and that you will speak the best of every man as near as you can  ai tell you i speak neither the best nor the worsti speak nothing  bwell sir that is to say that as charity directs you to speak well of every man so when you cannot speak well you refrain and will say nothing and you do very well to be sure you are a very kind neighbour  abut that is a base construction of my words for i tell you i do the like by every body  byes sir i believe you do and i think you are in the right of itam fully satisfied  ayou act more unjustly by me than by my neighbour for you take my silence or declining to give a character to be giving an ill character  bno sir not for an ill character  abut i find you take it for a ground of suspicion  bi take it indeed for a due caution to me sir but the man may be a good man for all that only  aonly what i understand youonly you wont trust him with your goods  bbut another man may sir for all that so that you have been kind to your neighbours and to me too sirand you are very just i wish all men would act so one by another i should feel the benefit of it myself among others for i have suffered deeply by ill tongues i am sure  awell however unjust you are to me and to my neighbour too i will not undeceive you at present i think you do not deserve it  he used a great many more words with him to convince him that he did not mean any discredit to his neighbour tradesman but it was all one he would have it be that his declining to give his said neighbour a good character was giving him an ill character which the other told him was a wrong inference however he found that the man stood by his own notion of it and declined trusting the tradesman with the goods though he was satisfied he the tradesman was a sufficient man  upon this he was a little uneasy imagining that he had been the cause of it as indeed he had next to the positive humour of the inquirer though it was not really his fault neither was the construction the other made of it just to his intention for he aimed at freeing himself from all inquiries of that nature but found there was no prevailing with him to understand it any other way than he did so to requite the man a little in his own way he contrived the following method he met with him two or three days after and asked him if he had sold his goods to the person his neighbour  no says he you know i would not  nay says the other i only knew you said so i did not think you would have acted so from what i said nor do i think i gave you any reason  why says he i knew you would have given him a good character if you could and i knew you were too honest to do it if you were not sure it was just  the last part i hope is true but you might have believed me honest too in what i did say that i had resolved to give no characters of any body  as to that i took it as any body would to be the best and modestest way of covering what you would not have be disclosed namely that you could not speak as you would and i also judged that you therefore chose to say nothing  well i can say no more but this you are not just to me in it and i think you are not just to yourself neither  they parted again upon this and the next day the first tradesman who had been so pressed to give a character of his neighbour sent a man to buy the parcel of goods of the other tradesman and offering him ready money bought them considerably cheaper than the neighbourtradesman was to have given for them besides reckoning a reasonable discount for the time which was four months that the first tradesman was to have given to his neighbour  as soon as he had done he went and told the neighbourtradesman what he had done and the reason of it and sold the whole parcel to him again giving the same four months credit for them as the first man was to have given and taking the discount for time only to himself gave him all the advantage of the buying and gave the first man the mortification of knowing it all and that the goods were not only for the same man but that the very tradesman whom he would not believe when he declined giving a character of any man in general had trusted him with them  he pretended to be very angry and to take it very ill but the other told him that when he came to him for a character of the man and he told him honestly that he would give no characters at all that it was not for any ill to his neighbour that he declined it he ought to have believed him and that he hoped when he wanted a character of any of his neighbours again he would not come to him for it  this story is to my purpose in this particular which is indeed very significant that it is the most difficult thing of its kind in the world to avoid giving characters of our neighbouring tradesmen and that let your reasons for it be what they will to refuse giving a character is giving a bad character and is generally so taken whatever caution or arguments you use to the contrary  in the next place it is hard indeed if an honest neighbour be in danger of selling a large parcel of goods to a fellow who i may know it is not likely should be able to pay for them though his credit may in the common appearance be pretty good at that time and what must i do if i discover the mans circumstances which perhaps i am let into by some accident i say if i discover them the man is undone and if i do not the tradesman who is in danger of trusting him is undone  i confess the way is clear if i am obliged to speak at all in the case the man unsound is already a bankrupt at bottom and must fail but the other man is sound and firm if this disaster does not befall him the first has no wound given him but negatively he stands where he stood before whereas the other is drawn in perhaps to his own ruin in the next place the first is a knave or rather thief for he offers to buy and knows he cannot pay in a word he offers to cheat his neighbour and if i know it i am so far confederate with him in the cheat  in this case i think i am obliged to give the honest man a due caution for his safety if he desires my advice i cannot say i am obliged officiously to go out of my way to do it unless i am any way interested in the personfor that would be to dip into other mens affairs which is not my proper work and if i should any way be misinformed of the circumstances of the tradesman i am to speak of and wrong him i may be instrumental to bring ruin causelessly upon him  in a word it is a very nice and critical case and a tradesman ought to be very sure of what he says or does in such a case the good or evil fate of his neighbour lying much at stake and depending too much on the breath of his mouth every part of this discourse shows how much a tradesmans welfare depends upon the justice and courtesy of his neighbours and how nice and critical a thing his reputation is  this well considered would always keep a tradesman humble and show him what need he has to behave courteously and obligingly among his neighbours for one malicious word from a man much meaner than himself may overthrow him in such a manner as all the friends he has may not be able to recover him a tradesman if possible should never make himself any enemies  but if it is so fatal a thing to tradesmen to give characters of one another and that a tradesman should be so backward in it for fear of hurting his neighbour and that notwithstanding the character given should be just and the particular reported of him should be true with how much greater caution should we act in like cases where what is suggested is really false in fact and the tradesman is innocent as was the case in the tradesman mentioned before about courting the lady if a tradesman may be ruined and undone by a true report much more may he be so by a false report by a malicious slandering defaming tongue there is an artful way of talking of other peoples reputation which really however some people salve the matter is equal if not superior in malice to the worst thing they can say this is by rendering them suspected talking doubtfully of their characters and of their conduct and rendering them first doubtful and then strongly suspected i dont know what to say to such a man a gentleman came to me the other day but i knew not what to say i dare not say he is a good man or that i would trust him with five hundred pounds myself if i should say so i should belie my own opinion i do not know indeed he may be a good man at bottom but i cannot say he minds his business if i should i must lie i think he keeps a great deal of company and the like  another he is asked of the currency of his payments and he answers suspiciously on that side too i know not what to say he may pay them at last but he does not pay them the most currently of any man in the street and i have heard saucy boys huff him at his door for bills on his endeavouring to put them off indeed i must needs say i had a bill on him a few weeks ago for a hundred pounds and he paid me very currently and without any dunning or often calling upon but it was i believe because i offered him a bargain at that time and i supposed he was resolved to put a good face upon his credit  a tradesman that would do as he would be done by should carefully avoid these people who come always about inquiring after other tradesmans characters there are men who make it their business to do thus and as they are thereby as ready to ruin and blow up good fairdealing tradesmen as others so they do actually surprise many and come at their characters earlier and nearer than they expect they would  tradesmen i say that will thus behave to one another cannot be supposed to be men of much principle but will be apt to lay hold of any other advantage how unjust soever and indeed will wait for an occasion of such advantages and where is there a tradesman but who if he be never so circumspect may some time or other give his neighbour who watches for his halting advantage enough against him when such a malicious tradesman appears in any place all the honest tradesmen about him ought to join to expose him whether they are afraid of him or no they should blow him among the neighbourhood as a public nuisance as a common barrettor or raiser of scandal by such a general aversion to him they would depreciate him and bring him into so just a contempt that no body would keep him company much less credit any thing he said and then his tongue would be no slander and his breath would be no blast and nobody would either tell him any thing or hear any thing from him and this kind of usage i think is the only way to put a stop to a defamer for when he has no credit of his own left he would be unable to hurt any of his neighbours     chapter xvi  of the tradesmans entering into partnership in trade and the many dangers attending it   there are some businesses which are more particularly accustomed to partnerships than others and some that are very seldom managed without two three or four partners and others that cannot be at all carried on without partnership and there are those again in which they seldom join partners together  mercers linendrapers banking goldsmiths and such considerable trades are often and indeed generally carried on in partnership but other meaner trades and of less business are carried on generally speaking singlehanded  some merchants who carry on great business in foreign ports have what they call houses in those ports where they plant and breed up their sons and apprentices and these are such as i hinted could not carry on their business without partnership  the trading in partnership is not only liable to more hazards and difficulties but it exposes the tradesman to more snares and disadvantages by a great deal than the trading with a single hand does and some of those snares are these  1 if the partner is a stirring diligent capable man there is danger of his slipping into the whole trade and getting in between you and home by his application thrusting you at last quite out so that you bring in a snake into your chimney corner which when it is warmed and grown vigorous turns about at you and hisses you out of the house it is with the tradesman in the case of a diligent and active partner as i have already observed it was in the case of a trusty and diligent apprentice namely that if the master does not appear constantly at the head of the business and make himself be known by his own application and diligence to be what he is he shall soon look to be what he is not that is to say one not concerned in the business  he will never fail to be esteemed the principal person concerned in the shop and in the trade who is principally and most constantly found there acting at the head of every business and be it a servant or a partner the master or chief loses himself extremely by the advances the other makes of that kind for whenever they part again either the apprentice by being out of his time or the partner by the expiration of the articles of partnership or by any other determination of their agreement the customers most certainly desire to deal with the man whom they have so often been obliged by and if they miss him inquire after and follow him  it is true the apprentice is the more dangerous of the two because his separation is supposed to be more certain and generally sooner than the partner the apprentice is not known and cannot have made his interest among the buyers but for perhaps a year or a year and a half before his time expired sooner than that he could not put himself in the way of being known and observed and then when his time is out he certainly removes unless he is taken into the shop as a partner and that indeed prolongs the time and places the injury at a greater distance but still it makes it the more influencing when it comes and unless he is brought some how or other into the family and becomes one of the house perhaps by marriage or some other settled union with the master he never goes off without making a great chasm in the masters affairs and the more by how much he has been more diligent and useful in the trade the wounds of which the master seldom if ever recovers  if the partner were not an apprentice but that they either came out of their times together or near it or had a shop and business before but quitted it to come in it may then be said that he brought part of the trade with him and so increased the trade when he joined with the other in proportion to what he may be said to carry away when he went off this is the best thing that can be said of a partnership and then i have this to add first that the tradesman who took the partner in has a fair field indeed to act in with his partner and must take care by his constant attendance due acquaintance with the customers and appearing in every part of the business to maintain not his interest only but the appearance of his interest in the shop or warehouse that he may on every occasion and to every customer not only be but be known to be the master and head of the business and that the other is at best but a partner and not a chief partner as in case of his absence and negligence will presently be suggested for he that chiefly appears will be always chief partner in the eye of the customers whatever he is in the substance of the thing  this indeed is much the same case with what is said before of a diligent servant and a negligent master and therefore i forbear to enlarge upon it but it is so important in both cases that indeed it cannot well be mentioned too often the masters full application in his own person is the only answer to both he that takes a partner only to ease him of the toil of his business that he may take his pleasure and leave the drudgery as they call it to the partner should take care not to do it till about seven years before he resolves to leave off trade that at the end of the partnership he may be satisfied to give up the trade to his partner or see him run away with it and not trouble himself about it  but if he takes a partner at his beginning with an intent by their joint enlarged stock to enlarge their business and so carry on a capital trade which perhaps neither of them were able to do by themselves and which is the only justifiable reason for taking a partner at all he must resolve then to join with his partner not only in stock but in mutual diligence and application that the trade may flourish by their joint assistance and constant labour as two oxen yoked together in the same draught by their joint assistance draw much more than double what they could either of them draw by their single strength and this indeed is the only safe circumstance of a partnership then indeed they are properly partners when they are assistants to one another whereas otherwise they are like two gamesters striving to worm one another out and to get the mastery in the play they are engaged in  the very word partner imports the substance of the thing and they are as such engaged to a mutual application or they are no more partners but rather one is the trading gentleman and the other is the trading drudge but even then let them depend the drudge will carry away the trade and the profit too at last and this is the way how one partner may honestly ruin another and for ought i know it is the only one for it cannot be said but that the diligent partner acts honestly in acting diligently and if the other did the same they would both thrive alike but if one is negligent and the other diligent one extravagant and expensive the other frugal and prudent it cannot be said to be his fault that one is rich and the other poorthat one increases in the stock and the other is lessened and at last worked quite out of it  as a partner then is taken in only for ease to abate the first tradesmans diligence and take off the edge of his application so far a partner let him be as honest and diligent as he will is dangerous to the tradesmannay the more honest and the more diligent he is the more dangerous he is and the more a snare to the tradesman that takes him in and a tradesman ought to be very cautious in the adventure for indeed it is an adventurethat he be not brought in time to relax his diligence by having a partner even contrary to his first intention for laziness is a subtle insinuating thing and it is a sore temptation to a man of ease and indolence to see his work done for him and less need of him in the business than used to be and yet the business to go on well too and this danger is dormant and lies unseen till after several years it rises as it were out of its ambuscade and surprises the tradesman letting him see by his loss what his neglect has cost him  2 but there are other dangers in partnership and those not a few for you may not only be remiss and negligent remitting the weight of the business upon him and depending upon him for its being carried on by which he makes himself master and brings you to be forgot in the business but he may be crafty too and designing in all this and when he has thus brought you to be as it were nobody he shall make himself be all somebody in the trade and in that particular he by degrees gets the capital interest as well as stock in the trade while the true original of the shop who laid the foundation of the whole business brought a trade to the shop or brought commissions to the house and whose the business more particularly is is secretly supplanted and with the concurrence of his own negligencefor without that it cannot beis as it were laid aside and at last quite thrust out  thus whether honest or dishonest the tradesman is circumvented and the partnership is made fatal to him for it was all owing to the partnership the tradesman was diligent before understood his business and kept close to it gave up his time to it and by employing himself prevented the indolence which he finds breaking insensibly upon him afterwards by being made easy as they call it in the assistance of a partner  3 but there are abundance of other cases which make a partnership dangerous for if it be so where the partner is honest and diligent and where he works into the heart of the business by his industry and application or by his craft and insinuation what may it not be if he proves idle and extravagant and if instead of working him out he may be said to play him out of the business that is to say prove wild expensive and run himself and his partner out by his extravagance  there are but too many examples of this kind and here the honest tradesman has the labouring oar indeed for instead of being assisted by a diligent industrious partner whom on that account he took into the trade he proves a loose extravagant wild fellow runs abroad into company and leaves him for whose relief he was taken in to bear the burden of the whole trade which perhaps was too heavy for him before and if it had not been so he had not been prevailed with to have taken in a partner at all  this is indeed a terrible disappointment and is very discouraging and the more so because it cannot be recalled for a partnership is like matrimony it is almost engaged in for better or for worse till the years expire there is no breaking it off at least not easily nor fairly but all the inconveniences which are to be feared will follow and stare in your face as first the partner in the first place draws out all his stock and this sometimes is a blow fatal enough for perhaps the partner cannot take the whole trade upon himself and cannot carry on the trade upon his own stock if he could he would not have taken in a partner at all this withdrawing the stock has sometimes been very dangerous to a partner nay has many times been the overthrow and undoing of him and of the family that is left  he that takes a partner into his trade on this accountnamely for the support of his stock to enjoy the assistance of so much cash to carry on the trade ought seriously to consider what he shall be able to do when the partner breaking off the partnership shall carry all his stock and the improvement of it too with him perhaps the tradesmans stock is not much increased perhaps not at all nay perhaps the stock is lessened instead of being increased and they have rather gone backward than forward what shall the tradesman do in such a case and how shall he bear the breach in his stock which that separation would make  thus he is either tied down to the partner or the partner is pinned down to him for he cannot separate without a breach it is a sad truth to many a partner that when the partnership comes to be finished and expired the man would let his partner go but the other cannot go without tearing him all to pieces whom he leaves behind him and yet the partner being loose idle and extravagant in a word will ruin both if he stays  this is the danger of partnership in some of the best circumstances of it but how hazardous and how fatal is it in other cases and how many an honest and industrious tradesman has been prevailed with to take in a partner to ease himself in the weight of the business or on several other accounts some perhaps reasonable and prudent enough but has found himself immediately involved in a sea of trouble is brought into innumerable difficulties concealed debts and unknown incumbrances such as he could no ways extricate himself out of and so both have been unavoidably ruined together  these cases are so various and so uncertain that it is not easy to enumerate them but we may include the particulars in a general or two  1 one partner may contract debts even in the partnership itself so far unknown to the other as that the other may be involved in the danger of them though he was not at all concerned in or acquainted with them at the same time they were contracted  2 one partner may discharge debts for both partners and so having a design to be knavish may go and receive money and give receipts for it and not bringing it to account or not bringing the money into cash may wrong the stock to so considerable a sum as may be to the ruin of the other partner  3 one partner may confess judgment or give bonds or current notes in the name and as for the account of the company and yet convert the effects to his own private use leaving the stock to be answerable for the value  4 one partner may sell and give credit and deliver parcels of goods to what sum or what quantity he thinks fit and to whom and so by his indiscretion or perhaps by connivance and knavery lose to the stock what parcel of goods he pleases to the ruin of the other partner and bring themselves to be both bankrupt together  5 nay to sum up all one partner may commit acts of bankruptcy without the knowledge of the other and thereby subject the united stock and both or all the partners to the danger of a commission when they may themselves know nothing of it till the blow is given and given so as to be too late to be retrieved  all these and many more being the ill consequences and dangers of partnership in trade i cannot but seriously warn the honest industrious tradesman if possible to stand upon his own legs and go on upon his own bottom to pursue his business diligently but cautiously and what we call fair and softly not eagerly pushing to drive a vast trade and enjoy but half of it rather carry on a middling business and let it be his own  there may be cases indeed which may have their exceptions to this general head of advice partnerships may sometimes prove successful and in some particular business they are more necessary than in others and in some they tell us that they are absolutely necessary though the last i can by no means grant but be that as it will there are so many cases more in number and of great consequence too which miscarry by the several perplexed circumstances differing tempers and open knavery of partners that i cannot but give it as a friendly advice to all tradesmenif possible to avoid partnerships of all kinds  but if the circumstances of trade require partnerships and the risk must be run i would recommend to the tradesman not to enter into partnerships but under the following circumstances  1 not to take in any partner who should be allowed to carry on any separate business in which the partnership is not concerned depend upon it whatever other business your partner carries on you run the risk of it as much as you do of your own and you run the risk with this particular circumstance too that you have the hazard without the profit or success that is without a share in the profit or success which is very unequal and unfair i know cunning men will tell you that there may be provision made so effectually in the articles of partnership that the stock in partnership should be concerned in no other interest or engagements but its own but let such cunning gentlemen tell me if the partner meets with a disappointment in his other undertakings which wounds him so deep as to break him will it not affect the partnership thus far 1 that it may cause his stock to be drawn hastily out and perhaps violently too 2 that it touches and taints the credit of the partner to be concerned with such a man and though a mans bottom may support him if it be very good yet it is a blow to him touches his credit and makes the world stand a little at a stay about him if it be no more for a while till they see that he shows himself upon the exchange or at his shopdoor again in spite of all the apprehensions and doubts that have been handed about concerning him either of these are so essential to the tradesman whose partner thus sinks by his own private breaches in which the parnership is not concerned that it is worth while to caution the tradesman against venturing and i must add too that many a tradesman has fallen under the disaster by the partners affairs thus affecting him though the immediate losses which the partner had suffered have not been charged upon him and yet i believe it is not so easy to avoid being fallen upon for those debts also  it is certain as i formerly noted rumour will break a tradesman almost at any time it matters not at first whether the rumour be true or false what rumour can sit closer to a man in businesshis own personal misfortunes exceptedthan such as thisthat his partner is broke that his partner has met with a loss suppose an insurance suppose a fall of stocks suppose a bubble or a cheat or we know not what the partner is sunk no man knows whether the partnership be concerned in it or no and while it is not known every man will suppose it for mankind always think the worst of every thing  what can be a closer stroke at the poor tradesman he knows not what his partner has done he has reason to fear the worst he even knows not himself for a while whether he can steer clear of the rocks or no but soon recovers knows his own circumstances and struggles hard with the world pays out his partners stock and gets happily over it and it is well he does so for that he is at the brink of ruin must be granted and where one stands and keeps up his reputation and his business there are twenty would be undone in the same circumstance  who then would run the venture of a partner if it were possible to avoid it and who if they must have a partner would have one that was concerned in separate business in which the partnership was not engaged  2 if you must have a partner always choose to have the partner rather under than over you by this i mean take him in for a fifth a fourth or at most a third never for a half there are many reasons to be given for this besides that of having the greater share of profits for that i do not give as a reason here at all but the principal reasons are thesefirst in case of any disaster in any of the particular supposed accidents which i have mentioned and that you should be obliged to pay out your partners stock it will not be so heavy or be so much a blow to you and secondly you preserve to yourself the governing influence in your own business you cannot be overruled overawed or dogmatically told it shall or shall not be thus or thus he that takes in a partner for a third has a partner servant he that takes him in for a half has a partner masterthat is to say a director or preceptor let your partner have always a lesser interest in the business than yourself and be rather less acquainted with the business than yourself at least not better you should rather have a partner to be instructed than a partner to instruct you for he that teaches you will always taunt you  3 if you must have a partner let him always be your junior rather than your senior by this i mean your junior in business whether he is so in years or not there are many reasons why the tradesman should choose this and particularly the same as the other of taking him in for a junior or inferior part of the tradethat is to say to maintain the superiority of the business in his own hands and this i mention not at all upon account of the pride or vanity of the superiority for that is a trifle compared to the rest but that he may have the more authority to inspect the conduct of his partner in which he is so much and so essentially concerned and to inquire whether he is doing any thing or taking any measures dangerous or prejudicial to the stock or to the credit of the partnership that so if he finds any thing he may restrain him and prevent in time the mischief which would otherwise be inevitable to them both  there are many other advantages to a tradesman who is obliged to take a partner by keeping in his own hands the major part of the trade which are too long to repeat here such as his being always able to put a check to any rash adventure any launching out into bubbles and projects and things dangerous to the business and this is a very needful thing in a partnership that one partner should be able to correct the rash resolves of another in hazardous cases  by this correcting of rash measures i mean overruling them with moderation and temper for the good of the whole and for their mutual advantage the romans frequently had two generals or consuls to command their armies in the field one of which was to be a young man that by his vigour and sprightly forwardness he might keep up the spirits and courage of the soldiers encourage them to fight and lead them on by his example the other an old soldier that by his experience in the military affairs age and counsels he might a little abate the fire of his colleague and might not only know how to fight but know when to fight that is to say when to avoid fighting and the want of this lost them many a victory and the great battle of cannae in particular in which 80000 romans were killed in one day  to compare small things with great i may say it is just so in the affair of trade you should always join a sober grave head weighed to business and acquainted with trade to the young trader who having been young in the work will the easier give up his judgment to the other and who is governed with the solid experience of the other and so you join their ways together the rash and the sedate the grave and the giddy  again if you must go into partnership be sure if possible you take nobody into partnership but such as whose circumstances in trade you are fully acquainted with such there are frequently to be had among relations and neighbours and such if possible should be the man that is taken into partnership that the hazard of unsound circumstances may be avoided a man may else be taken into partnership who may be really bankrupt even before you take him and such things have been done to the ruin of many an honest tradesman  if possible let your partner be a beginner that his stock may be reasonably supposed to be free and unentangled and let him be one that you know personally and his circumstances and did know even before you had any thoughts of engaging together  all these cautions are with a supposition that the partner must be had but i must still give it as my opinion in the case of such tradesmen as i have all along directed myself to that if possible they should go on singlehanded in trade and i close it with this brief note respecting the qualifications of a partner as above that next to no partner such a partner is best     chapter xvii  of honesty in dealing and lying   there is some difference between an honest man and an honest tradesman and though the distinction is very nice yet i must say it is to be supported trade cannot make a knave of an honest man for there is a specific difference between honesty and knavery which can never be altered by trade or any other thing nor can that integrity of mind which describes and is peculiar to a man of honesty be ever abated to a tradesman the rectitude of his soul must be the same and he must not only intend or mean honestly and justly but he must do so he must act honestly and justly and that in all his dealings he must neither cheat nor defraud overreach nor circumvent his neighbour nor indeed anybody he deals with nor must he design to do so or lay any plots or snares to that purpose in his dealing as is frequent in the general conduct of too many who yet call themselves honest tradesmen and would take it very ill to have any one tax their integrity  but after all this is premised there are some latitudes like poetical licences in other cases which a tradesman is and must be allowed and which by the custom and usage of trade he may give himself a liberty in which cannot be allowed in other cases to any man no nor to the tradesman himself out of his businessi say he may take some liberties but within bounds and whatever some pretenders to strict living may say yet that tradesman shall pass with me for a very honest man notwithstanding the liberty which he gives himself of this kind if he does not take those liberties in an exorbitant manner and those liberties are such as these  1 the liberty of asking more than he will take i know some people have condemned this practice as dishonest and the quakers for a time stood to their point in the contrary practice resolving to ask no more than they would take upon any occasion whatsoever and choosing rather to lose the selling of their goods though they could afford sometimes to take what was offered rather than abate a farthing of the price they had asked but time and the necessities of trade made them wiser and brought them off of that severity and they by degrees came to ask and abate and abate again just as other business tradesmen do though not perhaps as some do who give themselves a fuller liberty that way  indeed it is the buyers that make this custom necessary for they especially those who buy for immediate use will first pretend positively to tie themselves up to a limited price and bid them a little and a little more till they come so near the sellers price that they the sellers cannot find in their hearts to refuse it and then they are tempted to take it notwithstanding their first words to the contrary it is common indeed for the tradesman to say i cannot abate anything when yet they do and can afford it but the tradesman should indeed not be understood strictly and literally to his words but as he means it namely that he cannot reasonably abate and that he cannot afford to abate and there he may be in earnest namely that he cannot make a reasonable profit of his goods if he is obliged to abate and so the meaning is honest that he cannot abate and yet rather than not take your money he may at last resolve to do it in hopes of getting a better price for the remainder or being willing to abate his ordinary gain rather than disoblige the customer or being perhaps afraid he should not sell off the quantity and many such reasons may be given why he submits to sell at a lower price than he really intended or can afford to do and yet he cannot be said to be dishonest or to lie in saying at first he cannot or could not abate  a man in trade is properly to be said not to be able to do what he cannot do to his profit and advantage the english cannot trade to hungary and into slavoniathat is to say they cannot do it to advantage but it is better for them to trade to venice with their goods and let the venetians carry on a trade into hungary through dalmatia croatia c and the like in other places  to bring it down to particular cases one certain merchant cannot deal in one sort of goods which another merchant is eminent for the other merchant is as free to the trade as he but he cannot do it to profit for he is unacquainted with the trade and it is out of his way and therefore he cannot do it  thus to the case in hand the tradesman says he cannot sell his goods under such a price which in the sense of his business is true that is to say he cannot do it to carry on his trade with the usual and reasonable advantage which he ought to expect and which others make in the same way of business  or he cannot without underselling the market and undervaluing the goods and seeming to undersell his neighbourshopkeepers to whom there is a justice due in trade which respects the price of sale and to undersell is looked upon as an unfair kind of trading  all these and many more are the reasons why a tradesman may be said not to lie though he should say he cannot abate or cannot sell his goods under such a price and yet may after think fit to sell you his goods something lower than he so intended or can afford to do rather than lose your custom or rather than lose the selling of his goods and taking your ready money which at that time he may have occasion for  in these cases i cannot say a shopkeeper should be tied down to the literal meaning of his words in the price he asks or that he is guilty of lying in not adhering stiffly to the letter of his first demand though at the same time i would have every tradesman take as little liberty that way as may be and if the buyer would expect the tradesman should keep strictly to his demand he should not stand and haggle and screw the shopkeeper down bidding from one penny to another to a trifle within his price so as it were to push him to the extremity either to turn away his customer for a sixpence or some such trifle or to break his word as if he would say i will force you to speak falsely or turn me away for a trifle  in such cases if indeed there is a breach the sin is the buyers at least he puts himself in the devils stead and makes himself both tempter and accuser nor can i say that the seller is in that case so much to blame as the buyer however it were to be wished that on both sides buying and selling might be carried on without it for the buyer as often says i wont give a farthing more and yet advances as the seller says i cant abate a farthing and yet complies these are as i call them trading lies and it were to be wished they could be avoided on both sides and the honest tradesman does avoid them as much as possible but yet must not i say in all cases be tied up to the strict literal sense of that expression i cannot abate as above26  2 another trading licence is that of appointing and promising payments of money which men in business are oftentimes forced to make and forced to break without any scrupple nay and without any reproach upon their integrity let us state this case as clearly as we can and see how it stands as to the morality of it for that is the point in debate  the credit usually given by one tradesman to another as particularly by the merchant to the wholesaleman and by the wholesaleman to the retailer is such that without tying the buyer up to a particular day of payment they go on buying and selling and the buyer pays money upon account as his convenience admits and as the seller is content to take it this occasions the merchant or the wholesaleman to go about as they call it adunning among their dealers and which is generally the work of every saturday when the merchant comes to his customer the wholesaleman or warehousekeeper for money he tells him i have no money sir i cannot pay you now if you call next week i will pay you next week comes and the merchant calls again but it is the same thing only the warehouseman adds well i will pay you next week without fail when the week comes he tells him he has met with great disappointments and he knows not what to do but desires his patience another week and when the other week comes perhaps he pays him and so they go on  now what is to be said for this in the first place let us look back to the occasion this warehousekeeper or wholesaleman sells the goods which he buys of the merchanti say he sells them to the retailers and it is for that reason i place it first there now as they buy in smaller quantities than he did of the merchant so he deals with more of them in number and he goes about among them the same saturday to get in money that he may pay his merchant and he receives his bag full of promises too every where instead of money and is put off from week to week perhaps by fifty shopkeepers in a day and their serving him thus obliges him to do the same to the merchant  again come to the merchant except some whose circumstances are above it they are by this very usage obliged to put off the blackwellhall factor or the packer or the clothier or whoever they deal with in proportion and thus promises go round for payment and those promises are kept or broken as money comes in or as disappointments happen and all this while there is no breach of honesty or parole no lying or supposition of it among the tradesmen either on one side or other  but let us come i say to the morality of it to break a solemn promise is a kind of prevarication that is certain there is no coming off of it and i might enlarge here upon the first fault namely of making the promise which say the strict objectors they should not do but the tradesmans answer is this all those promises ought to be taken as they are madenamely with a contingent dependence upon the circumstances of trade such as promises made them by others who owe them money or the supposition of a weeks trade bringing in money by retail as usual both of which are liable to fail or at least to fall short and this the person who calls for the money knows and takes the promise with those attending casualties which if they fail he knows the shopkeeper or whoever he is must fail him too  the case is plain if the man had the money in cash he need not make a promise or appointment for a farther day for that promise is no more or less than a capitulation for a favour a desire or condition of a weeks forbearance on his assurance that if possible he will not fail to pay him at the time it is objected that the words if possible should then be mentioned which would solve the morality of the case to this i must answer that i own i think it needless unless the man to whom the promise was made could be supposed to believe the promise was to be performed whether it were possible or no which no reasonable man can be supposed to do  there is a parallel case to this in the ordinary appointment of people to meet either at place or time upon occasions of business two friends make an appointment to meet the next day at such a house suppose a tavern at or near the exchange one says to the other do not fail me at that time for i will certainly be there the other answers i will not fail some people who think themselves more religious than others or at least would be thought so object against these positive appointments and tell us we ought to say i will if it pleases god or i will life and health permitting27 and they quote the text for it where our saviour expressly commands to use such a caution and which i shall say nothing to lessen the force of  but to say a word to our present custom since christianity is the public profession of the country and we are to suppose we not only are christians ourselves but that all those we are talking to or of are also christians we must add that christianity supposes we acknowledge that life and all the contingencies of life are subjected to the dominion of providence and liable to all those accidents which god permits to befall us in the ordinary course of our living in the world therefore we expect to be taken in that sense in all such appointments and it is but justice to us as christians in the common acceptation of our words that when i say i will certainly meet my friend at such a place and at such a time he should understand me to mean if it pleases god to give me life and health or that his providence permits me to come or as the text says if the lord will for we all know that unless the lord will i cannot meet or so much as live  not to understand me thus is as much as to say you do not understand me to be a christian or to act like a christian in any thing and on the other hand they that understand it otherwise i ought not to understand them to be christians nor should i be supposed to put any neglect or dishonour upon the government of providence in the world or to suggest that i did not think myself subjected to it because i omitted the words in my appointment  in like manner when a man comes to me for money i put him off that in the first place supposes i have not the money by me or cannot spare it to pay him at that time if it were otherwise it may be supposed i would pay him just then he is then perhaps impatient and asks me when i will pay him and i tell him at such a time this naturally supposes that by that time i expect to be supplied so as to be able to pay i have current bills or promises of money to be paid me or i expect the ordinary takings in my shop or warehouse will supply me to make good my promise thus my promise is honest in its foundation because i have reason to expect money to come in to make me in a condition to perform it but so it falls out contrary to my expectation and contrary to the reason of things i am disappointed and cannot do it i am then indeed a trespasser upon my creditor whom i ought to have paid and i am under affliction enough on that account and i suffer in my reputation for it also but i cannot be said to be a liar an immoral man a man that has no regard to my promise and the like for at the same time i have perhaps used my utmost endeavour to do it but am prevented by many several men breaking promise with me and i am no way able to help myself  it is objected to this that then i should not make my promises absolute but conditional to this i say that the promises as is above observed are really not absolute but conditional in the very nature of them and are understood so when they are made or else they that hear them do not understand them as all human appointments ought to be understood i do confess it would be better not to make an absolute promise at all but to express the condition or reserve with the promise and say i will if i can or i will if people are just to me and perform their promises to me  but to this i answer the importunity of the person who demands the payment will not permit itnothing short of a positive promise will satisfythey never believe the person intends to perform if he makes the least reserve or condition in his promise though at the same time they know that even the nature of the promise and the reason of the promise strongly implies the conditioni say the importunity of the creditor occasions the breach which he reproaches the debtor with the immorality of28  custom indeed has driven us beyond the limits of our morals in many things which trade makes necessary and which we cannot now avoid so that if we must pretend to go back to the literal sense of the command if our yea must be yea and our nay nay if no man must go beyond or defraud his neighbour if our conversation must be without covetousness and the likewhy then it is impossible for tradesmen to be christians and we must unhinge all business act upon new principles in trade and go on by new rulesin short we must shut up shop and leave off trade and so in many things we must leave off living for as conversation is called life we must leave off to converse all the ordinary communication of life is now full of lying and what with tablelies salutationlies and tradinglies there is no such thing as every man speaking truth with his neighbour  but this is a subject would launch me out beyond the bounds of a chapter and make a book by itself i return to the case particularly in handpromises of payment of money men in trade i say are under this unhappy necessity they are forced to make them and they are forced to break them the violent pressing and dunning and perhaps threatening too of the creditor when the poor shopkeeper cannot comply with his demand forces him to promise in short the importunate creditor will not be otherwise put off and the poor shopkeeper almost worried and perhaps a little terrified too and afraid of him is glad to do and say any thing to pacify him and this extorts a promise which when the time comes he is no more able to perform than he was before and this multiplies promises and consequently breaches so much of which are to be placed to the accounts of force that i must acknowledge though the debtor is to blame the creditor is too far concerned in the crime of it to be excused and it were to be wished some other method could be found out to prevent the evil and that tradesmen would resolve with more courage to resist the importunities of the creditor be the consequence what it would rather than break in upon their morals and load their consciences with the reproaches of it for all their lives after  i remember i knew a tradesman who labouring long under the ordinary difficulties of men embarrassed in trade and past the possibility of getting out and being at last obliged to stop and call his people together told me that after he was broke though it was a terrible thing to him at first too as it is to most tradesmen yet he thought himself in a new world when he was at a full stop and had no more the terror upon him of bills coming for payment and creditors knocking at his door to dun him and he without money to pay he was no more obliged to stand in his shop and be bullied and ruffled by his creditors nay by their apprentices and boys and sometimes by porters and footmen to whom he was forced to give good words and sometimes strain his patience to the utmost limits he was now no more obliged to make promises which he knew he could not perform and break promises as fast as he made them and so lie continually both to god and man and he added the ease of his mind which he felt upon that occasion was so great that it balanced all the grief he was in at the general disaster of his affairs and farther that even in the lowest of his circumstances which followed he would not go back to live as he had done in the exquisite torture of want of money to pay his bills and his duns  nor was it any satisfaction to him to say that it was owing to the like breach of promise in the shopkeepers and gentlemen and people whom he dealt with who owed him money and who made no conscience of promising and disappointing him and thereby drove him to the necessity of breaking his own promises for this did not satisfy his mind in the breaches of his word though they really drove him to the necessity of it but that which lay heaviest upon him was the violence and clamour of creditors who would not be satisfied without such promises even when he knew or at least believed he should not be able to perform  nay such was the importunity of one of his merchants that when he came for money and he was obliged to put him off and to set him another day the merchant would not be satisfied unless he would swear that he would pay him on that day without fail and what said you to him said i say to him said he i looked him full in the face and sat me down without speaking a word being filled with rage and indignation at him but after a little while he insisted again and asked me what answer i would make him at which i smiled and asked him if he were in earnest he grew angry then and asked me if i laughed at him and if i thought to laugh him out of his money i then asked him if he really did expect i should swear that i would pay him the next week as i proposed to promise he told me yes he did and i should swear it or pay him before he went out of my warehouse  i wondered indeed at the discourse and at the folly of the merchant who i understood afterwards was a foreigner and though i thought he had been in jest at first when he assured me he was not i was curious to hear the issue which at first he was loth to go on with because he knew it would bring about all the rest but i pressed him to knowso he told me that the merchant carried it to such a height as put him into a furious passion and knowing he must break some time or other he was resolved to put an end to his being insulted in that manner so at last he rose up in a rage told the merchant that as no honest man could take such an oath unless he had the money by him to pay it so no honest man could ask such a thing of him and that since he must have an answer his answer was he would not swear such an oath for him nor any man living and if he would not be satisfied without it he might do his worstand so turned from him and knowing the man was a considerable creditor and might do him a mischief he resolved to shut up that very night and did so carrying all his valuable goods with him into the mint and the next day he heard that his angry creditor waylaid him the same afternoon to arrest him but he was too quick for him and as he said though it almost broke his heart to shut up his shop yet that being delivered from the insulting temper of his creditor and the perpetual perplexities of want of money to pay people when they dunned him and above all from the necessity of making solemn promises for trifling sums and then breaking them again was to him like a load taken off his back when he was weary and could stand under it no longer it was a terror to him he said to be continually lying breaking faith with all mankind and making promises which he could not perform  this necessarily brings me to observe here and it is a little for the ease of the tradesmans mind in such severe cases that there is a distinction to be made in this case between wilful premeditated lying and the necessity men may be driven to by their disappointments and other accidents of their circumstances to break such promises as they had made with an honest intention of performing them  he that breaks a promise however solemnly made may be an honest man but he that makes a promise with a design to break it or with no resolution of performing it cannot be so nay to carry it farther he that makes a promise and does not do his endeavour to perform it or to put himself into a condition to perform it cannot be an honest man a promise once made supposes the person willing to perform it if it were in his power and has a binding influence upon the person who made it so far as his power extends or that he can within the reach of any reasonable ability perform the conditions but if it is not in his power to perform it as in this affair of payment of money is often the case the man cannot be condemned as dishonest unless it can be made appear either  1 that when he made the promise he knew he should not be able to perform it or  2 that he resolved when he made the promise not to perform it though he should be in a condition to do it and in both these cases the morality of promising cannot be justified any more than the immorality of not performing it  but on the other hand the person promising honestly intending when he made the appointment to perform it if possible and endeavouring faithfully to be able but being rendered unable by the disappointment of those on whose promises he depended for the performance of his own i cannot say that such a tradesman can be charged with lying or with any immorality in promising for the breach was not properly his own but the peoples on whom he depended and this is justified from what i said before namely that every promise of that kind supposes the possibility of such a disappointment even in the very nature of its making for if the man were not under a moral incapacity of payment he would not promise at all but pay at the time he promised his promising then implies that he has only something future to depend upon to capacitate him for the payment that is to say the appointments of payment by other tradesmen who owe him that promises the money or the daily supply from the ordinary course of his trade suppose him a retailer in a shop and the like all which circumstances are subject to contingencies and disappointments and are known to be so by the person to whom the promise is made and it is with all those contingencies and possibilities of disappointment that he takes or accepts the tradesmans promise and forbears him in hopes that he will be able to perform knowing that unless he receives money as above he cannot  i must however acknowledge that it is a very mortifying thing to a tradesman whether we suppose him to be one that values his credit in trade or his principle as to honest dealing to be obliged to break his word and therefore where men are not too much under the hatches to the creditor and they can possibly avoid it a tradesman should not make his promises of payment so positive but rather conditional and thereby avoid both the immorality and the discredit of breaking his word nor will any tradesman i hope harden himself in a careless forwardness to promise without endeavouring or intending to perform from any thing said in this chapter for be the excuse for it as good as it will as to the point of strict honesty he can have but small regard to his own peace of mind or to his own credit in trade who will not avoid it as much as possible  footnotes  26 the practice of haggling about prices is now very properly abandoned by all respectable dealers in goods greatly to the comfort of both sellers and buyers  27 it was a fashion of trade in defoes time and down to a somewhat later period to thrust the phrase god willing into almost every promise or announcement the purport of which might possibly be thwarted by death or any other accident the phrase in particular appeared at the beginning of all letters in which a merchant announced his design of visiting retail dealers in the provinces as god willing i shall have the honour of waiting on you on the 15th proximo hence english riders or commercial travellers came to be known in scotland by the nickname of godwillings this pious phraseology seems now to be banished from all mercantile affairs except the shipping of goods  28 notwithstanding all this ingenious reasoning we cannot help thinking that it would be better if conditional promises were made in conditional language it is not necessarily to be understood in all cases that a direct unreserved promise means something conditional so that there is a liability to being much deceived and grievously disappointed by all such promises a sound morality certainly demands that the tradesman should use the practices described in the text as rarely and with as much reluctance as possible and that like other men he should make his words as nearly as may be the echo of his thoughts     chapter xviii  of the customary frauds of trade which honest men allow themselves to practise and pretend to justify   as there are trading lies which honest men tell so there are frauds in trade which tradesmen daily practise and which notwithstanding they think are consistent with their being honest men  it is certainly true that few things in nature are simply unlawful and dishonest but that all crime is made so by the addition and concurrence of circumstances and of these i am now to speak and the first i take notice of is that of taking and repassing or putting off counterfeit or false money  it must be confessed that calling in the old money in the time of the late king william was an act particularly glorious to that reign and in nothing more than this that it delivered trade from a terrible load and tradesmen from a vast accumulated weight of daily crime there was scarce a shopkeeper that had not a considerable quantity or bag full of false and unpassable money not an apprentice that kept his masters cash but had an annual loss which they sometimes were unable to support and sometimes their parents and friends were called upon for the deficiency  the consequence was that every raw youth or unskilful body that was sent to receive money was put upon by the cunning tradesmen and all the bad money they had was tendered in payment among the good that by ignorance or oversight some might possibly be made to pass and as these took it so they were not wanting again in all the artifice and sleight of hand they were masters of to put it off again so that in short people were made bites and cheats to one another in all their business and if you went but to buy a pair of gloves or stockings or any trifle at a shop you went with bad money in one hand and good money in the other proffering first the bad coin to get it off if possible and then the good to make up the deficiency if the other was rejected  thus people were daily upon the catch to cheat and surprise one another if they could and in short paid no good money for anything if they could help it and how did we triumph if meeting with some poor raw servant or ignorant woman behind a counter we got off a counterfeit halfcrown or a brass shilling and brought away their goods which were worth the said halfcrown or shilling if it had been good for a halfcrown that was perhaps not worth sixpence or for a shilling not worth a penny as if this were not all one with picking the shopkeepers pocket or robbing his house  the excuse ordinarily given for this practice was thisnamely that it came to us for good we took it and it only went as it came we did not make it and the like as if because we had been basely cheated by a we were to be allowed to cheat b or that because c had robbed our house that therefore we might go and rob d  and yet this was constantly practised at that time over the whole nation and by some of the honestest tradesmen among us if not by all of them  when the old money was as i have said called in this cheating trade was put to an end and the morals of the nation in some measure restoredfor in short before that it was almost impossible for a tradesman to be an honest man but now we begin to fall into it again and we see the current coin of the kingdom strangely crowded with counterfeit money again both gold and silver and especially we have found a great deal of counterfeit foreign money as particularly portugal and spanish gold such as moydores and spanish pistoles which when we have the misfortune to be put upon with them the fraud runs high and dips deep into our pockets the first being twentyseven shillings and the latter seventeen shillings it is true the latter being payable only by weight we are not often troubled with them but the former going all by tale great quantities of them have been put off among us i find also there is a great increase of late of counterfeit money of our own coin especially of shillings and the quantity increasing so that in a few years more if the wicked artists are not detected the grievance may be in proportion as great as it was formerly and perhaps harder to be redressed because the coin is not likely to be any more called in as the old smooth money was  what then must be done and how must we prevent the mischief to conscience and principle which lay so heavy upon the whole nation before the question is short and the answer would be as short and to the purpose if people would but submit to the little loss that would fall upon them at first by which they would lessen the weight of it as they go on as it would never increase to such a formidable height as it was at before nor would it fall so much upon the poor as it did then  first i must lay it down as a stated rule or maxim in the moral part of the questionthat to put off counterfeit base money for good money knowing it to be counterfeit is dishonest and knavish  nor will it take off from the crime of it or lessen the dishonesty to say i took it for good and current money and it goes as it comes for as before my having been cheated does not authorise me to cheat any other person so neither was it a just or honest thing in that person who put the bad money upon me if they knew it to be bad and if it were not honest in them how can it be so in me if then it came by knavery it should not go by knaverythat would be indeed to say it goes as it comes in a literal sense that is to say it came by injustice and i shall make it go so but that will not do in matters of right and wrong  the laws of our country also are directly against the practice the law condemns the coin as illegalthat is to say it is not current money or as the lawyers style it it is not lawful money of england now every bargain or agreement in trade is in the common and just acceptation and the language of trade made for such a price or rate in the current money of england and though you may not express it in words at length it is so understood as much as if it were set down in writing if i cheapen any thing at a shop suppose it the least toy or trifle i ask them what must you have for it the shopkeeper answersso much suppose it were a shilling what is the english but thisone shilling of lawful money of england and i agree to give that shilling but instead of it give them a counterfeit piece of lead or tin washed over to make it look like a shilling do i pay them what i bargained for do i give them one shilling of lawful money of england do i not put a cheat upon them and act against justice and mutual agreement  to say i took this for the lawful money of england will not add at all except it be to the fraud for my being deceived does not at all make it be lawful money so that in a word there can be nothing in that part but increasing the criminal part and adding one knave more to the number of knaves which the nation was encumbered with before  the case to me is very clear namely that neither by law justice nor conscience can the tradesman put off his bad money after he has taken it if he once knows it to be false and counterfeit money that it is against the law is evident because it is not good and lawful money of england it cannot be honest because you do not pay in the coin you agreed for or perform the bargain you made or pay in the coin expected of you and it is not just because you do not give a valuable consideration for the goods you buy but really take a tradesmans goods away and return dross and dirt to him in the room of it  the medium i have to propose in the room of this is that every man who takes a counterfeit piece of money and knows it to be such should immediately destroy itthat is to say destroy it as money cut it in pieces or as i have seen some honest tradesmen do nail it up against a post so that it should go no farther it is true this is sinking so much upon himself and supporting the credit of the current coin at his own expense and he loses the whole piece and this tradesmen are loth to do but my answer is very clear that thus they ought to do and that sundry public reasons and several public benefits would follow to the public in some of which he might have his share of benefit hereafter and if he had not yet he ought to do it  first by doing thus he puts a stop to the fraudthat piece of money is no more made the instrument to deceive others which otherwise it might do and though it is true that the loss is only to the last man that is to say in the ordinary currency of the money yet the breach upon conscience and principle is to every owner through whose hands that piece of money has fraudulently passed that is to say who have passed it away for good knowing it to be counterfeit so that it is a piece of good service to the public to take away the occasion and instrument of so much knavery and deceit  secondly he prevents a worse fraud which is the buying and selling such counterfeit money this was a very wicked but open trade in former days and may in time come to be so again fellows went about the streets crying brass money broken or whole that is to say they would give good money for bad it was at first pretended that they were obliged to cut it in pieces and if you insisted upon it they would cut it in pieces before your face but they as often got it without that ceremony and so made what wicked shifts they could to get it off again and many times did put it off for current money after they had bought it for a trifle  thirdly by this fraud perhaps the same piece of money might several years after come into your hands again after you had sold it for a trifle and so you might lose by the same shilling two or three times over and the like of other people but if men were obliged to demolish all the counterfeit money they take and let it go no farther they they would be sure the fraud could go no farther nor would the quantity be ever great at a time for whatever quantity the false coiners should at any time make it would gradually lessen and sink away and not a mass of false and counterfeit coin appear together as was formerly the case and which lost the nation a vast sum of money to call in  it has been the opinion of some that a penalty should be inflicted upon those who offered any counterfeit money in payment but besides that there is already a statute against uttering false money knowing it to be such if any other or farther law should be made either to enforce the statute or to have new penalties added they would still fall into the same difficulties as in the act  1 that innocent men would suffer seeing many tradesmen may take a piece of counterfeit money in tale with other money and really and bona fide not know it and so may offer it again as innocently as they at first took it ignorantly and to bring such into trouble for every false shilling which they might offer to pay away without knowing it would be to make the law be merely vexatious and tormenting to those against whom it was not intended and at the same time not to meddle with the subtle crafty offender whom it was intended to punish and who is really guilty  2 such an act would be difficultly executed because it would still be difficult to know who did knowingly utter false money and who did not which is the difficulty indeed in the present lawso that upon the whole such a law would no way answer the end nor effectually discover the offender much less suppress the practice but i am not upon projects and schemesit is not the business of this undertaking  but a general act obliging all tradesmen to suppress counterfeit money by refusing to put it off again after they knew it to be counterfeit and a general consent of tradesmen to do so this would be the best way to put a stop to the practice the morality of which is so justly called in question and the ill consequences of which to trade are so very well known nor will any thing but a universal consent of tradesmen in the honest suppressing of counterfeit money ever bring it to pass in the meantime as to the dishonesty of the practice however popular it is grown at this time i think it is out of question it can have nothing but custom to plead for it which is so far from an argument that i think the plea is criminal in itself and really adds to its being a grievance and calls loudly for a speedy redress  another trading fraud which among many others of the like nature i think worth speaking of is the various arts made use of by tradesmen to set off their goods to the eye of the ignorant buyer  i bring this in here because i really think it is something of kin to putting off counterfeit money every false gloss put upon our woollen manufactures by hotpressing folding dressing tucking packing bleaching c what are they but washing over a brass shilling to make it pass for sterling every false light every artificial sidewindow skylight and trunklight we see made to show the fine hollands lawns cambrics c to advantage and to deceive the buyerwhat is it but a counterfeit coin to cheat the tradesmans customersan ignis fatuus to impose upon fools and ignorant people and make their goods look finer than they are  but where in trade is there any business entirely free from these frauds and how shall we speak of them when we see them so universally made use of either they are honest or they are not if they are not why do we i say universally make use of themif they are honest why so much art and so much application to manage them and to make goods appear fairer and finer to the eye than they really arewhich in its own nature is evidently a design to cheat and that in itself is criminal and can be no other  and yet there is much to be said for setting goods out to the best advantage too for in some goods if they are not well dressed well pressed and packed the goods are not really shown in a true light many of our woollen manufactures if brought to market rough and undressed like a piece of cloth not carried to the fulling or thicking mill it does not show itself to a just advantage nay it does not show what it really is and therefore such works as may be proper for so far setting it forth to the eye may be necessary for example  the cloths stuffs serges druggets c which are brought to market in the west and northern parts of england and in norfolk as they are bought without the dressing and making up it may be said of them that they are brought to market unfinished and they are bought there again by the wholesale dealers or clothworkers tuckers and merchants and they carry them to their warehouses and workhouses and there they go through divers operations again and are finished for the market nor indeed are they fit to be shown till they are so the stuffs are in the grease the cloth is in the oil they are rough and foul and are not dressed and consequently not finished and as our buyers do not understand them till they are so dressed it is no proper finishing the goods to bring them to market beforethey are not indeed properly said to be made till that part is done  therefore i cannot call all those settingout of goods to be knavish and false but when the goods like a false shilling are to be set out with fraud and false colours and made smooth and shining to delude the eye there where they are so it is really a fraud and though in some cases it extremely differs yet that does not excuse the rest by any means  the packers and hotpressers tuckers and clothworkers are very necessary people in their trades and their business is to set goods off to the best advantage but it may be said too that their true and proper business is to make the goods show what really they are and nothing else it is true as above that in the original dress as a piece of cloth or drugget or stuff comes out of the hand of the maker it does not show itself as it really is nor what it should and ought to show thus far these people are properly called finishers of the manufactures and their work is not lawful only but it is a doing justice to the manufacture  but if by the exuberances of their art they set the goods in a false light give them a false gloss a finer and smoother surface than really they have this is like a painted jade who puts on a false colour upon her tawny skin to deceive and delude her customers and make her seem the beauty which she has no just claim to the name of  so far as art is thus used to show these goods to be what they really are not and deceive the buyer so far it is a trading fraud which is an unjustifiable practice in business and which like coining of counterfeit money is making goods to pass for what they really are not and is done for the advantage of the person who puts them off and to the loss of the buyer who is cheated and deceived by the fraud  the making false lights skylights trunks and other contrivances to make goods look to be what they are not and to deceive the eye of the buyer these are all so many brass shillings washed over in order to deceive the person who is to take them and cheat him of his money and so far these false lights are really criminal they are cheats in trade and made to deceive the world to make deformity look like beauty and to varnish over deficiencies to make goods which are ordinary in themselves appear fine to make things which are ill made look well in a word they are cheats in themselves but being legitimated by custom are become a general practice the honestest tradesmen have them and make use of them the buyer knows of it and suffers himself to be so imposed upon and in a word if it be a cheat as no doubt it is they tell us that yet it is a universal cheat and nobody trades without it so custom and usage make it lawful and there is little to be said but this si populus vult decepi decipiaturif the people will be cheated let them be cheated or they shall be cheated  i come next to the setting out their goods to the buyer by the help of their tongue and here i must confess our shop rhetoric is a strange kind of speech it is to be understood in a manner by itself it is to be taken not in a latitude only but in such a latitude as indeed requires as many flourishes to excuse it as it contains flourishes in itself  the end of it indeed is corrupt and it is also made up of a corrupt composition it is composed of a mass of rattling flattery to the buyer and that filled with hypocrisy compliment selfpraises falsehood and in short a complication of wickedness it is a corrupt means to a vicious end and i cannot see any thing in it but what a wise man laughs at a good man abhors and any man of honesty avoids as much as possible  the shopkeeper ought indeed to have a good tongue but he should not make a common prostitute of his tongue and employ it to the wicked purpose of abusing and imposing upon all that come to deal with him there is a modest liberty which trading licence like the poetic licence allows to all the tradesmen of every kind but tradesmen ought no more to lie behind the counter than the parsons ought to talk treason in the pulpit  let them confine themselves to truth and say what they will but it cannot be done a talking rattling mercer or draper or milliner behind his counter would be worth nothing if he should confine himself to that mean silly thing called truththey must lie it is in support of their business and some think they cannot live without it but i deny that part and recommend it i mean to the tradesmen i am speaking of to consider what a scandal it is upon trade to pretend to say that a tradesman cannot live without lying the contrary to which may be made appear in almost every article  on the other hand i must do justice to the tradesmen and must say that much of it is owing to the buyersthey begin the work and give the occasion it was the saying of a very good shopman once upon this occasion that their customers would not be pleased without lying and why said he did solomon reprove the buyerhe said nothing to the shopkeeperit is naught it is naught says the buyer but when he goes away then he boasteth prov xx 14 the buyer telling us adds he that every thing is worse than it is forces us in justifying its true value to tell them it is better than it is  it must be confessed this verbose way of trading is most ridiculous as well as offensive both in buyer and seller and as it adds nothing to the goodness or value of the goods so i am sure it adds nothing to the honesty or good morals of the tradesman on one side or other but multiplies tradinglies on every side and brings a just reproach on the integrity of the dealer whether he be the buyer or seller  it was a kind of a step to the cure of this vice in trade for such it is that there was an old office erected in the city of london for searching and viewing all the goods which were sold in bulk and could not be searched into by the buyerthis was called garbling and the garbler having viewed the goods and caused all damaged or unsound goods to be taken out set his seal upon the case or bags which held the rest and then they were vouched to be marketable so that when the merchant and the shopkeeper met to deal there was no room for any words about the goodness of the wares there was the garblers seal to vouch that they were marketable and good and if they were otherwise the garbler was answerable  this respected some particular sorts of goods only and chiefly spices and drugs and dyestuffs and the like it were well if some other method than that of a rattling tongue could be found out to ascertain the goodness and value of goods between the shopkeeper and the retail buyer that such a flux of falsehoods and untruths might be avoided as we see every day made use of to run up and run down every thing that is bought or sold and that without any effect too for take it one time with another all the shopkeepers lying does not make the buyer like the goods at all the better nor does the buyers lying make the shopkeeper sell the cheaper  it would be worth while to consider a little the language that passes between the tradesman and his customer over the counter and put it into plain homespun english as the meaning of it really imports we would not take that usage if it were put into plain wordsit would set all the shopkeepers and their customers together by the ears and we should have fighting and quarrelling instead of bowing and curtseying in every shop let us hark a little and hear how it would sound between them a lady comes into a mercers shop to buy some silks or to the lacemans to buy silver laces or the like and when she pitches upon a piece which she likes she begins thus  ladyi like that colour and that figure well enough but i dont like the silkthere is no substance in it  merindeed madam your ladyship liesit is a very substantial silk  ladyno no you lie indeed sir it is good for nothing it will do no service

lies upon my word madam it is in grain indeed and as fine as can be dyed  i might make this dialogue much longer but here is enough to set the mercer and the lady both in a flame and to set the shop in an uproar if it were but spoken out in plain language as above and yet what is all the shopdialect less or more than this the meaning is plainit is nothing but you lie and you liedownright billingsgate wrapped up in silk and satin and delivered dressed finely up in better clothes than perhaps it might come dressed in between a carman and a porter  how ridiculous is all the tonguepadding flutter between miss tawdry the sempstress and tattle my ladys woman at the changeshop when the latter comes to buy any trifle and how many lies indeed creep into every part of trade especially of retail trade from the meanest to the uppermost part of businesstill in short it is grown so scandalous that i much wonder the shopkeepers themselves do not leave it off for the mere shame of its simplicity and uselessness  but habits once got into use are very rarely abated however ridiculous they are and the age is come to such a degree of obstinate folly that nothing is too ridiculous for them if they please but to make a custom of it  i am not for making my discourse a satire upon the shopkeepers or upon their customers if i were i could give a long detail of the arts and tricks made use of behind the counter to wheedle and persuade the buyer and manage the selling part among shopkeepers and how easily and dexterously they draw in their customers but this is rather work for a ballad and a song my business is to tell the complete tradesman how to act a wiser part to talk to his customers like a man of sense and business and not like a mountebank and his merryandrew to let him see that there is a way of managing behind a counter that let the customer be what or how it will man or woman impertinent or not impertinentfor sometimes i must say the men customers are every jot as impertinent as the women but i say let them be what they will and how they will let them make as many words as they will and urge the shopkeeper how they will he may behave himself so as to avoid all those impertinences falsehoods follish and wicked excursions which i complain of if he pleases  it by no means follows that because the buyer is foolish the seller must be so too that because the buyer has a neverceasing tongue the seller must rattle as fast as she that because she tells a hundred lies to run down his goods he must tell another hundred to run them up and that because she belies the goods one way he must do the same the other way  there is a happy medium in these things the shopkeeper far from being rude to his customers on one hand or sullen and silent on the other may speak handsomely and modestly of his goods what they deserve and no other may with truth and good manners too set forth his goods as they ought to be set forth and neither be wanting to the commodity he sells nor run out into a ridiculous extravagance of words which have neither truth of fact nor honesty of design in them  nor is this middle way of management at all less likely to succeed if the customers have any share of sense in them or the goods he shows any merit to recommend them and i must say i believe this grave middle way of discoursing to a customer is generally more effectual and more to the purpose and more to the reputation of the shopkeeper than a storm of words and a mouthful of common shoplanguage which makes a noise but has little in it to plead except to here and there a fool that can no otherwise be prevailed with  it would be a terrible satire upon the ladies to say that they will not be pleased or engaged either with good wares or good pennyworths with reasonable good language or good manners but they must have the addition of long harangues simple fawning and flattering language and a flux of false and foolish words to set off the goods and wheedle them in to lay out their money and that without these they are not to be pleased  but let the tradesman try the honest part and stand by that keeping a stock of fashionable and valuable goods in his shop to show and i dare say he will run no venture nor need he fear customers if any thing calls for the help of noise and rattling words it must be mean and sorry unfashionable and ordinary goods together with weak and silly buyers and let the buyers that chance to read this remember that whenever they find the shopkeeper begins his noise and makes his fine speeches they ought to suppose he the shopkeeper has trash to bring out and believes he has fools to show it to     chapter xix  of fine shops and fine shows   it is a modern custom and wholly unknown to our ancestors who yet understood trade in proportion to the trade they carried on as well as we do to have tradesmen lay out twothirds of their fortune in fitting up their shops  by fitting up i do not mean furnishing their shops with wares and goods to sellfor in that they came up to us in every particular and perhaps went beyond us toobut in painting and gilding fine shelves shutters boxes glassdoors sashes and the like in which they tell us now it is a small matter to lay out two or three hundred pounds nay five hundred pounds to fit up a pastrycooks or a toyshop  the first inference to be drawn from this must necessarily be that this age must have more fools than the last for certainly fools only are most taken with shows and outsides  it is true that a fine show of goods will bring customers and it is not a new custom but a very old one that a new shop very well furnished goes a great way to bringing a trade for the proverb was and still is very true that every body has a penny for a new shop but that a fine show of shelves and glasswindows should bring customers that was never made a rule in trade till now  and yet even now i should not except so much against it if it were not carried on to such an excess as is too much for a middling tradesman to bear the expense of in this therefore it is made not a grievance only but really scandalous to trade for now a young beginner has such a tax upon him before he begins that he must sink perhaps a third part nay a half part of his stock in painting and gilding wainscoting and glazing before he begins to trade nay before he can open his shop as they say of building a watermill twothirds of the expense lies under the water and when the poor tradesman comes to furnish his shop and lay in his stock of goods he finds a great hole made in his cash to the workmen and his show of goods on which the life of his trade depends is fain to be lessened to make up his show of boards and glass to lay them in  nor is this heavy article to be abated upon any account for if he does not make a good show he comes abroad like a mean ordinary fellow and nobody of fashion comes to his shop the customers are drawn away by the pictures and painted shelves though when they come there they are not half so well filled as in other places with goods fit for a trade and how indeed should it be otherwise the joiners and painters glaziers and carvers must have all ready money the weavers and merchants may give credit their goods are of so much less moment to the shopkeeper that they must trust but the more important show must be finished first and paid first and when that has made a deep hole in the tradesmans stock then the remainder may be spared to furnish the shop with goods and the merchant must trust for the rest  it will hardly be believed in ages to come when our posterity shall be grown wiser by our loss and as i may truly say at our expense that a pastrycooks shop which twenty pounds would effectually furnish at a time with all needful things for sale nay except on an extraordinary show as on twelfthday at night for cakes or upon some great feast twenty pounds can hardly be laid out at one time in goods for sale yet that fitting up one of these shops should cost upwards of £300 in the year 1710let the year be recordedthe fitting up to consist of the following particulars  1 sash windows all of lookingglass plates 12 inches by 16 inches in measure  2 all the walls of the shop lined up with galleytiles and the back shop with galleytiles in panels finely painted in forestwork and figures  3 two large pier lookingglasses and one chimney glass in the shop and one very large pierglass seven feet high in the back shop  4 two large branches of candlesticks one in the shop and one in the back room  5 three great glass lanterns in the shop and eight small ones  6 twentyfive sconces against the wall with a large pair of silver standing candlesticks in the back room value £25  7 six fine large silver salvers to serve sweetmeats  8 twelve large high stands of rings whereof three silver to place small dishes for tarts jellies c at a feast  9 painting the ceiling and gilding the lanterns the sashes and the carved work £55  these with some odd things to set forth the shop and make a show besides small plate and besides china basins and cups amounted to as i am well informed above £300  add to this the more necessary part which was  1 building two ovens about £25  2 twenty pounds in stock for pies cheesecakes c  so that in short here was a trade which might be carried on for about £30 or £40 stock required £300 expenses to fit up the shop and make a show to invite customers  i might give something of a like example of extravagance in fitting up a cutlers shop anglicé a toyman which are now come up to such a ridiculous expense as is hardly to be thought of without the utmost contempt let any one stop at the temple or at pauls corner or in many other places  as to the shops of the more considerable trades they all bear a proportion of the humour of the times but do not call for so loud a remark leaving therefore the just reflection which such things call for let me bring it home to the young tradesman to whom i am directing this discourse and to whom i am desirous to give solid and useful hints for his instruction i would recommend it to him to avoid all such needless expenses and rather endeavour to furnish his shop with goods than to paint and gild it over to make it fine and gay let it invite customers rather by the wellfilled presses and shelves and the great choice of rich and fashionable goods that one customer being wellserved may bring another and let him study to bring his shop into reputation for good choice of wares and good attendance on his customers and this shall bring a throng to him much better and of much better people than those that go in merely for a gay shop  let the shop be decent and handsome spacious as the place will allow and let something like the face of a master be always to be seen in it and if possible be always busy and doing something in it that may look like being employed this takes as much with the wiser observers of such things as any other appearance can do  i have heard of a young apothecary who setting up in a part of the town where he had not much acquaintance and fearing much whether he should get into business hired a man acquainted with such business and made him be every morning between five and six and often late in the evenings working very hard at the great mortar pounding and beating though he had nothing to do with it but beating some very needless thing that all his neighbours might hear it and find that he was in full employ being at work early and late and that consequently he must be a man of vast business and have a great practice and the thing was well laid and took accordingly for the neighbours believing he had business brought business to him and the reputation of having a trade made a trade for him  the observation is just a show may bring some people to a shop but it is the fame of business that brings business and nothing raises the fame of a shop like its being a shop of good trade already then people go to it because they think other people go to it and because they think there is good choice of goods their gilding and painting may go a little way but it is the having a shop well filled with goods29 having good choice to sell and selling reasonablethese are the things that bring a trade and a trade thus brought will stand by you and last for fame of trade brings trade anywhere  it is a sign of the barrenness of the peoples fancy when they are so easily taken with shows and outsides of things never was such painting and gilding such sashings and lookingglasses among the shopkeepers as there is now and yet trade flourished more in former times by a gread deal that it does now if we may believe the report of very honest and understanding men the reason i think cannot be to the credit of the present age nor it it to the discredit of the former for they carried on their trade with less gaiety and with less expense than we do now30  my advice to a young tradesman is to keep the safe middle between these extremes something the times must be humoured in because fashion and custom must be followed but let him consider the depth of his stock and not lay out half his estate upon fitting up his shop and then leave but the other half to furnish it it is much better to have a full shop than a fine shop and a hundred pounds in goods will make a much better show than a hundred pounds worth of painting and carved work it is good to make a show but not to be all show  it is true that painting and adorning a shop seems to intimate that the tradesman has a large stock to begin with or else they suggest he would not make such a show hence the young shopkeepers are willing to make a great show and beautify and paint and gild and carve because they would be thought to have a great stock to begin with but let me tell you the reputation of having a great stock is ill purchased when half your stock is laid out to make the world believe it that is in short reducing yourself to a small stock to have the world believe you have a great one in which you do no less than barter the real stock for the imaginary and give away your stock to keep the name of it only  i take this indeed to be a french humour or a spice of it turned english and indeed we are famous for this that when we do mimic the french we generally do it to our hurt and overdo the french themselves  the french nation are eminent for making a fine outside when perhaps within they want necessaries and indeed a gay shop and a mean stock is something like the frenchman with his laced ruffles without a shirt i cannot but think a wellfurnished shop with a moderate outside is much better to a tradesman than a fine shop and few goods i am sure it will be much more to his satisfaction when he casts up his years account for his fine shop will weigh but sorrily in his account of profit and loss it is all a dead article it is sunk out of his first money before he makes a shilling profit and may be some years arecovering as trade may go with him  it is true that all these notions of mine in trade are founded upon the principle of frugality and good husbandry and this is a principle so disagreeable to the times and so contrary to the general practice that we shall find very few people to whom it is agreeable but let me tell my young tradesmen that if they must banish frugality and good husbandry they must at the same time banish all expectation of growing rich by their trade it is a maxim in commerce that money gets money and they that will not frugally lay up their gain in order to increase their gain must not expect to gain as they might otherwise do frugality may be out of fashion among the gentry but if it comes to be so among tradesmen we shall soon see that wealthy tradesmen will be hard to find for they who will not save as well as gain must expect to go out of trade as lean as they began  some people tell us indeed in many cases especially in trade that putting a good face upon things goes as far as the real merit of the things themselves and that a fine painted gilded shop among the rest has a great influence upon the people draws customers and brings trade and they run a great length in this discourse by satirising on the blindness and folly of mankind and how the world are to be taken in their own way and seeing they are to be deluded and imposed upon in such an innocent way they ought to be so far deluded and imposed upon alluding to the old proverbial saying si populus vult decipi decipiatur that it is no fraud no crime and can neither be against conscience nor prudence for if they are pleased with a show why should they not have it and the like  this way of talking is indeed plausible and were the fact true there might be more in it than i think there is but i do not grant that the world is thus to be deluded and that the people do follow this rule in generali mean go always to a fine shop to lay out their money perhaps in some cases it may be so where the women and the weakest of the sex too are chiefly concerned or where the fops and fools of the age resort and as to those few they that are willing to be so imposed upon let them have it  but i do not see that even this extends any farther than to a few toyshops and pastrycooks and the customers of both these are not of credit sufficient i think to weigh in this case we may as well argue for the fine habits at a puppetshow and a ropedancing because they draw the mob about them but i cannot think after you go but one degree above these the thing is of any weight much less does it bring credit to the tradesman whatever it may do to the shop  the credit of a tradesman respects two sorts of people first the merchants or wholesale men or makers who sell him his goods or the customers who come to his shop to buy  the first of these are so far from valuing him upon the gay appearance of his shop that they are often the first that take an offence at it and suspect his credit upon that account their opinion upon a tradesman and his credit with them is raised quite another way namely by his current pay diligent attendance and honest figure the gay shop does not help him at all there but rather the contrary  as to the latter though some customers may at first be drawn by the gay appearance and fine gilding and painting of a shop yet it is the well sorting a shop with goods and the selling good pennyworths that will bring trade especially after the shop has been open some time this and this only establishes the man and the credit of the shop  to conclude the credit raised by the fine show of things is also of a different kind from the substantial reputation of a tradesman it is rather the credit of the shop than of the man and in a word it is no more or less than a net spread to catch fools it is a bait to allure and deceive and the tradesman generally intends it so he intends that the customers shall pay for the gilding and painting his shop and it is the use he really makes of it namely that his shop looking like something eminent he may sell dearer than his neighbours who and what kind of fools can so be drawn in it is easy to describe but satire is none of our business here  on the contrary the customers who are the substantial dependence of a tradesmans shop are such as are gained and preserved by good usage good pennyworths good wares and good choice and a shop that has the reputation of these four like good wine that needs no bush needs no painting and gilding no carved works and ornaments31 it requires only a diligent master and a faithful servant and it will never want a trade  footnotes  29 in another place the author recommends a light stock as showing a nimble trade there can be little doubt that he is more reasonable here a considerable abundance of goods is certainly an attraction to a shop no doubt a tradesman with little capital would only be incurring certain ruin having a larger stock than he could readily pay for he must needs keep a small stock if he would have a chance at all of doing well in the world but this does not make it the less an advantage to a tradesman of good capital to keep an abundant and various stock of goods  30 it is really curious to find in this chapter the same contrast drawn between the old and the new style of fitting up shops and carrying on business as would be drawn at the present day by nine out of every ten common observers the notion that the shops of the past age were plain while those of the present are gaudy and that the tradesmen of a past age carried on all their business in a quiet way and with little expense is as strongly impressed on the minds of the present generation as it is here seen to have been on those of defoes contemporaries a hundred and twenty years ago although it is quite impossible that the notion can be just in both cases the truth probably is that in defoes time and at all former times there were conspicuous but not very numerous examples of finely decorated shops which seemed and really were very much of a novelty as well as a rather striking exception from the style in which such places in general were then and had for many years been furnished so far however from these proving as defoe anticipates a warning to future generations the general appearance of shops has experienced a vast improvement since those days and the thirdrate class are now probably as fine as the firstrate were at no distant period at the same time as in the reign of the first george we have now also a few shops fitted up in a style of extraordinary and startling elegance and thus forming that contrast with the general appearance of shops for the last forty years which makes old people and many others talk of all the past as homely and moderate and all the present as showy and expensive  31 the author seems here to carry his objections to decoration to an extreme good usage good pennyworths good wares and good choice are doubtless the four cardinal points of business but a handsome shop also goes a considerable way in attracting customers and is a principle which no prudent tradesman will despise     chapter xx  of the tradesmans keeping his books and casting up his shop   it was an ancient and laudable custom with tradesmen in england always to balance their accounts of stock and of profit and loss at least once every year and generally it was done at christmas or newyears tide when they could always tell whether they went backward or forward and how their affairs stood in the world and though this good custom is very much lost among tradesmen at this time yet there are a great many that do so still and they generally call it casting up shop to speak the truth the great occasion of omitting it has been from the many tradesmen who do not care to look into things and who fearing their affairs are not right care not to know how they go at all good or bad and when i see a tradesman that does not cast up once ayear i conclude that tradesman to be in very bad circumstances that at least he fears he is so and by consequence cares not to inquire  as casting up the shop is the way to know every year whether he goes backward or forward and is the tradesmans particular satisfaction so he must cast up his books too or else it will be very ominous to the tradesmans credit  now in order to doing this effectually once ayear it is needful the tradesman should keep his books always in order his daybook duly posted his cash duly balanced and all peoples accounts always fit for a view he that delights in his trade will delight in his books and as i said that he that will thrive must diligently attend his shop or warehouse and take up his delight there so i say now he must also diligently keep his books or else he will never know whether he thrives or no  exact keeping his books is one essential part of a tradesmans prosperity the books are the register of his estate the index of his stock all the tradesman has in the world must be found in these three articles or some of them  goods in the shop money in cash debts abroad  the shop will at any time show the first of these upon a small stop to cast it up the cashchest and billbox will show the second at demand and the ledger when posted will show the last so that a tradesman can at any time at a weeks notice cast up all these three and then examining his accounts to take the balance which is a real trying what he is worth in the world  it cannot be satisfactory to any tradesman to let his books go unsettled and uncast up for then he knows nothing of himself or of his circumstances in the world the books can tell him at any time what his condition is and will satisfy him what is the condition of his debts abroad  in order to his regular keeping his books several things might be said very useful for the tradesman to consider  i every thing done in the whole circumference of his trade must be set down in a book except the retail trade and this is clear if the goods are not in bulk then the money is in cash and so the substance will be always found either there or somewhere else for if it is neither in the shop nor in the cash nor in the books it must be stolen and lost  ii as every thing done must be set down in the books so it should be done at the very time of it all goods sold must be entered in the books before they are sent out of the house goods sent away and not entered are goods lost and he that does not keep an exact account of what goes out and comes in can never swear to his books or prove his debts if occasion calls for it  i am not going to set down rules here for bookkeeping or to teach the tradesman how to do it but i am showing the necessity and usefulness of doing it at all that tradesman who keeps no books may depend upon it he will ere long keep no trade unless he resolves also to give no credit he that gives no trust and takes no trust either by wholesale or by retail and keeps his cash all himself may indeed go on without keeping any books at all and has nothing to do when he would know his estate but to cast up his shop and his cash and see how much they amount to and that is his whole and neat estate for as he owes nothing so nobody is in debt to him and all his estate is in his shop but i suppose the tradesman that trades wholly thus is not yet born or if there ever were any such they are all dead  a tradesmans books like a christians conscience should always be kept clean and clear and he that is not careful of both will give but a sad account of himself either to god or man it is true that a great many tradesmen and especially shopkeepers understand but little of bookkeeping but it is as true that they all understand something of it or else they will make but poor work of shopkeeping  i knew a tradesman that could not write and yet he supplied the defect with so many ingenious knacks of his own to secure the account of what people owed him and was so exact doing it and then took such care to have but very short accounts with any body that he brought up his method to be every way an equivalent to writing and as i often told him with half the study and application that those things cost him he might have learned to write and keep books too he made notches upon sticks for all the middling sums and scored with chalk for lesser things he had drawers for every particular customers name which his memory supplied for he knew every particular drawer though he had a great many as well as if their faces had been painted upon them he had innumerable figures to signify what he would have written if he could and his shelves and boxes always put me in mind of the egyptian hieroglyphics and nobody understood them or any thing of them but himself  it was an odd thing to see him when a countrychap came up to settle accounts with him he would go to a drawer directly among such a number as was amazing in that drawer was nothing but little pieces of split sticks like laths with chalkmarks on them all as unintelligible as the signs of the zodiac are to an old schoolmistress that teaches the hornbook and primer or as arabic or greek is to a ploughman every stick had notches on one side for single pounds on the other side for tens of pounds and so higher and the length and breadth also had its signification and the colour too for they were painted in some places with one colour and in some places with anther by which he knew what goods had been delivered for the money and his way of casting up was very remarkable for he knew nothing of figures but he kept six spoons in a place on purpose near his counter which he took out when he had occasion to cast up any sum and laying the spoons in a row before him he counted upon them thus     one two three and another one odd spoon and tother        by this he told up to six if he had any occasion to tell any farther he began again as we do after the number ten in our ordinary numeration and by this method and running them up very quick he would count any number under thirtysix which was six spoons of six spoons and then by the strength of his head he could number as many more as he pleased multiplying them always by sixes but never higher  i give this instance to show how far the application of a mans head might go to supply the defect but principally to show and it does abundantly show it what an absolute necessity there is for a tradesman to be very diligent and exact in keeping his books and what pains those who understand their business will always take to do it  this tradesman was indeed a country shopkeeper but he was so considerable a dealer that he became mayor of the city which he lived in for it was a city and that a considerable city too and his posterity have been very considerable traders in the same city ever since and they show their greatgrandfathers six counting spoons and his hieroglyphics to this day  after some time the old tradesman bred up two of his sons to his business and the young men having learned to write brought books into the countinghouse things their father had never used before but the old man kept to his old method for all that and would cast up a sum and make up an account with his spoons and his drawers as soon as they could with their pen and ink if it were not too full of small articles and that he had always avoided in his business  however as i have said above this evidently shows the necessity of bookkeeping to a tradesman and the very nature of the thing evidences also that it must be done with the greatest exactness he that does not keep his books exactly and so as that he may depend upon them for charging his debtors had better keep no books at all but like my shopkeeper score and notch every thing for as books well kept make business regular easy and certain so books neglected turn all into confusion and leave the tradesman in a wood which he can never get out of without damage and loss if ever his dealers know that his books are ill kept they play upon him and impose horrid forgeries and falsities upon him whatever he omits they catch at and leave it out whatever they put upon him he is bound to yield to so that in short as books well kept are the security of the tradesmans estate and the ascertaining of his debts so books ill kept will assist every knavish customer or chapman to cheat and deceive him  some men keep a due and exact entry or journal of all they sell or perhaps of all they buy or sell but are utterly remiss in posting it forward to a ledger that is to say to another book where every parcel is carried to the debtors particular account likewise they keep another book where they enter all the money they receive but as above never keeping any account for the man there it stands in the cashbook and both these books must be ransacked over for the particulars as well of goods sold as of the money received when this customer comes to have his account made up and as the goods are certainly entered when sold or sent away and the money is certainly entered when it is received this they think is sufficient and all the rest superfluous  i doubt not such tradesmen often suffer as much by their slothfulness and neglect of bookkeeping as might especially if their business is considerable pay for a bookkeeper for what is such a mans case when his customer suppose a country dealer comes to town which perhaps he does once ayear as in the custom of other tradesmen and desires to have his account made up the london tradesman goes to his books and first he rummages his daybook back for the whole year and takes out the foot32 of all the parcels sent to his chapman and they make the debtor side of the account then he takes his cashbook if it deserves that name and there he takes out all the sums of money which the chapman has sent up or bills which he has received and these make the creditor side of the account and so the balance is drawn out and this man thinks himself a mighty good accountant that he keeps his books exactly and so perhaps he does as far as he keeps them at all that is to say he never sends a parcel away to his customer but he enters it down and never receives a bill from him but he sets it down when the money is paid but now take this man and his chap together as they are making up this account the chapman a sharp clever tradesman though a countryman has his pocketbook with him and in it a copy of his postingbook so the countrymen call a ledger where the london tradesmans accounts are copied out and when the city tradesman has drawn out his account he takes it to his inn and examines it by his little book and what is the consequence  if the city tradesman has omitted any of the bills which the country tradesman has sent him up he finds it out and is sure to put him in mind of it sir says he you had a bill from me upon mr ag at such a time for thirty pounds and i have your letter that you received the money but you have omitted it in the account so that i am not so much in your debt by thirty pounds as you thought i was  say you so says the city tradesman i cannot think but you must be mistaken  no no says the other i am sure i cant be mistaken for i have it in my book besides i can go to mr ag whom the bill was drawn upon and there is to be sure your own endorsement upon it and a receipt for the money  well says the citizen i keep my books as exact as any bodyill look again and if it be there i shall find it for i am sure if i had it it is in my cashbook  pray do then says the countryman for i am sure i sent it you and i am sure i can produce the bill if there be occasion  away goes the tradesman to his books which he pretends he keeps so exact and examining them over again he finds the bill for thirty pounds entered fairly but in his running the whole year over together as well he might he had overlooked it whereas if his cashbook had been duly posted every week as it ought to have been this bill had been regularly placed to account  but now observe the difference the bill for thirty pounds being omitted was no damage to the country tradesman because he has an account of it in his book of memorandums and had it regularly posted in his books at home whatever the other had and also was able to bring sufficient proof of the payment so the london tradesmans omission was no hurt to him  but the case differs materially in the debtor side of the account for here the tradesman who with all his boasts of keeping his books exactly has yet no ledger which being as i have said duly posted should show every mans account at one view and being done every week left it scarce possible to omit any parcel that was once entered in the daybook or journali say the tradesman keeping no ledger he looks over his daybook for the whole year past to draw up the debtor side of his customers account and there being a great many parcels truly he overlooks one or two of them or suppose but one of them and gives the chapman the account in which he sums up his debtor side so much suppose £136 10s the chapman examining this by his book as he did the cash finds two parcels one £7 15s and the other £9 13s omitted so that by his own book his debtor side was £153 18s but being a cunning sharp tradesman and withal not exceeding honest well well says he to himself if mr g says it is no more than £136 10s what have i to do to contradict him it is none of my business to keep his books for him it is time enough for me to reckon for it when he charges me so he goes back to him the next day and settles accounts with him pays him the balance in good bills which he brought up with him for that purpose takes a receipt in full of all accounts and demands to such a day of the month and the next day comes and looks out another parcel of goods and so begins an account for the next year like a current chapman and has the credit of an extraordinary customer that pays well and clears his accounts every year which he had not done had he not seen the advantage and so strained himself to pay that he might get a receipt in full of all accounts  it happens some years after that this city tradesman dies and his executors finding his accounts difficult to make up there being no books to be found but a daybook and a cashbook they get some skilful bookkeeper to look into them who immediately sees that the only way to bring the accounts to a head is to form a ledger out of the other two and post every bodys account into it from the beginning for though it were a long way back there is no other remedy  in doing this they come to this mistake among a great many others of the like kind in other chapmens accounts upon this they write to the chapman and tell him they find him debtor to the estate of the deceased in such a sum of money and desire him to make payment  the country shopkeeper huffs them tells them he always made up accounts with mr g the deceased once ayear as he did with all his other chapmen and that he took his receipt in full of all accounts and demands upon paying the balance to him at such a time which receipt he has to show and that he owes him nothing or but such a sum being the account of goods bought since  the executors finding the mistake and how it happened endeavour to convince him of it but it is all onehe wants no convincing for he knows at bottom how it is but being a little of a knave himself or if you please not a little he tells them he cannot enter into the accounts so far backmr g always told him he kept his books very exactly and he trusted to him and as he has his receipt in full and it is so long ago he can say nothing to it  from hence they come to quarrel and the executors threaten him with going to law but he bids them defiance and insists upon his receipt in full and besides that it is perhaps six years ago and so he tells them he will plead the statute of limitations upon them and then adds that he does not do it avoid a just debt but to avoid being imposed upon he not understanding books so well as mr g pretended to do and having balanced accounts so long ago with him he stands by the balance and has nothing to say to their mistakes not he so that in short not finding any remedy they are forced to sit down by the loss and perhaps in the course of twenty years trade mr g might lose a great many such parcels in the whole and had much better have kept a ledger or if he did not know how to keep a ledger himself had better have hired a bookkeeper to have come once aweek or once amonth to have posted his daybook for him  the like misfortune attends the not balancing his cash a thing which such bookkeepers as mr g do not think worth their trouble nor do they understand the benefit of it the particulars indeed of this article are tedious and would be too long for a chapter but certainly they that know any thing of the use of keeping an exact cashbook know that without it a tradesman can never be thoroughly satisfied either of his own not committing mistakes or of any people cheating him i mean servants or sons or whoever is the first about him  what i call balancing his cashbook is first the casting up daily or weekly or monthly his receipts and payments and then seeing what money is left in hand or as the usual expression of the tradesman is what money is in cash secondly the examining his money telling it over and seeing how much he has in his chest or bags and then seeing if it agrees with the balance of his book that what is and what should be correspond  and here let me give tradesmen a caution or two  1 never sit down satisfied with an error in the cash that is to say with a difference between the money really in the cash and the balance in the book for if they do not agree there must be a mistake somewhere and while there is a mistake in the cash the tradesman cannot at least he ought not to be easy he that can be easy with a mistake in his cash may be easy with a gang of thieves in his house for if his money does not come right he must have paid something that is not set down and that is to be supposed as bad as if it were lost or he must have somebody about him that can find the way to his money besides himself that is to say somebody that should not come to it and if so what is the difference between that and having a gang of thieves about himfor every one that takes money out of his cash without his leave and without letting him know it is so far a thief to him and he can never pretend to balance his cash nor indeed know any thing of his affairs that does not know which way his money goes  2 a tradesman endeavouring to balance his cash should no more be satisfied if he finds a mistake in his cash one way than anotherthat is to say if he finds more in cash than by the balance of his cashbook ought to be there than if he finds less or wanting in cash i know many who when they find it thus sit down satisfied and say well there is an error and i dont know where it lies but come it is an error on the right hand i have more cash in hand than i should have that is all so i am well enough let it go i shall find it some time or other but the tradesman ought to consider that he is quite in the dark and as he does not really know where it lies so for ought he knows the error may really be to his loss very considerablyand the case is very plain that it is as dangerous to be over as it would be to be under he should therefore never give it over till he has found it out and brought it to rights for example  if there appears to be more money in the cash than there is by the balance in the cashbook this must follownamely that some parcel of money must have been received which is not entered in the book now till the tradesman knows what sum of money this is that is thus not entered how can he tell but the mistake may be quite the other way and the cash be really wrong to his loss thus  my cashbook being cast up for the last month i find by the foot of the leaf there is cash remaining in hand to balance £176 10s 6d  to see if all things are right i go and tell my money over and there to my surprise i find £194 10s 6d in cash so that i have £18 there more than i should have now far from being pleased that i have more money by me than i should have my inquiry is plain how comes this to pass  perhaps i puzzle my head a great while about it but not being able to find out i sit down easy and satisfied and say well i dont much concern myself about it it is better to be so than £18 missing i cannot tell where it lies but let it lie where it will here is the money to make up the mistake when it appears  but how foolish is this how illgrounded the satisfaction and how weak am i to argue thus and please myself with the delusion for some months after it appears perhaps that whereas there was £38 entered received of mr bk the figure 3 was mistaken and set down for a figure of 5 for the sum received was £58 so that instead of having £18 more in cash than there ought to be i have 40s wanting in my cash which my son or my apprentice stole from me when they put in the money and made the mistake of the figures to puzzle the book that it might be some time before it should be discovered  upon the whole take it as a rule the tradesman ought to be as unsatisfied when he finds a mistake to his gain in his cash as when he finds it to his loss and it is every whit as dangerous nay it is the more suspicious because it seems to be laid as a bait for him to stop his mouth and to prevent further inquiries and it is on that account that i leave this caution upon record that the tradesman may be duly alarmed  the keeping a cashbook is one of the nicest parts of a tradesmans business because there is always the bag and the book to be brought together and if they do not exactly speak the same language even to a farthing there must be some omission and how big or how little that omission may be who knows or how shall it be known but by casting and recasting up telling and telling over and over again the money  if there is but twenty shillings over in the money the question is how came it there it must be received somewhere and of somebody more than is entered and how can the cashkeeper be he master or servant know but more was received with it which is not and should have been entered and so the loss may be the other way it is true in telling money there may have been a mistake and he that received a sum of money may have received twenty shillings too much or five pounds too muchand such a mistake i have known to be made in the paying and receiving of moneyand a mans cash has been more perplexed and his mind more distracted about it than the five pounds have been worth because he could not find it out till some accident has discovered it33 and the reason is because not knowing which way it could come there he could not know but some omission might be made to his loss another way as in the case above mentioned  i knew indeed a strong waterman who drove a very considerable trade but being an illiterate tradesman never balanced his cashbook for many years nor scarce posted his other books and indeed hardly understood how to do it but knowing his trade was exceedingly profitable and keeping his money all himself he was easy and grew rich apace in spite of the most unjustifiable and indeed the most intolerable negligence but lest this should be pleaded as an exception to my general rule and to invalidate the argument give me leave to add that though this man grew rich in spite of indolence and a neglect of his book yet when he died two things appeared which no tradesman in his wits would desire should be said of him  i the servants falling out and maliciously accusing one another had as it appeared by the affidavits of several of them wronged him of several considerable sums of money which they received and never brought into the books and others of sums which they brought into the books but never brought into the cash and others of sums which they took ready money in the shop and never set down either the goods in the daybook or the money into the cashbook and it was thought though he was so rich as not to feel it that is not to his hurt yet that he lost three or four hundred pounds ayear in that manner for the two or three last years of his life but his widow and son who came after him having the discovery made to them took better measures afterwards  ii he never did or could know what he was worth for the accounts in his books were never made up nor when he came to die could his executors make up any mans account so as to be able to prove the particulars and make a just demand of their debt but found a prodigious number of small sums of money paid by the debtors as by receipts in their books and on their files some by himself and some by his man which were never brought to account or brought into cash and his mans answer being still that he gave all to the master they could not tell how to charge him by the masters account because several sums which the master himself received were omitted being entered in the same manner so that all was confusion and neglect and though the man died rich it was in spite of that management that would have made any but himself have died poor  exact bookkeeping is to me the effect of a man whose heart is in his business and who intends to thrive he that cares not whether his books are kept well or no is in my opinion one that does not much care whether he thrives or no or else being in desperate circumstances knows it and that he cannot or does not thrive and so matters not which way it goes  it is true the neglect of the books is private and secret and is seldom known to any body but the tradesman himself at least till he comes to break and be a bankrupt and then you frequently hear them exclaim against him upon that very account break says one of the assignees how should he but breakwhy he kept no books you never saw books kept in such a scandalous manner in your life why he has not posted his cashbook for i know not how many months nor posted his daybook and journal at all except here and there an account that he perhaps wanted to know the balance of and as for balancing his cash i dont see any thing of that done i know not how long why this fellow could never tell how he went on or how things stood with him i wonder he did not break a long time ago  now the mans case was this he knew how to keep his books well enough perhaps and could write well enough and if you look into his five or six first years of trade you find all his accounts well kept the journal duly posted the cash monthly balanced but the poor man found after that that things went wrong that he went backwards and that all went downhill and he hated to look into his books as a profligate never looks into his conscience because he can see nothing there but what terrifies and affrights him makes him uneasy and melancholy so a sinking tradesman cares not to look into his books because the prospect there is dark and melancholy what signify the accounts to me says he i can see nothing in the books but debts that 1 cannot pay and debtors that will never pay i can see nothing there but how i have trusted my estate away like a fool and how i am to be ruined for my easiness and being a sot and this makes him throw them away and hardly post things enough to make up when folks call to pay or if he does post such accounts as he has money to receive from thats all and the rest lie at random till as i say the assignees come to reproach him with his negligence  whereas in truth the man understood his books well enough but had no heart to look in them no courage to balance them because of the afflicting prospect of them  but let me here advise tradesmen to keep a perfect acquaintance with their books though things are bad and discouraging it keeps them in full knowledge of what they are doing and how they really stand and it brings them sometimes to the just reflections on their circumstances which they ought to make so to stop in time as i hinted before and not let things run too far before they are surprised and torn to pieces by violence  and at the worst even a declining tradesman should not let his books be neglected if his creditors find them punctually kept to the last it will be a credit to him and they would see he was a man fit for business and i have known when that very thing has recommended a tradesman so much to his creditors that after the ruin of his fortunes some or other of them have taken him into business as into partnership or into employment only because they knew him to be qualified for business and for keeping books in particular  but if we should admonish the tradesman to an exact and regular care of his books even in his declining fortunes much more should it be his care in his beginning and before any disaster has befallen him i doubt not that many a tradesman has miscarried by the mistakes and neglect of his books for the losses that men suffer on that account are not easily set down but i recommend it to a tradesman to take exact care of his books as i would to every man to take care of his diet and temperate living in order to their health for though according to some we cannot by all our care and caution lengthen out life but that every one must and shall live their appointed time34 yet by temperance and regular conduct we may make that life more comfortable more agreeable and pleasant by its being more healthy and hearty so though the exactest bookkeeping cannot be said to make a tradesman thrive or that he shall stand the longer in his business because his profit and loss do not depend upon his books or the goodness of his debts depend upon the debtors accounts being well posted yet this must be said that the well keeping of his books may be the occasion of his trade being carried on with the more ease and pleasure and the more satisfaction by having numberless quarrels and contentions and lawsuits which are the plagues of a tradesmans life prevented and avoided which on the contrary often torment a tradesman and make his whole business be uneasy to him for want of being able to make a regular proof of things by his books  a tradesman without his books in case of a lawsuit for a debt is like a married woman without her certificate how many times has a woman been cast and her cause not only lost but her reputation and character exposed for want of being able to prove her marriage though she has been really and honestly married and has merited a good character all her days and so in trade many a debt has been lost many an account been perplexed by the debtor many a sum of money been recovered and actually paid over again especially after the tradesman has been dead for want of hits keeping his books carefully and exactly when he was alive by which negligence if he has not been ruined when he was living his widow and children have been ruined after his decease though had justice been done he had left them in good circumstances and with sufficient to support them  and this brings me to another principal reason why a tradesman should not only keep books but be very regular and exact in keeping them in order that is to say duly posted and all his affairs exactly and duly entered in his books and this is that if he should be surprised by sudden or unexpected sickness or death as many are and as all may be his accounts may not be left intricate and unsettled and his affairs thereby be perplexed  next to being prepared for death with respect to heaven and his soul a tradesman should be always in a state of preparation for death with respect to his books it is in vain that he calls for a scrivener or lawyer and makes a will when he finds a sudden summons sent him for the grave and calls his friends about him to divide and settle his estate if his business is in confusion below stairs his books out of order and his accounts unsettled to what purpose does he give his estate among his relations when nobody knows where to find it  as then the minister exhorts us to take care of our souls and make our peace with heaven while we are in a state of health and while life has no threatening enemies about it no diseases no fevers attending so let me second that advice to the tradesman always to keep his books in such a posture that if he should be snatched away by death his distressed widow and fatherless family may know what is left for them and may know where to look for it he may depend upon it that what he owes to any one they will come fast enough for and his widow and executrix will be pulled to pieces for it if she cannot and does not speedily pay it why then should he not put her in a condition to have justice done her and her children and to know how and of whom to seek for his just debts that she may be able to pay others and secure the remainder for herself and her children i must confess a tradesman not to leave his books in order when he dies argues him to be either  1 a very bad christian who had few or no thoughts of death upon him or that considered nothing of its frequent coming unexpected and sudden without warning or  2 a very unnatural relation without the affections of a father or a husband or even of a friend that should rather leave what he had to be swallowed up by strangers than leave his family and friends in a condition to find and to recover it  again it is the same case as in matters religious with respect to the doing this in time and while health and strength remain for as we say very well and with great reason that the work of eternity should not be left to the last moments that a deathbed is no place and a sick languishing body no condition and the last breath no time for repentance so i may add neither are these the place the condition nor the time to make up our accounts there is no posting the books on a deathbed or balancing the cashbook in a high fever can the tradesman tell you where his effects lie and to whom he has lent or trusted sums of money or large quantities of goods when he is delirious and lightheaded all these things must be done in time and the tradesman should take care that his books should always do this for him and then he has nothing to do but make his will and dispose of what he has and for the rest he refers them to his books to know where every thing is to be had  footnotes  32 the sum at the bottom or foot of the account  33 this reminds the editor of an amusing anecdote he has heard illustrative of the diseased accuracy as it may be called of a certain existing london merchant on reckoning up his household book one year he found that he had expended one penny more than was accounted for and there was accordingly an error to that extent in his reckoning the very idea of an error however trifling the amount gave him great uneasiness and he set himself with the greatest anxiety to discover if possible the occasion he employed the byhours of weeks in the vain attempt but at length having one day to cross waterloo bridge where there is a pontage of a penny for foot passengers he all at once to his inconceivable joy recollected having there disbursed the coin in question about a twelvemonth before  34 the correct doctrine is we may not by our utmost care and diligence avoid the causes of an early and premature death but he who acts according to the rules which promote health and avoids all things which tend to endanger it has a much better chance of living to the natural period appointed for human life than he who acts otherwisebesides as stated in the text making his life more agreeable the authors illustration would be more properly drawn if we were to say the tradesman by keeping exact accounts may not succeed in contending against certain unfavourable circumstances no more than the man who lives according to the just rules of nature may thereby succeed in eviting other evils that tend to cut short life but as the temperate man is most likely to be healthy so is the tradesman who keeps exact accounts most likely to thrive in business     chapter xxi  of the tradesman letting his wife be acquainted with his business   it must be acknowledged that as this chapter seems to be written in favour of the women it also seems to be an officious thankless benefaction to the wives for that as the tradesmans ladies now manage they are above the favour and put no value upon it on the contrary the women generally speaking trouble not their heads about it scorn to be seen in the counting house much less behind the counter despise the knowledge of their husbands business and act as if they were ashamed of being tradesmens wives and never intended to be tradesmens widows  if this chosen ignorance of theirs comes some time or other to be their loss and they find the disadvantage of it too late they may read their fault in their punishment and wish too late they had acted the humbler part and not thought it below them to inform themselves of what it is so much their interest to know this pride is indeed the great misfortune of tradesmens wives for as they lived as if they were above being owned for the tradesmans wife so when he dies they live to be the shame of the tradesmans widow they knew nothing how he got his estate when he was alive and they know nothing where to find it when he is dead this drives them into the hands of lawyers attorneys and solicitors to get in their effects who when they have got it often run away with it and leave the poor widow in a more disconsolate and perplexed condition than she was in before  it is true indeed that this is the womens fault in one respect and too often it is so in many since the common spirit is as i observed so much above the tradesmans condition but since it is not so with every body let me state the case a little for the use of those who still have ther senses about them and whose pride is not got so much above their reason as to let them choose to be tradesmens beggars rather than tradesmens widows  when the tradesman dies it is to be expected that what estate or effects he leaves is generally speaking dispersed about in many hands his widow if she is left executrix has the trouble of getting things together as well as she can if she is not left executrix she has not the trouble indeed but then it is looked upon that she is dishonoured in not having the trust when she comes to look into her affairs she is more or less perplexed and embarrassed as she has not or has acquainted herself or been made acquainted with her husbands affairs in his lifetime  if she has been one of those gay delicate ladies that valuing herself upon her being a gentlewoman and that thought it a step below herself when she married this mechanic thing called a tradesman and consequently scorned to come near his shop or warehouse and by consequence acquainting herself with any of his affairs35 or so much as where his effects lay which are to be her fortune for the futurei say if this has been her case her folly calls for pity now as her pride did for contempt before for as she was foolish in the first she may be miserable in the last part of it for now she falls into a sea of trouble she has the satisfaction of knowing that her husband has died as the tradesmen call it well to pass and that she is left well enough but she has at the same time the mortification of knowing nothing how to get it in or in what hands it lies the only relief she has is her husbands books and she is happy in that but just in proportion to the care he took in keeping them even when she finds the names of debtors she knows not who they are or where they dwell who are good and who are bad the only remedy she has here if her husband had ever a servant or apprentice who was so near out of his time as to be acquainted with the customers and with the books then she is forced to be beholden to him to settle the accounts for her and endeavour to get in the debts in return for which she is forced to give him his time and freedom and let him into the trade make him master of all the business in the world and it may be at last with all her pride has to take him for a husband and when her friends upbraid her with it that she should marry her apprentice boy when it may be she was old enough to be his mother her answer is why what could i do i see i must have been ruined else i had nothing but what lay abroad in debts scattered about the world and nobody but he knew how to get them in what could i do if i had not done it i must have been a beggar and so it may be she is at last too if the boy of a husband proves a brute to her as many do and as in such unequal matches indeed most such people do thus that pride which once set her above a kind diligent tender husband and made her scorn to stoop to acquaint herself with his affairs by which had she done it she had been tolerably qualified to get in her debts dispose of her shopgoods and bring her estate togetherthe same pride sinks her into the necessity of cringing to a scoundrel and taking her servant to be her master  this i mention for the caution of those ladies who stoop to marry men of business and yet despise the business they are maintained by that marry the tradesman but scorn the trade if madam thinks fit to stoop to the man she ought never to think herself above owning his employment and as she may upon occasion of his death be left to value herself upon it and to have at least her fortune and her childrens to gather up out of it she ought not to profess herself so unacquainted with it as not to be able to look into it when necessity obliges her  it is a terrible disaster to any woman to be so far above her own circumstances that she should not qualify herself to make the best of things that are left her or to preserve herself from being cheated and being imposed upon in former times tradesmens widows valued themselves upon the shop and trade or the warehouse and trade that were left them and at least if they did not carry on the trade in their own names they would keep it up till they put it off to advantage and often i have known a widow get from £300 to £500 for the goodwill as it is called of the shop and trade if she did not think fit to carry on the trade if she did the case turned the other way namely that if the widow did not put off the shop the shop would put off the widow and i may venture to say that where there is one widow that keeps on the trade now after a husbands decease there were ten if not twenty that did it then  but now the ladies are above it and disdain it so much that they choose rather to go without the prospect of a second marriage in virtue of the trade than to stoop to the mechanic low step of carrying on a trade and they have their reward for they do go without it and whereas they might in former times match infinitely to their advantage by that method now they throw themselves away and the trade too36  but this is not the case which i particularly aim at in this chapter if the women will act weakly and foolishly and throw away the advantages that he puts into their hands be that to them and it is their business to take care of that but i would have them have the opportunity put into their hands and that they may make the best of it if they please if they will not the fault is their own but to this end i say i would have every tradesman make his wife so much acquainted with his trade and so much mistress of the managing part of it that she might be able to carry it on if she pleased in case of his death if she does not please that is another case or if she will not acquaint herself with it that also is another case and she must let it alone but he should put it into her power or give her the offer of it  first he should do it for her own sake namely as before that she may make her advantage of it either for disposing herself and the shop together as is said above or for the more readily disposing the goods and getting in the debts without dishonouring herself as i have observed and marrying her prentice boy in order to take care of the effectsthat is to say ruining herself to prevent her being ruined  secondly he should do it for his childrens sake if he has any that if the wife have any knowledge of the business and has a son to breed up to it though he be not yet of age to take it up she may keep the trade for him and introduce him into it that so he may take the trouble off her hands and she may have the satisfaction of preserving the fathers trade for the benefit of his son though left too young to enter upon it at first  thus i have known many a widow that would have thought it otherwise below her has engaged herself in her husbandss business and carried it on purely to bring her eldest son up to it and has preserved it for him and which has been an estate to him whereas otherwise it must have been lost and he would have had the world to seek for a new business  this is a thing which every honest affectionate mother would or at least should be so willing to do for a son that she i think who would not ought not to marry a tradesman at all but if she would think herself above so important a trust for her own children she should likewise think herself above having children by a tradesman and marry somebody whose children she would act the mother for  but every widow is not so unnatural and i am willing to suppose the tradesman i am writing to shall be better married and therefore i give over speaking to the womans side and i will suppose the tradesmans wife not to be above her quality and willing to be made acquainted with her husbands affairs as well as to be helpful to him if she can as to be in a condition to be helpful to herself and her family if she comes to have occasion but then the difficulty often lies on the other side the question and the tradesman cares not to lay open his business to or acquaint his wife with it and many circumstances of the tradesman draw him into this snare for i must call it a snare both to him and to her  i the tradesman is foolishly vain of making his wife a gentlewoman and forsooth he will have her sit above in the parlour and receive visits and drink tea and entertain her neighbours or take a coach and go abroad but as to the business she shall not stoop to touch it he has apprentices and journeymen and there is no need of it  ii some trades indeed are not proper for the women to meddle in or custom has made it so that it would be ridiculous for the women to appear in their shops that is such as linen and woollen drapers mercers booksellers goldsmiths and all sorts of dealers by commission and the likecustom i say has made these trades so effectually shut out the women that what with custom and the womens generally thinking it below them we never or rarely see any women in those shops or warehouses  iii or if the trade is proper and the wife willing the husband declines it and shuts her outand this is the thing i complain of as an unjustice upon the woman but our tradesmen forsooth think it an undervaluing to them and to their business to have their wives seen in their shopsthat is to say that because other trades do not admit them therefore they will not have their trades or shops thought less masculine or less considerable than others and they will not have their wives be seen in their shops  iv but there are two sorts of husbands more who decline acquainting their wives with their business and those are 1 those who are unkind haughty and imperious who will not trust their wives because they will not make them useful that they may not value themselves upon it and make themselves as it were equal to their husbands a weak foolish and absurd suggestion as if the wife were at all exalted by it which indeed is just the contrary for the woman is rather humbled and made a servant by it or 2 the other sort are those who are afraid their wives should be let into the grand secret of allnamely to know that they are bankrupt and undone and worth nothing  all these considerations are foolish or fraudulent and in every one of them the husband is in the wrongnay they all argue very strongly for the wifes being in a due degree let into the knowledge of their business but the last indeed especially that she may be put into a posture to save him from ruin if it be possible or to carry on some business without him if he is forced to fail and fly as many have been when the creditors have encouraged the wife to carry on a trade for the support of her family and children when he perhaps may never show his head again  but let the mans case be what it will i think he can never call it a hard shift to let his wife into an acquaintance with his business if she desires it and is fit for it and especially in case of mortality that she may not be left helpless and friendless with her children when her husband is gone and when perhaps her circumstances may require it  i am not for a man setting his wife at the head of his business and placing himself under her like a journeyman like a certain chinaseller not far from the east india house who if any customers came into the shop that made a mean sorry figure would leave them to her husband to manage and attend them but if they looked like quality and people of fashion would come up to her husband when he was showing them his goods putting him by with a hold your tongue tom and let me talk i say it is not this kind or part that i would have the tradesmans wife let into but such and so much of the trade only as may be proper for her not ridiculous in the eye of the world and may make her assisting and helpful not governing to him and which is the main thing i am at such as should qualify her to keep up the business for herself and children if her husband should be taken away and she be left destitute in the world as many are  thus much i think it is hard a wife should not know and no honest tradesman ought to refuse it and above all it is a great pity the wives of tradesmen who so often are reduced to great inconvenience for want of it should so far withstand their own felicity as to refuse to be thus made acquainted with their business by which weak and foolish pride they expose themselves as i have observed to the misfortune of throwing the business away when they may come to want it and when the keeping it up might be the restoring of their family and providing for their children  for not to compliment tradesmen too much their wives are not all ladies nor are their children all born to be gentlemen trade on the contrary is subject to contingencies some begin poor and end rich others and those very many begin rich and end poor and there are innumerable circumstances which may attend a tradesmans family which may make it absolutely necessary to preserve the trade for his children if possible the doing which may keep them from misery and raise them all in the world and the want of it on the other hand sinks and suppresses them for example  a tradesman has begun the world about six or seven years he has by his industry and good understanding in business just got into a flourishing trade by which he clears five or six hundred pounds ayear and if it should please god to spare his life for twenty years or more he would certainly be a rich man and get a good estate but on a sudden and in the middle of all his prosperity he is snatched away by a sudden fit of sickness and his widow is left in a desolate despairing condition having five children and big with another but the eldest of these is not above six years old and though he is a boy yet he is utterly incapable to be concerned in the business so the trade which had his father lived to bring him up in his shop or warehouse would have been an estate to him is like to be lost and perhaps go all away to the eldest apprentice who however wants two years of his time now what is to be done for this unhappy family  done says the widow why i will never let the trade fall so that should be the making of my son and in the meantime be the maintenance of all my children  why what can you do child says her father or other friends you know nothing of it mr  did not acquaint you with his business  that is true says the widow he did not because i was a fool and did not care to look much into it and that was my fault mr  did not press me to it because he was afraid i might think he intended to put me upon it but he often used to say that if he should drop off before his boys were fit to come into the shop it would be a sad loss to themthat the trade would make gentlemen of a couple of them and it would be great pity it should go away from them  but what does that signify now child adds the father you see it is so and how can it be helped  why says the widow i used to ask him if he thought i could carry it on for them if such a thing should happen  and what answer did he make says the father  he shook his head replied the widow and answered yes i might if i had good servants and if i would look a little into it beforehand  why says the father he talked as if he had foreseen his end  i think he did foresee it says she for he was often talking thus  and why did you not take the hint then says her father and acquaint yourself a little with things that you might have been prepared for such an unhappy circumstance whatever might happen  why so i did says the widow and have done for above two years past he used to show me his letters and his books and i know where he bought every thing and i know a little of goods too when they are good and when bad and the prices also i know all the countrypeople he dealt with and have seen most of them and talked with them mr used to bring them up to dinner sometimes and he would prompt my being acquainted with them and would sometimes talk of his business with them at table on purpose that i might hear it and i know a little how to sell too for i have stood by him sometimes and seen the customers and him chaffer with one another  and did your husband like that you did so says the father  yes says she he loved to see me do it and often told me he did so and told me that if he were dead he believed i might carry on the trade as well as he  but he did not believe so i doubt says the father  i do not know as to that but i sold goods several times to some customers when he has been out of the way  and was he pleased with it when he came home did you do it to his mind  nay i have served a customer sometimes when he has been in the warehouse and he would go away to his countinghouse on purpose and say ill leave you and my wife to make the bargain and i have pleased the customer and him too  well says the father do you think you could carry on the trade  i believe i could if i had but an honest fellow of a journeyman for a year or two to write in the books and go abroad among customers  well you have two apprentices one of them begins to understand things very much and seems to be a diligent lad  he comes forward indeed and will be very useful if he does not grow too forward upon a supposition that i shall want him too much but it will be necessary to have a man to be above him for a while  well says the father we will see to get you such a one  in short they got her a man to assist to keep the books go to exchange and do the business abroad and the widow carried on the business with great application and success till her eldest son grew up and was first taken into the shop as an apprentice to his mother the eldest apprentice served her faithfully and was her journeyman four years after his time was out then she took him in partner to onefourth of the trade and when her son came of age she gave the apprentice one of her daughters and enlarged his share to a third gave her own son another third and kept a third for herself to support the family  thus the whole trade was preserved and the son and soninlaw grew rich in it and the widow who grew as skilful in the business as her husband was before her advanced the fortunes of all the rest of her children very considerably  this was an example of the husbands making the wife but a little acquainted with his business and if this had not been the case the trade had been lost and the family left just to divide what the father left which as they were seven of them mother and all would not have been considerable enough to have raised them above just the degree of having bread to eat and none to spare  i hardly need give any examples where tradesmen die leaving nourishing businesses and good trades but leaving their wives ignorant and destitute neither understanding their business nor knowing how to learn having been too proud to stoop to it when they had husbands and not courage or heart to do it when they have none the town is so full of such as these that this book can scarce fall into the hands of any readers but who will be able to name them among their own acquaintance  these indolent lofty ladies have generally the mortification to see their husbands trades catched up by apprentices or journeymen in the shop or by other shopkeepers in the neighbourhood and of the same business that might have enriched them and descended to their children to see their bread carried away by strangers and other families flourishing on the spoils of their fortunes  and this brings me to speak of those ladies who though they do perhaps for want of better offers stoop to wed a trade as we call it and take up with a mechanic yet all the while they are the tradesmens wives they endeavour to preserve the distinction of their fancied character carry themselves as if they thought they were still above their station and that though they were unhappily yoked with a tradesman they would still keep up the dignity of their birth and be called gentlewomen and in order to this would behave like such all the way whatever rank they were levelled with by the misfortune of their circumstances  this is a very unhappy and indeed a most unseasonable kind of pride and if i might presume to add a word here by way of caution to such ladies it should be to consider before they marry tradesmen the great disadvantages they lay themselves under in submitting to be a tradesmans wife but not putting themselves in a condition to take the benefit as well as the inconvenience of it for while they are above the circumstances of the tradesmans wife they are deprived of all the remedy against the miseries of a tradesmans widow and if the man dies and leaves them little or nothing but the trade to carry on and maintain them they being unacquainted with that are undone  a lady that stoops to marry a tradesman should consider the usage of england among the gentry and persons of distinction where the case is thus if a lady who has a title of honour suppose it be a countess or if she were a duchess it is all oneif i say she stoop to marry a private gentleman she ceases to rank for the future as a countess or duchess but must be content to be for the time to come what her husband can entitle her to and no other and excepting the courtesy of the people calling her my lady duchess or the countess she is no more than plain mrs such a one meaning the name of her husband and no other  thus if a baronets widow marry a tradesman in london she is no more my lady but plain mrs the drapers wife c the application of the thing is thus if the lady think fit to marry a mechanic say a glover or a cutler or whatever it is she should remember she is a glovers wife from that time and no more and to keep up her dignity when fortune has levelled her circumstances is but a piece of unseasonable pageantry and will do her no service at all the thing she is to inquire is what she must do if mr the glover or cutler should die whether she can carry on the trade afterwards or whether she can live without it if she find she cannot live without it it is her prudence to consider in time and so to acquaint herself with the trade that she may be able to do it when she comes to it  i do confess there is nothing more ridiculous than the double pride of the ladies of this age with respect to marrying what they call below their birth some ladies of good families though but of mean fortune are so stiff upon the point of honour that they refuse to marry tradesmen nay even merchants though vastly above them in wealth and fortune only because they are tradesmen or as they are pleased to call them though improperly mechanics and though perhaps they have not above £500 or £1000 to their portion scorn the man for his rank who does but turn round and has his choice of wives perhaps with two or three or four thousand pounds before their faces  the gentlemen of quality we see act upon quite another foot and i may say with much more judgment seeing nothing is more frequent than when any noble family are loaded with titles and honour rather than fortune they come down into the city and choose wives among the merchants and tradesmens daughters to raise their families and i am mistaken if at this time we have not several duchesses countesses and ladies of rank who are the daughters of citizens and tradesmen as the duchess of bedford of ae of wharton and others the countess of exeter of onslow and many more too many to name where it is thought no dishonour at all for those persons to have matched into rich families though not ennobled and we have seen many trading families lay the foundation of nobility by their wealth and opulenceas mr child for example afterwards sir josiah child whose posterity by his two daughters are now dukes of beaufort and of bedford and his grandson lord viscount castlemain and yet he himself began a tradesman and in circumstances very mean  but this stiffness of the ladies in refusing to marry tradesmen though it is weak in itself is not near so weak as the folly of those who first do stoop to marry thus and yet think to maintain the dignity of their birth in spite of the meanness of their fortune and so carrying themselves above that station in which providence has placed them disable themselves from receiving the benefit which their condition offers them upon any subsequent changes of their life  this extraordinary stiffness i have known has brought many a wellbred gentlewoman to misery and the utmost distress whereas had they been able to have stooped to the subsequent circumstances of life which providence also thought fit to make their lot they might have lived comfortably and plentifully all their days  it is certainly every ladys prudence to bring her spirit down to her condition and if she thinks fit or it is any how her lot to marry a tradesman which many ladies of good families have found it for their advantage to doi say if it be her lot she should take care she does not make that a curse to her which would be her blessing by despising her own condition and putting herself into a posture not to enjoy it  in all this i am to be understood to mean that unhappy temper which i find so much among the tradesmans wives at this time of being above taking any notice of their husbands affairs as if nothing were before them but a constant settled state of prosperity and it were impossible for them to taste any other fortune whereas that very hour they embark with a tradesman they ought to remember that they are entering a state of life full of accidents and hazards and that innumerable families in as good circumstances as theirs fall every day into disasters and misfortunes and that a tradesmans condition is liable to more casualties than any other life whatever  how many widows of tradesmen nay and wives of broken and ruined tradesmen do we daily see recover themselves and their shattered families when the man has been either snatched away by death or demolished by misfortunes and has been forced to fly to the east or west indies and forsake his family in search of bread  women when once they give themselves leave to stoop to their own circumstances and think fit to rouse up themselves to their own relief are not so helpless and shiftless creatures as some would make them appear in the world and we see whole families in trade frequently recovered by their industry but then they are such women as can stoop to it and can lay aside the particular pride of their first years and who without looking back to what they have been can be content to look into what providence has brought them to be and what they must infallibly be if they do not vigorously apply to the affairs which offer and fall into the business which their husbands leave them the introduction to and do not level their minds to their condition it may indeed be hard to do this at first but necessity is a spur to industry and will make things easy where they seem difficult and this necessity will humble the minds of those whom nothing else could make to stoop and where it does not it is a defect of the understanding as well as of prudence and must reflect upon the senses as well as the morals of the person  footnotes  35 most of the wives of tradesmen above a certain rather humble condition would now smile at the idea of their being expected to attend their husbands shops in order to form an intimate acquaintance with their affairs doubtless however in the days of defoe when the capitals of tradesmen were less when provision for widows by insurance upon lives was not practised and when the comparative simplicity of the modes of conducting business admitted it a female in that situation would only be exercising a prudent caution and doing nothing in the least inconsistent with the delicacy of her sex in obeying the rules laid down in the text  36 the number of widows or at least females carrying on trade in england is still very considerable in scotland it is a comparatively rare case a native of the northern part of the island is apt to be strongly impressed with this fact when in the large manufacturing towns of england he sees female names in so many cases inscribed upon the waggons used in the transport of goods the complaint in the text that females have to such an extent ceased to carry on the business of their deceased husbands is probably like many other complaints of the same kind already pointed out merely a piece of querulousness on the part of our author or the result of a very common mental deception     chapter xxii  of the dignity of trade in england more than in other countries   it is said of england by way of distinction and we all value ourselves upon it that it is a trading country and king charles ii who was perhaps that prince of all the kings that ever reigned in england that best understood the country and the people that he governed used to say that the tradesmen were the only gentry in england his majesty spoke it merrily but it had a happy signification in it such as was peculiar to the bright genius of that prince who though he was not the best governor was the best acquainted with the world of all the princes of his age if not of all the men in it and though it be a digression give me leave after having quoted the king to add three short observations of my own in favour of england and of the people and trade of it and yet without the least partiality to our own country  i we are not only a trading country but the greatest trading country in the world  ii our climate is the most agreeable climate in the world to live in  iii our englishmen are the stoutest and best men i mean what we call men of their hands in the world  these are great things to advance in our own favour and yet to pretend not to be partial too and therefore i shall give my reasons which i think support my opinion and they shall be as short as the heads themselves that i may not go too much off from my subject  1 we are the greatest trading country in the world because we have the greatest exportation of the growth and product of our land and of the manufacture and labour of our people and the greatest importation and consumption of the growth product and manufactures of other countries from abroad of any nation in the world37  2 our climate is the best and most agreeable because a man can be more out of doors in england than in other countries this was king charles iis reason for it and i cannot name it without doing justice to his majesty in it  3 our men are the stoutest and best because strip them naked from the waist upwards and give them no weapons at all but their hands and heels and turn them into a room or stage and lock them in with the like number of other men of any nation man for man and they shall beat the best men you shall find in the world  from this digression which i hope will not be disagreeable as it is not very tedious i come back to my first observation that england is a trading country and two things i offer from that head  first our tradesmen are not as in other countries the meanest of our people  secondly some of the greatest and best and most flourishing families among not the gentry only but even the nobility have been raised from trade owe their beginning their wealth and their estates to trade and i may add  thirdly those families are not at all ashamed of their original and indeed have no occasion to be ashamed of it  it is true that in england we have a numerous and an illustrious nobility and gentry and it is true also that not so many of those families have raised themselves by the sword as in other nations though we have not been without men of fame in the field too  but trade and learning have been the two chief steps by which our gentlemen have raised their relations and have built their fortunes and from which they have ascended up to the prodigious height both in wealth and number which we see them now risen to  as so many of our noble and wealthy families are raised by and derive from trade so it is true and indeed it cannot well be otherwise that many of the younger branches of our gentry and even of the nobility itself have descended again into the spring from whence they flowed and have become tradesmen and thence it is that as i said above our tradesmen in england are not as it generally is in other countries always of the meanest of our people  indeed i might have added here that trade itself in england is not as it generally is in other countries the meanest thing the men can turn their hand to but on the contrary trade is the readiest way for men to raise their fortunes and families and therefore it is a field for men of figure and of good families to enter upon  nb by trade we must be understood to include navigation and foreign discoveries because they are generally speaking all promoted and carried on by trade and even by tradesmen as well as merchants and the tradesmen are at this time as much concerned in shipping as owners as the merchants only the latter may be said to be the chief employers of the shipping  having thus done a particular piece of justice to ourselves in the value we put upon trade and tradesmen in england it reflects very much upon the understanding of those refined heads who pretend to depreciate that part of the nation which is so infinitely superior in number and in wealth to the families who call themselves gentry or quality and so infinitely more numerous  as to the wealth of the nation that undoubtedly lies chiefly among the trading part of the people and though there are a great many families raised within few years in the late war by great employments and by great actions abroad to the honour of the english gentry yet how many more families among the tradesmen have been raised to immense estates even during the same time by the attending circumstances of the war such as the clothing the paying the victualling and furnishing c both army and navy and by whom have the prodigious taxes been paid the loans supplied and money advanced upon all occasions by whom are the banks and companies carried onand on whom are the customs and excises levied have not the trade and tradesmen born the burden of the warand do they not still pay four millions ayear interest for the public debts on whom are the funds levied and by whom the public credit supported is not trade the inexhausted fund of all funds and upon which all the rest depend  as is the trade so in proportion are the tradesmen and how wealthy are tradesmen in almost all the several parts of england as well as in london how ordinary is it to see a tradesman go off the stage even but from mere shopkeeping with from ten to forty thousand pounds estate to divide among his familywhen on the contrary take the gentry in england from one end to the other except a few here and there what with excessive high living which is of late grown so much into a disease and the other ordinary circumstances of families we find few families of the lower gentry that is to say from six or seven hundred ayear downwards but they are in debt and in necessitous circumstances and a great many of greater estates also  on the other hand let any one who is acquainted with england look but abroad into the several counties especially near london or within fifty miles of it how are the ancient families worn out by time and family misfortunes and the estates possessed by a new race of tradesmen grown up into families of gentry and established by the immense wealth gained as i may say behind the counter that is in the shop the warehouse and the countinghouse how are the sons of tradesmen ranked among the prime of the gentry how are the daughters of tradesmen at this time adorned with the ducal coronets and seen riding in the coaches of the best of our nobility nay many of our trading gentlemen at this time refuse to be ennobled scorn being knighted and content themselves with being known to be rated among the richest commoners in the nation and it must be acknowledged that whatever they be as to courtbreeding and to manners they generally speaking come behind none of the gentry in knowledge of the world  at this very day we see the son of sir thomas scawen matched into the ducal family of bedford and the son of sir james bateman into the princely house of marlborough both whose ancestors within the memory of the writer of these sheets were tradesmen in london the first sir william scawens apprentice and the latters grandfather a porter upon or near london bridge  how many noble seats superior to the palaces of sovereign princes in some countries do we see erected within few miles of this city by tradesmen or the sons of tradesmen while the seats and castles of the ancient gentry like their families look worn out and fallen into decay witness the noble house of sir john eyles himself a merchant at giddyhall near rumford sir gregory page on blackheath the son of a brewer sir nathaniel mead near wealgreen his father a linendraper with many others too long to repeat and to crown all the lord castlemains at wanstead his father sir josiah child originally a tradesman  it was a smart but just repartee of a london tradesman when a gentleman who had a good estate too rudely reproached him in company and bade him hold his tongue for he was no gentleman no sir says he but i can buy a gentleman and therefore i claim a liberty to speak among gentlemen  again in how superior a port or figure as we now call it do our tradesmen live to what the middling gentry either do or can support an ordinary tradesman now not in the city only but in the country shall spend more money by the year than a gentleman of four or five hundred pounds ayear can do and shall increase and lay up every year too whereas the gentleman shall at the best stand stock still just where he began nay perhaps decline and as for the lower gentry from a hundred pounds ayear to three hundred or thereabouts though they are often as proud and high in their appearance as the otheras to them i say a shoemaker in london shall keep a better house spend more money clothe his family better and yet grow rich too it is evident where the difference lies an estates a pond but a trades a spring the first if it keeps full and the water wholesome by the ordinary supplies and drains from the neighbouring grounds it is well and it is all that is expected but the other is an inexhausted current which not only fills the pond and keeps it full but is continually running over and fills all the lower ponds and places about it  this being the case in england and our trade being so vastly great it is no wonder that the tradesmen in england fill the lists of our nobility and gentry no wonder that the gentlemen of the best families marry tradesmens daughters and put their younger sons apprentices to tradesmen and how often do these younger sons come to buy the elder sons estates and restore the family when the elder and head of the house proving rakish and extravagant has wasted his patrimony and is obliged to make out the blessing of israels family where the younger son bought the birthright and the elder was doomed to serve him  trade is so far here from being inconsistent with a gentleman that in short trade in england makes gentlemen and has peopled this nation with gentlemen for after a generation or two the tradesmens children or at least their grandchildren come to be as good gentlemen statesmen parliamentmen privycounsellors judges bishops and noblemen as those of the highest birth and the most ancient families and nothing too high for them thus the late earl of haversham was originally a merchant the late secretary craggs was the son of a barber the present lord castlemains father was a tradesman the greatgrandfather of the present duke of bedford the same and so of several others nor do we find any defect either in the genius or capacities of the posterity of tradesmen arising from any remains of mechanic blood which it is pretended should influence them but all the gallantry of spirit greatness of soul and all the generous principles that can be found in any of the ancient families whose blood is the most untainted as they call it with the low mixtures of a mechanic race are found in these and as is said before they generally go beyond them in knowledge of the world which is the best education  we see the tradesmen of england as they grow wealthy coming every day to the heralds office to search for the coatsofarms of their ancestors in order to paint them upon their coaches and engrave them upon their plate embroider them upon their furniture or carve them upon the pediments of their new houses and how often do we see them trace the registers of their families up to the prime nobility or the most ancient gentry of the kingdom  in this search we find them often qualified to raise new families if they do not descend from old as was said of a certain tradesman of london that if he could not find the ancient race of gentlemen from which he came he would begin a new race who should be as good gentlemen as any that went before them they tell us a story of the old lord craven who was afterwards created earl of craven by king charles ii that being upbraided with his being of an upstart nobility by the famous aubery earl of oxford who was himself of the very ancient family of the veres earls of oxford the lord craven told him he craven would cap pedigrees with him oxford for a wager the earl of oxford laughed at the challenge and began reckoning up his famous ancestors who had been earls of oxford for a hundred years past and knights for some hundreds of years more but when my lord craven began he read over his family thusi am william lord craven my father was lord mayor of london and my grandfather was the lord knows who wherefore i think my pedigree as good as yours my lord the story was merry enough but is to my purpose exactly for let the grandfather be who he would his father sir william craven who was lord mayor of london was a wholesale grocer and raised the family by trade and yet nobody doubts but that the family of craven is at this day as truly noble in all the beauties which adorn noble birth and blood as can be desired of any family however ancient or anciently noble  in italy and especially at venice we see every day the sons of merchants and other trades who grow in wealth and estates and can advance for the service of their country a considerable sum of money namely 60000 to 100000 dollars are accepted to honour by the senate and translated into the list of the nobility without any regard to the antiquities of their families or the nobility of blood and in all ages the best kings and sovereign princes have thought fit to reward the extraordinary merit of their subjects with titles of honour and to rank men among their nobility who have deserved it by good and great actions whether their birth and the antiquity of their families entitled them to it or not  thus in the late wars between england and france how was our army full of excellent officers who went from the shop and from behind the counter into the camp and who distinguished themselves there by their merit and gallant behaviour and several such came to command regiments and even to be general officers and to gain as much reputation in the service as any as colonel pierce wood richards and several others that might be named  all this confirms what i have said before namely that trade in england neither is nor ought to be levelled with what it is in other countries nor the tradesmen depreciated as they are abroad and as some of our gentry would pretend to do in england but that as many of our best families rose from trade so many branches of the best families in england under the nobility have stooped so low as to be put apprentices to tradesmen in london and to set up and follow those trades when they have come out of their times and have thought it no dishonour to their blood  to bring this once more home to the ladies who are so scandalised at that mean step which they call it of marrying a tradesmanit may be told them for their humiliation that however they think fit to act sometimes those tradesmen come of better families than their own and oftentimes when they have refused them to their loss those very tradesmen have married ladies of superior fortune to them and have raised families of their own who in one generation have been superior to those nice ladies both in dignity and estate and have to their great mortification been ranked above them upon all public occasions  the word tradesman in england does not sound so harsh as it does in other countries and to say a gentlemantradesman is not so much nonsense as some people would persuade us to reckon it and indeed as trade is now flourishing in england and increasing and the wealth of our tradesmen is already so great it is very probable a few years will show us still a greater race of tradebred gentlemen than ever england yet had  the very name of an english tradesman will and does already obtain in the world and as our soldiers by the late war gained the reputation of being some of the best troops in the world and our seamen are at this day and very justly too esteemed the best sailors in the world so the english tradesmen may in a few years be allowed to rank with the best gentlemen in europe and as the prophet isaiah said of the merchants of tyre that her traffickers were the honourable of the earth isaiah xxiii 8  in the meantime it is evident their wealth at this time outdoes that of the like rank of any nation in europe and as their number is prodigious so is their commerce for the inland commerce of englandand it is of those tradesmen or traffickers that i am now speaking in particularis certainly the greatest of its kind of any in the world nor is it possible there should ever be any like it the consumption of all sorts of goods both of our own manufacture and of foreign growth being so exceeding great  if the english nation were to be nearly inquired into and its present opulence and greatness duly weighed it would appear that as the figure it now makes in europe is greater than it ever made beforetake it either in king edward iiis reign or in queen elizabeths which were the two chief points of time when the english fame was in its highest extenti say if its present greatness were to be duly weighed there is no comparison in its wealth the number of its people the value of its lands the greatness of the estates of its private inhabitants and in consequence of all this its real strength is infinitely beyond whatever it was before and if it were needful i could fill up this work with a very agreeable and useful inquiry into the particulars  but i content myself with turning it to the case in hand for the truth of fact is not to be disputedi say i turn it to the case in hand thus whence comes it to be sohow is it produced war has not done it no nor so much as helped or assisted to it it is not by any martial exploits we have made no conquests abroad added no new kingdoms to the british empire reduced no neighbouring nations or extended the possession of our monarchs into the properties of others we have grained nothing by war and encroachment we are butted and bounded just where we were in queen elizabeths time the dutch the flemings the french are in view of us just as they were then we have subjected no new provinces or people to our government and with few or no exceptions we are almost for dominion where king edward i left us nay we have lost all the dominions which our ancient kings for some hundreds of years held in francesuch as the rich and powerful provinces of normandy poictou gascoigne bretagne and acquitaine and instead of being enriched by war and victory on the contrary we have been torn in pieces by civil wars and rebellions as well in ireland as in england and that several times to the ruin of our richest families and the slaughter of our nobility and gentry nay to the destruction even of monarchy itself and this many years at a time as in the long bloody wars between the houses of lancaster and york the many rebellions of the irish as well in queen elizabeths time as in king charles is time and the fatal massacre and almost extirpation of the english name in that kingdom and at last the late rebellion in england in which the monarch fell a sacrifice to the fury of the people and monarchy itself gave way to tyranny and usurpation for almost twenty years  these things prove abundantly that the rising greatness of the british nation is not owing to war and conquests to enlarging its dominion by the sword or subjecting the people of other countries to our power but it is all owing to trade to the increase of our commerce at home and the extending it abroad  it is owing to trade that new discoveries have been made in lands unknown and new settlements and plantations made new colonies placed and new governments formed in the uninhabited islands and the uncultivated continent of america and those plantings and settlements have again enlarged and increased the trade and thereby the wealth and power of the nation by whom they were discovered and planted we have not increased our power or the number of our subjects by subduing the nations which possessed those countries and incorporating them into our own but have entirely planted our colonies and peopled the countries with our own subjects natives of this island and excepting the negroes which we transport from africa to america as slaves to work in the sugar and tobacco plantations all our colonies as well in the islands as on the continent of america are entirely peopled from great britain and ireland and chiefly the former the natives having either removed farther up into the country or by their own folly and treachery raising war against us been destroyed and cut off  as trade alone has peopled those countries so trading with them has raised them also to a prodigy of wealth and opulence and we see now the ordinary planters at jamaica and barbadoes rise to immense estates riding in their coaches and six especially at jamaica with twenty or thirty negroes on foot running before them whenever they please to appear in public  as trade has thus extended our colonies abroad so it has except those colonies kept our people at home where they are multiplied to that prodigious degree and do still continue to multiply in such a manner that if it goes on so time may come that all the lands in england will do little more than serve for gardens for them and to feed their cows and their corn and cattle be supplied from scotland and ireland  what is the reason that we see numbers of french and of scots and of germans in all the foreign nations in europe and especially filling up their armies and courts and that you see few or no english there  what is the reason that when we want to raise armies or to man navies in england we are obliged to press the seamen and to make laws and empower the justices of the peace and magistrates of towns to force men to go for soldiers and enter into the service or allure them by giving bountymoney as an encouragement to men to list themselveswhereas the people of other nations and even the scots and irish travel abroad and run into all the neighbour nations to seek service and to be admitted into their pay  what is it but tradethe increase of business at home and the employment of the poor in the business and manufactures of this kingdom by which the poor get so good wages and live so well that they will not list for soldiers and have so good pay in the merchants service that they will not serve on board the ships of war unless they are forced to do it  what is the reason that in order to supply our colonies and plantations with people besides the encouragement given in those colonies to all people that will come there to plant and to settle we are obliged to send away thither all our petty offenders and all the criminals that we think fit to spare from the gallows besides what we formerly called the kidnapping tradethat is to say the arts made use of to wheedle and draw away young vagrant and indigent people and people of desperate fortunes to sell themselvesthat is bind themselves for servants the numbers of which are very great  it is poverty fills armies mans navies and peoples colonies in vain the drums beat for soldiers and the kings captains invite seamen to serve in the armies for fivepence aday and in the royal navy for twentythree shillings per month in a country where the ordinary labourer can have nine shillings aweek for his labour and the manufacturers earn from twelve to sixteen shillings aweek for their work and while trade gives thirty shillings per month wages to the seamen on board merchant ships men will always stay or go as the pay gives them encouragement and this is the reason why it has been so much more difficult to raise and recruit armies in england than it has been in scotland and ireland france and germany  the same trade that keeps our people at home is the cause of the well living of the people here for as frugality is not the national virtue of england so the people that get much spend much and as they work hard so they live well eat and drink well clothe warm and lodge softin a word the working manufacturing people of england eat the fat and drink the sweet live better and fare better than the working poor of any other nation in europe they make better wages of their work and spend more of the money upon their backs and bellies than in any other country this expense of the poor as it causes a prodigious consumption both of the provisions and of the manufactures of our country at home so two things are undeniably the consequence of that part  1 the consumption of provisions increases the rent and value of the lands and this raises the gentlemens estates and that again increases the employment of people and consequently the numbers of them as well those who are employed in the husbandry of land breeding and feeding of cattle c as of servants in the gentlemens families who as their estates increase in value so they increase their families and equipages  2 as the people get greater wages so they i mean the same poorer part of the people clothe better and furnish better and this increases the consumption of the very manufactures they make then that consumption increases the quantity made and this creates what we call inland trade by which innumerable families are employed and the increase of the people maintained and by which increase of trade and people the present growing prosperity of this nation is produced  the whole glory and greatness of england then being thus raised by trade it must be unaccountable folly and ignorance in us to lessen that one article in our own esteem which is the only fountain from whence we all take us as a nation are raised and by which we are enriched and maintained the scripture says speaking of the riches and glory of the city of tyrewhich was indeed at that time the great port or emporium of the world for foreign commerce from whence all the silks and fine manufactures of persia and india were exported all over the western worldthat her merchants were princes and in another place by thy traffic thou hast increased thy riches ezek xxviii 5 certain it is that our traffic has increased our riches and it is also certain that the flourishing of our manufactures is the foundation of all our traffic as well our merchandise as our inland trade  the inland trade of england is a thing not easily described it would in a word take up a whole book by itself it is the foundation of all our wealth and greatness it is the support of all our foreign trade and of our manufacturing and as i have hitherto written of the tradesmen who carry it on i shall proceed with a brief discourse of the trade itself  footnotes  37 we have here a pleasing trait of the superior sagacity of defoe in as far as it was a prevalent notion down to his time and even later nor is it perhaps altogether extinguished yet that the prosperity of a country was marked by its excess of exports over imports defoe justly ranks the amount of importation on a level with that of exportation as indicative of the wellbeing of the country     chapter xxiii  of the inland trade of england its magnitude and the great advantage it is to the nation in general   i have in a few words described what i mean by the inland trade of england in the introduction to this work it is the circulation of commerce among ourselves  i for the carrying on our manufactures of several kinds in the several counties where they are made and the employing the several sorts of people and trades needful for the said manufactures  ii for the raising and vending provisions of all kinds for the supply of the vast numbers of people who are employed every where by the said manufactures  iii for the importing and bringing in from abroad all kinds of foreign growth and manufactures which we want  iv for the carrying about and dispersing as well our own growth and manufactures as the foreign imported growth and manufactures of other nations to the retailer and by them to the last consumer which is the utmost end of all trade and this in every part to the utmost corner of the island of great britain and ireland  this i call inland trade and these circulators of goods and retailers of them to the last consumer are those whom we are to understand by the word tradesmen in all the parts of this work for as i observed in the beginning the ploughmen and farmers who labour at home and the merchant who imports our merchandise from abroad are not at all meant or included and whatever i have been saying except where they have been mentioned in particular and at length  this inland trade is in itself at this time the wonder of all the world of trade nor is there any thing like it now in the world much less that exceeds it or perhaps ever will be except only what itself may grow up to in the ages to come for as i have said on all occasions it is still growing and increasing  by this prodigy of a trade all the vast importation from our own colonies is circulated and dispersed to the remotest corner of the island whereby the consumption is become so great and by which those colonies are so increased and are become so populous and so wealthy as i have already observed of them this importation consists chiefly of sugars and tobacco of which the consumption in great britain is scarcely to be conceived of besides the consumption of cotton indigo rice ginger pimento or jamaica pepper cocoa or chocolate rum and molasses trainoil saltfish whalefin all sorts of furs abundance of valuable drugs pitch tar turpentine deals masts and timber and many other things of smaller value all which besides the employing a very great number of ships and english seamen occasion again a very great exportation of our own manufactures of all sorts to those colonies which being circulated again for consumption there that circulation is to be accounted a branch of home or inland trade as those colonies are on all such occasions esteemed as a branch of part of ourselves and of the british government in the world  this trade to our west indies and american colonies is very considerable as it employs so many ships and sailors and so much of the growth of those colonies is again exported by us to other parts of the world over and above what is consumed among us at home and also as all those goods and a great deal of money in specie is returned hither for and in balance of our own manufactures and merchandises exported thitheron these accounts some have insisted that more real wealth is brought into great britain every year from those colonies than is brought from the spanish west indies to old spain notwithstanding the extent of their dominion is above twenty times as much and notwithstanding the vast quantity of gold and silver which they bring from the mines of mexico and the mountains of potosi38  whether these people say true or no is not my business to inquire here though if i may give my opinion i must acknowledge that i believe they do but be it so or not it is certain that it is an infinitely extended trade and daily increasing and much of it if not all is and ought to be esteemed as an inland trade because as above it is a circulation among ourselves  as the manufactures of england particularly those of wool cotton wool included and of silk are the greatest and amount to the greatest value of any single manufacture in europe39 so they not only employ more people but those people gain the most money that is to say have the best wages for their work of any people in the world and yet which is peculiar to england the english manufactures are allowing for their goodness the cheapest at market of any in the world too even france itself after all the pains they are at to get our wool and all the expense they have been at to imitate our manufactures by getting over our workmen and giving them even greater wages than they had here have yet made so little proficiency in it and are so far from outselling us in foreign markets that they still in spite of the strictest prohibitions send hither and to holland and germany for english broadcloths druggets duroys flannels serges and several other sorts of our goods to supply their own nor can they clothe themselves to their satisfaction with their own goods but if any french gentleman of quality comes over hither from france he is sure to bring no more coats with him than backs but immediately to make him new clothes as soon as he arrives and to carry as many new suits home with him at his return as he can get leave to bring ashore when he comes therea demonstration that our manufacture exceeds theirs after all their boasts of it both in goodness and in cheapness even by their own confession but i am not now to enter upon the particular manufactures but the general trade in the manufacture this particular being a trade of such a magnitude it is to be observed for our purpose that the greatness of it consists of two parts  1 the consumption of it at home including our own plantations and factories  2 the exportation of it to foreign parts exclusive of the said plantations and factories  it is the first of these which is the subject of my present discourse because the tradesmen to whom and for whose instruction these chapters are designed are the people principally concerned in the making all these manufactures and wholly and solely concerned in dispersing and circulating them for the home consumption and this with some additions as explained above i call inland trade  the homeconsumption of our own goods as it is very great so it has one particular circumstance attending it which exceedingly increases it as a trade and that is that besides the numbers of people which it employs in the raising the materials and making the goods themselves as a manufacturei say besides all this there are multitudes of people employed cattle maintained with waggons and carts for the service on shore barges and boats for carriage in the rivers and ships and barks for carrying by sea and all for the circulating these manufactures from one place to another for the consumption of them among the people  so that in short the circulation of the goods is a business not equal indeed but bearing a very great proportion to the trade itself  this is owing to another particular circumstance of our manufacture and perhaps is not so remarkably the case of any other manufacture or country in europe namely that though all our manufactures are used and called for by almost all the people and that in every part of the whole british dominion yet they are made and wrought in their several distinct and respective countries in britain and some of them at the remotest distance from one another hardly any two manufactures being made in one place for example  the broadcloth and druggets in wilts gloucester and worcestershire serges in devon and somersetshire narrowcloths in yorkshire and staffordshire kerseys cottons halfthicks duffields plains and coarser things in lancashire and westmoreland shalloons in the counties of northampton berks oxford southampton and york womensstuffs in norfolk linseywoolseys c at kidderminster dimmeties and cottonwares at manchester flannels at salisbury and in wales tammeys at coventry and the like it is the same in some respects with our provisions especially for the supply of the city of london and also of several other parts for example when i speak of provisions i mean such as are not made use of in the county where they are made and produced for example  butter in firkins in suffolk and yorkshire cheese from cheshire wiltshire warwickshire and gloucestershire herrings cured red from yarmouth in norfolk coals for fuel from northumberland and durham malt from the counties of hertford essex kent bucks oxford berks c  and thus of many other things which are the proper produce of one part of the country only but are from thence dispersed for the ordinary use of the people into many or perhaps into all the other counties of england to the infinite advantage of our inland commerce and employing a vast number of people and cattle and consequently those people and cattle increasing the consumption of provisions and forage and the improvement of lands so true it is and so visible that trade increases people and people increase trade  this carriage of goods in england from those places is chiefly managed by horses and waggons the number of which is not to be guessed at nor is there any rule or art that can be thought of by which any just calculation can be made of it and therefore i shall not enter upon any particular of it at this time it is sufficient to say what i believe to be true namely that it is equal to the whole trade of some nations and the rather because of the great improvement of land which proceeds from the employing so many thousands of horses as are furnished for this part of business  in other countries and indeed in most countries in europe all their inland trade such as it is is carried on by the convenience of navigation either by coastings on the sea or by rivernavigation it is true our coasting trade is exceedingly great and employs a prodigious number of ships as well from all the shores of england to london as from one port to another  but as to our rivernavigation it is not equal to it though in some places it is very great too but we have but a very few navigable rivers in england compared with those of other countries nor are many of those rivers we have navigable to any considerable length from the sea the most considerable rivers in england for navigation are as followsthe thames the trent the severn the wye the ouse the humber the air and the calder these are navigable a considerable way and receive several other navigable rivers into them but except these there are very few rivers in england which are navigable much above the first town of note within their mouth  most of our other greatest and most navigable rivers are navigable but a very little way in as the northern ouse but to york the orwell but to ipswich the yare but to norwich the tyne itself but a very little above newcastle not in all above twelve miles the tweed not at all above berwick the great avon but to bristol the exe but to exeter and the dee but to chester in a word our rivernavigation is not to be named for carriage with the vast bulk of carriage by packhorses and by waggons nor must the carriage by pedlars on their backs be omitted40  this carriage is the medium of our inland trade and as i said is a branch of the trade itself this great carriage is occasioned by the situation of our produce and manufactures for examplethe taunton and exeter serges perpetuanas and duroys come chiefly by land the clothing such as the broadcloth and druggets from wilts gloucester worcester and shropshire comes all by landcarriage to london and goes down again by landcarriages to all parts of england the yorkshire clothing trade the manchester and coventry trades all by land not to london only but to all parts of england by horsepacksthe manchester men being saving their wealth a kind of pedlars who carry their goods themselves to the country shopkeepers every where as do now the yorkshire and coventry manufacturers also  now in all these manufactures however remote from one another every town in england uses something not only of one or other but of all the rest every sort of goods is wanted every where and where they make one sort of goods and sell them all over england they at the same time want other goods from almost every other part for example  norwich makes chiefly woollen stuffs and camblets and these are sold all over england but then norwich buys broadcloth from wilts and worcestershire serges and sagathies from devon and somersetshire narrow cloth from yorkshire flannel from wales coal from newcastle and the like and so it is mutatis mutandis of most of the other parts  the circulating of these goods in this manner is the life of our inland trade and increases the numbers of our people by keeping them employed at home and indeed of late they are prodigiously multiplied and they again increase our trade as shall be mentioned in its place  as the demand for all sorts of english goods is thus great and they are thus extended in every part of the island so the tradesmen are dispersed and spread over every part also that is to say in every town great or little we find shopkeepers wholesale or retail who are concerned in this circulation and hand forward the goods to the last consumer from london the goods go chiefly to the great towns and from those again to the smaller markets and from those to the meanest villages so that all the manufactures of england and most of them also of foreign countries are to be found in the meanest village and in the remotest corner of the whole island of britain and are to be bought as it were at every bodys door  this shows not the extent of our manufactures only but the usefulness of them and how they are so necessary to mankind that our own people cannot be without them and every sort of them and cannot make one thing serve for another but as they sell their own so they buy from others and every body here trades with every body this it is that gives the whole manufacture so universal a circulation and makes it so immensely great in england what it is abroad is not so much to our present purpose  again the magnitude of the city of london adds very considerably to the greatness of the inland trade for as this city is the centre of our trade so all the manufactures are brought hither and from hence circulated again to all the country as they are particularly called for but that is not all the magnitude of the city influences the whole nation also in the article of provisions and something is raised in every county in england however remote for the supply of london nay all the best of every produce is brought hither so that all the people and all the lands in england seem to be at work for or employed by or on the account of this overgrown city  this makes the trade increase prodigiously even as the city itself increases and we all know the city is very greatly increased within few years past again as the whole nation is employed to feed and clothe this city so here is the money by which all the people in the whole nation seem to be supported and maintained  i have endeavoured to make some calculation of the number of shopkeepers in this kingdom but i find it is not to be donewe may as well count the stars not that they are equal in number neither but it is as impossible unless any one person corresponded so as to have them numbered in every town or parish throughout the kingdom i doubt not they are some hundreds of thousands but there is no making an estimatethe number is in a manner infinite it is as impossible likewise to make any guess at the bulk of their trade and how much they return yearly nor if we could would it give any foundation for any just calculation of the value of goods in general because all our goods circulate so much and go so often through so many hands before they come to the consumer this so often passing every sort of goods through so many hands before it comes into the hands of the last consumer is that which makes our trade be so immensely great for example if there is made in england for our homeconsumption the value of £100000 worth of any particular goods say for example that it be so many pieces of serge or cloth and if this goes through ten tradesmens hands before it comes to the last consumer then there is £1000000 returned in trade for that £100000 worth of goods and so of all the sorts of goods we trade in  again as i said above all our manufactures are so useful to and depend on one another so much in trade that the sale of one necessarily causes the demand of the other in all parts for example suppose the poorest countryman wants to be clothed or suppose it be a gentleman wants to clothe one of his servants whether a footman in a livery or suppose it be any servant in ordinary apparel yet he shall in some part employ almost every one of the manufacturing counties of england for making up one ordinary suit of clothes for example  if his coat be of woollencloth he has that from yorkshire the lining is shalloon from berkshire the waistcoat is of callamanco from norwich the breeches of a strong drugget from devizes wiltshire the stockings being of yarn from westmoreland the hat is a felt from leicester the gloves of leather from somersetshire the shoes from northampton the buttons from macclesfield in cheshire or if they are of metal they come from birmingham or warwickshire his garters from manchester his shirt of homemade linen of lancashire or scotland  if it be thus of every poor mans clothing or of a servant what must it be of the master and of the rest of the family and in this particular the case is the same let the family live where they will so that all these manufactures must be found in all the remotest towns and counties in england be it where you will  again take the furnishing of our houses it is the same in proportion and according to the figure and quality of the person suppose then it be a middling tradesman that is going to live in some markettown and to open his shop there suppose him not to deal in the manufacture but in groceries and such sort of wares as the country grocers sell  this man however must clothe himself and his wife and must furnish his house let us see then to how many counties and towns among our manufactures must he send for his needful supply nor is the quantity concerned in it let him furnish himself as frugally as he pleases yet he must have something of every necessary thing and we will suppose for the present purpose the man lived in sussex where very few if any manufactures are carried on suppose he lived at horsham which is a markettown in or near the middle of the county  for his clothing of himselffor we must allow him to have a new suit of clothes when he begins the worldtake them to be just as above for as to the quality or quantity it is much the same only that instead of buying the cloth from yorkshire perhaps he has it a little finer than the poor man above and so his comes out of wiltshire and his stockings are it may be of worsted not of yarn and so they come from nottingham not westmoreland but this does not at all alter the case  come we next to his wife and she being a good honest townsmans daughter is not dressed over fine yet she must have something decent being newly married too especially as times go when the burghers wives of horsham or any other town go as fine as they do in other places allow her then to have a silk gown with all the necessaries belonging to a middling tolerable appearance yet you shall find all the nation more or less concerned in clothing this country grocers wife and furnishing his house and yet nothing at all extravagant for example  her gown a plain english mantuasilk manufactured in spitalfields her petticoat the same her binding a piece of chequeredstuff made at bristol and norwich her underpetticoat a piece of black callamanco made at norwithquilted at home if she be a good housewife but the quilting of cotton from manchester or cottonwool from abroad her innerpetticoats flannel and swanskin from salisbury and wales her stockings from tewksbury if ordinary from leicester if woven her lace and edgings from stony stratford the first and great marlow the last her muslin from foreign trade as likewise her linen being something finer than the mans may perhaps be a guilickholland her wrapper or morninggown a piece of irish linen printed at london her black hood a thin english lustring her gloves lambsskin from berwick and northumberland or scotland her ribands being but very few from coventry or london her ridinghood of english worstedcamblet made at norwich  come next to the furniture of their house it is scarce credible to how many counties of england and how remote the furniture of but a mean house must send them and how many people are every where employed about it nay and the meaner the furniture the more people and places employed for example  the hangings suppose them to be ordinary linseywoolsey are made at kidderminster dyed in the country and painted or watered at london the chairs if of cane are made at london the ordinary matted chairs perhaps in the place where they live tables chests of drawers c made at london as also lookingglass bedding c the curtains suppose of serge from taunton and exeter or of camblets from norwich or the same with the hangings as above the ticking comes from the west country somerset and dorsetshire the feathers also from the same country the blankets from whitney in oxfordshire the rugs from westmoreland and yorkshire the sheets of good linen from ireland kitchen utensils and chimneyfurniture almost all the brass and iron from birmingham and sheffield earthenware from stafford nottingham and kent glass ware from sturbridge in worcestershire and london  i give this list to explain what i said before namely that there is no particular place in england where all the manufactures are made but every county or place has its peculiar sort or particular manufacture in which the people are wholly employed and for all the rest that is wanted they fetch them from other parts41  but then as what is thus wanted by every particular person or family is but in small quantities and they would not be able to send for it to the country or town where it is to be bought there are shopkeepers in every village or at least in every considerable markettown where the particulars are to be bought and who find it worth their while to furnish themselves with quantities of all the particular goods be they made where and as far off as they will and at these shops the people who want them are easily supplied  nor do even these shopkeepers go or send to all the several counties where those goods are madethat is to say to this part for the cloth or to that for the lining to another for the buttons and to another for the thread but they again correspond with the wholesale dealers in london where there are particular shops or warehouses for all these and they not only furnish the country shopkeepers but give them large credit and sell them great quantities of goods by which they again are enabled to trust the tailors who make the clothes or even their neighbours who wear them and the manufacturers in the several counties do the like by those wholesale dealers who supply the country shops  through so many hands do all the necessary things pass for the clothing a poor plain countryman though he lived as far as berwickupontweed and this occasions as i have said a general circulation of trade both to and from london from and to all the parts of england so that every manufacture is sold and removed five or six times and perhaps more before it comes at the last consumer  this method of trade brings another article in which also is the great foundation of the increase of commerce and the prodigious magnitude of our inland trade is much owing to it and that is giving credit by which every tradesman is enabled to trade for a great deal more than he otherwise could do by this method a shopkeeper is able to stock his shop or warehouses with two or three times as much goods in value as he has stock of his own to begin the world with and by that means is able to trust out his goods to others and give them time and so under one anothernay i may say many a tradesman begins the world with borrowed stocks or with no stock at all but that of credit and yet carries on a trade for several hundreds nay for several thousands of pounds ayear  by this means the trade in general is infinitely increasednay the stock of the kingdom in trade is doubled or trebled or more and there is infinitely more business carried on than the real stock could be able to manage if no credit were to be given for credit in this particular is a stock and that not an imaginary but a real stock for the tradesman that perhaps begins but with five hundred or one thousand pounds stock shall be able to furnish or stock his shop with four times the sum in the value of goods and as he gives credit again and trusts other tradesmen under him so he launches out into a trade of great magnitude and yet if he is a prudent manager of his business he finds himself able to answer his payments and so continually supply himself with goods keeping up the reputation of his dealings and the credit of his shop though his stock be not a fifth nay sometimes not a tenth part in proportion to the returns that he makes by the year so that credit is the foundation on which the trade of england is made so considerable  nor is it enough to say that people must and will have goods and that the consumption is the same it is evident that consumption is not the same and in those nations where they give no credit or not so much as here the trade is small in proportion as i shall show in its place  footnotes  38 the amount of trade produced by the british colonies is still great but it has been ascertained that it is not profitable to the nation at large as much more is paid from the public purse for the military protection required by the colonies than returns to individuals through the medium of business  39 the cotton manufacture has now the prominence which in defoes time was due to those of wool and silk  40 it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader that the canal navigation of england has come into existence since the date of this workthe railway communication is but of yesterday  41 since defoes time little alteration has taken place in the locality of a number of manufactures in england but in the interval an entire change has been effected in scotland which now possesses various manufactures of importance in the commercial economy of the nation we need only allude to the cambrics gauzes and silks of paisley the cottons and other goods of glasgow the plaidings of stirlingshire the stockings of hawick the printingpaper of midlothian the carpets and bonnets of kilmarnock the iron of muirkirk and carron the linens of fife and dundee and the shawls of edinburgh     chapter xxiv  of credit in trade and how a tradesman ought to value and improve it how easily lost and how hard it is to be recovered   credit is or ought to be the tradesmans mistress but i must tell him too he must not think of ever casting her off for if once he loses her she hardly ever returns and yet she has one quality in which she differs from most of the ladies who go by that nameif you court her she is gone if you manage so wisely as to make her believe you really do not want her she follows and courts you but by the way no tradesman can be in so good circumstances as to say he does not want that is does not stand in need of credit  credit next to real stock is the foundation the life and soul of business in a private tradesman it is his prosperity it is his support in the substance of his whole trade even in public matters it is the strengh and fund of a nation we felt in the late wars the consequence of both the extremesnamely of wanting and of enjoying a complete fund of credit  credit makes war and makes peace raises armies fits out navies fights battles besieges towns and in a word it is more justly called the sinews of war than the money itself42 because it can do all these things without moneynay it will bring in money to be subservient though it be independent  credit makes the soldier fight without pay the armies march without provisions and it makes tradesmen keep open shop without stock the force of credit is not to be described by words it is an impregnable fortification either for a nation or for a single man in business and he that has credit is invulnerable whether he has money or no nay it will make money and which is yet more it will make money without an intrinsic without the materia medica as the doctors have it it adds a value and supports whatever value it adds to the meanest substance it makes paper pass for money and fills the exchequer and the banks with as many millions as it pleases upon demand as i said in last chapter it increases commerce so i may add it makes trade and makes the whole kingdom trade for many millions more than the national specie can amount to  it may be true as some allege that we cannot drive a trade for more goods than we have to trade with but then it is as true that it is by the help of credit that we can increase the quantity and that more goods are made to trade with than would otherwise be more goods are brought to market than they could otherwise sell and even in the last consumption how many thousands of families wear out their clothes before they pay for them and eat their dinner upon tick with the butcher nay how many thousands who could not buy any clothes if they were to pay for them in ready money yet buy them at a venture upon their credit and pay for them as they can  trade is anticipated by credit and it grows by the anticipation for men often buy clothes before they pay for them because they want clothes before they can spare the money and these are so many in number that really they add a great stroke to the bulk of our inland trade how many families have we in england that live upon credit even to the tune of two or three years rent of their revenue before it comes inso that they must be said to eat the calf in the cows belly this encroachment they make upon the stock in trade and even this very article may state the case i doubt not but at this time the land owes to the trade some millions sterling that is to say the gentlemen owe to the tradesmen so much money which at long run the rents of their lands must pay  the tradesmen having then trusted the landed men with so much where must they have it but by giving credit also to one another trusting their goods and money into trade one launching out into the hands of another and forbearing payment till the lands make it good out of their produce that is to say out of their rents  the trade is not limited the produce of lands may be and is restrained trade cannot exceed the bounds of the goods it can sell but while trade can increase its stock of cash by credit it can increase its stock of goods for sale and then it has nothing to do but to find a market to sell at and this we have done in all parts of the world still by the force of our stocks being so increased  thus credit raising stock at home that stock enables us to give credit abroad and thus the quantity of goods which we make and which is infinitely increased at home enables us to find or force a vent abroad this is apparent our home trade having so far increased our manufacture that england may be said to be able almost to clothe the whole world and in our carrying on the foreign trade wholly upon the english stocks giving credit to almost all the nations of the world for it is evident our stocks lie at this time upon credit in the warehouses of the merchants in spain and portugal holland and germany italy and turkey nay in new spain and brazil  the exceeding quantity of goods thus raised in england cannot be supposed to be the mere product of the solid wealth and stocks of the english people we do not pretend to it the joining those stocks to the value of goods always appearing in england in the hands of the manufacturers tradesmen and merchants and to the wealth which appears in shipping in stock upon land and in the current coin of the nation would amount to such a prodigy of stock as not all europe could pretend to  but all this is owing to the prodigious thing called credit the extent of which in the british trade is as hard to be valued as the benefit of it to england is really not to be described it must be likewise said to the honour of our english tradesman that they understand how to manage the credit they both give and take better than any other tradesmen in the world indeed they have a greater opportunity to improve it and make use of it and therefore may be supposed to be more ready in making the best of their credit than any other nations are  hence it is that we frequently find tradesmen carrying on a prodigious trade with but a middling stock of their own the rest being all managed by the force of their credit for example i have known a man in a private warehouse in london trade for forty thousand pounds ayear sterling and carry on such a return for many years together and not have one thousand pounds stock of his own or not moreall the rest has been carried on upon credit being the stocks of other men running continually through his hands and this is not practised now and then as a great rarity but is very frequent in trade and may be seen every day as what in its degree runs through the whole body of the tradesmen in england43  every tradesman both gives and takes credit and the new mode of setting it up over their shop and warehouse doors in capital letters no trust by retail is a presumption in trade and though it may have been attempted in some trades was never yet brought to any perfection and most of those trades who were the forwardest to set it up have been obliged to take it down again or act contrary to it in their business or see some very good customers go away from them to other shops who though they have not brought money with them have yet good foundations to make any tradesmen trust them and who do at proper times make payments punctual enough  on the contrary instead of giving no trust by retail we see very considerable families who buy nothing but on trust even bread beer butter cheese beef and mutton wine groceries c being the things which even with the meanest families are generally sold for ready money thus i have known a family whose revenue has been some thousands ayear pay their butcher and baker and grocer and cheesemonger by a hundred pounds at a time and be generally a hundred more in each of their debts and yet the tradesmen have thought it well worth while to trust them and their pay has in the end been very honest and good  this is what i say brings land so much in debt to trade and obliges the tradesman to take credit of one another and yet they do not lose by it neither for the tradesmen find it in the price and they take care to make such families pay warmly for the credit in the rate of their goods nor can it be expected it should be otherwise for unless the profit answered it the tradesman could not afford to be so long without his money  this credit takes its beginning in our manufactures even at the very first of the operation for the master manufacturer himself begins it take a country clothier or baymaker or what other maker of goods you please provided he be one that puts out the goods to the making it is true that the poor spinners and weavers cannot trust the first spin for their bread and the last not only weave for their bread but they have several workmen and boys under them who are very poor and if they should want their pay on saturday night must want their dinner on sunday and perhaps would be in danger of starving with their families by the next saturday  but though the clothier cannot have credit for spinning and weaving he buys his wool at the staplers or fellmongers and he gets two or three months credit for that he buys his oil and soap of the country shopkeeper or has it sent down from his factor at london and he gets longer credit for that and the like of all other things so that a clothier of any considerable business when he comes to die shall appear to be £4000 or £5000 in debt  but then look into his books and you shall find his factor at blackwell hall who sells his cloths or the warehousekeeper who sells his duroys and druggets or both together have £2000 worth of goods in hand left unsold and has trusted out to drapers and mercers and merchants to the value of £4000 more and look into his workhouse at home namely his woollofts his combingshop his yarnchamber and the like and there you will find itin wool unspun and in yarn spun and in wool at the spinners and in yarn at and in the looms at the weavers in rapeoil gallipoli oil and perhaps soap c in his warehouses and in cloths at the fullingmill and in his rowingshops finished and unfinished £4000 worth of goods more so that though this clothier owed £5000 at his death he has nevertheless died in good circumstances and has £5000 estate clear to go among his children all his debts paid and discharged however it is evident that at the very beginning of this manufacturers trade his £5000 stock is made £10000 by the help of his credit and he trades for three times as much in the year so that £5000 stock makes £10000 stock and credit and that together makes £30000 ayear returned in trade  when you come from him to the warehousekeeper in london there you double and treble upon it to an unknown degree for the london wholesale man shall at his death appear to have credit among the country clothiers for £10000 or £15000 nay to £20000 and yet have kept up an unspotted credit all his days  when he is dead and his executors or widow come to look into things they are frightened with the very appearance of such a weight of debts and begin to doubt how his estate will come out at the end of it but when they come to cast up his books and his warehouse they find  in debts abroad perhaps   £30000 in goods in his warehouse  £12000  so that in a word the man has died immensely rich that is to say worth between £20000 and £30000 only that having been a long standard in trade and having a large stock he drove a very great business perhaps to the tune of £60000 or £70000 ayear so that of all the £30000 owing there may be very little of it delivered above four to six months and the debtors being many of them considerable merchants and good paymasters there is no difficulty in getting in money enough to clear all his own debts and the widow and children being left well are not in such haste for the rest but that it comes in time enough to make them easy and at length it all comes in or with but a little loss  as it is thus in great things it is the same in proportion with small so that in all the trade of england you may reckon twothirds of it carried on upon credit in which reckoning i suppose i speak much within compass for in some trades there is four parts of five carried on so and in some more  all these things serve to show the infinite value of which credit is to the tradesman as well as to trade itself and it is for this reason i have closed my instructions with this part of the discourse credit is the choicest jewel the tradesman is trusted with it is better than money many ways if a man has £10000 in money he may certainly trade for £10000 and if he has no credit he cannot trade for a shilling more  but how often have we seen men by the mere strength of their credit trade for ten thousand pounds ayear and have not one groat of real stock of their own left in the world nay i can say it of my own knowledge that i have known a tradesman trade for ten thousand pounds ayear and carry it on with full credit to the last gasp then die and break both at once that is to say die unsuspected and yet when his estate has been cast up appear to be five thousand pounds worse than nothing in the world how he kept up his credit and made good his payments so long is indeed the mystery and makes good what i said before namely that as none trade so much upon credit in the world so none know so well how to improve and manage credit to their real advantage as the english tradesmen do and we have many examples of it among our bankers especially of which i have not room to enter at this time into the discourse though it would afford a great many diverting particulars44  i have mentioned on several occasions in this work how nice and how dainty a dame this credit is how soon she is affronted and disobliged and how hard to be recovered when once distasted and fled particularly in the story of the tradesman who told his friends in a public coffeehouse that he was broke and should shut up his shop the next day i have hinted how chary we ought to be of one anothers credit and that we should take care as much of our neighbour tradesmans credit as we would of his life or as we would of firing his house and consequently the whole street  let me close all with a word to the tradesman himself that if it be so valuable to him and his friends should be all so chary of injuring his reputation certainly he should be very chary of it himself the tradesman that is not as tender of his credit as he is of his eyes or of his wife and children neither deserves credit nor will long be master of it  as credit is a coy mistress and will not easily be courted so she is a mighty nice touchy lady and is soon affronted if she is ill used she flies at once and it is a very doubtful thing whether ever you gain her favour again  some may ask me here how comes it to pass since she is so nice and touchy a lady that so many clowns court and carry her and so many fools keep her so long my answer is that those clowns have yet good breeding enough to treat her civilly he must be a fool indeed that will give way to have his credit injured and sit still and be quietthat will not bustle and use his utmost industry to vindicate his own reputation and preserve his credit  but the main question for a tradesman in this case and which i have not spoken of yet is what is the man to do to preserve his credit what are the methods that a young tradesman is to take to gain a good share of credit in his beginning and to preserve and maintain it when it is gained45  every tradesmans credit is supposed to be good at first he that begins without credit is an unhappy wretch of a tradesman indeed and may be said to be broke even before he sets up for what can a man do who by any misfortune in his conduct during his apprenticeship or by some ill character upon him so early begins with a blast upon his credit my advice to such a young man would be not to set up at all or if he did to stay for some time till by some better behaviour either as a journeyman or as an assistant in some other mans shop or warehouse he had recovered himself or else to go and set up in some other place or town remote from that where he has been bred for he must have a great assurance that can flatter himself to set up and believe he shall recover a lost reputation  but take a young tradesman as setting up with the ordinary stock that is to say a negative character namely that he has done nothing to hurt his character nothing to prejudice his behaviour and to give people a suspicion of him what then is the first principle on which to build a tradesmans reputation and what is it he is to do  the answer is short two things raise credit in trade and i may say they are the only things required there are some necessary addenda but these are the fundamentals  1 industry 2 honesty  i have dwelt upon the first the last i have but a few words to say to but they will be very significant indeed that head requires no comment no explanations or enlargements nothing can support credit be it public or private but honesty a punctual dealing a general probity in every transaction he that once breaks through his honesty violates his creditonce denominate a man a knave and you need not forbid any man to trust him  even in the public it appears to be the same thing let any man view the public credit in its present flourishing circumstances and compare it with the latter end of the years of king charles ii after the exchequer had been shut up parliamentary appropriations misapplied and in a word the public faith broken who would lend seven or eight per cent was given for anticipations in king williams time though no new fraud had been offered only because the old debts were unpaid and how hard was it to get any one to lend money at all  but after by a long series of just and punctual dealing the parliament making good all the deficient funds and paying even those debts for which no provision was made and the like how is the credit restored the public faith made sacred again and how money flows into the exchequer without calling for and that at three or four per cent interest even from foreign countries as well as from our own people they that have credit can never want money and this credit is to be raised by no other method whether by private tradesmen or public bodies of men by nations and governments but by a general probity and an honest punctual dealing  the reason of this case is as plain as the assertion the cause is in itself no man lends his money but with an expectation of receiving it again with the interest if the borrower pays it punctually without hesitations and defalcations without difficulties and above all without compulsion what is the consequencehe is called an honest man he has the reputation of a punctual fair dealer and what thenwhy then he may borrow again whenever he will he may take up money and goods or anything upon his bare words or note when another man must give bondsmen or mainprize that is a pawn or pledge for security and hardly be trusted to neither this is credit  it is not the quality of the person would give credit to his dealing not kings princes emperors it is all one nay a private shopkeeper shall borrow money much easier than a prince if the credit of the tradesman has the reputation of being an honest man not the crown itself can give credit to the head that wears it if once he that wears it comes but to mortgage his honour in the matter of payment of money  who would have lent king charles ii fifty pounds on the credit of his word or bond after the shutting up the exchequer the royal word was made a jest of and the character of the king was esteemed a fluttering trifle which no man would venture upon much less venture his money upon  in king williams time the case was much the same at first though the king had not broken his credit then with any man yet how did they break their faith with the whole world by the deficiency of the funds the giving high and ruinous interest to men almost as greedy as vultures the causing the government to pay great and extravagant rates for what they bought and great premiums for what they borrowedthese were the injuries to the public for want of credit nor was it in the power of the whole nation to remedy it on the contrary they made it still grow worse and worse till as above the parliament recovered it and how was it done not but by the same method a private person must do the same namely by doing justly and fairly and honestly by every body  thus credit began to revive and to enlarge itself again and usury which had as it were eaten up mankind in business declined and so things came to their right way again  the case is the same with a tradesman if he shuffles in payment bargains at one time and pays at another breaks his word and his honour in the road of his business he is gone no man will take his bills no man will trust him  the conclusion is open and clear the tradesman cannot be too careful of his credit he cannot buy it too dear or be too careful to preserve it it is in vain to maintain it by false and loose doing business by breaking faith refusing to perform agreements and such shuffling things as those the greatest monarch in europe could not so preserve his credit  nothing but probity will support credit just and fair and honourable dealings give credit and nothing but the same just and fair and honourable dealings will preserve it  footnotes  42 how strikingly was this proved in the last war when the british government obtained credit for no less than six hundred millions to conduct warlike operations and by these means was ultimately victorious  43 the authors praises of credit must be received with caution if his descriptions of the credit system of his own day are true an improvement has since taken place as business neither is nor can be now carried on to such an extent upon credita circumstance that redounds to the advantage of all parties  44 defoe speaks of such cases as if there were something laudable in them whereas it is obviously for the interest of all honest traders that no such men should be allowed to carry on business  45 defoe almost appears in this place to lay capital out of the question and to represent credit as all in all credit is a matter of great consequence but we must not attempt to carry on business by its means alone it should only be considered as an aid to capital those who without capital endeavour to set up in business by means of credit or when capital is exhausted attempt to struggle on by means of credit alone will in general only have a life of anxiety and dispeace for their pains     chapter xxv  of the tradesmans punctual paying his bills and promissory notes under his hand and the credit he gains by it   as i said that credit is maintained by just and honourable dealing so that just dealing depends very much upon the tradesmans punctual payment of money in all the several demands that are upon him the ordinary demands of money upon a tradesman are  i promises of money for goods bought at time  ii bills drawn upon him which generally speaking are from the country that is to say from some places remote from where he lives or  iii promissory notes under his hand which are passed oftentimes upon buying goods bought also at time as in the first head  iv bonds bearing interest given chiefly for money borrowed at running interest  1 promises of money for goods bought at time this indeed is the loosest article in a tradesmans payments and it is true that a tradesmans credit is maintained upon the easiest terms in this case of any other that belongs to trade for in this case not one man in twenty keeps to his time and so easy are tradesmen to one another that in general it is not much expected but he that pays tolerably well and without dunning is a good man and in credit shall be trusted any where and keeps up a character in his business sometimes he pays sooner sometimes later and is accounted so good a customer that though he owes a great deal yet he shall be trusted any where and is as lofty and touchy if his credit be called in question as if he paid all ready money  and indeed these men shall often buy their goods as cheap upon the credit of their ordinary pay as another man shall that brings his money in his hand and it is reasonable it should be so for the readymoney man comes and buys a parcel here and a parcel there and comes but seldom but the other comes every day that is to say as often as he wants goods buys considerably perhaps deals for two or three thousand pounds ayear with you and the like and pays currently too such a customer ought indeed to be sold as cheap to as the other chance customer for his ready money in this manner of trade i say credit is maintained upon the easiest terms of any other and yet here the tradesman must have a great care to keep it up too for though it be the easiest article to keep up credit in yet even in this article the tradesman may lose his credit and then he is undone at once and this is by growing what in the language of trade is called longwinded putting off and putting off continually till he will bear dunning then his credit falls his dealer that trusted him perhaps a thousand pounds previously that esteemed him as good as ready money now grows sick of him declines him cares not whether he deals with him or no and at last refuses to trust him any longer then his credit is quite sunk and gone and in a little after that his trade is ruined and the tradesman too for he must be a very extraordinary tradesman that can open his shop after he has outlived his credit let him look which way he will all is lost nobody cares to deal with him and which is still worse nobody will trust him  2 bills drawn upon him from the country that is to say from some places remote from where he now dwells it is but a little while ago since those bills were the loosest things in trade for as they could not be protested so they would not in all their heats always sue for them but rather return them to the person from whom they received them  in the meantime let the occasion be what it will the tradesman ought on all occasions to pay these notes without a public recalling and returning them and without hesitation of any kind whatsoever he that lets his bills lie long unpaid must not expect to keep his credit much after them  besides the late law for noting and protesting inland bills alters the case very much bills now accepted are protested in form and if not punctually paid are either returned immediately or the person on whom they are drawn is liable to be sued at law either of which is at best a blow to the credit of the acceptor  a tradesman may without hurt to his reputation refuse to accept a bill for then when the notary comes he gives his reasons namely that he refuses to accept the bill for want of advice or for want of effects in his hands for account of the drawer or that he has not given orders to draw upon him in all which cases the nonacceptance touches the credit of the drawer for in trade it is always esteemed a dishonourable thing to draw upon any man that has not effects in his hands to answer the bill or to draw without order or to draw and not give advice of it because it looks like a forwardness to take the remitters money without giving him a sufficient demand for it where he expects and ought to have it  a tradesman comes to me in london and desires me to give him a bill payable at bristol for he is going to the fair there and being to buy goods there he wants money at bristol to pay for them if i give him a bill he pays me down the money upon receipt of it depending upon my credit for the acceptance of the bill if i draw this bill where i have no reason to draw it where i have no demand or no effects to answer it or if i give my correspondent no advice of it i abuse the remitter that is the man whose money i take and this reflects upon my credit that am the drawer and the next time this tradesman wants money at bristol fair he will not come to me no says he his last bills were not accepted or if he does come to me then he demands that he should not pay his money till he has advice that my bills are accepted  but on the other hand if bills are right drawn and advice duly given and the person has effects in his hands then if he refuses the bill he says to the notary he does not accept the bill but gives no reason for it only that he says absolutely i will not accept ityou may take that for an answer or he adds i refuse to accept it for reasons best known to myself this is sometimes done but this does not leave the persons credit who refuses so clear as the other though perhaps it may not so directly reflect upon him but it leaves the case a little dubious and uncertain and men will be apt to write back to the person who sent the bill to inquire what the drawer says to it and what account he gives or what character he has upon his tongue for the person drawn upon  as the punctual paying of bills when accepted is a main article in the credit of the acceptor so a tradesman should be very cautious in permitting men to draw upon him where he has not effects or does not give order for though as i said it ought not to affect his reputation not to accept a bill where it ought not to be drawn yet a tradesman that is nice of his own character does not love to be always or often refusing to accept bills or to have bills drawn upon him where he has no reason to accept them and therefore he will be very positive in forbidding such drawing and if notwithstanding that the importunities of the country tradesman oblige him to draw the person drawn upon will give smart and rough answers to such bills as particularly i refuse to accept this bill because i have no effects of the drawers to answer it or thus i refuse to accept this bill because i not only gave no orders to draw but gave positive orders not to draw or thus i neither will accept this bill nor any other this man shall draw and the like this thoroughly clears the credit of the acceptor and reflects grossly on the drawer  and yet i say even in this case a tradesman does not care to be drawn upon and be obliged to see bills presented for acceptance and for payment where he has given orders not to draw and where he has no effects to answer  it is the great error of our country manufacturers in many if not in most parts of england at this time that as soon as they can finish their goods they hurry them up to london to their factor and as soon as the goods are gone immediately follow them with their bills for the money without waiting to hear whether the goods are come to a market are sold or in demand and whether they are likely to sell quickly or not thus they load the factors warehouse with their goods before they are wanted and load the factor with their bills before it is possible that he can have gotten cash in his hand to pay them  this is first a direct borrowing money of their factor and it is borrowing as it were whether the factor will lend or no and sometimes whether he can or no the factor if he be a man of money and answers their bills fails not to make them pay for advancing or sells the goods to loss to answer the bills which is making them pay dear for the loan or refuses their bills and so baulks both their business and their credit  but if the factor willing to oblige his employers and knowing he shall otherwise lose their commission accepts the bills on the credit of the goods and then not being able to sell the goods in time is also made unable to pay the bills when duethis reflects upon his credit though the fault is indeed in the drawer whose effects are not come in and this has ruined many an honest factor  first it has hurt him by drawing large sums out of his cash for the supply of the needy manufacturer who is his employer and has thereby made him unable to pay his other bills currently even of such mens drafts who had perhaps good reason to draw  secondly it keeps the factor always bare of money and wounds his reputation so that he pays those very bills with discredit which in justice to himself he ought not to pay at all and the borrower has the money at the expense of the credit of the lender whereas indeed the reproach ought to be to him that borrows not to him that lendsto him that draws where there are no effects to warrant his draft not to him that pays where he does not owe  but the damage lies on the circumstances of accepting the bill for the factor lends his employer the money the hour he accepts the bill and the blow to his credit is for not paying when accepted when the bill is accepted the acceptor is debtor to the person to whom the bill is payable or in his right to every indorser for a bill of exchange is in this case different from a bond namely that the right of action is transferable by indorsement and every indorser has a right to sue the acceptor in his own name and can transfer that right to another whereas in a bond though it be given to me by assignment i must sue in the name of the first person to whom the bond is payable and he may at any time discharge the bond notwithstanding my assignment  tradesmen then especially such as are factors46 are unaccountably to blame to accept bills for their employers before their goods are sold and the money received or within reach if the employers cannot wait the reproach should lie on them not on the factor and indeed the manufacturers all over england are greatly wrong in that part of their business for not considering the difference between a time of demand and a time of glut a quick or a dead market they go on in the same course of making and without slackening their hands as to quantity crowd up their goods as if it were enough to them that the factor had them and that they were to be reckoned as sold when they were in his hands but would the factor truly represent to them the state of the marketthat there are great quantities of goods in hand unsold and no present demand desiring them to slack their hands a little in making and at the same time back their directions in a plain and positive way though with respect too by telling them they could accept no more bills till the goods were sold this would bring the trade into a better regulation and the makers would stop their hands when the market stopped and when the merchant ceased to buy the manufacturers would cease to make and consequently would not crowd or clog the market with goods or wrong their factors with bills  but this would require a large discourse and the manufacturers objections should be answered namely that they cannot stop that they have their particular sets of workmen and spinners whom they are obliged to keep employed or if they should dismiss them they could not have them again when a demand for goods came and the markets revived and that besides the poor would starve  these objections are easy to be answered though that is not my present business but thus far it is to my purposeit is the factors business to keep himself within compass if the goods cannot be sold the maker must stay till they can if the poor must be employed the manufacturer is right to keep them at work if he can but if he cannot without oppressing the factor then he makes the factor employ them not himself and i do not see the factor has any obligation upon him to consider the spinners and weavers especially not at the expense of his own credit and his familys safety  upon the whole all tradesmen that trade thus whether by commission from the country or upon their own accounts should make it the standing order of their business not to suffer themselves to be overdrawn by their employers so as to straiten themselves in their cash and make them unable to pay their bills when accepted it is also to be observed that when a tradesman once comes to suffer himself to be thus overdrawn and sinks his credit in kindness to his employer he buys his employment so dear as all his employer can do for him can never repay the price  and even while he is thus serving his employer he more and more wounds himself for suppose he does with difficulty raise money and after some dunning does pay the bills yet he loses in the very doing it for he never pays them with credit but suffers in reputation by every days delay in a word a tradesman that buys upon credit that is to say in a course of credit such as i have described before may let the merchant or the warehousekeeper call two or three times and may put him off without much damage to his credit and if he makes them stay one time he makes it up again another and recovers in one good payment what he lost in two or three bad ones  but in bills of exchange or promissory notes it is quite another thing and he that values his reputation in trade should never let a bill come twice for payment or a note under his hand stay a day after it is due that is to say after the three days of grace as it is called those three days indeed are granted to all bills of exchange not by law but by the custom of trade it is hard to tell how this custom prevailed or when it began but it is one of those many instances which may be given where custom of trade is equal to an established law and it is so much a law now in itself that no bill is protested now till those three days are expired nor is a bill of exchange esteemed due till the third day no man offers to demand it nor will any goldsmith or even the bank itself pay a foreign bill sooner but that by the way  bills of exchange being thus sacred in trade and inland bills being by the late law for protesting them and giving interest and damage upon them made as near as can be equally sacred nothing can be of more moment to a tradesman than to pay them always punctually and honourably  let no critic cavil at the word honourably as it relates to trade punctual payment is the honour of trade and there is a word always used among merchants which justifies my using it in this place and that is when a merchant draws a bill from abroad upon his friend at london his correspondent in london answering his letter and approving his drawing upon him adds that he shall be sure to honour his bill when it appears that is to say to accept it  likewise when the drawer gives advice of his having drawn such a bill upon him he gives an account of the sum drawn the name of the person it is payable to the time it is drawn at that is the time given for payment and he adds thusi doubt not your giving my bill due honour that is of accepting it and paying it when it is due  this term is also used in another case in foreign trade only namelya merchant abroad say it be at lisbon or bourdeaux draws a bill of £300 sterling upon his correspondent at london the correspondent happens to be dead or is broke or by some other accident the bill is not accepted another merchant on the exchange hearing of it and knowing and perhaps corresponding with the merchant abroad who drew the bill and loth his credit should suffer by the bill going back protested accepts it and pays it for him this is called accepting it for the honour of the drawer and he writes so upon the bill when he accepts it which entitles him to redraw the same with interest upon the drawer in lisbon or bourdeaux as above  this is indeed a case peculiar to foreign commerce and is not often practised in home trade and among shopkeepers though sometimes i have known it practised here too but i name it on two accounts firstto legitimate the word honourable which i had used and which has its due propriety in matters of trade though not in the same acceptation as it generally receives in common affairs and secondly to let the tradesman see how deeply the honour that is the credit of trade is concerned in the punctual payment of bills of exchange and the like of promissory notes for in point of credit there is no difference though in matter of form there is  there are a great many variations in the drawing bills from foreign countries according as the customs and usages of merchants direct and according as the coins and rates of exchange differ and according as the same terms are differently understood in several places as the word usance and two usance which is a term for the number of days given for payment after the date of the bill and though this is a thing particularly relating to merchants and to foreign commerce yet as the nature of bills of exchange is pretty general and that sometimes an inland tradesman especially in seaport towns may be obliged to take foreign accepted bills in payment for their goods or if they have money to spare as sometimes it is an inland tradesmans good luck to have may be asked to discount such billsi say on this account and that they may know the value of a foreign bill when they see it and how far it has to run before it has to be demanded i think it not foreign to the case before me to give them the following account  1 as to the times of payment of foreign bills of exchange and the terms of art ordinarily used by merchants in drawing and expressed in the said bills the times of payment are as above either  1 at sight which is to be understood not the day it is presented but three days called days of grace after the bill is accepted 2 usance 3 two usance47  usance between london and all the towns in the states generals dominions and also in the provinces now called the austrian netherlands belgium is one month and two usance is two months reckoning not from the acceptance of the bill but from the date of it usance between london and hamburgh is two months venice is three months and double usance or two usance is double that time usance payable at florence or leghorn is two months but from thence payable at london usance is three months usance from london to rouen or paris is one month but they generally draw at a certain number of days usually twentyone days sight usance from london to seville is two months as likewise between london and lisbon and oporto to or from usance from genoa to rome is payable at rome ten days after sight usance between antwerp and genoa naples or messina is two months whether to or from usance from antwerp or amsterdam payable at venice is two months payable in bank  there are abundance of niceties in the accepting and paying of bills of exchange especially foreign bills which i think needless to enter upon here but this i think i should not omit namely  that if a man pays a bill of exchange before it is due though he had accepted it if the man to whom it was payable proves a bankrupt after he has received the money and yet before the bill becomes due the person who voluntarily paid the money before it was due shall be liable to pay it again to the remitter for as the remitter delivered his money to the drawer in order to have it paid again to such person as he should order it is and ought to be in his power to divert the payment by altering the bill and make it payable to any other person whom he thinks fit during all the time between the acceptance and the day of payment  this has been controverted i know in some cases but i have always found that by the most experienced merchants and especially in places of the greatest business abroad it was always given in favour of the remitter namely that the right of guiding the payment is in him all the time the bill is running and no bill can or ought to be paid before it is due without the declared assent of the remitter signified under his hand and attested by a public notary there are i say abundance of niceties in the matter of foreign exchanges and in the manner of drawing accepting and protesting bills but as i am now speaking with and have confined my discourse in this work to the inland tradesmen of england i think it would be as unprofitable to them to meddle with this as it would be difficult to them to understand it48  i return therefore to the subject in hand as well as to the people to whom i have all along directed my discourse  though the inland tradesmen do not and need not acquaint themselves with the manner of foreign exchanges yet there is a great deal of business done by exchange among ourselves and at home and in which our inland trade is chiefly concerned and as this is the reason why i speak so much and repeat it so often to the tradesman for whose instruction i am writing that he should maintain the credit of his bills so it may not be amiss to give the tradesman some directions concerning such bills  he is to consider that in general bills pass through a number of hands by indorsation from one to another and that if the bill comes to be protested afterwards and returned it goes back again through all those hands with this mark of the tradesmans disgrace upon it namely that it has been accepted but that the man who accepted it is not able to pay it than which nothing can expose the tradesman more  he is to consider that the grand characteristic of a tradesman and by which his credit is rated is this of paying his bills well or ill if any man goes to the neighbours or dealers of a tradesman to inquire of his credit or his fame in business which is often done upon almost every extraordinary occasion the first question is how does he pay his bills as when we go to a master or mistress to inquire the character of a maidservant one of the first questions generally is of her probity is she honest so here if you would be able to judge of the man your first question is what for a paymaster is he how does he pay his billsstrongly intimating and indeed very reasonably that if he has any credit or any regard to his credit he will be sure to pay his bills well and if he does not pay his bills well he cannot be sound at bottom because he would never suffer a slur there if it were possible for him to avoid it on the other hand if a tradesman pays his bills punctually let whatever other slur be upon his reputation his credit will hold good i knew a man in the city who upon all occasions of business issued promissory notes or notes under his hand at such or such time and it was for an immense sum of money that he gave out such notes so that they became frequent in trade and at length people began to carry them about to discount which lessened the gentleman so much though he was really a man of substance that his bills went at last at twenty per cent discount or more and yet this man maintained his credit by this that though he would always take as much time as he could get in these notes yet when they came due they were always punctually paid to a day no man came twice for his money  this was a trying case for though upon the multitude of his notes that were out and by reason of the large discount given upon them his credit at first suffered exceedingly and men began to talk very dubiously of him yet upon the punctual discharge of them when due it began presently to be taken notice of and said openly how well he paid his notes upon which presently the rate of his discount fell and in a short time all his notes were at par so that punctual payment in spite of rumour and of a rumour not so ill grounded as rumours generally are prevailed and established the credit of the person who was indeed rich at bottom but might have found it hard enough to have stood it if as his bills had a high discount upon them they had been ill paid too all which confirms what i have hitherto alleged namely of how much concern it is for a tradesman to pay his bills and promissory notes very punctually  i might argue here how much it is his interest to do so and how it enables him to coin as many bills as he pleasesin short a man whose notes are currently paid and the credit of whose bills is established by their being punctually paid has an infinite advantage in trade he is a bank to himself he can buy what bargains he pleases no advantage in business offers but he can grasp at it for his notes are current as another mans cash if he buys at time in the country he has nothing to do but to order them to draw for the money when it is due and he gains all the time given in the bills into the bargain  if he knows what he buys and how to put it off he buys a thousand pounds worth of goods at once sells them for less time than he buys at and pays them with their own money i might swell this discourse to a volume by itself to set out the particular profit that such a man may make of his credit and how he can raise what sums he will by buying goods and by ordering the people whom he is to pay in the country to draw bills on him nor is it any loss to those he buys of for as all the remitters of money know his bills and they are currently paid they never scruple delivering their money upon his bills so that the countryman or manufacturer is effectually supplied and the time given in the bill is the property of the current dealer on whom they are drawn  but then let me add a caution here for the best of tradesmen not to neglectnamely as the tradesman should take care to pay his bills and notes currently so that he may do it he must be careful what notes he issues out and how he suffers others to draw on him he that is careful of his reputation in business will also be cautious not to let any man he deals with over draw him or draw upon him before the money drawn for his due and as to notes promissory or under his hand he is careful not to give out such notes but on good occasions and where he has the effects in his hand to answer them this keeps his cash whole and preserves his ability of performing and punctually paying when the notes become due and the want of this caution has ruined the reputation of a tradesman many times when he might otherwise have preserved himself in as good credit and condition as other men  all these cautions are made thus needful on account of that one useful maxim that the tradesmans all depends upon his punctual complying with the payment of his bills  footnotes  46 by factors defoe seems to mean the class of persons whom we now name commissionagents  47 all bills and promissory notes inland or foreign payable in this country are allowed three days of grace beyond the actual period expressed upon them thus a bill drawn at thirty days after date is payable only on the thirtythird day if bills be not presented for payment on the last day of grace they cannot be protested and consitute only an evidence of the debt for legal recovery if the last day of grace be a sunday the bill is presentible on the saturday previous  48 in consequence of the great extension of commerce since the time of defoe a short explanation of the principle and practice of drawing foreign bills of exchange now seems necessary foreign bills of exchange are used in order to avoid the necessity of transmitting actual money from one country to another a merchant for instance in nova scotia is owing £100 to a manufacturer in glasgow he seeks out some one who is a creditor to that amount to some person in britain we shall say he finds a captain in the army who wishes to draw £100 from his agent in london to this captain the nova scotia merchant pays £100 and gets his order or bill on the london agent which bill he sends to the manufacturer in glasgow and the manufacturer transmits the bill to london for payment any banker indeed will give him the money for it deducting a small commission thus two debts are liquidated without the transmission of a farthing in money the demand for bills in foreign countries to send to great britain has the effect of raising them to a premium which is called the rate of exchange and is a burden which falls on the purchaser of the bill foreign bills of exchange drawn on parties in great britain have expressed upon them the number of days after sight at which they are to be payable thus a merchant on receiving a foreign bill drawn at thirty days after sight hastens to get it sighted or shown to the party on whom it is drawn and that party accepts it at the same time marking the date of doing so the bill is then complete and negociable and is presented for payment to the acceptor at the end of the time specified allowing the usual three days of grace should the bill not be accepted on being sighted it is a dishonoured bill and is returned with a legal protest to the foreign correspondent to avert as far as possible the loss of foreign bills by shipwreck a set of three bills is drawn for each transaction called first second and third of the same tenor for example thirty days after sight pay this my first bill of exchange for the sum of £100 sterling second and third of the same tenor being unpaid this first bill is first sent and by next conveyance the second is sent should the first arrive safely the second on making its appearance is destroyed the third is retained by the foreign correspondent till he hear whether the former two have arrived at their destination and is sent only if they have been lost on receiving whichever comes first it is the duty of the receiver to communicate intelligence of the fact to the sender
