filmed with rain that claire fancied she was piloting a drowned car in dim spaces under the sea when it was open drops jabbed into her eyes and chilled her cheeks she was excited and thoroughly miserable she realized that these minnesota country roads had no respect for her polite experience on long island parkways she felt like a woman not like a driver  but the gomezdep roadster had seventy horsepower and sang songs since she had left minneapolis nothing had passed her back yonder a truck had tried to crowd her and she had dropped into a ditch climbed a bank returned to the road and after that the truck was not now she was regarding a view more splendid than mountains above a garden by the seaa stretch of good road to her passenger her father claire chanted  heavenly theres some gravel we can make time well hustle on to the next town and get dry  yes but dont mind me youre doing very well her father sighed  instantly the dismay of it rushing at her she saw the end of the patch of gravel the road ahead was a wet black smear crisscrossed with ruts the car shot into a morass of prairie gumbowhich is mud mixed with tar flypaper fish glue and wellchewed chocolatecovered caramels when cattle get into gumbo the farmers send for the stumpdynamite and try blasting  it was her first really bad stretch of road she was frightened then she was too appallingly busy to be frightened or to be miss claire boltwood or to comfort her uneasy father she had to drive her frail graceful arms put into it a vicious vigor that was genius  when the wheels struck the slime they slid they wallowed the car skidded it was terrifyingly out of control it began majestically to turn toward the ditch she fought the steering wheel as though she were shadowboxing but the car kept contemptuously staggering till it was sideways straight across the road somehow it was back again eating into a rut going ahead she didnt know how she had done it but she had got it back she longed to take time to retrace her own cleverness in steering she didnt she kept going  the car backfired slowed she yanked the gear from third into first she sped up the motor ran like a terrified pounding heart while the car crept on by inches through filthy mud that stretched ahead of her without relief  she was battling to hold the car in the principal rut she snatched the windshield open and concentrated on that left rut she felt that she was keeping the wheel from climbing those high sides of the rut those sixinch walls of mud sparkling with tiny grits her mind snarled at her arms let the ruts do the steering youre just fighting against them it worked once she let the wheels alone they comfortably followed the furrows and for three seconds she had that delightful belief of every motorist after every mishap now that this particular disagreeableness is over ill never never have any trouble again  but suppose the engine overheated ran out of water anxiety twanged at her nerves and the deep distinctive ruts were changing to a complex pattern like the rails in a city switchyard she picked out the track of the one motor car that had been through here recently it was marked with the swastika tread of the rear tires that track was her friend she knew and loved the driver of a car she had never seen in her life  she was very tired she wondered if she might not stop for a moment then she came to an upslope the car faltered felt indecisive beneath her she jabbed down the accelerator her hands pushed at the steering wheel as though she were pushing the car the engine picked up sulkily kept going to the eye there was merely a rise in the rolling ground but to her anxiety it was a mountain up which shenot the engine but herselfpulled this bulky mass till she had reached the top and was safe againfor a second still there was no visible end of the mud  in alarm she thought how long does it last i cant keep this up ioh  the guiding tread of the previous car was suddenly lost in a mass of heaving bubblescattered mud like a batter of black dough she fairly picked up the car and flung it into that welter through it and back into the reappearing swastikamarked trail  her father spoke youre biting your lips theyll bleed if you dont look out better stop and rest  cant no bottom to this mud once stop and lose momentumstuck for keeps  she had ten more minutes of it before she reached a combination of bridge and culvert with a plank platform above a big tile drain with this solid plank bottom she could stop silence came roaring down as she turned the switch the bubbling water in the radiator steamed about the cap claire was conscious of tautness of the cords of her neck in front of a pain at the base of her brain her father glanced at her curiously i must be a wreck im sure my hair is frightful she thought but forgot it as she looked at him his face was unusually pale in the tumult of activity he had been betrayed into letting the old despondent look blur his eyes and sag his mouth must get on she determined  claire was dainty of habit she detested untwisted hair ripped gloves muddy shoes hesitant as a cat by a puddle she stepped down on the bridge even on these planks the mud was three inches thick it squidged about her low spatted shoes eeh she squeaked  she tiptoed to the toolbox and took out a folding canvas bucket she edged down to the trickling stream below she was miserably conscious of a pastoral scene all gone to mildewcows beneath willows by the creek milkweeds dripping dried mullein weed stalks no longer dry the bank of the stream was so slippery that she shot down two feet and nearly went sprawling her knee did touch the bank and the skirt of her gray sportssuit showed a smear of yellow earth  in less than two miles the racing motor had used up so much water that she had to make four trips to the creek before she had filled the radiator when she had climbed back on the runningboard she glared down at spats and shoes turned into gray lumps she was not tearful she was angry  idiot ought to have put on my rubbers welltoo late now she observed as she started the engine  she again followed the swastika tread to avoid a hole in the road ahead the unknown driver had swung over to the side of the road and taken to the intensely black earth of the edge of an unfenced cornfield flashing at claire came the sight of a deep waterfilled hole scattered straw and brush d√©bris of a battlefield which made her gaspingly realize that her swastikaed leader had been stuck and  and instantly her own car was stuck  she had had to put the car at that hole it dropped far down and it stayed down the engine stalled she started it but the back wheels spun merrily round and round without traction she did not make one inch when she again killed the blatting motor she let it stay dead she peered at her father  he was not a father just now but a passenger trying not to irritate the driver he smiled in a waxy way and said hard luck well you did the best you could the other hole there in the road would have been just as bad youre a fine driver dolly  her smile was warm and real no im a fool you told me to put on chains i didnt i deserve it  well anyway most men would be cussing you acquire merit by not beating me i believe thats done in moments like this if youd like ill get out and crawl around in the mud and play turtle for you  no im quite all right i did feel frightfully strongminded as long as there was any use of it it kept me going but now i might just as well be cheerful because were stuck and were probably going to stay stuck for the rest of this carefree summer day  the weariness of the long strain caught her all at once she slipped forward sat huddled her knees crossed under the edge of the steering wheel her hands falling beside her one of them making a faint brushing sound as it slid down the upholstery her eyes closed as her head drooped farther she fancied she could hear the vertebrae click in her tense neck  her father was silent a misty figure in a laprobe the rain streaked the mica lights in the sidecurtains a distant train whistled desolately across the sodden fields the inside of the car smelled musty the quiet was like a blanket over the ears claire was in a hazy drowse she felt that she could never drive again     chapter ii  claire escapes from respectability   claire boltwood lived on the heights brooklyn persons from new york and other parts of the middlewest have been known to believe that brooklyn is somehow humorous in newspaper jokes and vaudeville it is so presented that people who are willing to take their philosophy from those sources believe that the leading citizens of brooklyn are all deacons undertakers and obstetricians the fact is that north washington square at its reddest and whitest and fanlightedest gramercy park at its most ivied are not so aristocratic as the section of brooklyn called the heights here preached henry ward beecher here in mansions like mausoleums on the ridge above docks where the good ships came sailing in from sourabaya and singapore ruled the lords of a thousand sails and still is it a place of wealth too solid to emulate the nimble selfadvertising of fifth avenue here dwell the fifthgeneration possessors of blocks of foundries and shipyards here in a big brick house of much dignity much ugliness and much conservatory lived claire boltwood with her widower father  henry b boltwood was vicepresident of a firm dealing in railway supplies he was neither wealthy nor at all poor every summer despite claires delicate hints they took the same cottage on the jersey coast and mr boltwood came down for sunday claire had gone to a good school out of philadelphia on the main line she was used to gracious leisure attractive uselessness nutcenter chocolates and a certain wonder as to why she was alive  she wanted to travel but her father could not get away he consistently spent his days in overworking and his evenings in wishing he hadnt overworked he was attractive fresh pinkcheeked whitemustached and nervetwitching with years of detail  claires ambition had once been babies and a solid husband but as various young males of the species appeared before her sang their mating songs and preened their newly drycleaned plumage she found that the trouble with solid young men was that they were solid though she liked to dance the dancing men bored her and she did not understand the districts quota of intellectuals very well she was good at listening to symphony concerts but she never had much luck in discussing the cleverness of the wood winds in taking up the main motif it is history that she refused a master of arts with an old violin a good taste in ties and an income of eight thousand  the only man who disturbed her was geoffrey saxton known throughout the interwoven sets of brooklyn heights as jeff jeff saxton was thirtynine to claires twentythree he was clean and busy he had no signs of vice or humor especially for jeff must have been invented the symbolic morning coat the unwrinkable gray trousers and the moral rimless spectacles he was a graduate of a nice college and he had a nice tenor and a nice family and nice hands and he was nicely successful in new york copper dealing when he was asked questions by people who were impertinent clever or poor jeff looked them over coldly before he answered and often they felt so uncomfortable that he didnt have to answer  the boys of claires own age not long out of yale and princeton doing well in business and jumping for their evening clothes daily at sixthirty light o loves and admirers of athletic heroes these lads claire found pleasant but hard to tell apart she didnt have to tell jeff saxton apart he did his own telling jeff callednot too often he sangnot too sentimentally he took her father and herself to the theaternot too lavishly he told clairein a voice not too seriousthat she was his helmed athena his rose of all the world he informed her of his substantial positionnot too obviously and he was so everlastingly firmly quietly politely immovably always there  she watched the hulk of marriage drifting down on her frail speedboat of aspiration and steered in desperate circles  then her father got the nervous prostration he had richly earned the doctor ordered rest claire took him in charge he didnt want to travel certainly he didnt want the shore or the adirondacks as there was a branch of his company in minneapolis she lured him that far away  being rootedly of brooklyn heights claire didnt know much about the west she thought that milwaukee was the capital of minnesota she was not so uninformed as some of her friends however she had heard that in dakota wheat was to be viewed in vast tractsmaybe a hundred acres  mr boltwood could not be coaxed to play with the people to whom his minneapolis representative introduced him he was overworking again and perfectly happy he was hoping to find something wrong with the branch house claire tried to tempt him out to the lakes she failed his nervefuse burnt out the second time with much fireworks  claire had often managed her circle of girls but it had never occurred to her to manage her executive father save by indirect and pretty teasing now in conspiracy with the doctor she bullied her father he saw gray death waiting as alternative and he was meek he agreed to everything he consented to drive with her across two thousand miles of plains and mountains to seattle to drop in for a call on their cousins the eugene gilsons  back east they had a chauffeur and two carsthe limousine and the gomezdeperdussin roadster claires beloved it would she believed be more of a change from everything that might whisper to mr boltwood of the control of men not to take a chauffeur her father never drove but she could she insisted his easy agreeing was pathetic he watched her with spaniel eyes they had the gomez roadster shipped to them from new york  on a july morning they started out of minneapolis in a mist and as it has been hinted they stopped sixty miles northward in a rain also in much gumbo apparently their nearest approach to the pacific ocean would be this oceanically moist edge of a cornfield between schoenstrom and gopher prairie minnesota                                       claire roused from her damp doze and sighed well i must get busy and get the car out of this  dont you think youd better get somebody to help us  but get who  whom  no its just who when youre in the mud no one of the good things about an adventure like this is that i must do things for myself ive always had people to do things for me maids and nice teachers and you old darling i suppose its made me soft softi would like a soft davenport and a novel and a pound of almondbrittle and get all sick and not feel so beastly virile as i do just now but  she turned up the collar of her gray tweed coat painfully climbed outthe muscles of her back rackingand examined the state of the rear wheels they were buried to the axle in front of them the mud bulked in solid shiny blackness she took out her jack and chains it was too late there was no room to get the jack under the axle she remembered from the narratives of motoring friends that brush in mud gave a firmer surface for the wheels to climb upon  she also remembered how jolly and agreeably heroic the accounts of their mishaps had soundeda week after they were over  she waded down the road toward an old woodlot at first she tried to keep dry but she gave it up and there was pleasure in being defiantly dirty she tramped straight through puddles she wallowed in mud in the woodlot was long grass which soaked her stockings till her ankles felt itchy claire had never expected to be so very intimate with a brushpile she became so as though she were a pioneer woman who had been toiling here for years she came to know the brush stick by stickthe long valuable branch that she could never quite get out from under the others the thorny bough that pricked her hands every time she tried to reach the curious bundle of switches  seven trips she made carrying armfuls of twigs and solemnly dragging large boughs behind her she patted them down in front of all four wheels her crisp hands looked like the paws of a threeyearold boy making a mud fort her nails hurt from the mud wedged beneath them her mudcaked shoes were heavy to lift it was with exquisite selfapproval that she sat on the runningboard scraped a carload of lignite off her soles climbed back into the car punched the starter  the car stirred crept forward one inch and settled backone inch the second time it heaved encouragingly but did not make quite so much headway then claire did sob  she rubbed her cheek against the comfortable rough heathersmelling shoulder of her fathers coat while he patted her and smiled good girl i better get out and help  she sat straight shook her head nope ill do it and im not going to insist on being heroic any longer ill get a farmer to pull us out  as she let herself down into the ooze she reflected that all farmers have hearts of gold anatomical phenomena never found among the snobs and hirelings of new york the nearest heart of gold was presumably beating warmly in the house a quarter of a mile ahead  she came up a muddy lane to a muddy farmyard with a muddy cur yapping at her wet legs and geese hissing in a pool of purest mud serene the house was small and rather old it may have been painted once the barn was large and new it had been painted very much and in a blinding red with white trimmings there was no brass plate on the house but on the barn in huge white letters was the legend adolph zolzac 1913  she climbed by log steps to a narrow frame back porch littered with parts of a broken creamseparator she told herself that she was simple and friendly in going to the back door instead of the front and it was with gaiety that she knocked on the illjointed screen door which flapped dismally in response  ja from within  she rapped again  hinein  she opened the door on a kitchen the highlight of which was a table heaped with dishes of dumplings and salt pork a shirtsleeved man all covered with mustache and calm sat by the table and he kept right on sitting as he inquired  vell  my carmy automobilehas been stuck in the mud a bad driver im afraid i wonder if you would be so good as to  i usually get tree dollars but i dunno as i vant to do it for less than four today i aind feelin very goot grumbled the goldenhearted  claire was aware that a woman whom she had not noticedso much smaller than the dumplings so much less vigorous than the salt pork was shewas speaking aber papa dots a shame you sharge de poor young lady dot when she drive by sei self vot she tink of de sherman people  the farmer merely grunted to claire yuh four dollars dots what i usually charge sometimes  usually do you mean to say that you leave that hole there in the road right alongthat people keep on trying to avoid it and get stuck as i was oh if i were an official  vell i dunno i dont guess i run my place to

i make fortyfive dollars they vos all glad to pay they say i help them fine i dont see vot youre kickin about oh these vimmins  its blackmail i wouldnt pay it if it werent for my father sitting waiting out there butgo ahead hurry  she sat tapping her toe while zolzac completed the stertorous task of hogging the dumplings then stretched yawned scratched and covered his merely dirty garments with overalls that were apparently woven of processed mud when he had gone to the barn for his team his wife came to claire on her drained face were the easy tears of the slave women  oh miss i dont know vot i should do my boys go on the public school and they speak american just so goot as you oh i vant man lets me luff america but papa he says it is an unsinn you got the money he says nobody should care if you are american or old country people i should vish i could ride once in an automobile buti am so shamed so shamed that i must sit and see my mann make this forty years i been married to him and pretty soon i die  claire patted her hand there was nothing to say to tragedy that had outlived hope  adolph zolzac clumped out to the highroad behind his vast rollingflanked horsesso much cleaner and better fed than his wisp of a wife claire followed him and in her heart she committed murder and was glad of it while mr boltwood looked out with mild wonder at claires new friend zolzac hitched his team to the axle it did not seem possible that two horses could pull out the car where seventy horsepower had fainted but easily yawning and thinking about dinner the horses drew the wheels up on the mudbank out of the hole and  the harness broke with a flying mess of straps and rope and the car plumped with perfect exactness back into its bed     chapter iii  a young man in a raincoat   huh such an auto look it break my harness aready two dollar that cost you to mend it de auto iss too heavy stormed zolzac  all right all right only for heavens sakego get another harness claire shrieked  fifefifty dot will be in all zolzac grinned  claire was standing in front of him she was thinking of other drivers poor people in old cars who had been at the mercy of this goldenhearted one she stared past him in the direction from which she had come another motor was in sight  it was a tin beetle of a car that agile cheerful rutjumping model known as a bug with a hometacked homepainted tin cowl and tail covering the stripped chassis of a little cheap teal car the lone driver wore an old black raincoat with an atrocious corduroy collar and a new plaid cap in the harry lauder tartan the bug skipped through mud where the boltwoods gomez had slogged and rolled its pilot drove up behind her car and leaped out he trotted forward to claire and zolzac his eyes were twentyseven or eight but his pink cheeks were twenty and when he smiledshyly radiantlyhe was no age at all but eternal boy claire had a blurred impression that she had seen him before some place along the road  stuck he inquired not very intelligently how much is adolph charging you  he wants threefifty and his harness broke and he wants two dollars  oh so hes still working that old gag ive heard all about adolph he keeps that harness for pulling out cars and it always busts the last time though he only charged six bits to get it mended now let me reason with him  the young man turned with vicious quickness and for the first time claire heard pidgin germangerman as it is spoken between americans who have never learned it and germans who have forgotten it  schon sex hundred times ich h√∂re all about the way you been doing autos zolzac you verfluchter schweinhund and ill set the sheriff on you  dot aind true maybe einmal die woche kommt somebody and ich muss die arbeit immer lassen und in die regen ausgehen und seh mal how die boots sint mit mud covered two dollars it dont pay for die boots  now thats enoughplenty out of you seien die boots verdammt and mach dass du fort gehstmuddy boots hellput mal ein egg in die boots and beat it verleicht maybe ill by golly arrest you myself weiss du im a special deputy sheriff  the young man stood stockily he seemed to swell as his somewhat muddy hand was shaken directly at under and about the circumference of adolph zolzacs hairy nose the farmer was stronger but he retreated he took up the reins he whined dont i get nothing i break de harness  sure you get tenyears and you get out  from thirty yards up the road zolzac flung back you tink youre pretty damn smart that was his last serious reprisal  clumsily as one not used to it the young man lifted his cap to claire showing straight wiry ropecolored hair brushed straight back from a rather fine forehead gee i was sorry to have to swear and holler like that but its all adolph understands please dont think theres many of the folks around here like him they say hes the meanest man in the county  im immensely grateful to you butdo you know much about motors how can i get out of this mud  she was surprised to see the youngster blush his clear skin flooded his engaging smile came again and he hesitated let me pull you out  she looked from her hulking car to his mechanical flea  he answered the look i can do it all right im used to the gumboregular mudhen just add my power to yours have you a towrope  no i never thought of bringing one  ill get mine  she walked with him back toward his bug it lacked not only top and sidecurtains but even windshield and runningboard it was a toya cardboard box on toothpick axles strapped to the bulging back was a wicker suitcase partly covered by tarpaulin from the seat peered a little furry face  a cat she exclaimed as he came up with a wire rope extracted from the tin back  yes shes the captain of the boat im just the engineer  what is her name  before he answered the young man strode ahead to the front of her car claire obediently trotting after him he stooped to look at her front axle he raised his head glanced at her and he was blushing again  her name is vere de vere he confessed then he fled back to his bug he drove it in front of the gomezdep the hole in the road itself was as deep as the one on the edge of the cornfield where she was stuck but he charged it she was fascinated by his skill where she would for a tenth of a second have hesitated while choosing the best course he hurled the bug straight at the hole plunged through with sheets of glassy black water arching on either side then viciously twisted the car to the right to the left and straight again as he followed the tracks with the solidest bottoms  strapped above the tiny angleiron step which replaced his runningboard was an old spade he dug channels in front of the four wheels of her car so that they might go up inclines instead of pushing against the straight walls of mud they had thrown up on these inclines he strewed the brush she had brought halting to ask with head alertly lifted from his stooped huddle in the mud did you have to get this brush yourself  yes horrid wet  he merely shook his head in commiseration  he fastened the towrope to the rear axle of his car to the front of hers now will you be ready to put on all your power as i begin to pull he said casually rather respectfully  when the struggling bug had pulled the wire rope taut she opened the throttle the rope trembled her car seemed to draw sullenly back then it came outoutreally out which is the most joyous sensation any motorist shall ever know in excitement over actually moving again as fast as any healthy young snail she drove on on the young man ahead grinning back at her nor did she stop nor he till both cars were safe on merely thick mud a quarter of a mile away  she switched off the powerand suddenly she was in a whirlwind of dizzy sickening tiredness even in her abandonment to exhaustion she noticed that the young man did not stare at her but keeping his back to her removed the towrope and stowed it away in his bug she wondered whether it was tact or yokelish indifference  her father spoke for the first time since the galahad of the tin bug had come how much do you think we ought to give this fellow  now of all the cosmic problems yet unsolved not cancer nor the future of poverty are the flustering questions but these twain which is worse not to wear evening clothes at a party at which you find every one else dressed or to come in evening clothes to a house where it proves they are never worn and which is worse not to tip when a tip has been expected or to tip when the tip is an insult  in discomfort of spirit and wetness of ankles claire shuddered oh dear i dont believe he expects us to pay him he seems like an awfully independent person maybe wed offend him if we offered  the only reasonable thing to be offended at in this vale of tears is not being offered money  just the same oh dear im so tired but good little claire will climb out and be diplomatic  she pinched her forehead to hold in her cracking brain and wabbled out into new scenes of mud and wetness but she came up to the young man with the most rainwashed and careless of smiles wont you come back and meet my father hes terribly grateful to youas i am and may we youve worked so hard and about saved our lives may i pay you for that labor were really much indebted  oh it wasnt anything tickled to death if i could help you  he heartily shook hands with her father and he droned pleased to meet you mr uh  boltwood  mr boltwood my name is miltmilton daggett see you have a new york license on your car we dont see but mighty few of those through here glad i could help you  ah yes mr daggett mr boltwood was uninterestedly fumbling in his money pocket behind milt daggett claire shook her head wildly rattling her hands as though she were playing castanets mr boltwood shrugged he did not understand his relations with young men in cheap raincoats were entirely monetary they did something for you and you paid thempreferably not too muchand they ceased to be whereas milt daggett respectfully but stolidly continued to be and mr henry boltwoods own daughter was halting the march of affairs by asking irrelevant questions  didnt we see you back inwhat was that village we came through back about twelve miles  schoenstrom suggested milt  yes i think that was it didnt we pass you or something we stopped at a garage there to change a tire  i dont think so i was in town though this morning say uh did you and your father grab any eats  a  i mean did you get dinner there  no i wish we had  well say i didnt either andid be awfully glad if you folks would have something to eat with me now  claire tried to give him a smile but the best she could do was to lend him one she could not associate interesting food with milt and his mudslobbered tincovered dunpainted teal bug he seemed satisfied with her dubious grimace by his suggestion they drove ahead to a spot where the cars could be parked on firm grass beneath oaks on the way mr boltwood lifted his voice in dismay his touch of nervous prostration had not made him queer or violent he retained a touching faith in good food  we might find some good little hotel and have some chops and just some mushrooms and peas insisted the man from brooklyn heights  oh i dont suppose the country hotels are really so awfully good she speculated and lookthat nice funny boy we couldnt hurt his feelings hes having so much fun out of being a good samaritan  from the mysterious rounded back of his car milt daggett drew a tiny stove to be heated by a can of solidified alcohol a frying pan that was rather large for dolls but rather small for squarefingered hands a jar of bacon eggs in a bag a coffee pot a can of condensed milk and a litter of unsorted tin plates and china cups while by his request claire scoured the plates and cups he made bacon and eggs and coffee the little stove in the bottom of his car sheltered by the cooks bending over it the smell of food made claire forgiving toward the fact that she was wet through that the rain continued to drizzle down her neck  he lifted his hand and demanded take your shoes off  uh  he gulped he stammered i meani mean your shoes are soaked through if youll sit in the car ill put your shoes up by the engine its pretty well heated from racing it in the mud you can get your stockings dry under the cowl  she was amused by the elaborateness with which he didnt glance at her while she took off her low shoes and slipped her quite too thin black stockings under the protecting tin cowl she reflected he has such a nice awkward gentleness but such bad taste theyre really quite good ankles apparently ankles are not done in teal bug circles his sisters dont even have limbs but do fairies have sisters he is a fairy when im out of the mud hell turn his raincoat into a pair of lordly white wings and vanish but what will become of the cat  thus her tired brain like a squirrel in a revolving cage while she sat primly and scraped at a clot of rust on a tin plate and watched him put on the bacon and eggs wondering if cats were used for this purpose in the daggett family she put soaked unhappy vere de vere on her feet to her own great comfort and the cats delight it was an open car and the rain still rained and a strange young man was a foot from her tending the not very crackly fire but rarely had claire felt so domestic  milt was apparently struggling to say something after several bobs of his head he ventured youre so wet id like for you to take my raincoat  no really im already soaked through you keep dry  he was unhappy about it he plucked at a button of the coat she turned him from the subject i hope lady vere de vere is getting warm too  seems to be shes kind of demanding she wanted a little car of her own but i didnt think she could keep up with me not on a long hike  a little car with her paws on the tiny wheel ohsweet are you going far mr daggett  yes quite a ways to seattle washington  oh really extraordinary were going there too  honest you driving all the way oh no of course your father  no he doesnt drive by the way i hope he isnt too miserable back there  ill be darned both of us going to seattle thats what they call a coincidence isnt it hope ill see you on the road some time but i dont suppose i will once youre out of the mud your gomez will simply lose my teal  not necessarily youre the better driver and i shall take it easy are you going to stay long in seattle it was not merely a polite dinnerpayment question she wondered she could not place this freshcheeked unworldly young man so far from his home  why i kind of hope government railroad alaska im going to try to get in on that somehow ive never been out of minnesota in my life but theres couple mountains and oceans and things i thought id like to see so i just put my suitcase and vere de vere in the machine and started out i burn distillate instead of gas so it doesnt cost much if i ever happen to have five whole dollars why i might go on to japan  that would be jolly  though i spose id have to eatwhat is itpickled fish theres a woman from near my town went to the orient as a missionary from what she says i guess all you need in japan to make a house is a bottle of mucilage and a couple of old newspapers and some twobyfours and you can have the house on a purple mountain with cherry trees down below and he put his clenched hand to his lips his head was bowed and the ocean lord the ocean and well see it at seattle bay anyway and steamers therejust come from india huh getting pretty darn poetic here eggs are done  the young man did not again wander into visions he was all briskness as he served her bacon and eggs took a plate of them to mr boltwood in the gomez gouged into his own having herself scoured the tin plates claire was not repulsed by their naked tinniness and the coffee in the brokenhandled china cup was tolerable milt drank from the top of a vacuum bottle he was silent immediately after the lunch he stowed the things away claire expected a drawnout tactdemanding farewell but he climbed into his bug said goodby miss boltwood good luck and was gone  the rainy road was bleakly empty without him  it did not seem possible that claires body could be nagged into going on any longer her muscles were relaxed her nerves frayed but the moment the gomez started she discovered that magic change which every longdistance motorist knows instantly she was alert seemingly able to drive forever the pilots instinct ruled her gave her tireless eyes and sturdy hands surely she had never been weary never would be so long as it was hers to keep the car going  she had driven perhaps six miles when she reached a hamlet called st klopstock on the bedraggled mudandshanty main street a man was loading crushed rock into a truck by him was a large person in a prosperous raincoat who stepped out held up his hand claire stopped  you the young lady that got stuck in that hole by adolph zolzacs  yes and mr zolzac wasnt very nice about it  hes going to be just elegant about it now and there aint going to be any more hole i think adolph has been keeping it muddythrowing in soft dirtand he made a good and plenty lot out of pulling out tourists bill and i are going down right now and fill it up with stone milt daggett come through herehes got a nerve that fellow but i did have to laughhe says to me barney this was just now he hasnt more than just drove out of town he said to me barney he says youre the richest man in this township and the banker and you got a big car yself and you think youre one whale of a political boss he says and yet you let that zolzac maintain a private ocean against the peace and damn horrible inconvenience of the commonwealth of minnesota hes got a great line of talk that fellow he told me how you got stuckmade me so ashamedi been to new york myselfand right away i got bill and were going down and hold a donation and surprise party on adolph and fill that hole  but wont adolph dig it out again  the banker was puffy but his eyes were of stone from the truck he took a shotgun he drawled in that case the surprise party will include an elegant wake  but how did who is this extraordinary milt daggett  him oh nobody specially hes just a fellow down here at schoenstrom but we all know him goes to all the dances thirty miles around thing about him is if he sees something wrong he picks out some poor fellow like me and says what he thinks  claire drove on she was aware that she was looking for milts bug it was not in sight  father she exclaimed do you realize that this lad didnt tell us he was going to have the hole filled just did it he frightens me im afraid that when we reach gopher prairie for the night well find he has engaged for us the suite that prince collars and cuffs once slept in  hhhhmm yawned her father  curious young man he said pleased to meet you  huuuuhhm fresh air makes me so sleepy  and fooled you got through that mudhole anyway and he said look fields stretch out so here and not a tree except the willowgroves round those farmhouses and he said gee so many times and dinner for the noon meal and his nails no i suppose he really is just a farm youngster  mr boltwood did not answer his machinefinish smile indicated an enormous lack of interest in young men in teal bugs     chapter iv  a room without   gopher prairie has all of five thousand people its commercial club asserts that it has at least a thousand more population and an infinitely better band than the ridiculously envious neighboring town of joralemon but there were few signs that a suite had been engaged for the boltwoods or that prince collars and cuffs had on his royal tour of america spent much time in gopher prairie claire reached it somewhat before seven she gaped at it in a hazy way though this was her first prairie town for a considerable stay she could not pump up interest  the state of mind of the touring motorist entering a strange place at night is as peculiar and definite as that of a prospector it is compounded of gratitude at having got safely in of perception of a new town yet with all eagerness about new things dulled by weariness of hope that there is going to be a good hotel but small expectationand absolutely no probabilitythat there really will be one  claire had only a blotched impression of peaked wooden buildings and squatty brick stores with faded awnings of a red grain elevator and a crouching station and a lumberyard then of the hopelessly muddy road leading on again into the country she felt that if she didnt stop at once she would miss the town entirely the drivinginstinct sustained her made her take corners sharply spot a garage send the gomez whirling in on the cement floor  the garage attendant looked at her and yawned  where do you want the car claire asked sharply  oh stick it in that stall grunted the man and turned his back  claire glowered at him she thought of a good line about rudeness butoh she was too tired to fuss she tried to run the car into the empty stall which was not a stall but a space like a missing tooth between two cars and so narrow that she was afraid of crumpling the lordly fenders of the gomez she ran down the floor returned with a flourish thought she was going to back straight into the stalland found she wasnt while her nerves shrieked and it did not seem possible that she could change gears she managed to get the gomez behind a truck and sideon to the stall  go forward again and cramp your wheelsharp ordered the garage man  claire wanted to outline what she thought of him but she merely demanded will you kindly drive it in  why sure you bet said the man casually his readiness ruined her inspired fury she was somewhat disappointed  as she climbed out of the car and put a hand on the smart bags strapped on a runningboard the accumulated weariness struck her in a shock she could have driven on for hours but the instant the car was safe for the night she went to pieces her ears rang her eyes were soaked in fire her mouth was dry the back of her neck pinched it was her father who took the lead as they rambled to the one tolerable hotel in the town  in the hotel claire was conscious of the ugliness of the poisongreen walls and brass cuspidors and insurance calendars and bare floor of the office conscious of the interesting scientific fact that all air had been replaced by the essence of cigar smoke and cooking cabbage of the stares of the traveling men lounging in bored lines and of the lack of welcome on the part of the night clerk an oldish bleached man with whiskers instead of a collar  she tried to be important two rooms with bath please  the bleached man stared at her and shoved forward the register and a pen clotted with ink she signed he took the bags led the way to the stairs anxiously she asked both rooms are with bath  from the second step the night clerk looked down at her as though she were a specimen that ought to be pinned on the corks at once and he said loudly no maam neither of em got no rooms vacant with bawth or bath either not but what we got em in the house this is an uptodate place but one of ms took and the other has kind of been out of order the last threefour months  from the audience of drummers below a delicate giggle  claire was too angry to answer and too tired when after miles of stairs leagues of stuffy hall she reached her coop with its iron bed so loosejointed that it rattled to a breath its bureau with a list to port and its anemic rockingchair she dropped on the bed panting her eyes closed but still brimming with fire it did not seem that she could ever move again she felt chloroformed she couldnt even coax herself off the bed to see if her father was any better off in the next room  she was certain that she was not going to drive to seattle she wasnt going to drive anywhere she was going to freight the car back to minneapolis and herself go back by trainpullmandrawingroom  but for the thought of her father she would have fallen asleep in her drenched tweeds when she did force the energy to rise she had to support herself by the bureau by the foot of the bed as she moved about the room hanging up the wet suit rubbing herself with a slippery towel putting on a dark silk frock and pumps she found her father sitting motionless in his room staring at the wall she made herself laugh at him for his gloomy emptiness she paraded down the hall with him  as they reached the foot of the stairs the old one the night clerk leaned across the desk and in a voice that took the whole office into the conversation quizzed come from new york eh well youre quite a ways from home  claire nodded she felt shyer before these solemnly staring traveling men than she ever had in a box at the opera at the double door of the diningroom from which the cabbage smell steamed with a lustiness undiminished by the sad passing of its youth a man one of the averagesized averagemustached average businesssuited averagebrownhaired men who can never be remembered stopped the boltwoods and hawed saw you coming into town youve got a new york license  she couldnt deny it  quite a ways from home arent you  she had to admit it  she was escorted by a bouncing blackeyed waitress to a table for four the next table was a long one at which seven traveling men or local business men whose wives were at the lake for the summer ceased trying to get nourishment out of the food and gawped at her before the boltwoods were seated the waitress dabbed at nonexistent spots on their napkins ignored a genuine crumb on the cloth in front of claires plate made motions at a cup and a formerly plated fork and bubbled autoing through  claire fumbled for her chair oozed into it and breathed yes  going far  yes  where do you live  new york  my youre quite a ways from home arent you  apparently  hamnegs roasbeef roaspork thapplesauce frypickerel springlamintsauce  ii beg your pardon  the waitress repeated  iohoh bring us ham and eggs is that all right father  ohnowell  you wanted same the waitress inquired of mr boltwood  he was intimidated he said if you please and feebly pawed at a fork  the waitress was instantly back with soup and a collection of china gathered by a man of much travel catholic interests and no taste one of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in omaha she pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch mr boltwoods sleeve brushed the crumb from in front of claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips picked for a while gave it up put her hands on her hips and addressed claire  how far you going  to seattle  got any folks there  any oh yes i suppose so  going to stay there long  really we havent decided  come from new york eh quite a ways from home all right father in business there  yes  whats his line  i beg pardon  whats his line ouch jiminy these shoes pinch my feet i used to could dance all night but im getting fat i guess ha ha put on seven pounds last month ouch gee they certainly do pinch my toes what business you say your fathers in  i didnt say but oh railroad  g n or n p  i dont think i quite understand  mr boltwood interposed are the ham and eggs ready  ill beat it out and see when she brought them she put a spoon in claires saucer of peas and demanded say you dont wear that silk dress in the auto do you  no  i should think youd put a pink sash on it seems like its kind of plainits a real pretty piece of goods though a pink sash would be real pretty you darkcomplected ladies always looks better for a touch of color  then was claire certain that the waitress was baiting her for the amusement of the men at the long table she exploded probably the waitress did not know there had been an explosion when claire looked coldly up raised her brows looked down and poked the cold and salty slab of ham for she was continuing  a lightcomplected lady like me dont need so much color you notice my hair is black but im light really pete liverquist says im a blonde brunette gee he certainly is killing that fellow oh hes a case he sure does like to hear himself talk my theres old man walters he runs the telephone exchange here i heard he went down to st cloud on number 2 but i guess he couldnt of hell be yodeling for friend soup and a couple slabs of moo i better beat it ill say so so long  claires comment was as acid as the pale beets before her as bitter as the peas as hard as the lumps in the watery mashed potatoes  i dont know whether the woman is insane or ignorant i wish i could tell whether she was trying to make me angry for the benefit of those horrid unshaven men or merely for her private edification  by me dolly so is this pie lets get some medium to levitate us up to bed uhuh i think perhaps wed better not try to drive clear to seattle if we just went through to montanaor even just to bismarck  drive through with the hotels like this my dear man if we have one more such day we stop right there i hope we get by the man at the desk i have a feeling hes lurking there trying to think up something insulting to say to us oh my dear i hope you arent as beastly tired as i am my bones are hot pokers  the man at the desk got in only one cynical question driving far before claire seized her fathers arm and started him upstairs  for the first time since she had been tenand in a state of naughtiness immediately following a pronounced state of grace induced by the pulpit oratory of the new rector of st chrysostomsshe permitted herself the luxury of not stopping to brush her teeth before she went to bed her sleep was druggedit was not sleep but an aching exhaustion of the body which did not prevent her mind from revisualizing the road going stupidly over the muddy stretches and sharp corners then becoming conscious of that bed the lump under her shoulder blades the slope to westward and the creak that rose every time she tossed for at least fifteen minutes she lay awake for hours  thus claire boltwoods first voyage into democracy  it was not so much that the sun was shining in the morning as that a ripple of fresh breeze came through the window she discovered that she again longed to go onkeep going onsee new places conquer new roads she didnt want all good road she wanted something to struggle against shed try it for one more day she was stiff as she crawled out of bed but a rub with cold water left her feeling that she was stronger than she ever had been that she was a woman not a dependent girl already in the beating prairie sunglare the wide main street of gopher prairie was drying the mud ruts flattening out beyond the town hovered the note of a meadow larksunlight in sound  oh its a sweet morning sweet we will go on im terribly excited she laughed  she found her father dressed he did not know whether or not he wanted to go on i seem to have lost my grip on things i used to be rather decisive but well try it one more day if you like he said  when she had gaily marched him downstairs she suddenly and unhappily remembered the people she would have to face the gibing questions she would have to answer  the night clerk was still at the desk as though he had slept standing he hailed them well well up bright and early hope you folks slept well beds arent so good as they might be but were kind of planning to get some new mattresses but you get pretty good air to sleep in hope you have a fine hike today  his voice was cordial he was their old friend faithful watcher of their progress claire found herself dimpling at him  in the diningroom their inquisitional acquaintance the waitress fairly ran to them sit down folks waffles this morning you want to stock up for your drive my aint it an elegant morning i hope you have a swell drive today  why claire gasped why they arent rude they careabout people they never saw before thats why they ask questions i never thoughti never thought theres people in the world who want to know us without having looked us up in the social register im so ashamed not that the sunshine changes my impression of this coffee its frightful but that will improve and the peoplethey were being friendly all the time oh henry b young henry boltwood you and your godmother claire have a lot to learn about the world  as they came into the garage their surly acquaintance of the night before looked just as surly but claire tried a boisterous good morning  mornin going north better take the lefthand road at wakamin easier going drive your car out for you  as the car stood outside taking on gas a man flapped up spelled out the new york license looked at claire and her father and inquired quite a ways from home arent you  this time claire did not say yes she experimented with yes quite a ways  well hope you have a good trip good luck  claire leaned her head on her hand thought hard its i who wasnt friendly she propounded to her father how much ive been losing though i still refuse to like that coffee  she noticed the sign on the airhose of the garagefree air  theres our motto for the pilgrimage she cried  she knew the exaltation of starting out in the fresh morning for places she had never seen without the bond of having to return at night  thus claires second voyage into democracy  while she was starting the young man who had pulled her out of the mud and given her lunch was folding up the tarpaulin and blankets on which he had slept beside his teal bug in the woods three miles north of gopher prairie to the highwellborn cat vere de vere milt daggett mused aloud your ladyship as shakespeare says the man that gets cold feet never wins the girl and im scared cat clean scared     chapter v  release brakesshift to third   milt daggett had not been accurate in his implication that he had not noticed claire at a garage in schoenstrom for one thing he owned the garage  milt was the most prosperous young man in the village of schoenstrom neither the village itself nor the nearby strom is really schoen the entire business district of schoenstrom consists of heinie rauskukles general store which is brick the leipzig house which is frame the old home poolroom and restaurant which is of old logs concealed by a frame sheathing the farmmachinery agency which is galvanized iron its roof like an enlarged washboard the church the three saloons and the red trail garage which is also according to various signs the agency for teal car best at the test stonewall tire service station sewing machines and binders repaired dr hostrum the veterinarian every thursday gas today 27c  the red trail garage is of cement and tapestry brick in the office is a clean hardwood floor a typewriter and a picture of elsie ferguson the establishment has an automatic rimstretcher a wheel jack and a reputation for honesty  the father of milt daggett was the old doctor born in maine coming to this frontier in the day when chippewas camped in your dooryard and came in to help themselves to coffee which you made of roasted corn the old doctor bucked northwest blizzards read dickens and byron pulled people through typhoid and left to milt his shabby old medicine case and thousands of dollarsin uncollectible accounts mrs daggett had long since folded her crinkly hands in quiet death  milt had covered the first two years of high school by studying with the priest and been sent to the city of st cloud for the last two years his father had meant to send him to the state university but milt had been born to a talent for machinery at twelve he had made a telephone that worked at eighteen he was engineer in the tiny flour mill in schoenstrom at twentyfive when claire boltwood chose to come tearing through his life in a gomezdep milt was the owner manager bookkeeper wrecking crew ignition expert thoroughly competent billcollector and all but one of the working force of the red trail garage  there were two factions in schoenstrom the retired farmers who said that german was a good enough language for anybody and that taxes for schools and sidewalks were yes something crazy and the group who stated that a pigpen is a fine place but only for pigs to this second revolutionary wing belonged a few of the first generation most of the second and all of the third and its leader was milt daggett he did not talk much normally but when he thought things ought to be done he was as annoying as a machinegun test in the lot next to a quaker meeting  if there had been a war milt would probably have been in itrather casual clearing his throat reckoning and guessing that maybe his men might try going over and taking that hill  then taking it but all of this history concerns the year just before america spoke to germany and in this town buried among the cornfields and the wheat men still thought more about the price of grain than about the souls of nations  on the evening before claire boltwood left minneapolis and adventured into democracy milt was in the garage he wore union overalls that were tan where they were not greaseblack a faded blue cotton shirt and the crown of a derby with the rim not too neatly hacked off with a dull toadstabber jackknife  milt smiled at his assistant ben sittka and suggested well wie geht s mit the work eh like to stay and get the profs flivver out so he can have it in the morning  you bet boss  getting to be quite a mechanic ben  ill say so  if you get stuck come yank me out of the old home  aw rats boss ill finish it you beat it ben grinned at milt adoringly  milt stripped off his overalls and derbycrown and washed his big firm hands with gritty soft soap he cleaned his nails with a file which he carried in his upper vest pocket in a red imitation morocco case which contained a comb a mirror an indelible pencil and a notebook with the smudged pencil addresses of five girls in st cloud and a memorandum about rauskukles car  he put on a twisted brown tie an old blue serge suit and a hat which being old and shabby had become graceful he ambled up the street he couldnt have ambled more than three blocks and have remained on the street schoenstrom tended to leak off into jungles of tall corn  two men waved at him and one demanded say milt is whisky good for the toothache what d you think the doc said it didnt do any good but then gosh hes only just out of college  i guess hes right  is that a fact well ill keep off it then  two stores farther on a bulky farmer hailed say milt should i get an ensilage cutter yet  yuh in the manner of a man who knows too much to be cocksure about anything i dont know but what i would julius  i guess i vill then  minnie rauskukle plump hearty minnie heiress to the general store gave evidence by bridling and straightening her pigeonlike body that she was aware of milt behind her he did not speak to her he ducked into the door of the old home poolroom and restaurant  milt ranged up to the short lunch counter in front of the pool table where two bricknecked farm youngsters were furiously slamming balls and attacking cigarettes loosejointedly milt climbed a loosejointed high stool and to the proprietor bill mcgolwey his best friend he yawned you might poison me with a hamburger and a slab of apple mac  ill just do that little thing look kind of grouchy tonight milt  too much excitement in this burg saw three people on the streets all simultaneously toonce  whats been eatin you lately  me nothing only i do get tired of this metropolis one of these days im going to buck some bigger place  try gopher prairie maybe suggested mac through the hiss and steam of the frying hamburger sandwich  rats too small  small why theres darn near five thousand people there  i know buti want to tackle some surenuff city like duluth or new york  but whatd you do  thats the devil of it i dont know just what i do want to do i could always land soft in a garage but thats nothing new might hit detroit and learn the motorfactory end  aw youre the limit milt always looking for something new  thats the way to get on the rest of this town is afraid of new things member when i suggested we all chip in on a dynamo with a gas engine and have electric lights the hicks almost died of nervousness  yuh thats true but you stick here milt you and me will just nachly run this burg  ill say only gosh mac i would like to go to a real show once and find out how radio works and see em put in a big suspension bridge  milt left the old home rather aimlessly he told himself that he positively would not go back and help ben sittka get out the profs car so he went back and helped ben get out the profs car and drove the same to the profs the prof otherwise professor otherwise mister james martin jones ba and mrs james martin jones welcomed him almost as noisily as had mac they begged him to come in with mr jones he discussedno ye claires of brooklyn heights this garage man and this threadbare young superintendent of a paintbare school talking in a town that was only a comma on the line did not discuss corngrowing nor did they reckon to guess that by heck the constabule was carryin on with the widdy perkins they spoke of fishculture elihu root the spiritualistic evidences of immortality government ownership selfstarters for flivvers and the stories of irvin cobb  milt went home earlier than he wanted to because mr jones was the only man in town besides the priest who read books because mrs jones was the only woman who laughed about any topics other than children and family sickness because he wanted to go to their house every night milt treasured his welcome as a sacred thing and kept himself from calling on them more than once a week  he stopped on his way to the garage to pet emil baumschweigers large gray cat publicly known as rags but to milt and to the lady herself recognized as the unfortunate countess vere de vereperhaps the only person of noble ancestry and mysterious past in milts acquaintance the baumschweigers did not treat their animals well emil kicked the bay mare and threw pitchforks at vere de vere milt saluted her and sympathized  you have a punk time dont you countess like to beat it to minneapolis with me  the countess said that she did indeed have an extraordinarily punk time and she sang to milt the hymn of the little gods of the warm hearth then milts evening dissipations were over schoenstrom has movies only once a week he sat in the office of his garage ruffling through a weekly digest of events milt read much though not too easily he had no desire to be a poet an indoiranian etymologist a lecturer to womens clubs or the secretary of state but he did rouse to the marvels hinted in books and magazines to large crowds the mechanism of submarines palm trees gracious women  he laid down the magazine he stared at the wall he thought about nothing he seemed to be fumbling for something about which he could deliciously think if he could but grasp it without quite visualizing either wall or sea he was yet recalling old dreams of a moonlit wall by a warm stirring southern sea if there was a girl in the dream she was intangible as the scent of the night presently he was asleep a not at all romantic figure rather ludicrously tipped to one side in his office chair his large solid shoes up on the desk  he half woke and filtered to what he called homeone room in the cottage of an oldish woman who had prejudices against the perilous night air he was too sleepy to go through any toilet save pulling off his shoes and achieving an unconvincing wash at the little stand whose crackly varnish was marked with white rings from the toothbrush mug  i feel about due to pull off some fool stunt wonder what it will be he complained as he flopped on the bed  he was up at six and at a quarter to seven was at work in the garage he spent a large part of the morning in trying to prove to a customer that even a teal car best at the test would not give perfect service if the customer persisted in forgetting to fill the oilwell the greasecups and the battery  at three minutes after twelve milt left the garage to go to dinner the fog of the morning had turned to rain mcgolwey was not at the old home sometimes mac got tired of serving meals and for a day or two he took to a pocket flask and among his former customers the cans of prepared meat at rauskukles became popular milt found him standing under the tin awning of the general store he had a troubled hope of keeping mac from too long a vacation with the pocket flask but mac was already redeyed he seemed only half to recognize milt  swell day said milt  y bet  road darn muddy  i should worry yea bo im feelin good  at eleven minutes past twelve a gomezdep roadster appeared down the road stopped at the garage to milt it was as exciting as the appearance of a comet to a watching astronomer  what kind of a car do you call that milt asked a loafer  gomezdeperdussin  never heard of it looks too heavy  this was sacrilege milt stormed why you poor floof its one of the best cars in the world imported from france that looks like a specialmade american body though trouble with you fellows is youre always scared of anything thats new tooheavy huh always wanted to see a gomeznever have except in pictures and i believe thats a new york license let me at it  he forgot noonhunger and clumped through the rain to the garage he saw a girl step from the car he stopped in the doorway of the old home in uneasy shyness he told himself he didnt know just what it is about hershe isnt so darn unusually pretty and yetgee certainly isnt a girl to get fresh with let ben take care of her like to talk to her and yet id be afraid if i opened my mouth id put my foot in it  he was for the first time seeing a smart woman this dark slender finenerved girl in her plain rough closelybelted gray suit her small black glengarry cocked on one side of her smooth hair her little kid gloves her veil was as delicately adjusted as an aeroplane engine  milt wanted to trumpet her exquisiteness to the world so he growled to a man standing beside him swell car nicelookin girl kind of  kind of skinny though i like em with some meat on em yawned the man  no milt did not strike him to earth he insisted feebly nice clothes shes got though  oh not so muchamuch i seen a woman come through here yesterday that was swell thoughhad on a purple dress and white shoes and a hat big s a bushel  well i dont know i kind of like those simple things apologized milt  he crept toward the garage the girl was inside he inspected the slopetopped patentleather motoring trunk on the rack at the rear of the gomezdep he noticed a middleaged man waiting in the car must be her father probablymaybe she isnt married then he could not get himself to shout at the man as he usually did he entered the garage office from the inner door he peeped at the girl who was talking to his assistant about changing an inner tube  that ben sittka whom an hour ago he had cajoled as a promising child he now admired for the sniffing calmness with which he was demanding want a red or gray tube  really i dont know which is the better the girls voice was curiously clear  milt passed claire boltwood as though he did not see her stood at the rear of the garage kicking at the tires of a car his back to her over and over he was grumbling if i just knew one girl like that like a picture likelike a silver vase on a blue cloth  ben sittka did not talk to the girl while he inserted the tube in the spare casing only in the triumphant moment when the parted ends of the steel rim snapped back together he piped going far  yes rather to seattle  milt stared at the cobwebgrayed window now i know what i was planning to do im going to seattle he said  the girl was gone at twentynine minutes after twelve at twentynine and a half minutes after milt remarked to ben sittka im going to take a trip uh now dont ask questions you take charge of the garage until you hear from me get somebody to help you gby  he drove his teal bug out of the garage at thirtytwo minutes after twelve he was in his room packing his wicker suitcase by the method of throwing things in and stamping on the case till it closed in it he had absolutely all of his toilet refinements and wardrobe except the important portion already in use they consisted according to faithful detailed report of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton socks two shirts five collars five handkerchiefs a pair of surprisingly vain dancing pumps high tan laced boots three suits of cheap cotton underclothes his sunday suit which was dead black in color and unimaginative in cut four ties a fagged toothbrush a comb and hairbrush a razor a strop shaving soap in a mug a not very clean towel and nothing else whatever  to this he added his entire library and private picture gallery consisting of ivanhoe benhur his fathers copy of byron a wireless manual and the 1916 edition of motor construction and repairing the art collection one colored sunday supplement picture of a princess lunching in a proven√ße courtyard and a halftone of colonel paul beck landing in an early military biplane under this last in a pencil scrawl now blurred to grayness milt had once written this what ill be aviator  what he was to wear was a piercing trouble till eleven minutes past twelve that day he had not cared people accepted his overalls at anything except a dance and at the dances he was the only one who wore pumps but in his discovery of claire boltwood he had perceived that dressing is an art before he had packed he had unhappily pawed at the prized black suit it had become stupid undertaker he growled  with a shrug which indicated that he had nothing else he had exchanged his overalls for a tan flannel shirt black bow tie thick pigskin shoes and the suit he had worn the evening before his best suit of two years agobaggy blue serge coat and trousers he could not know it but they were surprisingly graceful on his wiry firm white body  in his pockets were a roll of bills and an unexpectedly good gold watch for warmth he had a winter ulster an oldfashioned turtleneck sweater and a raincoat heavy as tarpaulin he plunged into the raincoat ran out galloped to rauskukles store bought the most vehement cap in the placea plaid of cerise orange emerald green ultramarine and five other guaranteed fashionable colors he stocked up with food for roadside camping  in the humping tincovered tail of the bug was a good deal of room and this he filled with motor extras a shotgun and shells a pair of skates and all his camping kit as used on his annual duckhunting trip to man trap lake  im a darned fool to take everything i own but might be gone a whole month he reflected  he had only one possession lefta check book concealed from the interested eye of his too maternal landlady by sticking it under the stair carpet this he retrieved it showed a balance of two hundred dollars there was ten dollars in the cash register in the office for ben sittka the garage would with the mortgage deducted be worth nearly two thousand this was his fortune  he bolted into the kitchen and all in one shout he informed his landlady called out of town lil trip blieve i dont owe you anthing heres six dollars two weeks notice dunno just when i be back  before she could issue a questionnaire he was out in the bug he ran through town at his friend mcgolwey now looselipped and wabbly sitting in the rain on a pile of ties behind the railroad station he yelled so long mac take care yourself old hoss off on lil trip  he stopped in front of the profs tooted till the heads of the joneses appeared at the window waved and shouted gby folks goin outa town  then while freedom and the distant pacific seemed to rush at him over the hood he whirled out of town it was two minutes to onefortyseven minutes since claire boltwood had entered schoenstrom  he stopped only once his friend lady vere de vere was at the edge of town on a scientific exploring trip in the matter of ethnology and field mice she hailed him mrwr me mrwr  you dont say so milt answered in surprise well if i promised to take you ill keep my word he vaulted out tucked vere de vere into the seat protecting her from the rain with the tarpaulin winter radiatorcover  his rutskipping car overtook the mudwalloping gomezdep in an hour and pulled it out of the mud  before milt slept that night in his camp three miles from gopher prairie he went through religious rites  girl like her shes darn particular about her looks im a sloppy hound used to be snappier about my clothes when i was in high school getting lazytoo much like mac think of me sleeping in my clothes last night  mrwr rebuked the cat  youre dead right fierce is the word nev will sleep in my duds again puss that is when i have a reglar human bed course camping different but still lets see all the funny things we can do to us  he shavedtwo complete shaves from lather to towel he brushed his hair he sat down by a campfire sheltered between two rocks and fought his nails though they were discouragingly crammed with motor grease throughout this interesting but quite painful ceremony milt kept up a conversation between himself as the worlds champion dude and his cat as vallay but when there was nothing more to do and the fire was low and vere de vere asleep in the sleeve of the winter ulster his bumbling voice slackened in something like agony he muttered  but oh whats the use i cant ever be anything but a dub cleaning my nails to make a hit with a girl thats got hands like hers its a long trail to seattle but its a darn sight longer one to beingbeingwell sophisticated oh and incidentally what the deuce am i going to do in seattle if i do get there     chapter vi  the land of billowing clouds   never a tawnybeached ocean has the sweetness of the prairie slew rippling and blue with long grass up to its edge a spot of dancing light set in the miles of rustling wheat it retains even in july on an afternoon of glare and brazen locusts the freshness of a spring morning a thousand slews a hundred lakes bordered with rippling barley or tinkling bells of the flax claire passed she had left the occasional groves of oak and poplar and silver birch and come out on the treeless great plains  she had learned to call the slews pugholes and to watch for ducks at twilight she had learned that about the pugholes flutter choirs of crimsonwinged blackbirds that the ugly brown birds squatting on fencerails were the divinevoiced meadow larks that among the humble cowbird citizens of the pastures sometimes flaunted a scarlet tanager or an oriole and that no rose garden has the quaint and hardy beauty of the indian paint brushes and rag babies and orange milkweed in the prickly burntover grass between roadside and railway line  she had learned that what had seemed rudeness in garage men and hotel clerks was often a resentful reflection of her own eastern attitude that she was necessarily superior to a race she had been trained to call common people if she spoke up frankly they made her one of their own and gave her companionable aid  for two days of sunshine and drying mud she followed a road flung straight across flat wheatlands then curving among low hills often there were no fences she was so intimately in among the grain that the fenders of the car brushed wheat stalks and she became no stranger but a part of all this vasthorizoned land she forgot that she was driving as she let the car creep on while she was transported by armadas of clouds prairie clouds wisps of vapor like a ribbed beach or mounts of cumulus swelling to goldwashed snowy peaks  the friendliness of the bearing earth gave her a calm that took no heed of passing hours even her father the abstracted man of affairs nodded to dusty people along the road to a jolly old man whose bulk rolled and shook in a tiny rhythmically creaking buggy to women in the small abrupt towns with their huge red elevators and their long flatroofed stores  claire had discovered america and she felt stronger and all her days were colored with the sun  she had discovered too that she could adventure no longer was she haunted by the apprehension that had whispered to her as she had left minneapolis she knew a thrill when she hailedas though it were a passing shipan illinois car across whose dustcaked back was a banner chicago to the yellowstone she experienced a new sensation of common humanness when on a railway paralleling the wagon road for miles the engineer of a freight waved his hand to her and tooted the whistle in greeting  her father was easily tired but he drowsed through the early afternoons when a nonetoodigestible smalltown lunch was as lead within him despite the beauty of the land and the joy of pushing on they both had things to endure  after lunch it was sometimes an agony to claire to keep awake her eyes felt greasy from the food or smarted with the sunglare in the still air after the morning breeze had been burnt out the heat from the engine was a torment about her feet and if there was another car ahead the trail of dust sifted into her throat unless there was traffic to keep her awake she nodded at the wheel she was merely a part of a machine that ran on without seeming to make any impression on the prairies endlessness  over and over there were the same manipulations slow for down hill careful of sand at the bottom letting her out on a smooth stretch waving to a lonely farmwife in her small baked dooryard slow to pass a haywagon gas for up the next hill and repeat the round all over again but she was joyous till noon and with midafternoon a new strength came which as rose crept above the golden haze of dust deepened into serene meditation  and she was finding the one secret of longdistance drivingnamely driving keeping on thinking by fiftymile units not by the tenmile stretches of long island runs and not fretting over anything whatever she seemed charmed if she had a puncturewhy she put on the spare if she ran out of gaswhy any passing driver would lend her a gallon nothing it seemed could halt her level flight across the giant land  she rarely lost her way she was guided by the friendly trail signsthose big red rs and ls on fence post and telephone pole magically telling the way from the mississippi to the pacific  her fathers occasional musing talk kept her from loneliness he was a good touring companion motoring is not the best occasion for epigrams satire and the good one you got off at the lambs club last night such verbiage on motor trips invariably results in the mysterious finding of the corpse of a strange man well dressed hidden beside the road claire and her father mumbled good farmhousebrick or nice view and smiled and were for miles as silent as the companionable sky  she thought of the people she knew especially of jeff saxton but she could not clearly remember his lean earnest face between her and jeff were sweeping sunny leagues but she was not lonely certainly she was not lonely for a young man with a raincoat a cat and an interest in japan  no singer after a first concert has felt more triumphant than claire when she crossed her first stateline rumbled over the bridge across the red river into north dakota to see dakota car licenses everywhere instead of minnesota was like the sensation of street signs in a new language and when she found a good hotel in fargo and had a real bath she felt that by her own efforts she had earned the right to enjoy it  mr boltwood caught her enthusiasm dinner was a festival and in iced tea the peaceful conquistadores drank the toast of the new spanish main and afterward arm in arm went chattering to the movies  in front of the royal palace pictures 4 great acts vaudeville 4 was browsing a small beetlelike tincovered car  dad look im sureyes of course theres his suitcasethats the car of that nice boydont you rememberthe one that pulled us out of the mud ati dont remember the name of the place apparently hes keeping going i remember hes headed for seattle too well look for him in the theater oh the darling theres his cat what was the funny name he gave herthe marchioness montmorency or something  lady vere de vere afraid of fargo and movie crowds but trusting in her itinerant castle the bug was curled in milt daggetts ulster in the bottom of the car she twinkled her whiskers at claire and purred to a stroking hand  with the excitement of one trying to find the address of a friend in a strange land claire looked over the audience when the lights came on before the vaudeville in the second row she saw milts stiffish ropecolored hairsurprisingly smooth above an astoundingly clean new tan shirt of mercerized silk  he laughed furiously at the dialogue between peterosenheim  larosebettina though it contained the cheese joke the motherinlaw joke and the joke about the wife rifling her husbands pockets  our young friend seems to have enviable youthful spirits commented mr boltwood  now no superiority hes probably never seen a real vaudeville show wouldnt it be fun to take him to the winter garden or the follies for the first time instead of being taken by jeff saxton and having the humor oh so articulately explained  the pictures were resumed the film which under ten or twelve different titles claire had already seen even though brooklyn heights does not devote saturday evening to the movies the badman the sheriffan aged party with whiskers and bootsthe holdup the sad eyes of the sheriffs daughteralso an aged party but with a sunbonnet and the most expensive rougethe crooks reformation and his violent adherence to law and order this libel upon the portions of these united states lying west of longitude 101¬∞ claire had seen too often she dragged her father back to the hotel sent him to bed and entered her roomto find a telegram upon the bureau  she had sent her friends a list of the places at which she would be likely to stop the message was from jeff saxton in brooklyn it brought to her mind the steady shine of his glassesthe most expensive glasses with the very best curved lensesas it demanded      received letter about trip surprised anxious will tire you out     fatigue prairie roads bad for your father mountain roads dangerous     strongly advise go only part way then take train       geoffrey  she held the telegram flipping her fingers against one end of it as she debated she remembered how the wide world had flowed toward her over the hood of the gomez all day she wrote in answer      awful perils of road two punctures split infinitive eggs at     lunch questionable but struggle on  before she sent it she held council with her father she sat on the foot of his bed and tried to sound dutiful i dont want to do anything thats bad for you daddy but isnt it taking your mind away from business  yees i think it is anyway well try it a few days more  i fancy we can stand up under the strain and perils i think we can persuade some of these big farmers to come to the rescue if we encounter any walruses or crocodiles among the wheat and i have a feeling that if we ever get stuck our friend of the teal bug will help us  probably never see him again hell skip on ahead of us  of course we havent laid an eye on him along the road he must have gotten into fargo long before we did now tomorrow i think     chapter vii  the great american frying pan   it was claires first bad day since the hole in the mud she had started gallantly scooting along the level road that flies straight west of fargo but at noon she encountered a restaurant which made eating seem an evil  that they might have fair fame among motorists the commercial club of reaper had set at the edge of town a sign welcome to reaper a live townspeed limit 8 miles perhr being interpreted that sign meant that if you went much over twenty miles an hour on the main street people might glance at you and that the real welcome the only impression of reaper that tourists were likely to carry away was the welcome in the one restaurant it was called the eats garden as claire and her father entered they were stifled by a belch of smoke from the frying pan in the kitchen the room was blocked by a huge lunch counter there was only one table covered with oil cloth decorated with venerable spots of dried egg yolk  the waitercook whose apron was gravypatterned with a border and stomacher of plain gray dirt grumbled whadyuhwant  claire sufficiently recovered to pick out the type from the fly specks on the menu and she ordered a small steak and coffee for her father for herself tea boiled eggs toast  toast we aint got any toast  well cant you make it  oh i suppose i could  when they came the slices of toast were an inch thick burnt on one side and raw on the other the tea was bitter and the eggs watery her father reported that his steak was hightest rawhide and his coffeewell he wasnt sure just what substitute had been used for chicory but he thought it was lukewarm quinine  claire raged you know this town really has aspirations theyre beginning to build such nice little bungalows and theres a fine clean bank then they permit this scoundrel to advertise the town among strangers influential strangers in motors by serving food like this i suppose they think that they arrest criminals here yet this restaurant man is a thief to charge real money for food like this yes and hes a murderer  oh come now dolly  yes he is literally he must in his glorious career have given chronic indigestion to thousands of peopleshortened their lives by years thats wholesale murder if i were the authorities here id be indulgent to the people who only murder one or two people but imprison this cook for life really i mean it  well he probably does the best he  he does not these eggs and this bread were perfectly good before he did black magic over them and did you see the contemptuous look he gave me when i was so eccentric as to order toast oh reaper reaper you desire a modern town yet i wonder if you know how many thousands of tourists go from coast to coast cursing you if i could only hang that restaurant manand the others like himin a rope of his own hempen griddle cakes the great american frying pan i dont expect men building a new town to have time to read hugh walpole and james branch cabell but i do expect them to afford a cook who can fry eggs  as she paid the check claire tried to think of some protest which would have any effect on the obese wits of the restaurant man in face of his pink puffiness she gave it up her failure as a citizeness fixit sent her out of the place in a fury carried her on in a dusty whirl till the engine spat sounded tired and reflective and said it guessed it wouldnt go any farther that day  now that she had something to do claire became patient run out of gas isnt it lucky i got that can for an extra gallon  but there was plenty of gas there was no discernible reason why the car should not go she started the engine it ran for half a minute and quit all the plugs showed sparks no wires were detached in the distributor there was plenty of water and the oil was not clogged and that ended claires knowledge of the inside of a motor  she stopped two motorists the first was sure that there was dirt on the point of the needle valve in the carburetor while claire shuddered lest he never get it back he took out the needle valve wiped it put it backand the engine was again started and again with great promptness it stopped  the second good samaritan knew that one of the wires in the distributor must be detached and though she assured him that she had inspected them he looked pityingly at her smart sportssuit said well ill just take a look and removed the distributor cover he also scratched his head felt of the fuses under the cowl scratched his cheek poked a finger at the carburetor rubbed his ear said well uh looked to see if there was water and gas sighed cant just seem to find out whats the trouble shot at his own car and escaped  claire had been highly grateful and laudatory to both of thembut she remained here ten miles from nowhere it was a beautiful place down a hill the wheat swam toward a village whose elevator was a glistening tower mudhens gabbled in a slew alfalfa shone with unearthly green and bees went junketing toward a field of red clover but she had the motorists fever to go on the road behind and in front was very long very whiteand very empty  her father out of much thought and a solid ignorance about all of motoring beyond the hiring of chauffeurs and the payment of bills suggested uh dolly have you looked to see if these uh is the carburetor all right  yes dear ive looked at it three times so far she said just a little too smoothly  on the hill five miles to eastward a line of dust then a small car as it approached the driver must have sighted her and increased speed he came up at thirtyfive miles an hour  now well get something done look its a buga flivver or a teal or something i believe its the young man that got us out of the mud  milt daggett stopped casually greeted them why hello miss boltwood thought youd be way ahead of me some place  mrwr said vere de vere what this meant the historian does not know  no ive been taking it easy mr uhi cant quite remember your name  milt daggett  theres something mysterious the matter with my car the engine will start after its left alone a while but then it stalls do you suppose you could tell what it is  i dont know ill see if i can find out  then you probably will the other two men knew everything one of them was the inventor of wheels and the other discovered skidding so of course they couldnt help me  milt added nothing to her frivolity but his smile was friendly he lifted the round rubber cap of the distributor then claires faith tumbled in the dust twice had the wires been tested milt tested them again she was too tired of botching to tell him he was wasting time  got an oil can he hesitated  through a tiny hole in the plate of the distributor he dripped two drops of oilonly two drops i guess maybe thats what it needed you might try her now and see how she runs he said mildly  dubiously claire started the engine it sang jubilantly and it did not stop again was the road open to her again was the settlement over there to which it would have taken her an hour to walk only six minutes away  she stopped the engine beamed at himthere in the dust on the quiet hilltop he said as apologetically as though he had been at fault distributor got dry might give it a little oil about once in six months  we are so grateful to you twice now youve saved our lives  oh i guess youd have gone on living and if drivers cant help each other who can  thats a good start toward worldfellowship i suppose i wish we could do return your lunch or mr daggett do you read books i mean  yes i do when i run across them  maynt i gilend you these two that i happen to have along ive finished them and so has father i think  from the folds of the strappeddown top she pulled out compton mackenzies youths encounter and vachel lindsays congo with a curious faint excitement she watched him turn the leaves his blunt fingers flapped through them as though he was used to books as he looked at congo he exclaimed poetry thats fine like it but i dont hardly ever run across it i say im terribly obliged  his clear face lifted sunbrown and young and adoring she had not often seen men look at her thus certainly jeff saxtons painless worship did not turn him into the likeness of a knight among banners yet the good geoffrey loved her while to milt daggett she could be nothing more than a strange young woman in a car with a new york license if her tiny gift could so please him how poor he must be he probably lives on some barren farm she thought or hes a penniless mechanic hoping for a good job in seattle how white his forehead is  but aloud she was saying i hope youre enjoying your trip  oh yes i like it fine you having a good time well well thanks for the books  she was off before him presently she exclaimed to mr boltwood you knowjust occurs to meits rather curious that our young friend should be so coincidental as to come along just when we needed him  oh he just happened to i suppose hemmed her father  im not so sure she meditated while she absently watched another member of the poultry suicide club rush out of a safe ditch prepare to take leave for immortality change her fowlish mind flutter up over the hood of the car and come down squawking her indignities to the barnyard im not so sure about his happening no i wonder if he could possibly oh no i hope not flattering but you dont suppose he could be deliberately following us  nonsense hes a perfectly decent young chap  i know of course he probably works hard in a garage and is terribly nice to his mother and sisters at home i mean i wouldnt want the dear lamb to be a devoted knight though too thankless a job  she slowed the car down to fifteen an hour for the first time she began to watch the road behind her in a few minutes a moving spot showed in the dust three miles back oh naturally he would still be behind her only if she stopped just to look at the scenery he would go on ahead of her she stopped for a momentfor a time too brief to indicate that anything had gone wrong with her car staring back she saw that the bug stopped also and she fancied that milt was out standing beside it peering with his palm over his eyesa spy unnatural and disturbing in the wide peace  she drove on a mile and halted again again halted her attendant he was keeping a consistent two to four miles behind she estimated  this wont do at all she worried flattering but somehow whatever sort of a cocoonwrapped hussy i am i dont collect scalps i wont have young men serving megraft on themget amusement out of their struggles besidessuppose he became just a little more friendly each time he came up all the way from here to seattle fresh no it wont do  she ran the car to the side of the road  more trouble groaned her father  no just want to see scenery  but theres a good deal of scenery on all sides without stopping seems to me  yes but she looked back milt had come into sight had paused to take observations her father caught it  oh i see pardon me our squire still following let him go on ahead wise lass  yes i think perhaps its better to avoid complications  of course mr boltwoods manner did not merely avoid milt it abolished him  she saw milt after five minutes of stationary watching start forward he came dustily rattling up with a hail of distributor on strike again so cheerful that it hurt her to dismiss him but she had managed a household she was able to say suavely  no everything is fine im sure it will be now im afraid we are holding you back you mustnt worry about us  oh thats all right breezily something might go wrong say is this poetry book  no im sure nothing will go wrong now you mustnt feel responsible for us but uh you understand were very grateful for what you have done and uh perhaps we shall see each other in seattle she made it brightly interrogatory  oh i see his hands gripped the wheel his cheeks had been too ruddily tinted by the dakota sun to show a blush but his teeth caught his lower lip he had no starter on his bug he had in his embarrassment to get out and crank he did it quietly not looking at her she could see that his hand trembled on the crank when he did glance at her as he drove off it was apologetically miserably his foot was shaking on the clutch pedal  the dust behind his car concealed him for twenty miles she was silent save when she burst out to her father i do hope youre enjoying the trip its so easy to make people unhappy i wonder no had to be done     chapter viii  the discovery of canned shrimps and hesperides   on the morning when milt daggett had awakened to sunshine in the woods north of gopher prairie he had discovered the golden age as mile on mile he jogged over new hills without having to worry about getting back to his garage in time to repair somebodys car he realized that for the past two years he had forced himself to find contentment in building up a business that had no future  now he laughed and whooped he drove with one foot inelegantly and enchantingly up on the edge of the cowl he made lady vere de vere bow to astounded farmers he went to the movies every eveningtwice in fargo and when the chariot of the young prince swept to the brow of a hill he murmured not in the manner of a bugdriver but with a stinging awe all that big country ours to see puss well settle down some day and be solid citizens and raise families and wheeze when we walk but all those hills to sail over and come on lez sail  milt attended the motion pictures every evening and he saw them in a new way as recently as one week before he had preferred those earnest depictions in which hardworking moral actors shoot one another or ride the most uncomfortable horses up mountainsides but now with a mental apology to that propagandist of lowbrowism the absent mac he chose the films in which the leading men wore evening clothes and no one ever did anything without being assisted by a man aside from the pictures milts best tutors were traveling men though he measured every cent and for his campfire dinners bought modest chuck steaks he had at least one meal a day at a hotel to watch the traveling men  to claire traveling men were merely commercial persons in hardboiled suits she identified them with the writingup of orderslips on long littered writingtables and with hotels that reduced the delicate arts of dining and sleeping to gray greasiness but milt knew traveling men he knew that not only were they the missionaries of business supplementing the taking of orders by telling merchants how to build up trade how to trim windows and treat customers like human beings but also that they as much as the local ministers and doctors and teachers and newspapermen were the agents in spreading knowledge and justice it was they who showed the young men how to have their hair cutand to wash behind the ears and shave daily they who encouraged villagers to rise from scandal and gossip to a perception of the great world of politics and sports and some measure of art and science  claire and indeed her father and mr jeff saxton as well had vaguely concluded that because drummers were always to be seen in soggy hotels and badly connecting trains and the headachy waitingrooms of stations they must like these places milt knew that the drummers were martyrs that for months of a trip all the while thinking of the children back home they suffered from landlords and train schedules that they were claires best allies in fighting the great american frying pan that they knew good things and fought against the laziness and impositions of people who kept hotel because they had failed as farmers and that when they did find a landlord who was cordial and efficient they went forth mightily advertising that glorious man the traveling men he knew were pioneers in spats  hence it was to the traveling men not to supercilious tourists in limousines that milt turned for suggestions as to how to perform the miracle of changing from an ambitious boy into what claire would recognize as a charming man he had not met enough traveling men at schoenstrom they scooped up what little business there was and escaped from the leipzig house to spend the night at st cloud or sauk centre  in the larger towns in minnesota and dakota after evening movies before slipping out to his roadside camp milt inserted himself into a circle of traveling men in large leather chairs and ventured saw a gomezdep with a new york license down the line today  oh you driving through  yes going to seattle  that distinguished milt from the ordinary youngmenloafers and he was admitted as one of the assembly of men who traveled and saw things and wondered about the ways of men it was good talk he heard too much of hotels and too many tight banal little phrases suggesting the solution of all economic complexities by hanging agitators but with this an exciting accumulation of impressions of vancouver and san diego florida and k c  thats a wonderful work farm they have at duluth said one and the next speaking of that i was in chicago last week and i saw a play  milt had in his two years of high school in st cloud and in his boyhood under the genial but abstracted eye of the old doctor learned that it was not well thought of to use the knife as a hod and to plaster mashed potatoes upon it as was the custom in macs old home lunch at schoenstrom but the arts of courteously approaching oysters salad and peas were rather unfamiliar to him now he studied forks as he had once studied carburetors and he gave spiritual devotion to the nice eating of a cannedshrimp cocktaila lost legion of shrimps now two thousand miles and two years away from their ocean home  he peeped with equal earnestness at the socks and the shirts of the traveling men socks had been to him not an article of faith but a detail of economy his attitude to socks had lacked in reverence and technique he had not perceived that socks may be as sound a symbol of culture as the cello or even demountable rims he had been able to think with respect of ties and damp piqu√© collars secured by gold safetypins and to the belted fawn overcoat that the st klopstock bankers son had brought back from st paul he had given jealous attention but now he graduated into differential socks  by his campfire sighing to the rather somnolent vere de vere he scornfully yanked his extra pairs of thick whitestreaked yellow cotton socks from the wicker suitcase and uttered anathema  begone ye unworthy and punklooking raiment i know ye ye werst a bargain and two pairs for two bits but even as adolph zolzac and an agent for flivver accessories are ye become in my eyes ye generation of vipers ye clumsy bagfooted wrinklesided gunnysacking ye  next day in the woods a happy hobo found that the mannabringing ravens had left him four pairs of good socks  five quite expensive pairs of silk and lisle socks milt purchasedall that the general merchant at jeppe had in stock what they lost in suitability to touring and to private laundering at creeks they gained as symbols milt felt less shut out from the life of leisure now in seattle say he could go into a good hotel with less fear of the clerks  he added attractive outing shirts ties neither too blackly dull nor too flashily crimson and a vicious nailbrush which simply tore out the motor grease that had grown into the lines of his hands also he added a book  the book was a rhetoric milt knew perfectly that there was an impertinence called grammar but it had never annoyed him much he knew that many persons preferred they were to they was and were nervous in the presence of aint one teacher in st cloud had buzzed frightfully about these minuti√¶ but milt discovered that grammar was only the beginning of woes he learned that there were such mental mortgages as figures of speech and the choice of synonyms he had always known but he had never passionately felt that the invariable use of hell doggone and you bet left certain subtleties unexpressed now he was finding subtleties which he had to express  as joyously adventurous as going on day after day was his experimentation in voicing his new observations he gave far more eagerness to it than claire boltwood had gustily intoning to vere de vere who was the perfect audience inasmuch as she never had anything to say but mrwr and didnt mind being interrupted in that he clamored the prairies are the sea in the distance they are kind of silverynothey are dim silver and way off on the skyline are the islands of theof the now what the devil was them were those islands in the mythology book in high school of theblessed great snakes boots youre an ignorant cat vere hesperyds no hesperides yea bo now that man in the hotel may i trouble you for the train guide thanks so much but how much is so much  as claires days were set free by her consciousness of sun and brown earth so milts odyssey was only the more valorous in his endeavor to criticize life he saw that macs lunch room had not been an altogether satisfactory home that macs habit of saying to dissatisfied customers if you dont like it get out had lacked something of courtesy staring at towns along the way milt saw that houses were not merely large and comfortable or small and stingy but that there was an interesting thing he remembered hearing his teachers call good taste  he was not the preoccupied milt of the garage but a gayeyed gallant the evening when he gave a lift to the schoolteacher and drove her from the district school among the wild roses and the corn to her home in the next town she was a neat tripping trimsided schoolteacher of nineteen or twenty  youre going out to seattle my thats a wonderful trip dont you get tired she adored  oh no and im seeing things i used to think everything worth while was right near my own town  youre so wise to go places most of the boys i know dont think there is any world beyond jimtown and fargo  she glowed at him milt was saying to himself am i a fool i probably could make this girl fall in love with me and shes better than i am so darn neat and clean and gentle wed be happy shes a nice comfy fire and here i go like a boob chasing after a lone cold star like miss boltwood and probably ill fall into all the slews from hell to breakfast on the way but id get sleepy by a comfy fire  are you thinking hard youre frowning so ventured the schoolteacher  didnt mean to scuse he laughed one hand off the steering wheel he took her handa fresh cool virginal hand snuggling into his suddenly stirring him he wanted to hold it tighter the lamenting historian of loves pilgrimage must set down the fact that the pilgrim for at least a second forgot the divine tread of the goddess claire and made rapid calculation that he could in a pinch drive from schoenstrom to the teachers town in two days and a night that therefore courtship and this sweet white hand resting in his were not impossible milt himself did not know what it was that made him lay down the hand and say so softly that he was but half audible through the rattle of the engine  isnt this a slick mean to say glorious evening sky rose and then that funny lavender and that new moon makes me think ofthe girl im in love with  youre engaged wistfully  not exactly but say did you study rhetoric in normal school i have a rhetoric thats got all kind of poetic extracts you know and quotations and everything from the big writers stevenson and all always been so practical making a garage pay never thought much about how i said things as long as i could say no and say it quick cept maybe when i was talking to the prof there but its great sport to see how musical you can make a thing sound words like shenandoah gollee isnt that a wonderful word makes you see old white mansion and mocking birds wonder if a fellow could be a big engineer you know build bridges and so on and still talk about oh beautiful things what d you think girlie  oh im sure you could  her admiration the proximity of her fragrant slightness was pleasant in the dusk but he did not press her hand again even when she whispered good night and thank youoh thank you  if milt had been driving at the rate at which he usually made his skipjack carom over the roads about schoenstrom he would by now have been through dakota into montana but he was deliberately holding down the speed when he had been tempted by a smooth stretch to go too breathlessly he halted teased vere de vere climbed out and sitting on a hilltop his hands about his knees drenched his soul with the vision of amber distances  he tried so to time his progress that he might always be from three to five miles behind clairedistant enough to be unnoticed near enough to help in case of need for behind poetic expression and the use of forks was the fact that his purpose in life was to know claire  when he was caught when claire informed him that he mustnt worry about her when slowly he understood that she wasnt being neighborly and interested in his making time he wanted to escape never to see her again  for thirty miles his cheeks were fiery he most considerate of roadmen crowded a woman in a flivver passed a laboring car on an upgrade with such a burst that the uneasy driver bumped off into a ditch he hadnt really seen them only mechanically had he got past them he was muttering  she thought i was trying to butt in stung again like a small boy in love with teacher and i thought i was so wise cussed out macblamed macno damn all the fine wordscussed out mac for being the village rumhound boozing is twice as sensible as me see a girl nice dressstart for seattle two thousand miles away of course she bawled me out she was dead right boob yahoo goat  he caught up vere de vere rubbed her fur against his cheek while he mourned oh puss you got to be nice to me i thought id do big things and then the alarm clock went off im back in schoenstrom for keeps i guess i didnt know i had feelings that could get hurt like this thought i had a rhinoceros hide but oh it isnt just feeling ashamed over being a fool its that wont ever see her again not once way i saw her through the window at that hotel in that blue silky dressthat funny long line of buttons and her throat never have dinnerlunchwith her by the road  in the reaction of anger he demanded of vere de vere what the deuce do i care if shes chump enough to chase away a crack garage man thats gone batty and wants to work for nothing let her go on and hit some crook garage and get stuck for an entire overhauling what do i care had nice trip thats all i wanted never did intend to go clear to seattle anyway go on to butte then back home no more fussing about fool tablemanners and books and i certainly will cut out tagging behind her no sir never again  it was somewhat inconsistent to add theres a bully placesneak in and let her get past me again but she wont catch me following next time  while he tried to keep up his virtuous anger he was steering into an abandoned farmyard parking the car behind cottonwoods and neglected tall currant bushes which would conceal it from the road  the windows of the deserted house stared at him a splintered screen door banged in every breeze lichens leered from the cracks of the porch the yard was filled with a litter of cottonwood twigs and over the flower garden hulked ragged weeds in the rank grass about the slimy green lip of the well crickets piped derisively the barndoor was open stray kernels of wheat had sprouted between the spokes of a rusty binderwheel a rat slipped across the edge of the shattered manger as dusk came on gray things seemed to slither past the upper windows of the house and somewhere under the roof there was a moaning milt was sure that it was the wind in a knothole he told himself that he was absolutely sure about it and every time it came he stroked vere de vere carefully and once when the moaning ended in the slamming of the screen door he said jiminy  this boy of the unghostly cylinders and tangible magnetos had never seen a haunted house to toil of the harvest field and machine shop and to trudging the sunbeaten road he was accustomed but he had never crouched watching the slinking spirits of old hopes and broken aspirations feeble phantoms of the first eager bridegroom who had come to this place and the mortgagecrushed rustwheatruined man who had left it he wanted to leap into the bug and go on yet the haunt of murmurous memories dignified his unhappiness in the soft treedimmed dooryard among dry blazing plains it seemed indecent to go on growling gee and can you beat it it was a young poet a poet rhymeless and inarticulate who huddled behind the shield of untrimmed currant bushes and thought of the girl he would never see again  he was hungry but he did not eat he was cramped but he did not move he picked up the books she had given him he was quickened by the powdery beauty of youths encounter by the vision of laughter and dancing steps beneath a streaky gasglow in the london fog of youth not roughhousing and wanting to be a sport yet in frail beauty and faded crimson banners finding such exaltation as schoenstrom had never known but every page suggested claire and he tucked the book away  in vachel lindsays congo in a poem called the santa fe trail he found his own modern pilgrimage from another point of view here was the poet disturbed by the honking hustle of passing cars but milt belonged to the honking and the hustle and it was not the soul of the grass that he read in the poem but his own sunflickering flight      swiftly the brazen car comes on     it burns in the east as the sunrise burns     i see great flashes where the far trail turns     butting through the delicate mists of the morning     it comes like lightning goes past roaring     it will hail all the windmills taunting ringing     on through the ranges the prairiedog tills     scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills     ho for the tearhorn scarehorn darehorn     ho for the gayhorn barkhorn bayhorn  milt did not reflect that if the poet had watched the teal bug go by he would not have recorded a scarehorn a darehorn or anything mightier than a yiphorn milt saw himself a crosscontinent racer with the envious poet left behind as a dot on the hill celebrating his passing  lord he cried i didnt know there were books like these thought poetry was all like longfellow and byron old boys europe and rhymed bellyachin about hard luck but these bookstheyre me very carefully no theyre i and she gave em to me i will see her again but she wont know it now be sensible son what do you expect ohnothing ill just go on and sneak in one more glimpse of her to take back with me where i belong  half an hour after claire had innocently passed his ambush he began to follow her but not for days was he careless if he saw her on the horizon he paused until she was out of sight that he might not fail her in need he bought a ridiculously expensive pair of field glasses and watched her when she stopped by the road once when both her right rear tire and the spare were punctured before she could make a town milt from afar saw her patch a tube pump up the tire in the dust he ached to go to her aidthough it cannot be said that handpumping was his favorite july afternoon sport  lest he encounter her in the streets he always camped to the eastward of the town at which she spent the night after dusk when she was likely to end the days drive in the first sizable place he hid his bug in an alley and like a spy after the papers sneaked into each garage to see if her car was there  he would stroll in look about vacuously and pipe to the suspicious night attendant seen a traveling man named smith usually the garage man snarled no i aint seen nobody named smith anthing else i can do for you but once he was so unlucky as to find the longmissing mr smith  mr smith was surprised and insistent milt had to do some quick lying during that interview the cement floor felt very hard under his fidgeting feet and he thought he heard the garage man in the office telephoning dont think he knows smith at all i got a hunch hes that auto thief that was through here last summer  when claire did not stop in the first town she reached after twilight but drove on by dark he had to do some perilous galloping to catch up the lights of a teal are excellent for adornment but they have no relation to illumination they are dependent upon a magneto which is dependent only upon faith  once skittering along by dark he realized that the halted car which he had just passed was the gomez he thought he heard a shout behind him but in a panic he kept going  to the burring motor he groaned now i probably never will see her again except that she thinks im such a pest that i dassnt let her know im in the same state i sure am one successful lover as a prince charming i win the vanderbilt cup im going ahead backwards so fast ill probably drop off into the atlantic over the next hill     chapter ix  the man with agate eyes   when her car had crossed the missouri river on the swingferry between bismarck and mandan claire had passed from middle west to far west she came out on an upland of virgin prairie so treeless and houseless so divinely dipping so rough of grass that she could imagine buffaloes still roving in a hollow a real prairie schooner was camped and the wandering homesteadseekers were cooking dinner beside it from a quilt on the hay in the wagon a baby peeped and claires heart leaped  beyond was her first butte its sharpcut sides glittering yellow and she fancied that on it the sioux scout still sat sentinel erect on his pony the feather bonnet down his back  now she seemed to breathe deeper see farther again she came from unbroken prairie into wheat country and large towns  her impression of the new land was not merely of sunglaring breadth sometimes on a cloudy day the wash of wheatlands was as brown and lowering and mysterious as an english moor in the mist it dwarfed the faroff houses by its giant enchantment its brooding reaches changed her attitude of brisk gasdriven efficiency into a melancholy that was full of hints of old dark beauty  even when the sun came out and the land was brazenly optimistic she saw more than just prosperity in a new home house and barn and windmill squarecornered and prosaic plumped down in a field with wheat coming up to the unporticoed door a habitation unshadowed unsheltered unsoftened she found a frank cleanness as though the inhabitants looked squarely out at life unafraid she felt that the keen winds ought to blow away from such a prairiefronting post of civilization all mildew and cowardice all the mummy dust of ancient fears  these were not peasants these farmers nor she learned were they the hicks of humor she could never again encounter without fiery resentment the broadway peddlers faith that farmers invariably say waal by heck for she had spent an hour talking to one dakota farmer genialeyed quiet of speech he had explained the relation of alfalfa to soilchemistry had spoken of his daughter who taught economics in a state university and asked mr boltwood how turbines were hitched up on liners  in fact claire learned that there may be an almost tolerable state of existence without gardenias or the news about the latest parisian imagists  she dropped suddenly from the vast smoothswelling miles of wheatland into the tortured marvels of the bad lands and the road twisted in the shadow of flying buttresses and the terraced tombs of maharajas while she tried to pick her way through a herd of wild arroyobred cattle she forgot her maneuvering as she was startled by the stabbing scarlet of a column of rock marking the place where for months deep beds of lignite had burned  claire had often given lifts to tramping harvesters and even hoboes along the road had enjoyed the sight of their dufflebags stuck up between the sleek fenders and the hood and their talk about people and crops along the road as they hung on the runningboard in the country of long hillslopes and sentinel buttes between the dakota bad lands and miles city she stopped to shout to a man whose plodding heavy back looked fagged want a ride  sure you bet  usually her guests stepped on the righthand runningboard beside mr boltwood and this man was far over on the right side of the road but while she waited he sauntered in front of the car round to her side mounted beside her before the car had started she was sorry to have invited him he looked her over grinningly almost contemptuously his unabashed eyes were as bright and hard as agates below them his nose was twisted a little his mouth bent insolently up at one corner and his square long chin bristled  usually too her passengers waited for her to start the conversation and talked at mr boltwood rather than directly to her but the bristly man spat at her as the car started going far  yees some distance  expensive car  why  fraid of getting held up  i hadnt thought about it  pack a cannon dont you  i dont think i quite understand  cannon gun revolver got a revolver of course  wwhy no she spoke uncomfortably she was aware that his twinkling eyes were on her throat his look made her feel unclean she tried to think of some question which would lead the conversation to the less exclamatory subject of crops they were on a curving shelf road beside a shallow valley the road was one side of a horseshoe ten miles long the unprotected edge of it dropped sharply to fields forty or fifty feet below  prosperouslooking wheat down there she said  no not a bit his look seemed to add and you know itunless youre a fool  well i didnt  make glendive tonight  at least that far  say lady hows the chance for borrowin a couple of dollars i was workin for a finnski back here a ways and he did me dirtholdin out my wages on me till the end of the month  why uh  it was claire not the man who was embarrassed  he was snickering come on dont be a tightwad swell carpoor man with no eats not even a twobits flop for tonight could yuh loosen up and slip me just a couple bones  mr boltwood intervened he looked as uncomfortable as claire well see its rather against my principles to give money to an ablebodied man like you even though it is a pleasure to give you a ride  sure dont cost you one red cent  and if i could help you get a job though of course being a stranger out here seems strange to me though mr boltwood struggled on that a strong fellow like you should be utterly destitute when i see all these farmers able to have cars  their guest instantly abandoned his attitude of supplication for one of boasting destitute who the hell said i was destitute heh he was snarling across claire at mr boltwood his wet face was five inches from hers she drew her head as far back as she could she was sure that the man completely appreciated her distaste for his eyes popped with amusement before he roared on  i got plenty of money just cause im hoofin it i dont want no charity from nobody i could buy out half these honyockers i dont need none of no mans money he was efficiently working himself into a rage who you calling destitute all i wanted was an advance till pay day got a check coming you hightone kidglove eastern towerists want to watch out who you go calling destitute i bet i make a lot more money than a lot of your fourflushin friends  claire wondered if she couldnt stop the car now and tell him to get off butthat snapping eye was too vicious before he got off he would say thingsscarring vile things that would never heal in her brain her father was murmuring lets drop him but she softly lied no his impertinence amuses me  she drove on and prayed that he would of himself leave his uncharitable hosts at the next town  the man was stormingwith a very meek ending im tellin you i can make money anywhere im a crack machinist give me twobits for a meal anyway  mr boltwood reached in his change pocket he had no quarter he pulled out a plump billfold without looking at the man claire could vision his eyes glistening and his chops dripping as he stared at the hoard mr boltwood handed him a dollar bill there take that and lets change the subject said mr boltwood testily  all right boss say you havent got a cartwheel instead of this wrapping paper have you i like to feel my money in my pocket  no sir i have not  all right boss no bad feelins  then he ignored mr boltwood his eyes focused on claires face to steady himself on the runningboard he had placed his left hand on the side of the car his right on the back of the seat that right hand slid behind her she could feel its warmth on her back  she burst out flaring kindly do not touch me  gee did i touch you girlie why thats a shame he drawled his cracked broad lips turning up in a grin  an instant later as they skipped round a bend of the long highhung shelf road he pretended to sway dangerously on the runningboard and deliberately laid his filthy hand on her shoulder before she could say anything he yelped in mockregret love o mike scuse me lady i almost fell off  quietly seriously claire said no that wasnt accidental if you touch me again ill stop the car and ask you to walk  better do it now dolly snapped mr boltwood  the man hooked his left arm about the sidepost of the open windowshield it was a strong arm a firm grip he seized her left wrist with his free hand though all the while his eyes grotesquely kept their amused sparkle and beside them writhed laughterwrinkles he shouted hoarsely youll stop hell his hand slid from her wrist to the steering wheel i can drive this boats well as you can you make one move to stop and i steer her over blooie down the bank  he did twist the front wheels dangerously near to the outer edge of the shelf road mr boltwood gazed at the hand on the wheel with a quick breath claire looked at the side of the road if the car ran off it would shoot down forty feet  turning over and over  yyou wouldnt dare because youd ggo too she panted  well dearuh you just try any monkey business and youll find out how much ill gggggggotoo ill start you down the joyslope and jump off savvy take your foot off that clutch  she obeyed  pretty lil feet aint they cutie shoes cost about twelve bucks i reckon while a better man than you or old moldyface there has to hit the pike in threedollar brogans sit down yuh fool  this last to mr boltwood who had stood up swaying with the car and struck at him with a huge arm the man swept mr boltwood back into the seat but without a word to her father he continued to claire  and keep your hand where it belongs dont go trying to touch that switch aw be sensible what would you do if the car did stop i could blackjack you both before this swellelegant vehickle lost momentum savvy i dont want to pay out my good money to a lawyer on a charge ofmurder get me better take it easy and not worry his hand was constantly on the wheel he had driven cars before he was steering as much as she when i get you up the road a piece im going to drive all the cute lil boys and girls up a side trail and take all of papas goshwhatawad in the cunnin potetbook and i guess well kiss lil daughter and drive on awavin our hand politely and let you suckers walk to the next burg  you wouldnt dare you wouldnt dare  dare

as a couplinpin smeared all over those rocks get me and meill be sorry the regrettable accident was so naughty and went and happenedand i just got off in time meself and ill pinch papas poke while im helping get out the bodies  till now she hadnt believed it but she dared not glance at the approaching car it was their interesting guest who steered the gomez past the other and he ran rather too near the edge of the road  so that she looked over down  beaming he went on id pull the rough stuff right here instead of wastin my time as a capn of industry by taking you up to see the scenery in that daisy little gully off the road but the whole world can see us along herethe hicks in the valley and anybody that happens to sneak along in a car behind us shame the way this road curvessee too far along it fact youre giving me a lot of trouble but youll give me a kiss wont you gwendolyn  he bent down chuckling she could feel his bristly chin touch her cheek she sprang up struck at him he raised his hand from the wheel for a second the car ran without control he jabbed her back into the seat with his elbow dont try any more monkeyshines if you know whats good for you he said quite peacefully as he resumed steering  she was in a haze conscious only of her fathers hand fondling hers she heard a quick pitpitpitpit behind them car going to pass shed have to let it go by shed concentrate on finding something she could  then hello folks having a picnic whos your little friend in the rompers sang out a voice beside them it was milt daggettthe milt who must be scores of miles ahead his bug had caught up with them was running even with them on the broad road     chapter x  the curious incident of the hillside road   so unexpectedly so genially that claire wondered if he realized what was happening milt chuckled to the tough on the runningboard as the two cars ran side by side bound for some place brother  the unwelcome guest looked puzzled for the first time his china eyes ceased twinkling and he answered dubiously just gettin a lift he sped up the car with the handthrottle milt accelerated equally  claire roused wanted to shout she was palsied afraid that milt would leave them the last time she had seen him she had suggested that leaving them would be a favor  her guest growled at herthe words coming through a slit at the corner of his rowdy mouth sit still or ill run you over  milt innocently babbled on better come ride with me bo more room in thishere handsome coupelet  then was the rough relieved in his uneasy tender little heart and his eyes flickered again as he shouted back not looking at milt thanks bub ill stick by me friends  oh no cant lose pleasure of your company i like your looks youre a bloomin little island way off on the dim silver skyline claire knitted her brows she had not seen milts rhetoric youre an island of hesperyds or hesperides accent on the bezuzus oh yes moondream i think you better come havent decidedmilts tone was blandwhether to kill you or just have you pinched miss boltwood switch off your power  if she does the tough shouted ill run em off the bank  no you wont sweetheart cause why cause whatll i do to you afterwards  you wont do nothin jack cause id gouge your eyes out  why lovesoul d you suppose id be talking up as brash as this to a bid stwong man like oo if i didnt have a gun handy  yuh i guess so lil sunbeam and before you could shoot id crowd your tin liz into the bank and jam right into it i may get killed but you wont even be a greasespot  he was turning the gomez from its straight course forcing milts bug toward the high bank of earth which walled in the road on the left  while claire was very sick with fear then more sick with contempt milt squealed you win and he had dropped back the gomez was going on alone  there was only one thing more for claireto jump and that meant death  the tough was storming your friends a crack shotwith his mouth  the thin pitpitpit was coming again she looked back she saw milts bug snap forward so fast that on a bump its light wheels were in the air she saw milt standing on the right side of the bug holding the wheel with one hand and the other handfirm grim broadknuckled handoutstretched toward the tough then snatching at his collar  the toughs grip was torn from the steering wheel he was yanked from the runningboard he crunched down on the road  she seized the wheel she drove on at sixty miles an hour she had gone a good mile before she got control of her fear and halted she saw milt turn his little car as though it were a prancing bronco it seemed to paw the air with its front wheels he shot back pursuing the late guest the man ran bobbing along the road at this distance he was no longer formidable but a comic jerking rabbity figure humping himself over the back track  as the bug whirled down on him the tough was to be seen throwing up his hands leaping from the high bank  milt turned again and came toward them but slowly and after he had drawn up even and switched off the engine he snatched off his violent plaid cap and looked apologetic  sorry i had to kid him along i was afraid he really would drive you off the bank he was a bad actor and he was right he could have licked me thought maybe i could jolly him into getting off and have him pinched next town  but you had a guna revolverdidnt you lad panted mr boltwood  um wellllll ive got a shotgun it wouldnt take me more n five or ten minutes to dig it out and put it together and theres some shells they may be all right havent looked at em since last fall they didnt get so awful damp then  but suppose hed had a revolver himself wailed claire  gee you know i thought he probably did have one i was scared blue i had a wrench to throw at him though confided milt  how did you know we needed you  why back there couple miles behind you maybe i saw your father get up and try to wrestle him so i suspected there was kind of a disagreement say miss boltwood you know when you spoke to meway back therei hadnt meant to butt in honest i thought maybe as we were going  oh i know  the same way you wouldnt mind my trailing if i didnt sit in too often and i thought maybe i could help you if  oh i know im so ashamed so bitterly ashamed i just meant will you forgive me you were so good taking care of us  oh sure thats all right  i fancy you do know how grateful father and i are that you were behind us this time wasnt it a lucky accident that wed slipped past you some place  yes dryly quite an accident well ill skip on ahead again may run into you again before we hit seattle going to take the run through yellowstone park  yes but began claire her father interrupted  uh mr uhdaggett was iti wonder if you wont stay a little closer to us hereafter i was getting rather a good change out of the trip but im afraid that now if it wouldnt be an insult id beg you to consider staying with us for a consideration uh you know remuneration and you could  thanks uh thank you sir but i wouldnt like to do it you see its kind of my vacation if ive done anything im tickled  but perhaps mr boltwood ardently begged the young man recently so abysmally unimportant perhaps you would consent to being my guest when you cared tosay at hotels in the park  fraid i couldnt im kind of a lone wolf  please pretty please besought claire her smile was appealing her eyes on his  milt bit his knuckles he looked weak but he persisted no youll get over this scrap with our friend by the way ill put the deputy onto him in the next town hell never get out of the county when you forget him oh no you can go on fine youre a good steady driver and the roads perfectly safeif you give people the onceover before you pick em up picking up badmen is no more dangerous here than it would be in new york fact theres lot more holdups in any city than in the wildest country i dont think you showed such awfully good taste in asking terrible tim the twogun man right into the parlor gee please dont do it again please  no meekly i was an idiot ill be good next time but wont you stay somewhere near us  id like to but i got to chase on dont want to wear out the welcome on the doormat and im due in seattle and say miss boltwood he swung out of the bug cranked up climbed back went awkwardly on i read those books you gave me theyre slickmean to say interesting where that young fellow in youths encounter wanted to be a bishop and a soldier and everything just like me except schoenstrom is different from london some ways i always wanted to be a brakie and then a yeggman but i wasnt bright enough for either i just became a garage man and i some day im going to stop using slang but itll take an operation  he was streaking down the road and claire was sobbing oh the lamb the darling thing fretting about his slang when he wasnt afraid in that horrible nightmare if we could just do something for him  dont you worry about him dolly hes a very energetic chap and uh mightnt we drive on a little farther perhaps i confess that the thought of our recent guest still in this vicinity  yes and oh im shameless if mohammed milton wont stay with our car mountain were going to tag after him  but when she reached the next hill with its far shining outlook there was no milt and no teal bug on the road ahead     chapter xi  sagebrush tourists of the great highway   she had rested for two days in miles city had seen the horsemarket with horsewranglers in chaps had taken dinner with army people at fort keogh once the bulwark against the sioux now nodding over the dry grass on its parade ground  by the yellowstone river past the crow reservation claire had driven on through the real west along the great highway the red trail and the yellowstone trail had joined now and she was one of the new canterbury pilgrims even mr boltwood caught the trick of looking for licenses and cried theres a connecticut car  to the easterner a drive from new york to cape cod over asphalt is viewed as heroic but here were cars that had casually started on thousandmile vacations she kept pace not only with large cars touring from st louis or detroit to glacier park and yellowstone but also she found herself companionable with families of workmen headed for a new town and a new job and driving because a flivver bought secondhand and soon to be sold again was cheaper than trains  sagebrush tourists these camping adventurers were called claire became used to small cars with curtainlights broken bearing washboilers or refrigerators on the back pasteboard suitcases lashed by rope to the runningboard frying pans and canvas water bottles dangling from toprods and once babys personal laundry was seen flapping on a line across a tonneau  in each car was what looked like the crowd at a large farmauctiongrandfather father mother a couple of sons and two or three daughters at least one baby in the arms of each grownup all jammed into two seats already filled with trunks and babycarriages and they were happyincredibly happier than the smart people being conveyed in a bored way behind chauffeurs  the sagebrush tourists made camp covered the hood with a quilt from which the cotton was oozing brought out the washboiler did a washing had dinner sang about the fire granther and the youngest baby gamboling together while the limousinvalids insulated from life by plate glass preserved by their steady forty an hour from the commonness of seeing anything along the road looked out at the campers for a second sniffed rolled on wearily wondering whether they would find a good hotel that nightand why the deuce they hadnt come by train  if claire boltwood had been protected by jeff saxton or by a chauffeur she too would probably have marveled at cars gray with dust the unshaved men in fleecelined duck coats and the women windburnt beneath the boudoir caps they wore as motoring bonnets but claire knew now that filling greasecups does not tend to delicacy of hands that when you wash with a cake of petrified pink soap and half a pitcher of cold hard water you never quite get the stain offyou merely get through the dust stratum to the laurentian grease formation and mutter a nice clean grease doesnt hurt food and go sleepily down to dinner  she saw a dozen camping devices unknown to the east trailers which by day bobbed along behind the car like coffins on two wheels but at night opened into tents with beds an icebox a table tents covering a bed whose head rested on the runningboard beds madeup in the car with the cushions as mattresses  the great transcontinental highway was colored not by motors alone it is true that the old west of the stories is almost gone that billings miles city bismarck are more given to doric banks than to gambling hells but still are there hints of frontier days still trudge the prairie schooners cowpunchers in chaps still stand at the doors of log cabinswhen they are tired of playing the automatic piano and blanket indians blackfeet and crows stare at fivestory buildingswhen they are not driving modern reapers on their farms  they all waved to claire telephone linemen lolling with pipes and climberstrapped legs in big trucks sang out to her traction engine crews shouted and these she found to be her own people only once did she lose contentmentwhen on the observation platform of a train bound for seattle she saw a britisher in flannels and a monocle headed perhaps for the orient as the train slipped silkenly away the gomez seemed slow and clumsy and the strain of driving intolerable and that britisher must be charming then a lonely tighthaired woman in the doorway of a tarpaper shack waved to her and in that wistful gesture claire found friendship  and sometimes in the desert of yet unbroken land she paused by the great highway and forgot the passion to keep going  she sat on a rock by a river so muddy that it was like yellow milk the only trees were a bunch of cottonwoods untidily scattering shreds of cotton and the only other vegetation left in the dead world was dusty green sagebrush with lumps of gray yet pregnant earth between or a few exquisite green and white flashes of the herb called snowonthemountain the inhabitants were jackrabbits or american magpies in sharp black and white livery forever trying to balance their huge tails against the wind and yelling in lowmagpie their opinion of tourists  she did not desire gardens then nor the pettiness of plump terraced hills she was in the real west and it was hers since she had won to it by her own plodding her soulif she hadnt had one it would immediately have been provided by special arrangement the moment she sat theresailed with the hawks in the high thin air and when it came down it sang hallelujahs because the sagebrush fragrance was more healing than piney woods because the sharpbitten edges of the buttes were coral and gold and basalt and turquoise and because a real person one milt daggett though she would never see him again had found her worthy of worship  she did not often think of milt she did not know whether he was ahead of her or had again dropped behind when she did recall him it was with respect quite different from the titillation that dancing men had sometimes aroused or the impression of manicured agreeableness and efficiency which jeff saxton carried about  she always supplicated the mythical milt in moments of tight driving driving just the actual getting on was her purpose in life and the routine of driving was her order of the day morning freshness rolling up as many miles as possible before lunch that she might loaf afterward the invariable two pm discovery that her eyes ached and the donning of huge amber glasses which gave to her lithe smartness a counterfeit scholarliness toward night the quarterhour of level sunglare which prevented her seeing the road dusk and the discovery of how much light there was after all once she remembered to take off her glasses the worst quarterhour when though the roads were an amethyst rich to the artist they were also a murkiness exasperating to the driver yet still too light to be thrown into relief by the lamps the mystic moment when night clicked tight and the lamps made a fan of gold and claire and her father settled down to plodding contentand no longer had to take the trouble of admiring the scenery  the morning out of billings she wondered why a low cloud so persistently held its shape and realized that it was a faroff mountain her first sight of the rockies then she cried out and wished for milt to share her exultation rather earnestly she said to mr boltwood  the mountains must be so wonderful to mr daggett after spending his life in a cornfield poor milt i hope  i dont think you need to worry about that young man i fancy hes quite able to run about by himself as jolly as a sanddog and of course im extremely grateful to him for his daily rescue of us from the jaws of death but he was right if he had stayed with us it would have been inconvenient to keep considering him he isnt accustomed to the comedy of manners  he ought to be hed enjoy it so hes the real american he has imagination and adaptability its a shame all the petits fours and bach recitals wasted on jeff saxton when a milt dag  yes yes quite so  no honest the dear honeylamb so ingenious and really rather goodlooking but so lonely and gregariouslike a little woolly dog that begs you to come and play and i slapped him when he patted his paws and gamboled it was horrible ill never forgive myself making him drive on ahead in that nasty patronizing way i feel as if wed spoiled his holiday i wonder if he had intended to make the yellowstone park trip he didnt  yes yes lets forget the young man look how very curious  they were crossing a high bridge over a railroad track along which a circus train was bending mr boltwood offered judicious remarks upon the migratory habits of circuses and the vision of the galahad of the teal bug was thoroughly befogged by parental observations till claire returned from youthful romance to being a sensible boltwood and decided that after all milt was not a lord of the skypainted mountains  before they bent south at livingston claire had her first mountain driving and once she had to ford a stream putting the car at it watching the water curve up in a lovely silver veil she felt that she was conquering the hills as she had the prairies  she pulled up on a plateau to look at her battery she noted the edge of a brakeband peeping beyond the drum in a ragged line of fabric and copper wire then she knew that she didnt know enough to conquer do you suppose its dangerous she asked her father who said a lot of comforting things that didnt mean anything  she thought of milt she stopped a passing car the driver guessed that the brakeband was all gone and that it would be dangerous to continue with it along mountain roads claire dustily tramped two miles to a ranch house and telephoned to the nearest garage in a town called saddle back  whenever a motorist has delirium he mutters those lamentable words telephoned to the nearest garage  she had to wait a tedious hour before she saw a flivver rattling up with the garage man who wasnt a man at all but a fourteenyearold boy he snorted rats you didnt need to send for me could have made it perfectly safe come on  never has the greatest boy pianist received such awe as claire gave to this contemptuous young god with grease on his peachy cheeks she did come on but she rather hoped that she was in great danger it was humiliating to telephone to a garage for nothing when she came into the gassmelling garage in saddle back she said appealingly to the man in charge a serious lippuffing person of fortyfive was it safe to come in with the brakeband like that  no pretty risky want it mike  the mike to whom he turned for authority was the same fourteenyearold boy he snapped heh that naw put in new band get busy bring me the jack hustle up uncle  while the older man stood about and vainly tried to impress people who came in and asked questions which invariably had to be referred to his repair boy the precocious expert stripped the wheel down to something that looked to claire distressingly like an empty milkpan then the boy didnt seem to know exactly what to do he scratched his ear a good deal and thought deeply the older man could only scratch  so for two hours claire and her father experienced that most distressing of motor experienceswaiting while the afternoon that would have been so good for driving went by them every fifteen minutes they came in from sitting on a drygoods box in front of the garage and never did the repair appear to be any farther along the boy seemed to be giving all his time to getting the wrong wrench and scolding the older man for having hidden the right one  when she had left brooklyn heights claire had not expected to have such authoritative knowledge of the kalifornia kandy kitchen saddle back montana across from tubbs garage that she could tell whether they were selling more atharva cigarettes or polutropons she prowled about the garage till she knew every pool of dripped water in the tin pail of soft soap in the iron sink  she was worried by an overheard remark of the boy wonder gosh we havent any more of that decent brake lining have to use this piece of mush but when the car was actually done nothing like a dubious brake could have kept her from the glory of starting the first miles seemed miracles of ease and speed  she came through the mountains into livingston  kicking his heels on a fence near town and fondling a gray cat sat milt daggett and he yelped at her with earnestness and much noise     chapter xii  the wonders of nature with all modern improvements   hello said milt  hello said claire  how dee do said mr boltwood  this is so nice wheres your car i hope nothings happened glowed claire  no its back here from the road a piece camp there tonight reason i stopped struck me youve never done any mountain driving and theres some pretty good climbs in the park slick road but we go up to almost nine thousand feet and cold mornings thought id tip you off to some driving tricksif youd like me to  oh of course very grateful  then ill tag after you tomorrow and speak my piece  so jolly youre going through the park  yes thought might as well what the guide books call wonders of nature only wonder of nature i ever saw in schoenstrom was my friend mac trying to think he was soused after a case of nearbeer well see you tomorrow  not once had he smiled his tone had been impersonal he vaulted the fence and tramped away  when they drove out of town in the morning they found milt waiting by the road and he followed them till noon by urgent request he shared a lunch and lectured upon going down long grades in first or second speed to save brakes upon the use of the retarded spark and the slipped clutch in climbing his bug was beside the gomez in the lineup at the park gate when the united states army came to seal ones firearms and to inquire on which mountain one intended to be killed by defective brakes he was just behind her all the climb up to mammoth hot springs  when she paused for water to cool the boiling radiator the bug panted up and with the first grin she had seen on his face since dakota milt chuckled the teal is a grand car for mountains aside from overheating bum lights thin upholstery faulty ignition tissuepaper brakebands and thishere special aviation engine specially built for a bumblebee its what the catalogues call a powerful brute  claire and her father stayed at the chain of hotels through the park milt was always near them but not at the hotels he patronized one of the chains of permanent camps  the boltwoods invited him to dinner at one hotel but he refused and                                       because he was afraid that claire would find him intrusive milt was grave in her presence he couldnt respond either to her enthusiasm about canyon and colored poolor to her rage about the tourists who she alleged preferred freak museum pieces to plain beauty who never admired a view unless it was labeled by a signpost and megaphoned by a guide as something they ought to admireand tell the folks back home about  when she tried to express this social rage to milt he merely answered uneasily yes i guess theres something to that  she was he pondered so darn particular how could he ever figure out what he ought to do no thanks much obliged but guessed hed better not accept her invitation to dinner darn sorry couldnt come but had promised a fellow down at the camp to have chow with him  if in this milt was veracious he was rather fickle to his newly discovered friend for while claire was finishing dinner a solemn young man was watching her through a window  she was at a table for six she was listening to a man of thirty in ridingbreeches a stock and a pointed nose who bowed to her every time he spoke which was so frequently that his dining gave the impression of a man eating grapefruit on a merrygoround back in schoenstrom fortified by mac and the bunch at the old home lunch milt would have called the man a dude andthough less noisily than the otherswould have yelped get onto percys beerbottle pants whats he got his neck bandaged for bet hes got a boil  but now milt yearned he does look swell wish i could get away with those things wouldnt i look like a fool with my knees buttoned up though and theres two other fellows in dress suits wouldnt mind those so much gee it must be awful where youve got so many suits of trick clothes you dont know which one to wear  that fellow and claire are talking pretty swift he doesnt need any piston rings that lad wonderwonder what theyre talking about music i guess and books and pictures and scenery hes saying that no tongue or pen can describe the glories of the park and then hes trying to describe em and maybe they know the same folks in new york lord how id be out of it i wish  milt made a toothpick out of a match decided that toothpicks were inelegant in his tragic mood and longed never did see her among her own kind of folks till now i wish i could jabber about music and stuff ill learn it i will i can i picked up autos in three months i milt youre a dub i wonder can they be talking french maybe or wop or something i could get onto the sedan styles in highbrow talk as long as it was in american  i could probably spring linencollar stuff about really a delightful book so full of delightful characters if i stuck by the rhetoric books long enough but once they begin the parlezvous oui oui im a gone goose still by golly didnt i pick up dutchgermanlike a mice back off son you did not you can talk plattdeutsch something grand as long as you keep the verbs and nouns in american you got a nice character milt but you havent got any parts of speech  now look at percy taking a bath in a fingerbowl i never could pull that fingerbowl stuff pinning your ears back and jiujitsing the fried chicken and then doing a high dive into a little dish that aintthat isnt either a washbowl or real good lemonade hes a perfect lady percy is dabs his mouth with his napkin like a watchmaker tinkering the carburetor in a wrist watch  lookit him bow and scrapeasking her something rats hes going out in the lobby with her walks like a cat on a wet ashpile but oh thunder hes all right neat i never could mingle with that bunch id be webfooted and butterfingered and he seems to know all that bunchbows to every maiden aunt in the shop now if i was following her id never see anybody but her rest of the folks could all bob their heads silly and id never see one blame thing except that funny little soft spot at the back of her neck nope youre kind to your cat milt but you werent cut out to be no parlororgan duet  this same meditative young man might have been discovered walking past the porch of the hotel his hands in his pockets his eyes presumably on the starscertainly he gave no signs of watching claire and the man in ridingbreeches as they leaned over the rail looked at mountaintops filmy in starlight while in the cologneatomized mode breeches quoted      ah tis far heaven my awed heart seeks     when i behold those mighty peaks  milt could hear him commenting doesnt that just get the feeling of the great open miss boltwood  milt did not catch her answer himself he grunted i never could get much het up about this poetry thats full of ahs and tises  claire must have seen milt just after he had sauntered past she cried oh mr daggett just a moment she left breeches ran down to milt he was frightened was he going to get what he deserved for eavesdropping  she was almost whispering save me from our friend up on the porch she implored  he couldnt believe it but he took a chance wont you have a little walk he roared  so nice of youjust a little way perhaps she sang out  they were silent till he got up the nerve to admire glad you found some people you knew in the hotel  but i didnt  oh i thought your friend in the ridingpants was chummy  so did i she rather snorted  well hes a nicelooking lad i did admire those pants i never could wear anything like that  i should hope notat dinner the creepy jackass i dont believe hes ever been on a horse in his life he thinks ridingbreeches are the  oh thats it breeches not pants  last word in smartness overdressing is just ten degrees worse than underdressing  oh i dont know take this sloppy old blue suit of mine  its perfectly nice and simple and quite well cut you probably had a clever tailor  i had he lives in chicago or new york i believe  really how did he come to schoenstrom  never been there this tailor is a busy boy he fitted about eleventeen thousand people last year  i see ready mades cheer up thats where henry b boltwood gets most of his clothes mr daggett if ever i catch you in the arentibeautiful frame of mind of our friend back on the porch ill give up my trip to struggle for your soul  he seemed to have soul in large chunks he seemed to talk pretty painlessly i had a hunch you and he were discussing sculpture anyway maybe rodin  what do you know about rodin  articles in the magazines same place you learned about him but milt did not sound rude he said it chucklingly  youre perfectly right and weve probably read the very same articles well our friend back there said to me at dinner it must be dreadful for you to have to encounter so many common people along the road i said it is in the most insulting tone i could and he just rolled his eyes and hadnt an idea i meant him then he slickered his hair at me and mooed is it not wonderful to see all these strange manifestations of the secrets of nature and i said is it and he went on one feels that if one could but meet a sympathetic lady here ones cup of rejoicing in untrammeled nature honest milt mr daggett i mean he did talk like that been reading books by optimistic lady authors and one looked at me one did as if one would be willing to hold my hand if i let one  he invited me to come out on the porch and give the double o to handsome mountains as illuminated by terrestrial bodies and i felt so weak in the presence of his conceit that i couldnt refuse then he insisted on introducing me to a woman from my own brooklyn who condoled with me for having to talk to western persons while motoring oh dear god that such people should live  that the sniffy little claire should once have been permitted to live and then i saw you  through all her tirade they had stood close together her face visibly eager in the glow from the hotel and milt had grown taller but he responded im afraid i might have been just as bad i havent even reached the ridingbreeches stage in evolution maybe never will  no you wont youll go right through it by and by when youre so rich that father and i wont be allowed to associate with you youll wear ridingbreechesbut for riding not as a donation to the beauties of nature  oh im already rich it shows waitress down at the camp asked me whose car i was driving through  i know what i wanted to say since you wont be our guest will you be our hosti mean as far as welcoming us i think it would be fun for father and me to stop at your camp tomorrow night at the canyon instead of at the hotel will you guide me to the canyon if i do  ohterriblyglad     chapter xiii  adventurers by firelight   neither of the boltwoods had seen the grand canyon of the colorado the canyon of the yellowstone was their first revelation of intimidating depth and color gone mad when their car and milts had been parked in the palisaded corral back of the camp at which they were to stay they three set out for the canyons edge chattering and stopped dumb  mr boltwood declined to descend he returned to the camp for a cigar the boy and girl crept down seeming miles of damp steps to an outhanging pinnacle that still was miles of empty airy drop above the river bed claire had a quaking feeling that this rock pulpit was going to slide she thrust out her hand seized milts paw and in its firm warmth found comfort clinging to its security she followed him by the crawling path to the river below she looked up at columns of crimson and saffron and burning brown up at the matronly falls up at lone pines clinging to jutting rocks that must be already crashing toward her and in the splendor she knew the panic fear that is the deepest reaction to beauty  milt merely shook his head as he stared up he had neither gossiped nor coyly squeezed her hand as he had guided her she fell to thinking that she preferred this american boy in this american scene to a nimble gentleman saluting the alps in a dinky green hat with a little feather  it was milt who when they had labored back up again when they had sat smiling at each other with comfortable weariness made her see the canyon not as a freak but as the miraculous work of a stream rolling grains of sand for millions of years till it had cut this jovian intaglio he seemed to have readwhether in books or in paragraphs in mechanical magazinesa good deal about geology he made it real not that she paid much attention to what he actually said she was too busy thinking of the fact that he should say it at all  not condescendingly but very companionably she accompanied milt in the exploration of their camp for the nightthe big dining tent the city of individual bedroom tents canvassided and woodenfloored each with a tiny stove for the cold mornings of these high altitudes she was awed that evening by hearing her waitress discussing the novels of ibanez jeff saxton knew the names of at least six russian novelists but jeff was not highly authoritative regarding spanish literature  i suppose shes a schoolteacher working here in vacation claire whispered to milt beside her at the long busy scenically conversational table  our waitress well sort of i understand shes professor of literature in some college said milt in a matter of fact way and he didnt at all see the sequence when she went on  there is an america im glad ive found it  the camps evening bonfire was made of logs on end about a stake of iron as the logs blazed up the guests on the circle of benches crooned suwanee river and old black joe and claire crooned with them she had been afraid that her father would be bored but she saw that above his carefully tended cigar he was dreaming she wondered if there had been a time when he had hummed old songs  the fire sank to coals the crowd wandered off to their tents mr boltwood followed them after an apologetic good night dont stay up too late with a scattering of only half a dozen people on the benches this huge circle seemed deserted and claire and milt leaning forward chins on hands were aloneby their own campfire among the mountains  the stars stooped down to the hills the pines were a wall of blackness a coyote yammered to point the stillness and the mighty pile of coals gave a warmth luxurious in the creeping mountain chill  the silence of large places awes the brisk intruder and claires voice was unconsciously lowered as she begged tell me something about yourself mr daggett i dont really know anything at all  oh you wouldnt be interested just schoenstrom  but just schoenstrom might be extremely interesting  but honest youd think i wasedging in on you  i know what you are thinking the time i suggested way back there in dakota that you were sticking too close youve never got over it ive tried to make up for it but i really dont blame you i was horrid i deserve being beaten but you do keep on punishing ra  punishing lord i didnt mean to no honest it was nothing you were right looked as though i was inviting myself but oh pleassssse miss boltwood dont ever think for a sec that i meant to be a grouch  then do tell me who is this milton daggett that you know so much better than i ever can  well milt crossed his knees caught his chin in his hand i dont know as i really do know him so well i thought i did i was onto his evil ways he was the son of the pioneer doctor maine folks  really my mother came from maine  milt did not try to find out that they were cousins he went on this kid milt went to high school in st cloudtown twenty times as big as schoenstrombut he drifted back because his dad was old and needed him after his mothers death  you have no brothers or sisters  no nobody cept lady vere de verewhich animal she is going to get cuffed if she chews up any more of my overcoat out in my tent tonight well this kid worked round machinery mostly and got interested in cars and started a garage wee that was an awful shop first one i had in rauskukles barn six wrenches and a screwdriver and a onelung pump and i didnt know a rollerbearing from threepoint suspension but well anyway he worked along and built a regular garage and paid off practically all the mortgage on it  i remember stopping at a garage in schoenstrom im almost sure it was for something i seem to remember it was a good place do you own it really  yees what there is of it  but theres a great deal of it its efficient youve done your job thats more than most highborn aidesdecamp could say  honestly welli dont know  who did you play with in schoenstrom oh i wish id noticed that town but i couldnt tell then that what uh which girl did you fall in love with  none honest none not one never fell in love  youre unfortunate i have lots of times i remember quite enjoying being kissed once at a dance  when he answered his voice was strange i suppose youre engaged to somebody  no and i dont know that i shall be once i thought i liked a man rather he has nice eyes and the most correct spectacles and he is polite to his mother at breakfast and his name is jeff and he will undoubtedly be worth five or six hundred thousand dollars some day and his opinions on george moore and commercial paper are equally sound and unoriginal oh i ought not to speak of him and i certainly ought not to be spiteful im not at all reticent and ladylike am i but somehow i cant see him out here against a mountain of jagged rock  only you wont always be out here against mountains some day youll be back inwhere is it in new york state  i confess its brooklynbut not what youd mean by brooklyn your remark shows you to have subtlety i must remember that mustnt i i wont always be driving through this big land but will i get all fussy and ribbontied again when i go back  no you wont you drive like a man  what has that  it has a lot to do with it a garage man can trail along behind another car and figger out figure out just about what kind of a person the driver is from the way he handles his boat now you bite into the job you drive pretty neatneatly you dont either scoot too far out of the road in passing a car or take corners too wide you wont be fussy but still i suppose youll be glad to be back among your own folks and youll forget the wild milt that tagged along  miltor mr daggettno milt i shall never in my oldest grayest year in a ducky cap by the fireplace forget the halfsecond when your hand came flashing along and caught that man on the runningboard but it wasnt just that melodrama if that hadnt happened something else would have to symbolize you its that youoh you took me in a stranger and watched over me and taught me the customs of the country and were never impatient no i shant forget that neither of the boltwoods will  in the rosehaze of firelight he straightened up and stared at her but he settled into shyness again as she added  perhaps others would have done the same thing i dont know if they had i should have remembered them too but it happened that it was you and i uh my father and i will always be grateful we both hope we may see you in seattle what are you planning to do there what is your ambition or is that a rude question  why uh  what i mean i mean how did you happen to want to go there with a garage at home you still control it  oh yes left my mechanic in charge why i just kind of decided suddenly i guess it was what they call an inspiration always wanted a long trip anyway and i thought maybe in seattle i could hook up with something a little peppier than schoenstrom maybe something in alaska always wished i were a mechanical or civil engineer so  then why dont you become one youre young how old are you  twentyfive  were both children compared with jecompared with some men who are my friends youre quite young enough to go to engineering school and take some academic courses on the sideenglish so on why dont you have you ever thought of it  nno i hadnt thought of doing it but all right i will in seattle blieve the university of washington is there  you mean it  yes i do youre the boss  thatsthats flattering but do you always make up your mind as quickly as this  when the boss gives orders  he smiled and she smiled back but this time it was she who was embarrassed youre rather overwhelming you change your lifeif you really do mean itbecause a jeune fille from brooklyn is so impertinent from her olympian height of finishingschool learning as to suggest that you do so  i dont know what a jeune fille is but i do know he sprang up he did not look at her he paraded back and forth three steps to the right three to the left his hands in his pockets his voice impersonal i know youre the finest person i ever met youre the kindi knew there must be people like you because i knew the joneses theyre the only friends ive got that have oh i suppose its what they call culture  in a long monologue uninterrupted by claire he told of his affection for the schoenstrom prof and his wife the practical slangy milt of the garage was lost in the enthusiastic undergraduate adoring his instructor in the university that exists as veritably in a teachers or a doctors sittingroom in every schoenstrom as it does in certain lugubrious stone hulks recognized by a state legislature as magically empowered to paste on sacred labels lettered bachelor of arts  he broke from his revelations to plump down on the bench beside her to slap his palm with his fist and sigh lord ive been gassing on guess i bored you  oh please milt please i see it all so it must have been wonderful the evening when mrs jones read noyess highwayman aloud tell melong before thatwere you terribly lonely as a little boy  now milt had not been a terribly lonely little boy he had been a leader in a gang devoted to fighting swimming pickerelspearing beggiestealing and catching rides on freights  but he believed that he was accurately presenting every afternoon of his childhood as he mused yes i guess i was pretty much i remember i used to sit on dads doorstep all those long sleepy summer afternoons and id think aw geeeeee iwishtihadsomebodytoplaywith i always wanted to makeblieve robin hood but none of the other kidsso many of them were german they didnt know about robin hood so i used to scout off alone  if i could only have been there to be maid marian for you wed have learned archery lonely little boy on the doorstep her fingers just touched his sleeve in her gesture the emberlight caught the crystal of her wrist watch she stooped to peer at it and her pitying tenderness broke off in an agitated heavings is it that late to bed good night milt  good night cl miss boltwood  no claire of course im not normally a firstnamesnatcher but i do seem to have fallen into saying milt night  as she undressed in her tent claire reflected he wont take advantage of my being friendly will he only thing is i shant dare to look at henry b when milt calls me claire in that sedate brooklyn heights presence the dear lamb lonely afternoons     chapter xiv  the beast of the corral   they met in the frostshimmering mountain morning on their way to the corral to get their cars ready before breakfast they were shy hence they were boisterous and tremendously unreferential to campfire confidences and informative about distilled water for batteries and the price of gas in the park on milts shoulder rode vere de vere who in her original way relieved one pause by observing mrwr  they came in through the corral gate before any of the other motor tourists had appearedand they stupidly halted to watch a bear a large black adipose and extremely unchained bear stalk along the line of cars sniff cock an ear at the gomez lumber up on its runningboard and bundle into the seat his stern filled the space between side and top and he was to be heard snuffing  oh look milt left box of candy on seat oh please drive him away  me drivethat  frighten him away arent animals afraid human eye  not in this park guns forbidden animals protected by u s army president congress supreme court department of interior monroe doctrine w c t u but ill trycautiously  dont you want me think youre hero  yees providin i dont have to go and be one  they edged toward the car the bear flapped his hind legs looked out at the intruders said oofflll and returned to the candy  shoo milt answered politely  llooffll  from his own bug beside the gomez milt got a tool kit and with considerable brilliance as a pitcher he sent a series of wrenches at the agitated stern of the bear they offended the dignity of the ward of the government he finished the cover and ribbons of the candy box and started for milt  who proceeded with haste toward claire  who was already at the gate  lady vere de vere cat of a thousand battles gave one frightful squawl shot from milts shoulder and at the bear claws out fur electric the bear carelessly batted once with its paw and the cat sailed into the air the satisfied bear strolled to the fence shinned up it and over  good old vere that wallop must of darn near stunned her though milt laughed to claire as they trotted back into the corral the cat did not move as they came up did not give the gallant mrwr with which she had saluted milt on lonely morning after morning of forlorn driving behind the gomez he picked vere up  shesshes dead he said he was crying  oh milt last night you said vere was all the family you had you have the boltwoods now  she did not touch his hand nor did they speak as they walked soberly to the far side of the corral and buried lady vere de vere at breakfast they talked of the coming days run from the canyon out of the park and northward but they had the queer quick casualness of intimates                                       it was at breakfast that her father heard one milt daggett address the daughter of the boltwoods as claire the father was surprised into clearing his throat and attacking his oatmeal with a zealousness unnatural in a man who regarded breakfastfoods as moral rather than interesting  while he was lighting a cigar and claire was paying the bill mr boltwood stalked milt cleared his throat all over again and said nice morning  it was the first time the two men had talked unchaperoned by claire  yes we ought to have a good run sir the sir came hard the historian puts forth a theory that milt had got it out of fiction we might go up over mount washburn take us up to ten thousand feet  uh you saiddidnt miss boltwood tell me that you are going to seattle too  yes  friends there no doubt  milt grinned irresistibly not a friend but im going to make em im going to take up engineering and some french i guess at the university there  ah really  yes been too limited in my ambition dont see why i shouldnt get out and build railroads and power plants and roadssiberia africa all sorts of interesting places  quite right quite right uh ah i oh i have you seen miss boltwood  i saw miss boltwood in the office  oh yes quite so uhah here she is  when the gomez had started mr boltwood skirmished this young man do you think you better let him call you by your christian name  why not i call him milt mr daggett is too long a handle to use when a man is constantly rescuing you from the perils of the deep or hoboes or bears or something oh i havent told you poor old milt his cat was killed  yes yes dolly you may tell me about that in due time but lets stick to this social problem for a moment do you think you ought to be too intimate with him  hes only too selfrespecting he wouldnt take advantage  im quite aware of that im not speaking on your behalf but on his im sure hes a very amiable chap and ambitious in fact did you know that he has saved up money to attend a university  when did he tell you that how long has he been planning i thought that i  just this morning just now  oh im relieved  i dont quite follow you dolly but where was i do you realize what a demure tyrant you are if you can drag me from new york to the aboriginal wilds and i did not like that oatmeal what will you do to this innocent i want to protect him  you better because im going to carve him and paint him and possibly spoil him the creating of a manof one who knows how to handle lifeis so much more wonderful than creating absurd pictures or statues or stories ill nag him into completing college hell learn dignityor perhaps lose his simplicity and be ruined and then ill marry him off to some nice wellbred pinkface like jeff saxtons pretty cousinwho may turn him into a beastly moneygrubber and im monkeying with destiny and i ought to be slapped and i realize it and i cant help it and all my latent instinct as a feminine meddler is aroused andgolly i almost went off that curve     chapter xv  the black day of the voyage   that was the one black day of her voyageblack stippled with crimson  it began with the bears invasion of the car resulting in long clawmarks across the upholstery the loss of some particularly good candy bought at a park hotel and genuine grief abiding after the sentimental tragedy of vere de veres death the next act was the ingenious loss of all power of her engine she forgot that before breakfast milt had filled the oilwell for her when she stopped for gasoline and the seller inquired quart of oilshe absently nodded so the cylinders filled with surplus oil the sparkplugs were fouled and the engine had the power of a sewing machine  she could not make mount washburnshe could not make even the slopes of the lower road now she knew the agony of the feeble car in the mountainsmost shameful and anxious of a drivers dolors the brisk start up the hill the belief that you will keep on going this time the feeling of weariness through all the car the mad shifting of gears the slipping of the clutch and more gas and less gas and wondering whether more gas or less is the better and the appalling knocking when you finally give her a lot too much gas the remembrance when its too late to retard the spark the safe crawling up to the last sharp pitch just fifteen feet from the summit the cars halting the yelp at your passenger jump out and push the painful next five feet and the final death of the power just as the front wheels creep up over the pitch then the anxious putting on of brakesholding the car with both footbrake and emergency lest it run down backward slip off the road the calf of your leg begins to ache from the pressure on the footbrake and with an unsuccessful effort to be courteous you bellow at the passenger who has been standing beside the car looking deprecatory will you please block the back wheels with a stonehustle up will you  all this routine claire thoroughly learned always milt bumbled up said cheerful things and either hauled the gomez over the pitch by a towline to his bug or getting out pushing on a rear fender till his neck was red and bulgy gave the extra impetus necessary to get the gomez over  would you mind shoving on that side just a little bit he suggested to mr boltwood who ceased the elaborate smoking of cigars dusted his hands and gravely obeyed while claire was awaiting the new captains command to throw on the power  i wish we werent under so much obligation to this young man said mr boltwood after one crisis  i know butwhat can we do  dont you suppose we might pay him  henry b boltwood if you tried to do that im not sure your being my parent might save you but even so i think hed probably chase you off the road clear down into that chasm  i suppose so shall we have to entertain him in seattle  have to my dear parent you cant keep me from it any of the seattle friends of gene gilson who dont appreciate that straight fine aspiring boy may go not overdo it you understand but oh take him to the theater by the way shall we try to climb mount rainier before  see here my good dolly you stop steering me away from my feeble parental efforts do you wish to be under obligations  dont mind with milt he wouldnt charge interest as jeff saxton would milt is oh hes folks  quite true but are we are you  learning to be  between discussions and not making hills claire cleaned the spark plugs as they accumulated carbon from the surplus oilor she pretended to help milt clean them the plugs were always very hot and when you were unscrewing the jacket from the core you always burned your hand and wished you could swear  and sometimes you could  after noon when they had left the park and entered gardiner milt announced ive got to stick around a while the key in my steeringgear seems to be worn may have to put in a new one get the stuff at a garage here if you wouldnt mind waiting be awful glad to tag and try to give a few helping hands till the oil cleans itself out  ill just stroll on she said but she drove away as swiftly as she could her fathers worry about obligations disturbed her and she did not wish to seem too troublesome an amateur to milt she would see him in livingston and tell him how well she had driven the spark plugs kept clean enough now so that she could command more power but  between the park and the transcontinental road there are many climbs short but severely steep upshoots like the humps on a scenic railway to tackle them with her uncertain motor was like charging a machinegun nest she spent her nerveforce lavishly and after every wild rush to make a climb she had to rest to rub the suddenly aching back of her neck because she was so tired she did not take the trouble to save her brakes by going down in gear she let the brakes smoke while the river and railroad below rose up at her  there was a long drop how long it was she did not guess because it was concealed by a curve at the top she seemed to plane down forever the brakes squealed behind she tried to shift to first but there was a jarring snarl and she could neither get into first nor back into third she was running in neutral the great car coasting while she tried to slow it by jamming down the footbrake the car haltedand started on again the brakelining which had been wished on her at saddle back was burnt out  she had the feeling of the car bursting out from under control  ready to leap off the road into a wash she wanted to jump it took all her courage to stay in the seat she got what pressure she could from the remaining band with one hand she kept the accelerating car in the middle of the road with the other she tried to pull the handle of the emergency brake back farther she couldnt she was not strong enough faster faster rushing at the next curve so that she could scarce steer round it  as quietly as she could she demanded of her father pull back on this brake lever far as you can take both hands  i dont understand  heavens y dont haft unstand yank back yank i tell you  again the car slowed she was able to get into second speed even that check did not keep the car from darting down at thirty miles an hourwhich pace to one who desires to saunter down at a dignified rate of eighteen is equivalent in terms of mileage on level ground to seventy an hour with a drunken driver on a foggy evening amid traffic  she got the car down and in the midst of a valley of emptiness and quiet she dropped her head on her fathers knee and howled  i just cant face going down another hill i just cant face it she sobbed  no dolly mustnt we better youre quite right this young daggett is a very gentlemanly fellow i didnt think his tablemanners but well sit here and regard the flora and fauna till he comes hell see us through  yes he will honestly dad she said it with the first touch of heroworship since she had seen an aviator loop loops isnt he oh effective arent you glad hes here to help us instead of somebody like jeff saxton  weul you must remember that geoffrey wouldnt have permitted the brake to burn out hed have foreseen it and have had a branch office with special leased wire located back on that hill ready to do business the instant the market broke enthusiasm is a nice quality dolly but dont misplace it this lad however trustworthy he may be would scarcely even be allowed to work for a man like geoffrey saxton it may be that later with college  no hed work for jeff two hours then jeff would give him that you poor fish look and milt would hit him and stroll out and go to the north pole or some place and discover an oilwell and hire jeff as his nice efficient general manager and i do wish milt would hurry though  it was dusk before they heard the pitpitpit chuckling down the hill milts casual grin changed to bashfulness as claire ran into the road her arms wide in a lovely gesture of supplication and cried we been waiting for you so long one of my brakebands is burnt out and the other is punk  well well lets try to figure out something to do  she waited reverently while the local prophet sat in his bug stared at the wheels of the gomez and thought the levelfloored sagebrushsprinkled hollow had filled with mauve twilight and creeping stilly sounds the knowable world of yellow lights and security was far away milt was her only means of ever getting back to it  tell you what we might try he speculated ill hitch on behind you and hold back in going down hill  she did not even try to help him while he again cleaned the spark plugs and looked over brakes oil gas water she sat on the runningboard and it was pleasant to be relieved of responsibility he said nothing at all while he worked he whistled that recent refined ballad      i wanta go back to oregon     and sit on the lawn and look at the dawn     oh motheruh dear dont leavuh me here     the leaves are so sere in the fallothe year     i wanta go back to oregugon     to dearuh old oregugon  they started shouting optimistically to each other lights on trouble seeming overand they stopped after the next descent and pools of tears were in the corners of claires eyes the holdback had not succeeded her big car with its quickincreasing momentum had jerked at the bug as though it were a lardcan the towrope had stretched sung snapped and again in fireshot delirium she had gone rocking down hill  he drove up beside her got out stood at her elbow his im a bum inventor well try somethin else was so careless that in her nervetwanging exhaustion she wailed oh dont be so beastly cheerful you dont care a bit  in the dusk she could see him straighten and his voice came sharp as he ignored the everpresent parental background and retorted somebody has got to be cheerful matter fact i worked out the right stunt coming down  like a man in the dentists chair recovering between bouts she drowsed and ignored the fact that in a few minutes she would again have to reassemble herself become wakeful and calm and go through quite impossible maneuvers of driving milt was with a hatchet from his campingkit cutting down a large scrub pine he dragged it to the gomez and hitched it to the back axle the knuckles of the branches would dig into the earth the foliage catch at every pebble  there that anchor would hold a truck he shouted  it held she went down the next two hills easily but she was through her forearms and brain were equally numb she appealed to milt i cant seem to go on any more its so dark and im so tired  all right no ranch houses anywheres near so well camp here if mr boltwood doesnt mind  claire stirred herself to help him prepare dinner it wasnt much of a dinner to prepare both cars had let provisions run low they had bacon and petrified ends of a loaf and something like coffeenot much like it scientists may be interested in their discovery that as a substitute for both cream and sugar in beverages strawberry jam is a fallacy  for mr boltwoods bed milt hauled out the springy seatcushions of both cars the gomez cushion was three inches thicker than that of the bug which resulted in a mattress two stories in front with a leanto at the foot and the entire edifice highly slippery but with a blanket from milts kit it was sufficient to claire milt gave another blanket his collection of antique overcoats and good advice he spoke vaguely of a third blanket for himself and he had one its dimensions were thirteen by twenty inches it was of white wool he had bought it in dakota for vere de vere and many times that day he had patted it and whispered poor old cat  under his blankets mr boltwood thought of rattlesnakes bears rheumatism brooklyn his debt to milt and the fact thatthough he hadnt happened to mention it to clairehe had expected to be killed when the brake had burned out  claire was drowsily happy she had got through she was conscious of rustling sagebrush of the rapids of the yellowstone beside her of open sky and sweet air and a scorn for people in stuffy rooms and comfortably ever conscious of milt ten feet away she had in him the interest that a young physician would have in a new xray machine a printer in a new font of type any creator in a new outlet for his power she would see to it that her seattle cousins the gilsons helped him to know the right people during his university work she herself would be back in brooklyn but perhaps he would write to her writewrite lettersbrooklynshe was in brooklynno no where was sheoh yes campingbad daybrakes no she would not marry jeff saxton brooklynriver singingstars  and when milt wasnt unromantically thinking of his cold back he exulted she wont be back among her own folks till seattle probably forget me then dont blame her but till we get there shell let me play in her yard gee in the morning ill be talking to her again and shes right there right now  in the morning they were all very stiff but glad of the sun on sagebrush and river and the boy and girl sang over breakfast while milt was gathering fuel he looked up at claire standing against a background of rugged hills her skirt and shoes still smug but her jacket off her blouse turned in at the throat her hair blowing her sleeves rolled up one hand on her hip erect charged with vigorthe spirit of adventure  when her brake had been relined at livingston they sauntered companionably on to butte and the day after butte when milt was half a mile behind the gomez a pinkhaired man with a large shiny revolver stepped out from certain bushes and bowed politely and at that point milt stopped     chapter xvi  the spectacles of authority   over the transcontinental divide and into butte diamondglittering on its hills in the dark into missoula where there are trees and a university with a mountain in everybodys backyard through the flathead agency where scarletblanketed indians stalk out of tepees and the papoose rides on mothers back as in forgotten days down to st ignatius that italian alp town with its old mission at the foot of mountains like the wall of heaven claire had driven west then north she was sailing past flathead lake where fifty miles of mountain glory are reflected in bright waters everywhere were sections of flat wheatplains stirring with threshing with clattering machinery and the flash of blown straw but these miniature prairies were encircled by abrupt mountains  mr boltwood remarked id rather have one of these homesteads and look across my fields at those hills than be king of england not that he made any effort to buy one of the homesteads but then he made no appreciable effort to become king of england  claire had not seen milt for a day and a half not since the morning when both cars had left butte she wondered and was piqued and slightly lonely toward evening when she was speculating as to whether she would make kalispellalmost up to the canadian bordershe saw a woman run into the road from a house on the shore of flathead lake the woman held out her hand claire pulled up  are you miss boltwood  it was as startling as the same question would have been in a chinese village  wwhy yes  somebody trying to get you on the longdistance phone  me phone  she was trembling somethings happened to milt he needs me she could not manage her voice as she got the operator on the farmersline wire and croaked was some one trying to get miss boltwood  yes this boltwood hotel in kalispell trying to locate you for two hours been telephoning all along the line from butte to somers  wwell wwill you gget em for me  it was not milts placid and slightly twangy voice but one smoother more decisive perplexingly familiar that finally vibrated hello hello miss boltwood operator i cant hear get me a better connection miss boltwood  yes yes this is miss boltwood she kept beseeching during a long and not unheated controversy between the unknown and the crisp operator who knew nothing of the english language beyond heres your party why dont you talk speak louder  then came clearly hear me now  yes yes  miss boltwood  yes  oh oh hello claire this is jeff  jess who  not jess jeff geoffrey jeff jeff saxton  oh it was like a sob whywhybut youre in new york  not exactly dear im in kalispell montana  but thats right near here  so am i  bbut  out west to see copper interests traced you from yellowstone park but missed you at butte thought id catch you on road you talking from barmberrys  the woman who had hailed her was not missing a word of a telephone conversation which might be relative to death fire elopement or any other dramatic event claire begged of her where in the world am i talking from anyway  this is barmberrys inn  yes claire answered on the telephone i seem to be shall i start on and  no got ripping plan stay right where you are got a fast car waiting be right down well have dinner by  a click no answer to claires urgent hellos she hung up the receiver very very carefully she hated to turn and face her audience of mr henry b boltwood mr james barmberry mrs james barmberry and four barmberry buds averaging five and a quarter in age she tried to ignore the barmberrys but their silence was noisy and interested while she informed her father its jeff saxton out here to see copper mines telephoned along road to catch us says were to wait dinner till he comes  yessum mrs barmberry contributed he told me if i did catch you i was to have some newkilled chickens ready to fry and some whipped cream jim barmberry you go right out and finish whipping that cream and dont stand there gawping and gooping and you children you scat  claire seized the moment of mr boltwoods lordly though bewildered bow to their hostess and escaped outdoors round the original settlers logcabin were nests of shacks and tents for bedrooms and on a screened porch looking on flathead lake was the diningroom the few other guests had finished supper and gone to their tents  she ambled to the lake shore feeling feebler more slapped and sent back to be a good little girl than she had when milt had hitched a forest to the back axle three days ago a map of her thoughts about jeff saxton would have shown a labyrinth now she was muttering dear jeff so thoughtful clever of him to find me so good to see him again now its still distinctly understood that i am not engaged to him and im not going to be surprised into kissing him when he comes down like a wolf on the fold now jeff saxton here makes me homesick for the heights and nice shops in manhattan and a really good playmusic just before the curtain goes up now ohhhhhh geeeeee whizzzzzz i wonder if hell let us go any farther in the car hes so managerial and dad is sure to take his side he tried to scare us off by that telegram to fargo now hed be horrified if he knew about that bum brake milt didnt mind milt likes his womenfolks to be daring jeff wants his harem admiring and very reliable  she crouched on the shore a rather forlorn figure the peaks of the mission range across the violetshadowed mirror of flathead lake were a sudden pure rose in reflection of sunset then stony forbidding across the road on the barmberry porch she could hear her father saying ah and indeed to jamess stories  up the road a blaring horn great lights growing momently more dazzling a roar a rush the halting car and out of its blurred bulk a trim figure dartingjeff saxtonhome and the people she loved and the ways and days she knew best of all he had shouted only is miss before she had rushed to him into the comfort of his arms and kissed him  she backed off and tried to sound as if it hadnt happened but she was quavery i cant believe it its too ridiculously wonderful to see you she retreated toward the barmberry porch jeff following his two hands out they came within the range of the house lights and mr boltwood hailed ah geoffrey never had such a surprisenor a more delightful one  mr boltwood looking splendid sir new man william street better look to its laurels when you come back and get into the game  then on the lamplighted porch the two men shook hands and looked for some other cordial thing to do they thought about giving each other cigars they smiled and backed away and smiled in the foolish indeterminate way males have being unable to take it out in kissing mr boltwood solved the situation by hemming must trot in and wash see you very soon mr james barmberry and the squad of lesser barmberrys regretfully followed claire was alone with jeff and she was frightened yet she was admitting that jeff in his english cap and flaring london topcoat his keen smile and his extreme shavedness was more attractive than she had remembered  glad to see me he demanded  oh rather  youre looking  youre so  nice trip you know youve sent me nothing but postcards with pretty town or something equally sentimental  yes its really been bully these mountains and big spaces simply inspire me she said it rather defiantly  of course they do trouble is with you away weve nothing to inspire us  do you need anything with your office and your club  why claire  im sorry that was horrid of me  yes it was though i dont mind im sure weve all become meek missing you so im quite willing to be bullied and reminded that im a mere tbm  she had got herself into it she had to tell him that he wasnt just a business man that she had just meant he was so practical  but jeff is no longer the practical one he declared think of claire driving over deserts and mountains but oh its been so lonely for us can you guess how much a dozen times every evening ive turned to the telephone to call you up and beg you to let me nip in and see you and then realized you werent there and ive just sat looking at the phone oh other people are so dull  you really miss  i wish i were a poet so i could tell you adequately but you havent said you missed me claire didnt you a teeny bit wouldnt it have been tolerable to have poor old jeff along to drive down dangerous hills  and fill greasecups nasty and stickum on the fingers  yes id have done that too and invented surprises along the way im a fine surpriser ive arranged for a motorboat so we can explore the lake here tomorrow thats why i had you wait here instead of coming on to kalispell tomorrow morning unfortunately i have to hustle back and catch a traincalled to california and possibly a northern trip but meantime by now my driver must have sneaked my sprises into the kitchen  what are they  guess  food eats divine eats  maybe  but what please sir claire is so hungry  we shall see in time my child uncle jeff is not to be hurried  ahletmeseenow ill kick and scream  from new york jeff had brought a mammoth picnic basket to the fried chicken ordered for dinner he added sealed jars of pur√©e of wood pigeon of stuffed artichokes prepared by his club chef caviar and anchovies a marvelous nightmarecreating fruit cake to go with the whipped cream two quarts of a famous sherry candied fruits in a silver box dinner was served not on the diningporch but before the fire in the barmberrys livingroom claire looked at the candied fruits stared at jeff rather queerlyas though she was really thinking of some one elseand mused  i didnt know i cared so much for these foolish luxuries tonight id like a bath just a tiny bit scented and a real dressingtable with a triple mirror and french talc and come down in a dinnergown oh i have enjoyed the trip jeff but my poor body does get so tired and dusty and then you treacherously come along with these things that youve magicked out of the mountains and im not a pioneer woman after all and henry b is not a caveman see him act idolatrously toward his soup  i feel idolatrous id forgotten the supreme ethical importance of the soup ill never let myself forget it again said mr boltwood in the tone of one who has come home  claire was grateful to jeff that he did not let her go on being grateful he turned the talk to brooklyn he was neat and explicitand almost funnyin his description of an outdoor presentation of midsummer nights dream in which a domestic and intellectual lady weighing a hundred and eightyseven stageside had enacted puck as they sat after dinner as claire shivered he produced a knitted robe and pulled it about her shoulders smiling at her in a lonely hungry way she caught his hand  nice jeff she whispered  oh my dear he implored he shook his head in a wistful way that caught her heart and dutifully went back to informing mr boltwood of the true state of the markets  talk to claire too she demanded she stopped stared from outside she heard a nervous pitpitpit a blurred dialogue between mr james barmberry and another man into the room rambled milt daggett dusty of unpressed blue suit tired of eyes and not too well shaved of chin grumbling thought id never catch up with you claire why  oh oh miltmr daggett oh jeff this is our good friend milt daggett who has helped us along the road  jeffs lucid rimless spectacles stared at milts windreddened eyes his jaunty patchpocket outing clothes sniffed at milts sweater his even voice followed milts grunt of surprise with a curt ah mr daggett  pleased meet you faltered milt  jeff nodded turned his shoulder on milt and went on the fact is mr boltwood the whole metal market  milt was looking from one to another claire was now over her first shocked comparison of candied fruits with motor grease she rose moved toward milt murmuring have you had dinner  the door opened again a pinkhaired redfaced man in a preposterous green belted suit lunged in swept his broad felt hat in greeting and boomed like a cheap actor  friends of my friend milt we about to dine salute you let me introduce myself as westlake parrott better known to the vulgar as pinky parrott gentleman adventurer born in the conjunction of mars and venus with saturn ascendant  jeff had ignored milt but at this absurd second intrusion on his decidedly private dinnerparty he flipped to the center of the room and said i beg your pardon in such a headoffice manner that the pinklocked mystery halted in his bombast claire felt wabbly she had no theories as to where milt had acquired a private jester nor as to what was about to happen to miltand possibly to her incautious self     chapter xvii  the vagabond in green   as milt had headed westward from butte as he rattled peacefully along the road conscious of golden haze over all the land and the unexpectedness of prairie threshingcrews on the sloping fields of mountainsides a man had stepped out from bushes beside the road and pointed a 44 navy revolver  the man was not a movie bandit he wore a green imitation of a norfolk jacket he had a broad red smile and as he flourished his hat in a bow his hair was a bristly pompadour of graystreaked red that was almost pink he made oration  pardon my eccentric greeting brother of the open road but i wanted you to give ear to my obsequious query as to hows chances on gettin a lift i have learned that obsequiousness is best appreciated when it is backed up by prayer and catridges  whats the idea i seem to gather youd like a lift jump in  you do not advocate the ciceronian style i take it chuckled the man as he climbed aboard  milt was not impressed claire might have been but milt had heard politics and religion argued about the stove in rauskukles store too often to be startled by polysyllabomania he knew it was often the sign of a man who has read too loosely and too much by himself he snorted huh what are younewspaper politics law preacher or gambler  well a little of all those interesting occupations and tentwentthirt trouping and countyfair spieling and selling dr thunder rapids choctaw herbal sensitizer how far y going  seattle  honest say kid this is muh boy we shall have the rare privilege of pooling adventures as far as blewett pass four to six days run from herea day this side of seattle im going to my goldmine there ill split up on the grubi note from your kit that you camp nights quite all right my boy pinky parrott is no man to fear night air  he patted milts shoulder with patronizing insolence he filled a pipe and though the car was making twentyfive he lighted the pipe with distinguished ease then settled down to his steady stride  in the pride of youth you feel that you have thoroughly categorized me particularly since i am willing to admit that though i shall have abundance of the clinking iron men to buy my share of our chow i chance just for the leadenfooted second to lack the wherewithal to pay my railroad fare back to blewett and the bumpers and sidedoor pullman of the argonauts like me not too damn dusty but your analysis is unsynthetic though you will scarce grasp my paradoxical metaphor  the hell i wont ive taken both chemistry and rhetoric growled milt strictly attending to driving and to the desire to get rid of his parasite  oh oh i see well anyway i am no mere nimble knight of wits as you may take it in fact i am lord of fair acres in arcady  dont know the burg montana or idaho  neither in the valley of dream  oh that one huh  but i happen to back them up with a perfectly undreamlike goldmine prospected for it in a canyon near blewett pass and found it b gum and my lady wife erstwhile fairest among the society favorites of north yakima now guards it against her consorts return straight goods got the stuff been to butte to get a raise on it but the fell khedives of commerce are jealous they would hearken not gee those birds certainly did pull the frigid mitt so i wend my way back to the demure dolores the houri of my heart and the next time ill take a crack at the big guns in seattle and ill sure reward you for your generosity in taking me to blewett all the long long languid languorous way  too bad i got to stop couple of days at spokane  well then you shall have the pleasure of taking me that far  and about a week in kalispell  twill discommode me but pon honor i like your honest simple face and i wont desert you besides i know a guy in kalispell and i can panhandle the sordid necessary chuck while i wait for you little you know my cockerel how facile a brain your bus so lightly bears when ive cashed in on the mine ill take my rightful place among the motored gentry not merely as actor and spieler promoter and inventor and soldier and daring journalist have i played my r√¥le but also i am a mystic an initiate a clairaudient a psychometrist a rosicrucian adept and profoundly psychicin fact my guide is hermes trismegistus himself i also hold a degree as doctor of mentopractic and my studies in astrobiochemistry  gonna stop all off make little coffee said milt  he did not desire coffee and he did not desire to stop but he did desperately desire not to inflict pinky parrott upon the boltwoods it was in his creed as a lover of motors never to refuse a ride to any one when he had room he hoped to get around his creed by the hint implied in stopping pinkys reaction to the hint was not encouraging  why you have a touch of the psychics flare i could do with coffee myself but dont trouble to make a fire ill do that you drivei do the camp work not but that i probably drive better than you if you will permit me to say so i used to do a bit of racing before i took up aviation  huh aviation what machine dyou fly  why whya biplane  huh what kind of motor  why a foreign one thethe it was a french motor  huh what track you race on  the pardon me till i build a fire for our al fresco collation and i my driving history will unfold  but he didnt do either  after he had brought seven twigs one piece of sagebrush and a sixinch board pinky let milt finish building the fire while he told how much he knew about the mysteries of ancient egyptian priests  milt gave up hope that pinky would become bored by waiting and tramp on after one hour of conversational deluge he decided to let pinky driveto make him admit that he couldnt he was wrong pinky could drive he could not drive well he wabbled in his steering and he killed the engine on a grade but he showed something of the same dashing idiocy that characterized his talk it was milt not pinky who was afraid of their running off the road and suggested resuming the wheel  seven times that day milt tried to lose him once he stopped without excuse and merely stared up at rocks overhanging the hollowed road pinky was not embarrassed he leaned back in the seat and sang two spanish love songs once milt deliberately took a wrong road up a mountainside they were lost and took five hours getting back to the highway pinky loved the thrill andin a brief address lasting fifteen minuteshe said so  milt tried to bore him by driving at seven miles an hour pinky affectionately accepted this opportunity to study the strata of the hills when they camped that night pinky loved him like a brother and was considering not stopping at blewett pass to see his goldmine and dolores the ladywife but going clear on to seattle with his playmate  the drafted host lay awake and when pinky awoke and delivered a few wellchosen words on the subject of birdsong at dawn milt burst out  pinky i dont like to do it but ive never refused a fellow a lift but im afraid youll have to hike on by yourself the rest of the way  pinky sat up in his blankets afraid of me eh you better be im a bad actor i killed doloress husband and took her along see i  are you trying to scare me you poor fourflusher milts right hand expanded fingers arching with the joyous tension of a man stretching  no im just reading your thoughts im telling you youre scared of me you think that if i went on i might steal your car youre afraid because im so suave you arent used to smooth ducks you dont dare to let me stick with you even for today youre afraid id have your misable car by tonight you dont dare  the hell i dont howled milt if you think im afraid just to show you im not ill let you go on today  thats sense my boy it would be a shame for two such born companions of the road to part pinky had soared up from his blankets was lovingly shaking milts hand  milt knew that he had been tricked but he felt hopeless was it impossible to insult pinky he tried again  ill be frank with you youre the worst windjamming liar i ever met now dont reach for that gat of yours ive got a hefty rock right here handy  but my dear dear boy i dont intend to reach for any crude lethal smokewagon besides there isnt anything in it i hocked the shells in butte i am not angry merely grieved well argue this out as we have breakfast and drive on i can prove to you that though occasionally i let my fancy color mere untutored fact with the pigments of a robert j ingersoll by the way do you know his spiel on whisky  stick to the subject well finish our arguing right now and ill give you breakfast and well sadly part  merely because i am lighter of spirits than this lugubrious old world no i decline to be dropped ill forgive you and go on with you mind you i am sensitive i will not intrude where i am not welcome only you must give me a sounder reason than my diverting conversational powers for shucking me my logic is even stronger than my hedonistic contempt for hitting the pike  well hang it if you must know hate to say it but id do almost anything to get rid of you fact is ive been sort of touring with a lady and her father and you would be in the way  aaaaaaah you see why my boy i will not only stick but for you i shall do the nimble john alden and win the lady fair i will so bedizen your virile though somewhat crassly practical gifts why women are my long suit they fall for  tut tut tut youre a fool shes no beanery mistress like youre used to she really is a lady  how blind you are cruel friend you do not even see that whatever my vices may be my social standing  ohshutup cant you see im trying to be kind to you have i simply got to beat you up before you begin to suspect you arent welcome your social standing isnt even in the telephone book and your vocabulary you let too many kids slip in among the juicy words have i got to lick  well youre right im a fliv shake hands m boy and no hard feelings  good then i can drive on nice and alone without having to pound your ears off  certainly that iswell compromise you take me on just a few miles into more settled country and ill leave you  so it chanced that milt was still inescapably accompanied by mr pinky parrott that evening when he saw claires gomez standing in the yard at barmberrys and pulled up  pinky had voluntarily promised not to use his eloquence on claire nor to try to borrow money from mr boltwood without ever having quite won permission to stay he had stayed he had also carried out his promise to buy his half of the provisions by adding a fivecent bag of lemon drops to milts bacon and bread  when they had stopped milt warned theres their machine now seems to be kind of a hotel here im going in and say howdy goodby pink glad to have met you but i expect you to be gone when i come out here again if you arent want granite or marble for the headstone i mean it now  i quite understand my lad i admire your chivalric delicacy farewell old compagnon de voyage  milt inquired of mr barmberry whether the boltwoods were within and burst into the parlorlivingroomlibrary as he cried to claire by the fire thought id never catch up with you he was conscious that standing up talking to mr boltwood was an oldyoung man very suave very unfriendly of eye he had an oxfordgray suit unwrinkled cordovan shoes a pert insultingly welltied blue bow tie and a superior narrow pink bald spot as he heard jeff saxton murmur ah mr daggett milt felt the luxury in the roomthe fleecy robe over claires shoulders the silver box of candy by her elbow the smell of expensive cigars and the portly complacence of mr boltwood  have you had any dinner claire was asking when a voice boomed let me introduce myself as westlake parrott  jeff abruptly took charge he faced pinky and demanded i beg pardon  claires eyebrows asked questions of milt  this is a fellow i gave a lift to mineri mean actorwell kind of spiritualistic medium  mr boltwood with the geniality of dinner and cigar soothed jeff uh daggett here has saved our lives two distinct times and given us a great deal of help he is a motor expert he has always refused to let us do anything in return but i noticed there was almost a whole fried chicken left i wonder if he wouldnt share it with uh with his acquaintance here beforebefore they make camp for the night  in civil and vicious tones jeff began very glad to reward any one who has been of service to  he was drowned out by pinkys effusive true hospitality is a virtue as delicate as it is rare we accept your invitation in fact i should be glad to have one of those cigarros elegantos that mine olfactory  milt cut in abruptly pink shut up thanks folks but well go on just wanted to see if you had got in safe see you tomorrow some place  claire was close to milt her fingers on his sleeve please milt father you didnt make your introduction very complete you failed to tell mr daggett that this is mr saxton a friend of ours in brooklyn please milt do stay and have dinner i wont let you go on hungry and i want you to know jeffmr saxton jeff mr daggett is an engineer that is in a way hes going to take an engineering course in the university of washington some day i shall make you bloated copper magnates become interested in him mrs barmberry mrssssssss barrrrrrrmberrrrrry oh oh mrs barmberry wont you please warm up that other chicken for  oh now thats too bad me and jim have et it all up wept the landlady at the door  ill go on stammered milt  jeff looked at him expressionlessly  you will not go on claire was insisting mrs barmberry wont you cook some eggs or steak or something for these boys  perhaps jeff suggested theyd rather make their own dinner by a campfire must be very jolly and that sort of thing  jeff if you dont mind this is my party just for the moment  quite right sorry  milt you sit here by the fire and get warm im not going to be robbed of the egotistic pleasure of being hospitable everybody look happy now  she got them all seatedall but pinky he had long since seated himself by the fire in claires chair and he was smoking a cigar from the box which jeff had brought for mr boltwood  milt sat farthest from the fire by the diningtable he was agonizing this jeff person is the real thing hes no percy in ridingbreeches hes used to society and nastiness if he looks at me once moreyoung garage man found froze stiff near flathead lake scared look in eyes believed to have met a grizzly no signs of vilence and i thought i could learn to mingle with claires own crowd i wish i was out in the bug i wonder if i cant escape     chapter xviii  the fallacy of romance   during dinner milt watched jeff saxtons manner and manners the hot day had turned into a cold night jeff tucked the knitted robe about claires shoulders when she returned to the fire he moved quietly and easily he kept poking up the fire smiling at claire as he did so he seemed without difficulty to maintain two conversations one with mr boltwood about finances one with claire about mysterious persons called fannie and alden and chub and bobbie and dot the mention of whom made milt realize how much a stranger he was once as he passed by claire jeff said gently you are lovely only that and he did not look at her but milt saw that claire flushed and her eyes dimmed  pinky was silent till he had eaten about twothirds of the total amount of fried eggs cold lamb and icebox curios when claire came over to see how they fared pinky removed himself with smirking humility and firmly joined himself to jeff and mr boltwood he caught the subject of finance and while claire dropped down in the chair by milt pinky was lecturing the two men from new york  ah finance queen of the sociological pantheon i dont know how come i am so graced by fortune as to have encountered in these wilds two gentlemen so obviously versed in the stratagems of the great golden game but i will take the opportunity to give you gentlemen some statistics about the golddeposits still existent in the cascades and other ranges that may be of benefit and certainly will be a surprise to you it happens that i have at the present time a mine  claire was whispering to milt if we can get rid of your dreadful passenger i do want you to meet mr saxton he may be of use to you some day hes terribly capable and really quite nice think he happened to be out here and he traced me by telephoneoh he treats longdistance phoning as i do a hairpin he brought down the duckiest presentsdivertissements for dinner and that knitted robe and some real ren√© bleuzet perfumei was all out of it and after the grime of the road  do you really care for things like that all those awfully expensive luxuries begged milt  of course i do especially after small hotels  then you dont really like adventuring  oh yesin its place for one thing it makes a clever dinner seem so good by contrast  well afraid i dont know much about clever dinners milt was sighing when he was aware of jeff saxton looming down on him demanding  daggett would you mind trying to inform your friend that neither mr boltwood nor i care to invest in his goldmine we cant seem to get that into his head i dont mind being annoyed myself but i really feel i must protect mr boltwood  what can i do  my dear sir since you brought him here  it was the potassium cyanide and cracked ice and carpet tacks and tnt and castor oil in jeffs my dear sir that did it milt discovered himself on his feet bawling i am not your dear sir pinky is my guest and gee sorry i lost my temper claire terrible sorry see you along the road good night pink you take your hat git  milt followed pinky out of the door snarling git in the car and do it quick ill take you clear to blewett pass we drive all night  pinky was of great silence and tact milt lumped into the bug beside him but he did not start the allnight drive he wanted to crawl back on his knees to apologize to claireand to be slapped by jeff saxton he compromised by slowly driving a quarter of a mile up the road and camping there for the night  pinky tried to speak words of philosophy and cheerjust once he tried it  for hours by a small fire milt grieved that all his pride was gone in a weak longing to see claire again in the morning he did see herputting off on the lake in a motorboat with jeff and mr barmberry he saw the boat return saw jeff get into the car which had brought him from kalispell saw the farewell the long handclasp the stoop of jeffs head and claires quick step backward before jeff could kiss her but claire waved to jeff long after his car had started                                       when claire and her father came along in the gomez milt was standing by the road she stopped she smiled night of sadness and regrets you were fairly rude milt so was mr saxton but ive lectured him and he sends his apologies  i send him minedeed i do said milt gravely  then everythings all right im sure we were all tired well just forget it  morning daggett mr boltwood put in hope you lose that dreadful redheaded person  no i cant mr boltwood when mr saxton turned on me i swore id take pinky clear through to blewett pass  though not to seattle by golly  foolish oaths should be broken claire platitudinized  clairelook you dont really care so terribly much about these little luxuries food and fixins and sixdollaradayhotel junk do you  yes stoutly i do  but not compared with mountains and  oh its all very well to talk and be so superior about these dear old grandeurs of nature and the heroism of pioneers and i do like a glimpse of them but the niceties of life do mean something and even if it is weak and dependent i shall always simply adore them  all these things are kind of softening and he meant that she was still soft  at least theyre not rude and she meant that he was rude  theyre absolutely trivial they shut off  they shut off rain and snow and dirt and i still fail to see the picturesqueness of dirt goodby  she had driven off without looking back she was heading for seattle and the pacific ocean at forty miles an hourand they had no engagement to meet either in seattle or in the pacific  before milt went on he completed a task on which he had decided the night before while he had meditated on the tailored impertinence of jeff saxtons gray suit the task was to give away the best suit that stolid very black covering which at schoenstrom had seemed suitable either to a dance or to the y p s c e the recipient was mr pinky parrott who gave in return a history of charity and high souls  milt did not listen he was wondering now that they had started where they had started for certainly not for seattle why not stop and see pinkys goldmine maybe he did have one even pinky had to tell the truth sometimes with a good popular goldmine in his possession milt could buy quantities of clothes like jeff saxtons and  and he reflected i can learn as good manners as his in one hour with a dancing lesson thrown in if i didnt id sue the professor     chapter xix  the night of endless pines   on the edge of kootenai canyon feeling more like an aviator than like an automobilist claire had driven and now nearing idaho she had entered a national forest she was delayed for hours while she tried to change a casing after a blowout when the spare tire was deflated she wished for milt she would never see him again she was sorry he hadnt meant  but hang it she panted if he admired her at all hed be here now and get on this perfectly beastly casing over which she had been laboring for a dozen years and she was simply too ridiculously tired and was there any respectful way of keeping henry b from beaming in that benevolent manner while she was killing herself and look at those fingernails andoh drrrrrrat that casing  to make the next town after this delay she had to drive for hours by night through the hulking pines of the national forest it was her first long night drive  a few claims with log cabins of recent settlers once or twice the shack of a forestranger a telephone in a box by the road or a rough r f d box nailed to a pine trunk these indicated that civilization still existed but they were only melancholy blurs she was in a cold enchantment all of her was dead save the ability to keep on driving forever with no hope of the tedium ending she was bewildered she passed six times what seemed to be precisely the same forest clearing always with the road on a tiny ridge to the left of the clearing always with a darknessstilled house at one end and always in the pasture at the other end a horse which neighed she was in a panorama stagescene things moved steadily by her there was a sound of the engine and a sensation of steering but she was forever in the same place among the same pines with the same scowling blackness between their bare clean trunks only the road ahead was clear a oneway track the foothigh earthy bank and the pineroots beside it two distinct ruts and a roughening of strewn brown bark and pineneedles which in the beating light of the cars lamps made the sandy road scabrous with little incessant shadows  she had never known anything save this strained driving on jeff and milt were old tales and untrue was it ten hours before that she had cooked dinner beside the road no matter she wasnt hungry any longer she would never reach the next townand she didnt care it wasnt she but a grim spirit which had entered her dead body that kept steering feeding gas watching the road  in the darkness outside the funnel of light from her lamps were shadows that leaped and gray hands hastily jerked back out of sight behind tree trunks as she came up things that followed her and hidden men waiting for her to stop  as drivers will she tried to exorcise the creeping fear by singing she made up what she called her drivingsong it was intended to echo the hoofs of a fat old horse on a hard road      the old horse trots with a jog jog jog     and a jog jog jog and a jog jog jog     and the old road makes a little jog jog jog     to the west jog jog and the north jog jog     while the farmer drinks some cider from his jug jug jug     from his coy jug jug from his joy jug jug     till he accumulates a little jag jag jag     and he jigs jigs jigs with his jug jug jug  the song was a comfort at firstthen a torment she drove to it and she steered to it and when she tried to forget it sang itself in her tired brain jog jog jogoh damn  her father had had a chill miserable weak as a small boy he had curled up on the bottom of the car his head on the seat and gone to sleep she was alone the mileposts went by slowly the posts said there was a town ahead called pellago but it never came  and when it did come she was too tired to care in a thick dream she drove through midnight streets of the town in stupid paralysis she kicked at the door of the galvanizedironcovered garage no answer she gave it up she drove down the street and into the yard of a hotel marked by a swing sign out over the plank sidewalk she got out the traveling bags awakened her father led him up on the porch  the pellago tavern was a transformed dwelling house the pillars of the porch were aslant and the rainwarped boards snapped beneath her feet she hesitatingly opened the door the hallway was dark and musty a sound like a moan filtered down the unlighted stairs  there seemed to be light in the room on the right trying to assure herself that her father was a protection she pushed open the door she looked into an airless room scattered with rubber boots unsavory old corduroy caps tattered magazines by the stove nodded a wrymouthed squat old woman and a tall cheaply handsome man of forty tobacco juice stained the front of his stiffbosomed collarless shirt his hands were white but huge  the old woman started well  i want to get two rooms for the night please  the man smirked at her the woman creaked well i dont know where d you come from heh  were motoring through  heh whos that man  hes my father madam  neednt to be so hoitytoity about it hes my father madam f that matter that thing there is my husband  the man had been dusting his shabby coat stroking his mustache smiling with sickly gallantry he burbled shut up teenie this lady is all right give her a room number 2 is empty and i guess number 7 has been made up since bill leftif taint the sheets aint been slept on but one night  where d you come  now dont go shooting off a lot of questions at the lady teenie ill show her the rooms  the woman turned on her husband he was perhaps twentyfive years younger a quartercentury less soaked in hideousness her yellow concavesided teeth were bared at him her mouth drew up on one side above the gums pete if i hear one word more out of you out you go lady huh where d you come from young woman  claire was too weak to stagger away she leaned against the door her father struggled to speak but the woman hurled  wherdjuhcomfromised  from new york is there another hotel  nah there aint another hotel oh so you come from new york do you snobs thats what n yorkers are ill show you some rooms theyll be two dollars apiece and breakfast fifty cents extra  the woman led them upstairs claire wanted to flee but oh she couldnt drive any farther she couldnt  the floor of her room was the more bare in contrast to a twofootsquare splash of gritty ingrain carpet in front of the swaybacked bed on the bed was a red comforter that was filthy beyond disguise the yellow earthenware pitcher was cracked the wall mirror was milky claire had been spoiled she had found two excellent hotels since yellowstone park she had forgotten how badly human beings can live she protested  seems to me two dollars is a good deal to charge for this  i didnt say two dollars i said three three each for you and your pa if you dont like it you can drive on to the next town its only sixteen miles  why the extra dollaror extra two dollars  dont you see that carpet these is our best rooms and three dollars i know you new yorkers i heard of a gent once and they charged him five dollarsfive dollarsfor a room in new york and a boy grabbed his valise from him and wanted a shortbit and  ohallright can we get something to eat  now  we havent eaten since noon  that aint my fault some folks can go gadding around in automobuls and some folks has to stay at home if you think im going to sit up all night cooking for people that come chassayin in here god knows what all hours of the day and night theres an allnight lunch down the street  when she was alone claire cried a good deal  her father declined to go out to the lunch room the chill of the late ride was still on him he croaked through his door he was shivering he was going right to bed  yes do dear ill bring you back a sandwich  safe to go out alone  anythings safe after facing that horrible i do believe in witches now listen dear ill bring you a hotwater bag  she took the bag down to the office the landlady was winding the clock while her husband yawned she glared  i wonder if i may have some hot water for my father he has a chill  stoves out no hot water in the house  couldnt you heat some  now look here miss you come in here asking for meals and rooms at midnight and you want a cut rate on everything and i do what i can but enoughs enough  the woman stalked out her husband popped up mustnt mind the old girl lady got a grouch well you cant blame her in a way when bill lit out he done her out of fourbits but ill tell you he leered you leave me the hotwater biznai and ill heat you some water myself  thank you but i wont trouble you good night  claire was surprised to find a warm rather comfortable allnight lunch room called the alaska caf√© with a brighteyed man of twentyfive in charge he nodded in a friendly way and made haste with her order of two hamandegg sandwiches she felt adventurous she polished her knife and fork on a napkin as she had seen people do in lunches along the way a crowd of three rubbed their noses against the front window to stare at the strange girl in town but she ignored them and they drifted away  the lunchman was cordial at a hotel maam which one gee not the tavern  why yes is there another  sure firstrate one two blocks over one up  the woman said the tavern was the only hotel  oh shes an old sourface dont mind her just bawl her out whats she charging you for a room  three dollars  per each gee well she sticks tourists anywheres from one buck to three natives get by for fifty cents shes pretty fierce but she aint a patch on her husband he comes from spokanenobody knows whyguess he was run out he takes some kind of dope and he cheats at rummy  but why does the town stand either of them why do you let them torture innocent people why dont you put them in the insane hospital where they belong  thats a good one her friend chuckled but he saw it only as a joke  she thought of moving her father to the good hotel but she hadnt the strength  claire boltwood of brooklyn heights went through the shanty streets of pellago montana at one am carrying a sandwich in a paper bag which had recently been used for salted peanuts and a red rubber hotwater bag filled with water at the alaska caf√© at the tavern she hastened past the office door she made her father eat his sandwich she teased him and laughed at him till the hotwater bag had relieved his chillpinched back she kissed him boisterously and started for her own room at the far end of the hall  the lights were off she had to feel her way and she hesitated at the door of her room before she entered she imagined voices creeping footsteps people watching her from a distance she flung into the room and when the kindled lamp showed her familiar traveling bag she felt safer but once she was in bed with the sheet down as far as possible over the loathly red comforter the quiet rustled and snapped about her and she could not relax sinking into sleep seemed slipping into danger and a dozen times she started awake  but only slowly did she admit to herself that she actually did hear a fumbling hear the knob of her door turning  wwhos there  its me lady the landlord brought you the hot water  thanks so much but i dont need it now  got something else for you come to the door dont want to holler and wake evbody up  at the door she said timorously nothing else i want thank you ddont bother me  why ive brought you up a sandwich girlie

city fella myselfspokane and cheyenne and everything  in her bare feet claire had run across the room looked desperately out of the window could she climb out reach her friend of the alaska caf√© if she had to  then she grinned the world was rosecolored and hung with tinkling bells i love even that pinky person she said in the yard of the hotel beside her gomez was a teal bug and two men were sleeping in blankets on the ground  she marched over to the door she flung it open the man started back he was holding an electric torch she could not see him but to the hovering ball of light she remarked two men friends of mine are below by their car you will go at once or ill call them if you think i am bluffing go down and look good night     chapter xx  the free woman   before breakfast claire darted down to the hotel yard she beamed at milt who was lacing a rawhide patch on a tire before she remembered that they were not on speaking terms they both looked extremely sheepish and young it was pinky parrott who was the social lubricant pinky was always on speaking terms with everybody ah here she is the little lady of the mutinous eyes our colonel of the flivver hussars  but he got no credit milt straightened up and lumbered hello  she peeped at him and whispered hello  say oh please claire i didnt mean  oh i know letslets go have breakfast  was awfully afraid youd think we were fresh but when we came in last night and saw your cardidnt like the looks of the hotel much and thought wed stick around  im so glad oh miltyes and you mr parrottwill you whiplickbeat uphowever you want to say itsomebody for me  with one glad communal smile milt and pinky curved up their wrists and made motions as of pulling up their sleeves  but not unless i say so i want to be a citizeness fixit ive been good for so long but now  show him to me and up lads and atum responded her squad  not till after breakfast  it was a sufficiently vile breakfast at the tavern the feature was curious cakes whose interior was raw creepy dough a dozen skilled workmen were at the same long table with claire milt pinky and mr boltwoodthe last two of whom were polite and scenically descriptive to each other but portentously silent about goldmines the landlady and a slavey waited on table the landlord could be seen loafing in the kitchen  toward the end of the meal claire insultingly crooked her finger at the landlady and said come here woman  the landlady stared then ignored her  very well then ill say it publicly claire swept the workmen with an affectionate smile gentlemen of pellago i want you to know from one of the poor tourists who have been cheated at this nasty place that we depend on you to do something this woman and her husband are criminals in the way they overcharge for hideous food and  the landlady had been petrified now she charged down behind her came her husband milt arose the husband stopped but it was pinky who faced the landlady tapped her shoulder and launched into and whats more you hag if our new friends here have any sense theyll run you out of town  that was only the beginning of pinkys paper on corrections and charities he enjoyed himself before he finished the landlady was crying  she voluntarily promised to give her boarders waffles some morning jus soon as she could find the waffleiron  with her guard about her at the office desk claire paid one dollar apiece for the rooms and discussion was not  before they started milt had the chance to say to her im getting so i can handle pinky now have to thinking of getting hold of his goldmine i just give him the eye as your friend mr saxton would and he gets so meek  but dont please understand me milt i do admire mr saxton he is fine and capable and really generous only he may be just a bit snippish at times while youyoure a playmatefathers and mineand i did face that landlady didnt i im not soft and trivial am i praise                                       she had driven through the panhandle of idaho into washington through spokane through the writhing lava deposits of moses coulee where fruit trees grow on volcanic ash beyond wenatchee with its rows of apple trees striping the climbing fields like corduroy in folds she had come to the famous climb of blewett pass once over that pass and snoqualmie she would romp into seattle  she was sorry that she hadnt come to know milt better but perhaps she would see him in seattle  not adventure alone was she finding but high intellectual benefit in studying the names of towns in the state of washington not kankakee nor kalamazoo nor oshkosh can rival the picturesque fancy of washington and claire combined the townnames in a lyric so emotionstirring that it ought perhaps to be the national anthem it ran

playing mental whist she was trying to keep from worry all the way she had heard of blewett pass its fourteen miles of climbing and the last half mile of stern pitch on this eastern side of the pass the new road was not open there was a tortuous flintscattered trail too narrow in most places for the passing of other cars claire was glad that milt and pinky were near her  if so many of the race of kind advisers of tourists had not warned her about it doubtless she would have gone over the pass without difficulty but their voluntary croaking sapped her nerve and her fathers he kept worrying do you think we better try it when they stopped at a ranch house at the foot of the climb for the night he seemed unusually tired he complained of chill he did not eat breakfast they started out silent depressed  he crouched in the corner of the seat she looked at him and was anxious she stopped on the first level space on the pass crying you are perfectly miserable im afraid of i think we ought to see a doctor  oh ill be all right  but she waited till milt came pitpattering up the slope father feels rather sick what shall i do turn round and drive to the nearest doctorat cashmere i suppose  theres a magnolious medico ahead here on the pass pinky parrott interrupted a young thing but they say hes a graduate of harvard hes out here because he has some timberclaims look milt o the daggett why dont you drive miss boltwoods busmake better time and hustle the old gent up to the doc and ill come on behind with your machine  why claire fretted i hate  a new milt the boss abrupt almost bullying snapped out of his bug good idee jump in claire ill take your father up heh whasat pink yes i get it second turn beyond grocery right on we go huh oh well think about the goldmine later pink  with the three of them wedged into the seat of the gomez and pinky recklessly skittering after them in the bug they climbed againand lo there was no climb unconsciously claire had hesitated before dashing at each sharp upsloping bend had lost headway while she was wondering suppose the car went off this curve milt never sped up but he never slackened his driving was as rhythmical as music  they were so packed in that he could scarcely reach gear lever and handbrake he halted on a level and curtly asked that trapdoor in the back of the carconvertible extra seat  yes but we almost never use it and its stuck cant get it open  ill open it all right got a big screwdriver want you sit back there need elbow room  perhaps id better drive with mr pinky  nope dont think better  with one yank he opened the trapdoor revealing a folding seat which she meekly took back there she reflected how strong his back looks funny how the little silvery hairs grow at the back of his neck  they came to a settlement and the red cedar bungalow of dr hooker beach the moment claire saw the doctors thin demanding face she trusted him he spoke to mr boltwood with assurance all you need is some rest and your digestion is a little shaky been eating some pork might stay here a day or two were glad to have a glimpse of easterners  mr boltwood went to bed in the beaches guestroom mrs beach gave claire and milt lunch with thin toast and thin china on a porch from which an arroyo dropped down for a hundred feet fir trees scented the air and a talking machine played the same russian music that was popular that same moment in new york and the beaches knew people who knew claire  claire was thinking these people were genuine aristocrats while jeff saxton for all his family and his assumptions about life was the eternal climber milt who had been uncomfortable with jeff was serene and unselfconscious with the beaches and the doctor gratefully took his advice about his stationary gas engine hes rather like the beaches in his simplicityyes and his ability to do anything if he considers it worth while she decided  after lunch when the doctor and his wife had to trot off to a patient claire proposed lets walk up to that ledge of rock and see the view shall we milt  yes and keep an eye on the road for pinky the poor nut he hasnt showed up so reckless hope he hasnt driven the teal off the road  she crouched at the edge of a rock where she would have been frightened a month before and looked across the main road to a creek in a pinelaced gully he sat beside her elbows on knees  those beachestheir kin are judges and senators and college presidents all over new england she said this doctor must be the grandson of the ambassador i fancy  honest i thought they were just regular folks was i nice  of course you were  did idid i wash my paws and sit up and beg  no you arent a little dog im that youre the big mastiff that guards the house while i run and yip she was turned toward him smiling her hand was beside him he touched the back of it with his forefinger as though he was afraid he might soil it  there seemed to be no reason but he was trembling as he stammered iiim ddarn glad i didnt know they were anybody or d have been as bad as a flivver driver the first time he tries a ttwelvecylinder machine ggee your hand is little  she took it back and inspected it i suppose it is and pretty useless  nno it isnt but your shoes are why dont you wear boots when youre out like this a flicker of his earlier peremptoriness came into his voice she resented it  my shoes are perfectly sensible i will not wear those horrible vegetarian uplift sacks on my feet  your shoes may be all right for new york but youre not going to new york for a while youve simply got to see some of this country while youre out herebritish columbia and alaska  would be nice but ive had enough roughing  chance to see the grandest mountains in the world almost and then you want to go back to tea and all that junk  stop trying to bully me you have been dictatorial ever since we started up  have i didnt mean to be though i suppose i usually am bullying at least i run things theres two kinds of people those that give orders and those that naturally take them and i belong to the first one and  but my dear milt so do i and really  and mostly id take them from you but hang it seattle is just a day away and youll forget me wish i could kidnap you have half a mind to take you way up into the mountains and when you got used to roughing it in sureenough wildernesssay youd helped me haul timber for a flumethen wed be real pals you have the stuff in you but you still need toughening before  listen to me milton you have been reading fiction about this mansometimes hes a lumberjack and sometimes a trapper or a miner but always hes frightfully hairyand he sees a charming woman in the city and kidnaps her and shuts her up in some unspeakable shanty and makes her eat nice cold boiled potatoes and so naturally she simply adores him a hundred men have written that story and its an example of their insane masculine conceit which i as a woman resent shakespeare may have started it with his silly taming of the shrew shakespeares men may have been real but his women were dolls designed to please some majesty you may not know it but there are women today who dont live just to please majesties fancies if a woman like me were kidnapped she would go on hating the brute or if she did give in then the man would lose anyway because she would have degenerated shed have turned into a slave and lost exactly the things hed liked in her oh you cavemen with your belief that you can force women to like you i have more courage than any of you  i admit you have courage but youd have still more if you bucked the wilds  nonsense in new york i face every day a hundred complicated problems you dont know i ever heard of  let me remind you that brer julius c√¶sar said hed rather be mayor in a little spanish town than police commissioner in rome im king in schoenstrom while youre just one of a couple hundred thousand bright people in new york  really oh at least a million thanks  ohgeeclaire i didnt mean to be personal and get in a row and all butcant you seekind of desperateseattle so soon  her face was turned from him its thin profile was firm as silver wire he blundered off into silence andthey were at it again  i didnt mean to make you angry he gulped  well you did bullying you and your men of granite in mackinaws and a muchneeded shave trying to make a wellbred woman satisfied with a view consisting of rocks and stumps and socks on the line let me tell you that compared with a street canyon a mountain canyon is simply dead and yet these unlettered wild men  see here i dont know if youre firing these adjectives at me but i dont know that im so much more unlettered you talked about taking french in your finishingschool well they taught american in mine  they would  then he was angry yes and chemistry and physics and greek and latin and history and mathematics and economics and i took more or less of a whirl at all of them while you were fiddling with ribbons and then i had to buck mechanics and business methods  i also fiddled with mannersan unfortunate omission in your curriculum i take it you have been reasonably rude  so have you  i had to be but i trust you begin to see that even your strong hand couldnt control a womans taste kidnapping as intelligent a boy as you wanting to imitate these boorish movie  not a darn bit more boorish than your smart set with its champagne and these orgies at country clubs  you know so much about country clubs dont you the worst orgy i ever saw at one was the golf champion reading the beauty department in boudoir would you mind backing up your statements about the vices of myself and my friends  oh you oh i didnt mean  then why did you  now youre bullying me and you know that if the smart set isnt vicious at least its so snobbish that it cant see any  then its wise to be snobbish because if it did condescend  i wont stand people talking about condescending  would you mind not shouting so  very well ill keep still  silence again while both of them looked unhappy and tried to remember just what they had been fighting about they did not at first notice a small red car larruping gaily over the road beneath the ledge though the driver was a pinkhaired man in a green coat he was almost gone before milt choked its pinky  pink pinky he bellowed  pinky looked back but instead of stopping he sped up and kept going     chapter xxi  the mine of lost souls   that couldnt have been pinky why why the car he had was red cried claire  sure the idiots got hold of some barn paint somewhere and tried to daub it over hes trying to make a getaway with it  well chase him in my car  dont you mind  of course not i do not give up my objections to the roughing philosophy but you were right about these shoes oh dont leave me behind want to go along  these sentences she broke scattered and totally lost as she scrambled after him down the rocks he halted his lips trembled he picked her up carried her down hesitated a second while his facecuriously foreshortened as she looked up at it from his big armstwisted with emotion he set her down gently and she climbed into the gomez  it seemed to her that he drove rather too carefully too slowly he took curves and corners evenly his face was as empty of expression as unmelodramatic as that of a jitney driver then she looked at the speedometer he was making fortyeight miles an hour down hill and forty to thirty on upgrades  they were in sight of the fleeing pinky in two miles pinky looked back instantly was to be seen pulling his hat low stooping overthe demon driver milt merely sat more erect looked more bland and whitebrowed and steady  the bug fled before them on a winding shelf road it popped up a curve then slowed down he took it too fast poor pink said milt  they gained on that upslope but as the road dropped the bug started forward desperately another car was headed toward them was drawn to the side of the road in one of the occasional widenings pinky passed it so carelessly that with crawling spine claire saw the outer wheels of the bug on the very edge of the roadthe edge of a fiftyfoot drop milt went easily past the halted careven waved his hand to the waiting driver  this did not seem to claire at all like the chase of a thief she looked casually ahead at pinky as he whirled round an sshaped curve on the downslope then it was too quick to see what happened the bug headed directly toward the edge of the road shot out went down the embankment over and over it lay absurdly upsidedown its muffler and brakerods showing in place of the seat and hood  milt quite carefully stopped the gomez the day was stilljust a breathing of running water in the deep gully the topsyturvy car below them was equally still no sight of pinky no sound  the gauche boy gone from him milt took her hand pressed it to his cheek claire youre here you might have gone with him to make room oh i was bullying you because i was bullying myself trying to make myself tell youbut oh you know you know can you stand going down there i hate to have you but you may be needed  yes ill come she whispered  their crawl down the rockrolling embankment seemed desperately slow  wait here bade milt at the bottom  she looked away from the grotesque car she had seen that one side of it was crumpled like paper in an impatient hand  milt was stooping looking under seemed to be saying something when he came back he did not speak he wiped his forehead come well climb back up nothing to do now guess you better not try to help anyway you might not sleep well  he gave her his hand up the embankment drove to the nearest house telephoned to dr beach later she waited while milt and the doctor with two other men were raising the car as she waited she thought of the teal bug as a human thingas her old friend to which she had often turned in need  milt returned to her there is one thing for you to do before he died pinky asked me to go get his wifedolores i think it is shes up in a side canyon few miles away she may want a woman around beach will take care ofof him can you come  of course oh milt i didnt  i didnt  mean you were a caveman youre my big brother  mean you were a snob  they drove five miles along the highway then up a trail where the gomez brushed the undergrowth on each side as it desperately dug into moss raingutted ruts loose rocks all on a vicious slant which seemed to push the car down again beside them the mountain woods were sacredly quiet with fern and lily and greenlit spaces they came out in a clearing before dusk beside the clearing was a brook with a crude cradlesign of a not very successful gold miner before a log cabin in a swaysided rocker creaked a tall white flabby woman once nearly beautiful now rubbed at the edges she rose huddling her wrapper about her bosom as they drove into the clearing and picked their way through stumps and briars  where you folks think youre going she whimpered  why why just  i cernly am glad to see somebody i been most scared to death been here alone two weeks now got a shotgun but if anybody come i guess theyd take it away from me i was brought up nice no roughhouse or say did you folks come to see the goldmine  mmine babbled milt  course not pinky said i was to show it but im so sore on that lowlife hound now i swear i wont even take the trouble and lie about it no more gold in that crick than there is in my eye or than theres flour or pork in the house  the womans voice was rising her gestures were furious claire and milt stood close their hands slipping together  what d you think of a man thatd go off and leave a lady without half enough to eat while he gallivanted around trying to raise money by gambling when he was offered a good job up here hes a gamblertold me he was a rich mineowner but never touched a mine in his life lying houndworst talker in ten counties got a gamblers hand on him tooi ought to seen it oh wait till i get hold of him just wait  claire thought of the still handso stillthat she had seen under the edge of the upturned car she tried to speak while the woman raved on wrath feeding wrath  thank god i aint really his wife my husband is a fine manmr klohdlorus kloh my name is mr klohs got a fine job with the mill at north yakima oh i was a fool this gambler pinky parrott he comes along with his elegant ways and he hands me out a swell line of gab and i ups and leaves poor kloh and the kid and the nicest kid say please could you folks take me wherever youre going maybe i could get a job againused to was a good waitress and i aint going to wait here any longer for that lying cheating meantalking  oh mrs kloh please dont hes dead wailed claire  dead pinky ohmygod and i wont ever see him and he was so funny and  she threw herself on the ground she kicked her heels she tore at her loosely caught tarnished blonde hair  claire knelt by her you mustntyou mustntwell  damn you with your smugfaced husband there and your fine auto and all butting into poor folks troubles shrieked dlorus  claire stumbled to her feet stood with her clenched right hand to her trembling lips cupping it with her nervous left hand her shoulders were dejected milt pleaded lets hike out i dont mind decent honest grease but this placelook in at table dirty dishes and gin bottles on the floor  desert her when she needs me so claire started forward but milt caught her sleeve and admired you were right youve got more nerve than i have  no i wouldnt dare if im glad youre here with me  claire calmed the woman bound up her hair washed her facewhich needed it and sat on the log doorstep holding dloruss head in her lap while dlorus sobbed pinkydead him that was so lively and he was so sweet a lover oh so sweet he was a swell fellow my he could just make you laugh and cry the way he talked and he was so educated and he played the vilinhe could do anythingand athaletiche would have made me rich oh let me alone i just want to be alone and think of him i was so bored with kloh and no nice dresses or nothin andi did love the kid but he squalled so just all the time and pinky come and he was so funny oh let me alone  claire shivered then and the strength seemed to go from the steady arms that had supported dloruss head dusk had sneaked up on them the clearing was full of swimming grayness and between the womans screams the woods crackled each time dlorus spoke her screech was like that of an animal in the woods and round about them crept such sinister echoes that milt kept wanting to look back over his shoulder  yes sighed claire at last perhaps wed better go  if you go ill kill myself take me to mr kloh oh he was my husband mr kloh oh so good only he didnt understand a lady has to have her good times and pink danced so well  dlorus sprang up flung into the cabin stood in the dimness of the doorway holding a butcher knife and clamoring i will ill kill myself if you leave me take me down to mr kloh at north yakima tonight  milt sauntered toward her  dont you get flip young man i mean it and ill kill you  most unchivalrously quite out of the picture of gray grief milt snapped thatll be about enough of you here gimme that knife  she dropped the knife sniveling oh gawd somebodys always bullying me and all i wanted was a good time  claire herded her into the cabin well take you to your husbandtonight come lets wash up and ill help you put on your prettiest dress  honest will you cried the woman in high spirits all grief put aside i got a dandy china silk dress and some new white kid shoes my mr kloh he wont hardly know me hell take me back i know how to handle him thatll be swell going back in an automobile and i got a new haircomb with genuine peruvian diamonds say you arent kidding me along  in the light of the lantern milt had kindled claire looked questioningly at him both of them shrugged claire promised yes tonight if we can make it  and will you jolly mr kloh for me gee ill be awfully scared of him i swear ill wash his dishes and everything hes a good man he say he aint seen my new parasol neither     chapter xxii  across the roof of the world   claire dressed dlorus cooked a dinner of beet greens potatoes and trout and by bullying and great sweetness kept dlorus from too many trips to the gin bottle milt caught the trout cut wood locked in a log shed pinkys forlorn miningtools they started for north yakima at eight of the evening with dlorus back in the spare seat alternately sobbing and to inattentive ears announcing what shed say to the old hens  milt was devoted to persuading the huge cat of a car to tiptoe down the slippery gouged ruts of the road and claires mind was driving with him every time he touched the footbrake she could feel the strain in the tendons of her own ankle  a mile down the main road they stopped at a storepostoffice to telephone back to mr boltwood and dr beach on the porch was a man in overalls and laced boots he was lean and quickmoving as he raised his head and his spectacles flashed claire caught milts arm and gasped oh my dear im in a beautiful state of nerves for a moment i thought that was jeff saxton i bet it is his astral body  and you thought he was going to forbid your running away on this fool expedition and you were scared chuckled milt as they sat in the car  of course i was and i still am i know what hell say afterward he is here reasoning with me oughtnt i to be sensible oughtnt i to have you leave me at the beaches before you startjolly jaunt to take a strange woman to her presumably homicidal husband why am i totally lacking in sense just listen to what jeff is saying  of course you ought to go back and let me drive alone absolutely insane your  but you would like me to go along wouldnt you  like you to its our last ride together and that bloomin old browning never thought of a ride together by midnight over the roof of the world no its really our first ride together and tomorrowyoure gone  no i shant be gone but addressing herself to the astounded overalled man on the porch she declared youre quite right jeff and milt is wrong insane adventure only its wonderful to be young enough to do insane adventures falling down abyssy places is so much more interesting than bridge im goinggoinggoing milt you telephone  dont you think you better  no siree father would forbid me try not to get himjust tell dr beach where were going and hang up and scoot  all night they drove down the pacific side of blewett pass down the sweeping spirals to a valley dlorus drowsed in the extra seat claires sleepy head was fantastically swaying she was awakened by an approaching roar and as though she sat at a play she watched a big racing machine coming toward them passing them with two wheels in the ditch she had only a thunderous glimpse of the stolid driver a dark hooded romantic figure like a sailor at the helm in a storm  milt cried golly may be a transcontinental racer be in new york in five daysgoing night and daytake mud at fifty an hourcrack mechanic right from the factorychange tires in three minutespeople waiting up all night to give him gasoline and a sandwich thats my idea of fun  studying milts shadowed face claire considered he could do it too sitting there at the wheel taking danger and good road with the same steadiness oh heswell anyway hes a dear boy  but what she said was  less dramatic things for you now milt trigonometry is going to be your idea of fun blueprints and engineering books  yes i know im going to do it do four years work in threeor two ill tack pages of formulas on the wall in my bum hallroom and study em while im shaving oh ill be the grind but learn to dance the foxtrot though if america gets into the war ill get into the engineering corps and come back to school afterward  will the finances  ill sell my garage by mail rauskukle will take it he wont rob me of more than a thousand dollars on pricenot much more  youre going to love seattle and well have some good tramps while im there you and i  honestly will you want to  do you suppose for one second id give up my feeling of free air if you dont come and get me ill call on you and make you come  warn you ill probably be living over some beanery  probably with dirty steps leading up to it ill sweep the steps ill cook supper for you i can do things cant i i did manage dlorus didnt i  he was murmuring claire dear when she changed her tone to the echo of brooklyn heights and hurried on you do understand dont you well be uh good friends  yes he drove with much speed and silence  though they were devouring the dark road though roadside rocks caught by the headlights seemed to fly up at them though they went on forever chased by a nightmare claire snuggled down in security her head drooped against his shoulder he put his arm about her his hand about her waist she sleepily wondered if she ought to let him she heard herself muttering sorry i was so rude when you were so rude and her chilly cheek discovered that the smoothworn shoulder of his old blue coat was warm and she wondered some more about the questions of waists and hands and she was asleep  she awoke bewildered to find that dawn was slipping into the air while she had slept milt had taken his arm from about her and fished out a laprobe for her behind them dlorus was slumbering with her soft mouth wide open claire felt the luxury of the pocket of warmth under the laprobe she comfortably stretched her legs while she pictured milt driving on all the night rigid tireless impersonal as the engineer of a night express  they came into north yakima at breakfast time and found the house of mr kloh a neat bare drab frame box with tight small front and back yards dlorus was awake and when she wasnt yawning she was enjoying being hysterical  miss boltwood she whined you go in and jolly him up  milt begged better let me do it claire  they looked squarely at each other no i think id better she decided  right claire buti wish i could do more things for you  i know  he lifted her stiff cold little body from the car his hands under her arms he held her on the runningboard an instant her eyes level with his little sisterplucky little sister he sighed he lowered her to the ground  claire knocked at the back door to it came a bald tired man in an apron wet at the knees the kitchen floor was soaped and a scrubbingbrush rode amid the seas a rather dirty child clung to his hand trying to clean up maam not very good at it i hope you aint the cruelty to children lady willy looks mussed but fact is i just cant get time to wash the clothes but he means a terrible lot to me what was it will you step in  claire buttoned the childs rompers before she spoke then  mr kloh i want to be perfectly honest with you ive had word from your wife shes unhappy and she loves and admires you more than any other man in the world and i think she would come backmisses the child so  the man wiped his reddened hands i dont know i dont wish her no harm trouble was im kind of pokey i guess i couldnt give her any good times i used to try to go to dances with her but when id worked late id get sleepy and shes a beautiful woman smart s a whip and i guess i was too slow for her no she wouldnt never come back to me  shes out in front of the house nowwaiting  great c√¶sars ghost and the floor not scrubbed with a squawk of anxiety he leaped on the scrubbingbrush and when milt and dlorus appeared at the door mr kloh and miss claire boltwood were wiping up the kitchen floor  dlorus looked at them arms akimbo and sighed hello johnny my aint it nice to be back oh you had the sink painted oh forgive me johnny i was a bad ungrateful woman i dont care if you dont never take me to no more dances hardly any willy come here dear oh he is such a sweet child my his mouth is so dirty will you forgive me johnny is my overcoat in the mothballs  when mr kloh had gone off to the millthrice returning from the gate to kiss dlorus and to thank her rescuersclaire sat down and yawningly lashed off every inch of dloruss fair white skin  youre at it already taking advantage of that good mans forgiveness and getting lofty with him and rather admiring yourself as a spectacular sinner you are a lazy ignorant not very clean woman and if you succeed in making mr kloh and willy happy it will be almost too big a job for you now if i come back from seattle and find you misbehaving again  dlorus broke down you wont miss and i will raise chickens like he wanted honest i will  then you may let me have a room to take a nap in and perhaps mr daggett could sleep in there on the sofa and well get rested before we start back  both milt and dlorus meekly followed the boss  it was noon before milt and claire woke and discovered that dlorus had prepared for them scrambled eggs and store celery served on an almost clean tablecloth mr kloh came home for lunch and while dlorus sat on his lap in the livingroom and repeated that she had been a bad naughty ittle dirlwhat did the fellows say at the mill milt and claire sat dumpily on the back porch regarding scenery which featured of seven tin cans a broken patent washingmachine and a rheumatic pear tree  i suppose we ought to start groaned claire  i have about as much nerve as a rabbit and as much punch as a bale of hay milt admitted  were like two children that have been playing too long  but dont want to go home  quite though i dont think much of your idea of a playhousethose tin cans but its better than having to be grownup  in the midst of which chatter they realized that mr henry b boltwood and dr hooker beach had come round the corner of the house and were gaping at them     chapter xxiii  the grael in a back yard in yakima   i must say that you two have chosen a fine pastoral scene observed mr boltwood  hhhhhhhhow did you get here gasped claire  auto bus over blewett pass train here from ellensburg that womaneverything all right  yes everythings fine we were just starting back sir implored milt  huh  awfully sorry sir to take claire on such a hike  i dont blame you particularly when that young woman gets an idea into her head the rest of us are pawns why even meshes dragged me all over the rocky mountains and i will admit claire that its been good for me but i begin to feel human again and i think its about time i took charge well catch the afternoon train for seattle claire the trip has been extremely interesting but i think perhaps well call it enough daggett want to get you to drive the gomez on to seattle beach tells me your car is completely wrecked lose any money in it  no sir had my roll in the bug ill have to go back to it and get some clothes out of it though  well then will you drive my car in charge me anywhere up to fifty dollars if you want to  id rather not  its a perfectly honest jobid do it too quick or if your confounded pride wont let you charge anything bring the car on anyway come dolly i have a jitney here please observe my graceful use of jitney and i have the bags well hustle to the station now no no arguments chick  on the station platform claire and milt were under the surveillance of mr boltwood who was extremely irritable as every two minutes the train was reported to be two minutes later they tramped up and down speaking in lowered voices very meek but in their joint naughtiness very intimate  that was a nice place to end a transcontinental drivein the back yard of mr johnny kloh with an unrestricted view of tin cans lamented claire  still your drive didnt end at klohs it ended way up in the mountains  mr boltwood bumbled down on them another minute late like to know what the matter is  yes father  when mr boltwoods impatiently waiting back was turned claire gripped milts hand and whispered to him you see im captured i thought i was fathers lord and chauffeur but he sniffs the smoke of the ticker in his mind hes already back in the office running things hell probably turn me over to jeff for disciplining you wont let them change me back into a pinkface will you come to tea at the gilsons just as soon as you reach seattle  tea now were so near your gilsons i begin to get scared wouldnt know what to do gee ive heard you have to balance a teacup and a sandwich and a hunk o cake and a lot of conversation all at once id spill the tea and drop crumbs and probably have the butler set on me  you will not and if you didcant you seeit wouldnt matter it just wouldnt matter  honestly claire dear do you know why i came on this trip in schoenstrom i heard you say you were going to seattle that moment i decided i would too and get acquainted with you if murder would do it but oh im clumsy  youve seen me clumsy in driving you taught me to get over it perhaps i can teach you some things and well studytogetherevenings im a thoroughly ignorant parasite woman make me become real a real woman  deardear  mr boltwood loomed on them the trains coming at last well have a decent sleep for once at the gilsons ive wired them to meet us he departed  terribly glad your father keeps coming down on us because it scares me so i get desperate said milt golly i think i can hear the train i uh claire claire dear  milt are you proposing to me please hurry because that is the train isnt it absurdsome day youll have to propose all over again formally for the benefit of people like father when you and i already know were partners weve done things together not just danced together when youre an engineer youll call me and ill come arunning up to alaska and sometimes youll come with me to brooklynwell be a couple of bombs theres the train oh playmate hurry with your engineering course hurry hurry hurry because when

private lesson in balancing teacups yes father i have the tickets so glad dear the trip smashed up like thisshocked me into realitymade me realize ive been with you every hour since i dismissed you back in dakota and you looked at me big hurt eyes like a child and yes father pullmans at the back yes im coming  wwait ddid you know i was going to propose  yes ever since the yellowstone been trying to think of a nice way to refuse you but there isnt any youre like pinkycant get rid of youhave t adopt you besides ive found out  you love me  i dont know how can i tell but i do like to drive with my head on your shoulder and yesssss father coming     chapter xxiv  her own people   mr henry b boltwood was decorously asleep in a chair in the observation car and claire on the wide back platform sat unmoving apparently devoted to agriculture and mountain scenery but it might have been noted that her hand clenched one of the wooden supports of her campstool and that her hunched back did not move  when she had turned to follow her father into the train milt had caught her shoulders and kissed her  for half an hour that kiss had remained a perceptible warm pressure on her lips and for half an hour she had felt the relief of gliding through the mountains without the strain of piloting the comfort of having the unseen mysterious engineer up ahead automatically drive for her she had caroled to her father about nearing the pacific her nervousness had expressed itself in jerky gaiety  but when he had sneaked away for a nap and claire could no longer hide from herself by a veil of chatter the big decision she had made on the station platform then she was lonely and frightenedand very anxious to undecide the decision she could not think clearly she could see milt daggett only as a solemn young man in an inferior sweater standing by the track in a melancholy autumnal light waving to her as the train pulled out disappearing in a dun obscurity less significant than the station the receding ties or the porter who was in places known only to his secretive self concealing her baggage  she could only mutter in growing panic im crazy insane pledging myself to this boy before i know how he will turn out will he learn anything besides engineering i know iti do want to stroke his cheek andhis kiss frightened me but will i hate him when i see him with nice people can i introduce him to the gilsons oh i was mad so wrought up by that idiotic chase with dlorus and so sure i was a romantic heroine and and im simply an indecisive girl in a realistic muddle  threatened by darkness and the sinister evening chill of the mountains with the train no longer cheerfully climbing the rocky ridge but rumbling and snorting in the defiles and startling her with agitating forward leaps as though the brakes had let go she could not endure the bleak platform and even less could she endure sitting in the chair car eyed by the smug touristspeople as empty of her romance as they were incapable of her sharp tragedy she balanced forward to the vestibule she stood in that cold swaying darkling place that was filled with the smell of rubber and metal and grease and the thunderous clash of steel on steel she tried to look out into the fleeing darkness she tried to imagine that the train was carrying her away from the pursuing enemyfrom her own weak self  her father came puffing and lippursing and jolly to take her to dinner mr boltwood had no tearing meditations he had a healthy interest in soup but he glanced at her across the bright sleek diningtable he seemed to study her and suddenly claire saw that he was a very wise man his look hinted youre worried my dear but his voice ventured nothing beyond comfortable drawling stories to which she had only from the depth of her gloomy brooding to nod mechanically  she got a great deal of satisfaction and horror out of watching two travelingmen after dinner milt had praised the race and one of the two travelingmen a slender clearfaced youngster was rather like milt despite plastered hair a watchchain slung diagonally across his waistcoat maroon silk socks and shoes of pearl buttons gray tops and patentleather bottoms the other man was a butterball both of them had harshly pompous voicesthe proudly unlettered voices of the smoking compartment the slender man was roaring  yes sir hes got a great proposition therebelieve me hes got a great propositionhes got one great little factory there take it from me he can turn out toothpicks to compete with michigan hes simply piling up the shekelswhy say hes got a house with eighteen roomsevery room done different  claire wondered whether milt when the sting and faith of romance were blunted would engage in great propositions and fight for the recognition of histoothpicks would his creations be favorites in the best lunch rooms would he pile up shekels  then her fretting was lost in the excitement of approaching seattle and their hostclaires cousin eugene gilson an outrageously prosperous owner of shinglemills he came from an old brooklyn heights family he had married eva gontz of englewood he liked music and wrote jokey little letters and knew the addresses of all the best new york shops he was of her own people and she was near now to the security of his friendship the long journey done  lights thicker and thickera factory illuminated by arclampsthe baggagethe porterthe eager trail of people in the aisleclimbing down to the platformred capspassing the puffing engine which had brought them inthe procession to the gatefaces behind a grilleugene gilson and eva wavingkisses cries of how was the trip and oh had wonderful drivethe huge station and curious waiting passengers jap coolies in a gang lumbermen in corksthe gilsons quiet car and baggage stowed away by the chauffeur instead of by their own tired handsstreets strangely silent after the tumult of the trainseattle and the sunset coast at last attained  claire had forgotten how many charming most desirable things there were in the world the gilsons drove up queen anne hill to a bayfronting house on a breezy knoba georgian house of holly hedge french windows a terrace that suggested tea and a great hall of mahogany and white enamel with the hint of roses somewhere and a fire kindled in the paneled drawingroom to be seen beyond the hall warmth and softness and the gilsons confident affection wrapped her around and in contented weariness she mounted to a bedroom of bakst sketches a fourposter and a bedside table with a black and orange electric lamp and a collection of arthur symons essays  she sank by the bed pitifully rubbed her cheek against the silk comforter that was primly awaiting her commands at the foot of the bed and cried oh fourposters are necessary i cant give them up i wont they no one has a right to ask me she mentally stamped her foot i simply wont live in a shack and take in washing it isnt worth it  a bath faintly scented in a builtin tub in her own marble bathroom a preposterously and delightfully enormous turkish towel one of eva gilsons foamy neglig√©es slow exquisite dressingnot the scratchy hopping over ingrown dirt among ingrown smells of a filthy smallhotel bedroom but luxurious wandering over rugs velvety to her bare feet a languid inspection of the frivolous colors and curves in the drawings by bakst and george plank and helen dryden a glance at the richness of the toilettable at the velvet curtains that shut out the common world  expanding to the comfort as an orchid to cloying tropic airs she drew on her sheerest chemise her most frivolous silk stockings in a dreaming enervated joy she saw how smooth were her arms and legs she sleepily resented the redness of her wrists and the callouses of the texture of corduroy that scored her palms from holding the steering wheel  yes she was glad that she had made the experimentbut gladder that she was safely in from the long dustwhitened way back in her own world of beauty and she couldnt imagine ever trying it again to think of clumping out into that world of deliberate and brawling crudeness  of one milt daggett she didnt think at all  gorgeously sleepyand gorgeously certain that by and by she would go not to a stingy hotel bed with hounddog ribs to cut into her tired back but to a feathery softness of slumbershe wavered down to the drawingroom and on the davenport by the fire with victoria chocolates by her elbow and pillows behind her shoulders she gossiped of her adventure and asked for news of friends and kin back east  eugene and eva gilson asked with pyrotechnic merriness about the funny people she must have met along the road with a subdued hidden unhappiness claire found that she could not mention miltthat she was afraid her father would mention miltto these people who took it for granted that all persons who did not live in large houses and play good games of bridge were either queer or common who believed that their west was desirable in proportion as it became like the east and that they though westerners were as superior to workmen with hard hands as was brooklyn heights itself  claire tried to wriggle out from under the thought of milt while with the gilsons as the perfect audience she improvised on the theme of wandering with certain unintended exaggerations and certain not quite accurate groupings of events she described the farmers and cowpunchers the incredible hotels and garages indeed they had become incredible to her own self obviously this silken girl couldnt possibly take seriously a dlorus klohor a young garage man who said aint  eva gilson had been in brooklyn within the month and in a passion of remembrance of home claire cried oh do tell me about everybody  i had such a good time with amy dorrance said mrs gilson of course amy is a little dull but shes such an awfully good sort and we did have the jolliest party one afternoon we went to lunch at the ritz and a matin√©e and we saw such an interesting mangene is frightfully jealous when i rave about himim sure he was a violinistsimply an exquisite thing he wasi wanted to kiss him gene will now say why didnt you  and gene said well why didnt you and claire laughed and her toes felt warm and pink and good and she was perfectly happy and she murmured it would be good to hear a decent violinist again oh what had george worlicht been doing when you were home  dont you think georgie is wonderful fluttered mrs gilson he makes me rue my thirtysix sad years i think ill adopt him you know he almost won the tennis cup at long branch  georgie had a little mustache and an income just enough income to support the little mustache and he sang inoffensively and was always winning tennis cupsalmostand he always said at least once at every party the basis of savoir faire is knowing how to be rude to the right people fireenamored and gliding into a perfumed haze of exquisite drowsiness claire saw georgie as heroic and wise but the firelight got into her eyes and her lids wouldnt stay open and in her ears was a soft humming as of a million bees in a distant meadow goldenspangledand gene was helping her upstairs sleepiness submerged her like bathing in sweet waters she fumbled at buttons and hooks and stays let things lie where they felland of all that luxury nothing was more pleasant than the knowledge that she did not have to take precautions against the rats mice cockroaches and all their obscene little brothers whichon some faroff fantastic voyaging when she had been young and foolishshe seemed to remember having found in her own room then she was sinking into a bed like a tide of rainbowcolored foam sinking deep deep deep  and it was morning and she perceived that the purpose of morning light was to pick out surfaces of mahogany and orange velvet and glass and that only an idiot would ever leave this place and go about begging dirty garage men to fill her car with stinking gasoline and oil  the children were at breakfastchildren surely not of the same species as the smearycheeked brats she had seen tumbling by roadsides along the waysturdy mason with his cap of curls and virginia with bobbed ashblond hair prim about her delicate face they curtsied and in voices that actually had intonations they besought her oh cousin claire would you pleasssssse tell us about drivetothecoast  after breakfast she went out on the terrace for the view  in seattle even millionaires and the i w w and men with red garters on their exposed shirtsleeves who want to give you real estate all talk about the view the view is to seattle what the carservice the auditorium the flivverfactory or the price of coal is to other cities at parties in seattle you discuss the question of whether the view of lake union or the view of the olympics is the better and polite officemanagers say to their stenographers as they enter hows your view this morning all realestate deeds include a patent on the view and every native son has it as his soundest belief that no one in tacoma gets a view of mount rainier  mrs gilson informed claire that they had the finest view in seattle  below claire was the harbor with docks thrust far out into the water and steamers alive with smoke mrs gilson said they were blue funnel liners loading for vladivostok and japan the names just the names shot into claires heart a wistful unexpressed desire that was somehow vaguely connected with a milt daggett who back in the middlewestern mud and rain had longed for purple mountains and cherry blossoms and the sea but she cast out the wish and lifted her eyes to mountains across the soundnot purple mountains but sheer silver streaked with black like frozen surf on a desolate northern shorethe olympics twoscore miles away  up there one could camp with a boy in a deteriorated sweater singing as he watched the coffee  hastily she looked to the left across the city with its bright new skyscrapers its shining cornices and masses of ranked windows and the exclamationpoint of the tallest building outside of new yorkfar livelier than her own rusty brooklyn beyond the city was a dun cloud but as she stared far up in the cloud something crept out of the vapor and hung there like a dull full moon aloof majestic overwhelming and she realized that she was beholding the peak of mount rainier with the city at its foot like white quartz pebbles at the base of a tower  a landingstage for angels she reflected  it did seem larger than dressingtables and velvet hangings and scented baths  but she dragged herself from the enticing path of that thought and sighed wretchedly oh yes he would appreciate rainier but howhow would he manage a grapefruit i mustnt be a fool i mustnt she saw that mrs gilson was peeping at her and she made herself say adequate things about the view before she fled insidefled from her sputtering inquiring self  in the afternoon they drove to capitol hill they dropped in at various pretty houses and met the sort of people claire knew back home between people they had views and the sensible miss boltwood making a philosophic discovery announced to herself after all ive seen just as much from this limousine as i would from a bonebreaking teal bug silly to make yourself miserable to see things oh yes i will go wandering some more but not like a hobo but what can i say to him good heavens he may be here any time now with our car oh whywhywhy was i insane on that station platform     chapter xxv  the abyssinian prince   snoqualmie pass lies among mountains prickly with rocks and burnt stumps but the road is velvet with broad saucer curves and to milt it was pure beauty it was release from life to soar up coaxing inclines and slip down easy grades in the powerful car no more teals for me he cried in the ecstasy of handling an engine that slowed to a demure whisper then at a touch of the accelerator floated up a rise effortless joyous humming the booming song of the joy in speed he suddenly hated the bucking tediousness of the teal the gomezdep symbolized his own new life  so he came to lake washington and just across it was the city of his long dreams the city of the pacificand of claire there was no ferry in sight and he rounded the lake struck a brick pavement rolled through rough woods suburban villas and petty business streets to a region of factories and mills with the funnels of ships beyond  and every minute he drove more slowly and became more uneasy  the pavementthe miles of it the ruthless lumbermills with their thousands of workmen quite like himself the agitation of realizing that every three minutes he was passing a settlement larger than schoenstrom the strangeness of ships and all the cynical ways of the seathe whole scene depressed him as he perceived how little of the world he knew and how big and contemptuous of milt daggetts that world must be  huh he growled quite some folks living here dont suppose they spend such a whale of a lot of time thinking about milt daggett and bill mcgolwey and prof jones i guess most of these people wouldnt think heinie rauskukles store was so goshawful big i wasnt scared of minneapolismuchbut there they didnt ring in mountains and an ocean on you and i didnt have to go up on the hill and meet folks like claires relations and figure out whether you shake hands catchascatchcan or corinthian look at that sawmill chimneyisnt it nice of em to put the flyscreen over it so the flies wont get down into the flames no they havent got much more than a million feet of lumber in that one pile and heres a bum little furniture storeit wouldnt cost more n about ten times all ive got to buy one of those morris chairs oh gooooooosh wont these houses ever stop say that must be a jitney the driver snickered at me will the whole town be onto me milt youre a kind young fellow and you know whats the matter with heinies differential but they dont need you here quite a few folks to carry on the business gosh look at that building aheadnine stories  he had planned to stop at a hotel to wash up and to gallop to claire butwellwouldnt it maybe be better to leave the car at a public garage so the boltwoods could get it when they wanted to hed better just kind of look around before he tackled the watchdog  it was the public garage which finally crushed him it was a garage of enameled brick and colored tiles with a plateglassenclosed office in which worked young men clad as the angels one of them wore a carnation milt noted  huh ill write back and tell ben sittka that hereafter hes to wear his bestsundaygotomeeting clothes and a milkweed blossom when he comes down to work at the red trail garage  milt drove up the brick incline into a room thousands of miles long with millions of new and recently polished cars standing in lines as straight as a runningboard he begged of a highnosed colored functionarynot in khaki overalls but in maroon liverywherell i put this boat  the abyssinian prince gave him a check and in a tone of extreme lack of personal interest snapped take it down the aisle to the elevator  milt had followed the natural lines of traffic into the city he had spoken to no one the princes snort was his welcome to seattle  meekly he drove past the cars so ebon and silvery so smug and strong that they would have regarded a teal bug as an insult another attendant waved him into the elevator and milt tried not to look surprised when the car started not forward but upward as though it had turned into an aeroplane  when these adventures were over when he had had a shave and a shine and washed his hands and looked into a departmentstore window that contained ten billion yards of silk draped against polished satinwood when he had felt unhappy over a movie theater large enough to contain ten times the population of schoenstrom and been cursed by a policeman for jaywalking and had passed a hotel entirely full of diplomats and marble and caviarethen he could no longer put off telephoning to claire and humbly in a booth meant for an umbrellastand he got the eugene gilson house and to a female who said yes in a tone which made it mean no he ventured may i speak to miss boltwood  miss boltwood it seemed was out  he was not sorry he was relieved he ducked out of the telephonebooth with a sensation of escape  milt was in love with claire she was to him the purpose of life he thought of her deeply and tenderly and longingly all the way into seattle he had brooded about her remembered her every word and gesture recalled the curve of her chin and the fresh feeling of her hands but claire had suddenly become too big in her were all these stores these office buildings for clever lawyers and surgeons these contemptuous trolley cars these careless people in beautiful clothes they were too much for him desperately he was pushing them backbackfighting for breath and she belonged with them  he mailed the check for the stored car to her with a notewritten standing before a hacked walldesk in a branch postofficewhich said only heres check for the boat did not know whether you would have room for it at house tried to get you on phone phone again just as soon as rent room etc hope having happy time md  he went out to the university on the trolley he relaxed but he did not exultantly feel that he had won to the pacific he could not regard seattle now as a magic city the bagdad of modern caravans with alaska and the orient on one hand the forests to the north and eastward the spacious inland empire of the wheat he saw it as a place where you had to work hard just to live where busy policemen despised you because you didnt know which trolley to take where it was incredibly hard to remember even the names of the unceasing streets where the conductors said step lively and there was no room to whistle no time to swap stories with a bill mcgolwey at an old home lunchcounter  he found the university he talked with the authorities about entering the engineering school the y m c a gave him a list of rooms and because it was cheap he chose a cubbyhole in a flat over a candy storea low room which would probably keep out the rain but had no other virtues it had one bed one table one dissipated bureau two straight bare chairs and one venerable lithograph depicting a girl with ringlets shaking her irritating forefinger at a highchurch kitten  the landlady consented to his importing an oilstove for cooking his meals he bought the stove with a box of oatmeal a jar of bacon and half a dozen eggs he bought a plane and solid geometry and an algebra at dinner time he laid the algebra beside his plate of anemic bacon and leaking eggs the eggs grew cold he did not stir he was reviewing his highschool algebra he went down the pages word by word steadily quickly absolutely concentratedas concentrated as he would recently have been in a new problem of disordered transmission not once did he stop to consider how glorious it would be to marry claireor how terrifying it would be to marry miss boltwood  three hours went by before he started up bewildered rubbed his eyes picked at the chill bacon and altogether disgusting eggs and rambled out into the street  again he risked the scorn of conductors and jitney drivers he found queen anne hill found the residence of mr eugene gilson he sneaked about it slipped into the gate prowled toward the house flabby from the intensity of study he longed for the stimulus of claires smile but as he stared up at the great squares of the clear windows at the flare of white columns in the porchlights that smile seemed unreachable he felt like a rustic at court from the shelter of the prickly holly hedge he watched the house it was some kind of a partyor what would folks like these call a party limousines were arriving he had a glimpse of silken ankles frothy underskirts heard easy laughter saw people moving through a big blue and silver room caught a drifting tremor of music  at last he saw claire she was dancing with a young man as decorative as that confounded saxton fellow he had met at flathead lake but younger than saxton a laughing young man with curly black hair for the first time in his life milt wanted to kill he muttered damndamndamn as he saw the young man carelessly embracing claire  his fingers tingling his whole body yearning till every cell seemed a beating hammer milt longed just once to slip his hand about claires waist like that he could feel the satin of her bodice and its warmth  then it seemed to him as claire again passed the window that he did not know her at all he had once talked to a girl who resembled her but that was long ago he could understand a gomezdep and appreciate a brisk sportssuit but this girl was of a world unintelligible to him her hair in its dips and convolutions was altogether a puzzle how did she ever fix it like that her low evening dresswhat was it made ofsome white stuff but was it silk or muslin or what her shoulders were startling in their bare powdery smoothnesshow dare that young pup dance with her and her face that had seemed so jolly and friendly floated past the window as pale and illusive as a wisp of fog his longing for her passed into clumsy awe he remembered without resentment that once on a hilltop in dakota she had coldly forbidden him to follow her  with all the pleasure of martyrdomto make quite sure that he should realize how complete a fool he had been to intrude on miss boltwoodhe studied the other guests he gave them perhaps a glory they did not have there were girls sleek as ivory there was a lean stooped man very distinguished there was a bulky man in a dinner coat with a semicircle of mustache and eyes that even at a distance seemed to give impatient orders he would be a big banker or a lumberman  it was the easy friendliness of all of them that most made milt feel like an outsider if a servant had come out and ordered him away he would have gone meekly  he fancied  he straggled off too solidly unhappy to think how unhappy he was in his clammy room he picked up the algebra for a quarterhour he could not gather enough vigor to open it in his lassitude his elbows felt feeble his fingers were ready to drop off he slowly scratched the book open  at one oclock he was reading algebra his face still and grim but already it seemed less heartily brickred  he listlessly telephoned to claire in the morning  hello oh miss boltwood this is milt daggett  oh oh how are you  why why imive got settled i can get into the engineering school all right  im glad  uh enjoying seattle  oh oh yes the mountains do you like it  oh oh yes sea and all great town  uh wwhen are we going to see you daddy had to go east left you his regards wwhen  whywhy i suppose youre awfulawfully busy meeting people and all  yes i am rather but her hedging uncomfortable tone changed to a cry of distress milt i must see you come up at four this afternoon  yes  he rushed to a small hot tailorshop he panted press m suit while i wait they gave him a pair of temporary trousers an undesirable pair of trousers belonging to a short fat man with no taste in fabrics and with these flapping about his lean legs he sat behind a calico curtain reading the war cry and looking at a fashionplate depicting nine gentlemen yachtsmen each nine feet tall while the jugoslav in charge unfeelingly sprinkled and ironed and patted his suit  he spent ten minutes in blacking his shoes in his roomand twenty minutes in getting the blacking off his fingers  he was walking through the gate in the gilson hedge at one minute to four  but he had reached queen anne hill at three for an hour he had walked the crest road staring at the steamers below alternately gripping his hands with desire of claire and timorously finally deciding that he wouldnt go to her housewouldnt ever see her again  he came into the hall tremblingly expecting some great thing some rending scene and she met him with a cool oh this is nice eva had some little white cakes made for us he felt like a man who has asked for a drink of cold charged water and found it warm and flat  how dandy house he muttered limply shaking her limp hand  yes isnt it a darling they do themselves awfully well here im afraid your bluff plain democratic westerners are a fraud i hear a lot more about society here than i ever did in the east the sets seem frightfully complicated she was drifting into the drawingroom to a tapestry stool and milt was awkwardly stalking a large wing chair while she fidgeted  everybody tells me about how one poor dear soul a charming lady who used to take in washing or salt goldmines or something and she came here a little while ago with billions and billions of dollars and tried to buy her way in by shopping for all the charities in town and apparently shes just as out of it here as she would be in london you and i arent exclusive like that are we  somehow  her you and i was too kindly as though she was trying to put him at ease as though she knew he couldnt possibly be at ease with a horribly elaborate politeness with a smile that felt hot on his twitching cheeks he murmured oh no no we no i guess  if he knew what it was he guessed he couldnt get it out while he was trying to find out what had become of all the things there were to say in the world a maid came in with an astonishing objecta small red shelved table on wheels laden with silver vessels and cake and sandwiches that were amazingly small and thin  the maid was so starched that she creaked she glanced at milt claire didnt make him so nervous that he thought of his clothes but the maid did he was certain that she knew that he had blacked his own shoes knew how old were his clothes he was urging himself must get new suit tomorrowreadymademustnt forget nowbe sureget suit tomorrow he wanted to apologize to the maid for existing he wouldnt dare to fall in love with the maid and hed kill the man who said he could be fool enough to fall in love with miss boltwood  he sipped his tea and dropped sandwich crumbs and ached and panted and peeped at the crushing quantities of pictures and sconces and tables and chairs in the room and wondered what they did with all of them while claire chattered  yes we werent exclusive out on the road didnt we meet funny people though oh somehow that funny people sounds familiar but what fun that morning was atpellago was it heavens im forgetting those beastly little towns alreadythat place where we hazed the poor landlady who overcharged me  yes he was thinking of how much claire would forget now yes we certainly fixed her all right uhdid you get the storage check for your car  oh yes thank you so nice of you to bother with it  oh nothing at all nothing nothing at all uh do you like seattle  oh yes such viewsthe mountains do you like it  oh yes always wanted to see the sea  yes and such a wellbuilt town  yes and they must do a lot of business here  yes they oh yes i do like seat  he had darted from his chair brushed by the teawagon ignoring its rattle and the perilous tipping of cups he put his hand on her shoulder snorted look here were both sparring for time stop it itsits all right claire i want you to like me but im notim not like that woman you were telling about thats trying to butt in i know lord i know so well what youre thinking youre thinking im not up to the people youve been seeing last couple of daysnot up to em yet anyway well well be good friends  fearless now his awe gone in tenderness he lifted her chin looked straight into her eyes smiled but his courage was slipping he wanted to run and hide  he turned abruptly grumbling well better get back to work now i guess  her cry was hungry oh please dont go she was beside him shyly picking at his sleeve i know what you mean i like you for being so understanding but i do like you you were the perfect companion lets oh lets have a walkand try to laugh again  he definitely did not want to stay at this moment he did not love her he regarded her as an estimable young woman who for a person so idiotically reared had really shown a good deal of pluck out on the roadwhere he wanted to be he stood in the hall disliking his old cap while she ran up to put on a top coat  mute casual they tramped out of the house together and down the hill to a region of shabby old brown houses like blisters on the hillside they had little to say and that little was a polite reminiscence of incidents in which neither was interested  when they came back to the gilson hedge he stopped at the gate with terrific respectableness removed his cap  good night she said cheerily call me up soon again  he did not answer good night he said goodby and he meant it to be his last farewell he caught her hand hastily dropped it fled down the hill  he was he told himself going to leave seattle that evening  that doubtless is the reason why he ran to a trolley to get to a departmentstore before it closed and why precipitating himself upon a startled clerk he purchased a new suit of chaste blue serge a new pair of tan boots curiously like some he had seen on the university campus that morning and a new hat so gray and conservative and felty that it might have been worn by woodrow wilson  he spent the evening in reading algebra and geometry and in telling himself that he was beautifully not thinking about claire  in the midst of it he caught himself at it and laughed  what youre doing my friend is pretending you dont like claire so that you can hide from your fool self the fact that youre going to sneak back to see her the first chance you getfirst time the watchdog is out seriously now son claire is impossible for you no can do now that youve been chump enough to leave home oh lord i wish i hadnt promised to take this room for all winter wish i hadnt matriculated at the u but im here now and ill stick it out ill stay here one year anyway and go back home oh and to by golly she liked me  he was thinking of the wildrose teacher to whom he had given a lift back in dakota he was remembering her daintiness her admiration  now theres somebody whod make me keep climbing but wouldnt think i was a poor hick if i were to drive back next spring i could find her     chapter xxvi  a class in engineering and omelets   the one thing of which milt daggett was certain was that now he had managed to crawl into the engineering school he must get his degree in mechanical engineering he was older than most of his classmates he must hurry he must do four years work in two  there has never been a freshman not the most goggleeyed and earnest of them who has seen less of classmates thought less about outside activities more grimly centered the universe about his work  milt had sold his garage by mail to ben sittka and heinie rauskukle he had enough money to get through two years with economy his life was as simple and dull as it had been in schoenstrom he studied while he cooked his scrappy meals he pinned mathematical formul√¶ and mechanical diagrams on the wall and pored over them while he was dressingor while he was trying to break in the new shoes which were beautiful squeaky and confoundedly tight  he was taking french and english and compositionwriting in addition to engineering and he made out a schedule of life as humorlessly as a girl grind who intends to be a latin teacher when he was not at work or furiously running and yanking chestweights in the gymnasium he was attending concerts lectures  studying the life about him he had discovered that the best way to save time was to avoid the lazy friendships of college the pipesmoking yawning comfortable rather heavy altogether pleasant wondering about whatll we do next which occupies at least four hours a day for the average man in college he would have liked it as he had liked long talks about nothing with bill mcgolwey at the old home lunch but he couldnt afford it he had to be ready to  that was the point at which his reflections always came up with a jolt he was quite clear about the method of getting ready but he hadnt the slightest idea of what he was getting ready for the moment he had redecided to marry claire he saw that his only possible future would be celibate machineryinstalling in alaska and the moment he was content with the prospect of an engineers camp in alaskan wilds his thoughts went crazily fluttering after claire  despite his aloofness milt was not unpopular in his class the engineers had few of them the interest in dances athletics college journalism which distinguished the men in the academic course they were older and more conscious of a living to earn and milts cheerful hows the boy his manner of waving his handas though to a good customer leaving the red trail garage with the generator at last tamedindicated that he was a good fellow  one group of collegians milt did seek it is true that he had been genuine in scorning social climbers but it is also true that the men whom he sought to know were the university smart set their satisfaction in his allegiance would have been lessened however had they known how little he cared for what they thought of him and with what cruel directness he was using them as models for the one purpose of pleasing miss claire boltwood  the american state universities admit in a pleased way that though yale and harvard and princeton may be snobbish the state universities are the refuge of a myth called college democracy but there is no university near a considerable city into which the inheritors of the wealth of that city do not carry all the local social distinctions their family rank their place in the unwritten peerage determines to which fraternity they shall be elected and the fraternity determines with whommen and girlsthey shall be intimate the sons and daughters of seattle and tacoma the scions of old families running in an unbroken line clear back to 1880 were amiable to poor outsiders from the yakima valley and the new claims of idaho but they did not often invite them to their homes on the two hills and the boulevard  yet it was these plutocrats whom milt followed they whose boots and table manners cigarettes and lack of interest in theology he studied he met them in his english class he remarked hello smith and mornin jones as though he liked them but didnt care a hang whether they liked him and by and by he drifted into their fraternity dwellinghouse with a question about the next days assignment and met their friends he sat pipesmoking silent cheerful and they seemed to accept him whenever one of them felt that milt was intruding and asked impertinent questions in the manner of a pullman porter at a darktown ball milt had a peculiar level look which had been known to generate courtesy even in the offspring of a million dollars they found that he knew more about motorcars than any of them and as motorcars were among their greater gods they considered him wise he was incomparably simple and unpretentious they found his presence comfortable  but there is a question as to what they would have thought had they known that lying awake in the morning milt unsmilingly repeated  hair always straight down at the back never rounded nix on clippers over the ears  matisse is a popular nut artist fashionable for the swells to laugh at him and the fellows on the college papers to rave about him  blinx and severan the swellestthe smartest haberdashery in the city  the one way to get in dutch is to mention labor leaders  never say pleased to meet you just look about halfway between bored and tolable and say how do you do                                       all these first three weeks of his life in seattle he had seen claire only on his first call twice he had telephoned to her on one of these high occasions she had invited him to accompany the family to the theaterwhich meant to the moviesand he had wretchedly refused the other time she had said that she might stay in seattle all winter and she might go any day and they must be sure to have that good long walk and he had said oh yes ten or twelve unhappy times and had felt very empty as he hung up the receiver  then she wrote to invite him to late sunday breakfast at the gilsonsthey made a function of it and called it bruncheon the hour was given as tenthirty most people came at noon but milt arrived at tenthirtyone and found only a sleepy butler in sight  he waited in the drawingroom for five minutes feeling like a billcollector into the room vaulted a mediumsized mediumlooking amiable man eugene gilson babbling oh i say so sorry to keep you waiting mr daggett rotten shame do come have a bun or something frightfully informal these bruncheons play auction  zallrightno said milt  the host profusely led him to a diningroom wherein english fashion or something like english fashion or anyway a close approximation to the fictional pictures of english fashionkidneys and sausages and omelets waited in dishes on the sideboard mr gilson poured coffee and chanted  do try the kidneys theyre usually very fair miss boltwood tells me that you were very good to her on the trip must have been jolly trip you going to be in town some time oh yes claire said you were in the university engineering wasnt it have you ever seen our lumbermills do drop around some try the omelet before the beastly thing gets cold do you mind kicking that button well have some more omelet inany time at the mill and ill be glad to have some one show you through how did you find the roads along the red trail  why pretty fair said milt  into the room precipitated mrs gilson in a smile a supersweater and a sports skirt that would have been soiled by any variety of sport more violent than pinochle and she was wailing as she came  were disgraced gene is this mr daggett how do you do so good of you to come do try the kidneys theyre usually quite decent are the omelets warm you might ring for some more gene for heavens sake give me some coffee miss boltwood will be right down mr daggett she told us how fortunate they were that they met you on the road did you like the trip how were the roads  why they were pretty good said milt  claire arrived fresh and serene in white taffeta and she cried prettily i ought to have known that youd be prompt even if no one else in the world is so glad you came have you tried the kidneys and do have anoh i see you have tried the omelets how goes the work at the university  why fine said milt  he ate stolidly and looked pleased and sneaked in a glance at his new and still tight and still squeaky tan boots to make sure that they were as well polished as they had seemed at home  from nowhere appeared a bustling weighty woman purring hello hello hello is it possible that youre all up mr daggett yes do lead me to the kidneys  and a man with the gray hair of a grandfather and the giggle of a cashgirl bounced in clamoring morninexpected to have bruncheon alonedo we have some bridge oh good morning mr daggett how do you like seattle oh thanks so much yes just two  then milt ceased to keep track of the conversation which bubbled over the omelets and stewed over the kidneys and foamed about the coffee and clashed above a hastily erected bridge table and altogether sounded curiously like four cars with four quite different things the matter with them all being tried out at once in a small garage people flocked in and nodded as though they knew one another too well to worry about it they bowed to him charmingly and instantly forgot him for the kidneys and sausages he sat looking respectable and feeling lonely by a cup of coffee till clairedropping the highly unreal smile with which she had been listening to the elderly beaus account of a fishingtrip he hadnt quite got around to takingslipped into a chair beside him and begged are they looking out for you milt  oh yes thank you  you havent been to see me  oh no but working so darn hard  what a strikingly original reason but have you really  honest  suddenly he wantedeternal man forever playing confidential small boy to the belovedto tell her about his classes and acquaintances to get pity for his bare room and his homecooking but round them blared the brazen interest in kidneys and as claire glanced up with much brightness at another arrival milt lost momentum and found that there was absolutely nothing in the world he could say to her  he made a grateful farewell to the omelets and kidneys and escaped  he walked many miles that day trying to remember how claire looked     chapter xxvii  the viciousness of nice things   what did you think of my nice daggett boy claire demanded of eva gilson the moment bruncheon was over  which one was oh the boy you met on the road why really i didnt notice him particularly id rather fancied from the way you referred to him that he was awfully jolly and forceful but rather crude but i didnt notice him at all he seemed perfectly wellbred but slightly heavy  no he isnt that he why did you lead spades reflected claire  they were in the drawingroom resting after the tact and tumult of the bruncheon claire had been here long enough now for the gilsons to forget her comfortably and be affectionate and quarrelsome and natural and to admit by their worrying that even in their exalted social position there were things to fuss about  i do think we ought to have invited belle torrens fretted mrs gilson weve simply got to have her here soon  mr gilson speculated intensely but shes the dullest soul on earth and her husband spends all his spare time in trying to think up ways of doing me dirt in business oh by the way did you get the water tap in the blue room fixed its dripping all the time  no i forgot it  well i do wish youd have it attended to it simply drips all the time  i know i intended to phone the plumber cant you phone him tomorrow from the office  no i havent time to bother with it but i do wish you would it keeps on dripping  i know it doesnt seem to stop well you remind me of it in the morning  im afraid ill forget you better make a note of it if it keeps on dripping that way its likely to injure something and i do wish youd tell the jap not to put so much parsley in the omelet and i say how would an omelet be with a butter sauce over it  oh no i dont think so an omelet ought to be nice and dry butter makes it so greasybesides with the price of butter  but theres a richness to butter youd better make a note about the tap dripping in the blue room right now before you forget it oh why in heavens name did we have johnny martin here hes dull as ditchwater  i know but it is nice to go out to his place on the point oh gene i do wish youd try and remember not to talk about your business so much you and mr martin were talking about the price of lumber for at least half an hour  nothing of the kind we scarcely mentioned it oh what car are you going to use this afternoon if we get out to the barnetts i thought we might use the limousine or no youll probably go out before i do i have to read over some specifications and i promised to give will a lift couldnt you take the loco maybe you might drive yourself no i forgot the clutch is slipping a little well you might drive out and send the car back for mestill there wouldnt hardly be time  listening to them as to a play claire suddenly desired to scream oh for heavens sake quit fussing im going up and drown myself in the blueroom tap what does it matter walk take a surface car dont fuss so  her wrath came from her feeling of guilt yes milt had been commonplace had she done this to him had she turned his cheerful ignorances into a careful stupor and she felt stuffy and choking and overpacked with food she wanted to be out on the road clearheaded forcing her way through an independent human beingwith milt not too far behind  mrs gilson was droning i do think mattie vincent is so nice  rather dull id call her yawned mr gilson  mattie was the seventh of their recent guests whom he had called dull by now  not at alloh of course she doesnt dance on tables and quote maeterlinck but she does have an instinct for the niceties and the proprietiesher little house is so sweeteverything just exactly rightit may be only a single rose but always chosen so carefully to melt into the background and such adorable chinai simply die of envy every time i see her lowestoft plates and such a quiet way of reproving any bad tastethe time that crank university professor was out there and spoke of the radical labor movement and mattie just smiled at him and said if you dont mind lets not drag filthy lumberjacks into the drawingroomtheyd hate it just as much as we would dont you think perhaps  oh damn nice china oh lets hang all spinsters who are brightly reproving claire was silently raging and particularly and earnestly confound all nicety and discretion of living  she tried to break the spell of the gilsons fussing she falseheartedly fawned upon mr gilson and inquired  is there anything very exciting going on at the mills gene  exciting asked mr gilson incredulously why how do you mean  dont you find business exciting why do you do it then  oh wellllll of course oh yes exciting in a way well well weve had a jolly interesting time making staves for candy pailspromises to be wonderfully profitable we have a new way of cutting them but you wouldnt be interested in the machinery  of course not you dont bore eva with your horrid headachy businessproblems do you claire cooed with low cunning  indeed no dont think a chap ought to inflict his business on his wife the home should be a place of peace  yes said claire  but she wasnt thinking yes she was thinking milt what worries me now isnt how i can risk letting the nice people meet you its how i can ever waste you on the nice people oh im spoiled for cutglassandvelvet afternoons eternal spiritual agony over blueroom taps is too high a price even for fourposter beds i want to be driving hiking living  that afternoon after having agreed that mr johnny martin was a bore mr and mrs gilson decided to run out to the house of mr johnny martin they bore along the lifeless claire  mr martin was an unentertaining bachelor who entertained there were a dozen supercilious young married people at his bayside cottage when the gilsons arrived among them were two eyebrowarching young matrons whom claire had not metmrs corey and mrs betz  weve all heard of you miss boltwood said mrs betz you come from the east dont you  yes fluttered claire trying to be cordial  mrs corey and mrs betz looked at each other in a motionless wink and mrs corey prodded  from new york  no brooklyn claire tried not to make it too short  oh the tacit wink was repeated mrs corey said brightlymuch too brightlyi was born in new york i wonder if you know the dudenants  now claire knew the dudenants she had danced with that young ass don dudenant a dozen times but the devil did enter into her and possess her and to eva gilsons horror claire said stupidly noo but i think ive heard of them  the condemning wink was repeated  i hear youve been doing such interesting thingsmotoring and adventuringyou must have met some terrible people along the way fished mrs betz  yes everybody does seem to feel that way but im afraid i found them terribly nice flared claire  i always say that common people can be most agreeable mrs corey patronized before claire could kill herthere wasnt any homicidal weapon in sight except a silver teastrainermrs corey had pirouetted on though i do think that were much too kind to workmen and allthe labor situation is getting to be abominable here in the west and upon my word to keep a maid nowadays you have to treat her as though she were a countess  why shouldnt maids be like countesses theyre much more important said claire sweetly  it cannot be stated that claire had spent any large part of her time in reading karl marx leading syndicalist demonstrations or hemming red internationalist flags but at this instant she was a complete revolutionist she could have executed mrs corey and pretty mrs betz with zeal she disliked the entire bourgeoisie she looked around for a jap boy to call comrade and she again thought about the possibilities of the teastrainer for use in assassination she stolidly wore through the combined and exclamatory explanations of mrs corey mrs betz mrs gilson and mr johnny martin about the inherent viciousness of all maids and when the storm was over she said in a manner of honey and syrup  you were speaking of the dudenants werent you mrs corey i do remember them now poor don dudenant isnt it a pity hes such a fool his father is really a very decent old bore  i observed mrs corey in prim horror regard the dudenants as extremely delightful people i fancy we must be thinking of different families i mean the manhattan dudenants not the brooklyn family  oh yes i meant the manhattan family toothe one that made its fortune selling shoddy woolens in the civil war caressed claire  right there her welcome by mrs corey and mrs betz ceased and without any of the unhappiness which the thought would have caused her three months before claire reflected how they hate me  the gilsons had a number of thoughts upon the subject of tact to express to claire on the way home but she who had always smiled who had been the obedient guest shrugged and snapped theyre idiots those young women theyre impertinent shopgirls in good frocks i like your seattle its a glorious city and i love so many of the fine simple real people ive met here i admire your progress i do know how miraculously youve changed it from a mining camp but for heavens sake dont forget the good common hardiness of the miners somehow london social distinctions seem ludicrous in american cities that twenty years ago didnt have much but board sidewalks and saloons i dont care whether its seattle or minneapolis or omaha or denver i refuse to worry about the duchess of corey and the baroness betz and all the other wonderful imitations of gilt when a pair of finishingschool flappers like betz and corey try to impress me with their superiority to workmen and their extreme aristocracy and easternness they make me tired i am the east  she had made peace with the gilsons by night she had been reasonably repentant about not playing the game of her hosts but inside her eager heart she snuggled a warm thought she remembered how gaily she had once promised out on the road to come to milts room and cook for him she thought of it with homesick desire his room probably wasnt particularly decorative and she doubted his having an electric range but it would be fun to fry eggs again to see him fumbling with the dishwashing to chatter and plan golden futures and not worry about the opinions of mrs corey and mrs betz  the next afternoon the limousine was not busy and she borrowed it with the handsome greek chauffeur  she gave him an address not far from the university  he complained pardon me miss but i think you have the wrong number that block is a low quarter  probably but thats the right number  he raised his athenian eyebrows and she realized what a mistake she had made in not bringing the lethal teastrainer along when they had stopped in front of a cheap candystore he opened the door of the car with such frigid reserve that she thought seriously about slapping him  she climbed the stingy flapping stairs and knocked at the first door in the upper hall it was opened by a large apron to which a sleepy woman was an unimportant attachment and out of the mass of apron and woman came a yawning mr daggetts room is down the hall on the right  claire knocked at a door which had at various epochs been blue yellow and pink and now was all three no answer she tried the knob went in  she could not tell whether it was the barrenness of the room or milts carefulness that caught her the uncarpeted boards of the floor were well swept he had only one plate one spoon but they were scoured and put away on newspapercovered shelves in a cupboard made of a soapbox behind a calico curtain was his new suit dismayingly neat on its hanger on the edge of the iron sink primly washed and spread out to dry was a tattered old rag at the sight of it at the thought of milt solemnly washing dishes the tears began to creep to her eyes  there was but one picture in the rooma halftone of a girl clipped from a magazine devoted to actresses the name was cut off as she wondered at it claire saw that the actress was very much like herself  the only other ornament was a papierm√¢ch√© figure of a cat a cat reminiscent of the lady vere de vere claire picked it up on the bottom was the pricemarkthree cents  it was the pricemark that pierced her she flung across the room dropped on his creaky cotbed howled oh ive been a beasta beasta beast all the pretty thingslimousines and marble bathsthinking so much of them and not wanting them for him and he with so little with just nothinghe that would appreciate jolly things so muchhere in this den and making it as tolerable as he canand me half ashamed of him instead of fighting for him i belong with corey and betz oh im so ashamed so bitterly ashamed  she patted his bed smooth with nervous eager fingers  she scraped a pinpoint of eggyolk off a platter  before she had been home five minutes she had written a note asking him to tea for next day     chapter xxviii  the morning coat of mr hudson b riggs   mr hudson b riggs now enters the talesomewhat tardily and making a quick exit all in a morning coat too tight about the shoulders and a smile of festivity too tight about the lips he looked as improbable as an undertakers rubberplant yet in his brief course he had a mighty effect upon the progress of civilization as exemplified in the social career of mr milton daggett  mr riggs had arrived at a golden position in alaskan mining engineering by way of the farm the section gang the surveyors chain and prospecting and his thick hands showed his evolution his purpose in life was to please mrs riggs and he wasnt ever going to achieve his purpose in life she wore spangles and her corsets creaked and she smiled nervously and could tell in a glance quicker than the 1100 kodak shutter whether or not a new acquaintance was worth cultivating she had made mr riggs thoroughly safe and thoroughly unhappy in the pursuit of society he stood about keeping from doing anything he might want to and he was profusely polite to young cubs whom he longed to have in his officeso that he could get even with them  what mr riggs wanted to do at the third large tea given by mrs gilson for miss claire boltwood was to sneak out on the sunporch and play over the new records on the phonograph but the things he had heard from mrs riggs the last time hed done that had convinced him that it was not a wise method of escape so he stood by the fireplacesafe on one side at leastand ate lettuce sandwiches which he privately called cow feed and listened to a shining largely feminine crowd rapidly uttering unintelligible epigrams from which he caught only the words ripping handtrained nursewhipcordreally worth seeinglost the ball near the second holemost absurd personnew maidthanks so much he was hoping that some one would come around and let him be agreeable he knew that he stood the ride home with mrs riggs much better after he had been agreeable to people he didnt like  what mr riggs did not know was that a young man in uninteresting blue who looked like a good tennisplayer was watching him it wasnt because he detected a fellow soul in purgatory but because he always was obsequious outside of his office that mr riggs bowed so profusely that he almost lost his teacup when the young man in blue drifted to him and suggested i hear youre in the alaskan mininggame mr riggs  oh yes  do you get up there much now  no not much  i hope to hit alaska some dayim taking engineering at the u  do you straight mr riggs violently set his cup down on a tablemrs riggs would later tell him that hed put it down in the wrong place but never mind he leaned over milt and snarled offer me a cigarette i dont know if they smoke here and i dassnt be the first to try say boy alaska i wish i was there now say it beats all hell how good tea can taste in a tin cup and how wishywashy it is in china boy i dont know anything about you but you look all right and when you get ready to go to alaska you come to me and ill see if i cant give you a chance to go up there but dont ever come back  when the crowd began bubblingly to move toward the door milt prepared to moveand bubblewith them though claires note had sounded as though she was really a little lonely at the tea she had said nothing to him except so glad you came do you know dolly ransome dolly this is my nice mr daggett take him and make him happy  dolly hadnt made him in the least happy she had talked about tennis she had with some detail described her remarkable luck in beating one sally saunders three sets now milt was learning tennis he was at the present period giving two hours a week to tennis two to dancing two to bridge but he preferred cleaning oilwells to any of these toilsome accomplishments and it must sadly be admitted that all the while he was making his face bright at dolly he was wondering what would happen if he interrupted dollys gurgling galloping giggling multitudinousness by shouting oh shut up  when it seemed safe to go and he tried to look as though he too were oozing out to a cranesimplex claire slipped beside him soft as a shadow and whispered please dont go i want to talk to you please there was fluttering wistfulness in her voice though instantly it was gone as she hastened to the door and was to be heard asserting that she did indeed love seattle  milt looked out into the hall he studied a console with a curious black and white vase containing a single peacock feather and a gold mirror shimmering against a gray wall  lovely stuff i like that mirror like a slew in the evening but it isnt worth being a slave for im not going to be a mr riggs poor devil hes more of a servant than any of these maids certainly am sorry for that poor fish hell have a chance to take his coat off and sit down and smokewhen hes dead  the guests were gone the gilsons upstairs claire came running seized milts sleeve coaxed him to the davenport in the drawingroomthen sighed and rubbed her forehead and looked so tired that he could say nothing but hope you havent been overdoing  no justjust talking too much  he got himself to say miss ransomethe one thats nuts about tennisshes darn nice  is she  yes shesshes what do you hear from your father  oh hes back at work  trip do him good  oh a lot  did he  milt tell me about you what are you doing what are you studying how do you live do you really cook your own meals do you begin to get your teeth into the engineering oh do tell me everything i want to know so much  there isnt a whole lot to tell mostly im getting back into math been out of touch with it i find that i know more about motors than most of the fellows that helps and about livingoh i keep conservative did you know id sold my garage  oh i didnt i didnt  he wondered why she said it with such stooping shame but he went on mildly well i got a pretty good price but of course i dont want to take any chances on running short of coin so im not splurging much and he looked at his nails and whistled a bar or two and turned his head away and looked back with a shy and im learning to play bridge and tennis and stuff  oh my dear it was a cry of pain she beat her hands for a moment before she murmured when are we going to have our lessons in dancingand in making an impression on sunspecks like dolly ransome  i dont know he parried then looking at her honestly he confessed i dont believe were ever going to claire i cant do it im no good for this tea game you know how clumsy i was i spilled some tea and i darn near tripped over some womans dress and oh im not afraid of them now that i get a good close look at this bunch they seem pretty much like other folks except maybe that one old dame says cawnt but i cant do the manners stunt i cant get myself to give enough thought to how you ought to hold a teacup  oh those things dont matterthey dont matter besides everybody likes youonly youre so terribly cautious that you never let them see the force and courage and all that wonderful sweet dear goodness thats in you and as for your mannersheaven knows im no p g wodehouse valet but ill teach you all i know  claire i appreciate it a lot but im not so darn sure i want to learn im getting scared i watched that bird named riggs here today hes a regular fellow or he was but now hes simply lost in the shuffle i dont want to be one of the million ghosts in a city seattle is bad enoughits so big that i feel like a noseeum in a norway pine reserve but new york would be a lot worse i dont want to be a mr riggs  yes butim not a mrs riggs  what do you  he did not finish asking her what she meant she was in his arms she was whispering my heart is so lonely and the room was still the low sun flooded the windows swam in the mirror in the hall but they did not heed did not see its gliding glory  not till there was a sound of footsteps did she burst from his arms spring to her reflection in the glass of a picture and shamefacedly murmur to him over her shoulder my hairits a terrible giveaway  he had followed her he stood with his arm circling her shoulder  she begged no please no im frightened letsoh lets have a walk or something before you scamper home  look my dear lets run away and explore the town and not come back till late evening  yes lets  they walked from queen anne hill through the city to the docks there was nothing in their excited childish oh see that and theres a dandy car and ohhhhh thats a minnesota licensewonder who it is to confess that they had been so closely so hungrily together  they swung along a high walk overlooking the city wharf they saw a steamer loading rails and food for the government railroad in alaska they exclaimed over a nest of little tarry fishingboats they watched men working late to unload alaska salmon  they crossed the city to jap town and its writhing streets its dark alleys and stairways lost up the hillsides they smiled at blackeyed children and found a japanese restaurant and tried to dine on raw fish and huge shrimps and roots soaked in a very fair grade of lightmedium motor oil  with milt for guide claire discovered a christianity that was not of candles and shifting lights and insinuating music nor of carpets and large pews and sound oratory but of hoboes blinking in rows and girls in gospel bonnets and little silver and crimson placards of bible texts they stopped on a corner to listen to a pentecostal brother to an i w w speaker to a magnificent negro who boomed in an operatic baritone that the day of judgment was coming on april 11 1923 at three in the morning  in the streets of jap town in cheap motionpicture theaters in hotels for transient workmen she found life running swift and eager and manycolored and it seemed to her that back in the house of fourposters and walls of subdued gray life was smothered in the very best pink cottonbatting milts delight in every picturesque dark corner and the colloquial eloquence of the streetorators stirred her and when she saw a shopgirl caress the hand of a slouching beau in threadbare brown her own hand slipped into milts and clung there  but they came shyly up to the gilson hedge and when milt chuckled bully walk lets do it again she said only oh yes i did like it very much  he had abruptly dropped his beautiful new felt hat he was clutching her arms demanding can you like me oh my god claire i cant play at love im madi just live in you youre my blood and soul can i becomethe kind of man you like  my dear she was fiercely addressing not him alone but the betzes and coreys and gilsons and jeff saxtons dont you forget for one moment that all these peoplehere or brooklyn eitherthat seem so aloof and amused are secretly just plain people with enamel on and youre to have the very best enamel if its worth while im not sure that it is  youre going to kiss me  no please no i donti dont understand us even now cant we be just playmates a while yet buti do like you  she fled when she reached the hall she found her eyelids wet  it was the next afternoon  claire was curled on the embroidered linen counterpane of her bed thinking about chocolates and brooklyn and driving through yellowstone park and corn fritters and satin petticoats versus cr√™pe de chine and mount rainier and milt and spiritualism and manicuring when mrs gilson prowled into her room and demanded busy so casually that claire was suspicious  no not very something up  a nice party come down and meet an amusing man from alaska  claire took her time powdering her nose and ambled downstairs and into the drawingroom to find  jeff saxton mr geoffrey saxton who is the height of brooklyn heights standing by the fireplace smiling at her     chapter xxix  the enemy love   but at second glancewas it jeff this man was tanned to a thick even brown in which his eyes were startlingly white his hands were burned red there was a scar across one of them and he was standing with them cockily at his hips all unlike the sleekly noisily quiet jeff of brooklyn he was in corduroy trousers and belted corduroy jacket with a khakicolored flannel shirt  but his tranquilly commanding smile was jeffs and his lean grace and jeffs familiar amused voice greeted her paralyzed amazement with  hello pard aint i met you some place in montana  wellwhereinthe  just landed from alaska had to run up there from california how are you little princess  his hand was out to her then both hands beseechingly but she did not run to him as she had at flathead lake she stalked him cautiously and shook handsmuch too heartily she sought cover in the wingchair andmuch too cordiallyshe invited  tell me all about it  he was watching her already his old pursuing determination his steady dignity were beginning to frighten her but he calmly dropped into a straight chair and obliged  its really been quite a lively journey didnt know i could like roughingit so well and it was real roughingit pretty much oh not dangerous at all but rather vigorous i had to canoe up three hundred miles of a shallow river with one indian guide making a portage every ten miles or so and we got tipped over in the rapids now and thenthe big chief almost got drowned onceand we camped at night in the original place where they invented mosquitoesand one morning i shot a black bear just in time to keep him from eating my boots  oh she sighed in admiration and oh again uneasily  nothing had been said about it jeff was the last person in the world to spoil his triumph by commenting on it but both of them knew that they had violently changed places that now it was she who was the limp indoordweller and he who was the ruddy ranger that as he had admired her at flathead lake so now it was hers to admire and his to be serenely heroic  she was not far from the worshiping subdeb in her sighing how did you get the scar  that oh nothing  please tell me  really and truly nothing at all just a drunken fellow with a knife playing the fool i didnt have to touch himquite sure he could have given me a frightful beating and all that sort of thing it was the big chief who got rid of him  hecut you with a kniiiiiife ohhhhhhh  she ran to him pityingly stroked the scar looked down at him with filmy eyes then she tried to retreat but he retained her hand glanced up at her as though he knew her every thought she felt weak how could she escape him please she begged flutteringly  if he held her hand another moment she trembled shed be on his lap in his armslost and he was holding it he was  oh he was too old for her yes and too paternal but still life with jeff would be protected kindly honorable  yet all the time she wanted and stormily knew she wanted to be fleeing to the boy milt her mate to run away with him hand in hand discovering all the colored world laughing at life not afraid of losing dignity in fear of jeffs very kindliness and honor she jerked her hand free then she tried to smile like a clever fencer  as she retreated to her chair she stammered did you was alaska interesting  he did not let her go this time easy catlike for all his dry gravity he sauntered after her and with a fine high seriousness pleaded his case  claire dear those few weeks of fighting nature were a revelation to me im going to have lots more of it as it happens they need me there theres plenty of copper but theres big transportation and employment problems that i seem better able to solve than the other chapsthough of course im an absolute muff when it comes to engineering problems but ive had certain training andim going to arrange things so that i get up there at least once a year next summer ill make a much longer tripsee the mountainsoh glorious mountainsand funny halfrussian towns and have some fishing wandering the really big thing even finer than your superb plucky trip through  wasnt plucky im a cry baby she said like a bad contradictory little girl  he didnt argue it he smiled and said tut and placidly catalogued her with youre the pluckiest girl ive ever seen and its all the more amazing because youre not a motionpicture tomboy but essentially exquisite  im a grub  very well then youre a grub so am i and i like it and when i make the big alaskan trip next year i want you to go along claire havent you any idea how terribly close to me the thought of you has been these weeks youve guided me through the wilderness  its im glad she sprang up beseeching jeff dear youre going to stay for tea i must run up and powder my nose  not until you say youre glad to see me child dear weve been ambling along and no you arent a child any more youre a woman and if ive never been quite a man but just a dusty officemachine thats gone now ive got the wind of the wilderness in my lungs man and woman my woman thats all im going to say now but oh my god claire i do need you so  he drew her head to his shoulder and for an instant she rested there but as she looked up she saw coming age in the granulated skin of his throat  he needs mebut hed boss me id be the cunning childwife even at fifty she worried and hang him its like his superiority to beat poor milt even at adventuringand to be such a confounded modest christian gentleman about it  youdyoure so dreadfully managing she sighed aloud  for the first time in all their acquaintanceship jeffs pride broke and he held her away from him while his lips were pathetic and he mourned why do you always try to hurt me  oh my dear i dont  is it because you resent the decent things i have managed to do  i dont understand  if i have an idea for a party you think im managing if i think things out deeply you say im dull  oh you arent i didnt mean  what are you a real woman or one of these flirts that love to tease a man because hes foolish enough to be honestly in love  im nothonestly im not jeff its you dont quite make me its just that im not in love with you i like you and respect you terribly but  im going to make you love me his clutching fingers hurt her arm and somehow she was not angry but stirred but im not going to try now forget the alaskan caveman remember i havent even used the word love ive just chatted about fjords or whatever they are but one of these days no i wont do it i want to stay here in seattle a few days and take you on jolly picnics but would you rather i didnt even do that im he dropped her arm kneaded his forehead with the heel of his palm i cant stand being regarded as a bothersome puppy i cant stand it i cant  please stay jeff well have some darling drives and things well go up rainier as far as we can  he stayed he was anecdotal and amusing at tea that afternoon claire saw how the gilsons and two girls who dropped in admired him that made her uneasy and when mrs gilson begged him to leave his hotel and stay with them he refused with a quick look at claire that hurt her  he wants me to be free hes really so much more considerate than milt and i hurt him even his pride broke down and ive spoiled milts life by meddling and ive hurt the gilsons feelings and im not much of a comfort to father oh im absolutely no good she agonized     chapter xxx  the virtuous plotters   mr geoffrey saxton in alaskan tan and new york evening clothes and piccadilly poise was talking to the eugene gilsons while claire finished dressing for the theater  mrs gilson observed shes the dearest thing weve become awfully fond of her but i dont think she knows what she wants to do with life shes rather at loose ends who is this daggett boysome university studentwhom she seems to like  well since you speak of him i hadnt meant to unless you did i want to be fair to him what did she tell you about him jeff asked confidentially  nothing except that hes a young engineer and frightfully brave and all those uncomfortable virtues and she met him in yellowstone park or somewhere and he saved her from a bearor was it a trampfrom something unnecessary at any rate  eva i dont want to be supercilious but the truth is that this young daggett is a rather dreadful person hes been here at the house hasnt he how did he strike you  not at all hes silent and as dull as lukewarm tea but perfectly inoffensive  then hes cleverer than i thought daggett is anything but dull and inoffensive and if he can play that estimable r√¥le it seems that he is the son of some common workman in the middlewest he isnt an engineer at all hes really a chauffeur or a taxidriver or something and he ran into claire and henry b on the road and somehow insinuated himself into their gracesfar from being silent and commonplace he appears to have some strange kind of charm which jeff sighed i dont understand at all i simply dont understand it  i met him in montana with the most gorgeously atrocious person ive ever encounteredone pinky westlake or some such a namepositively a crook he tried to get boltwood and myself interested in the commonest kind of a mining swindlehinted that we were to join him in cheating the public and this daggett was his partnerthey actually traveled together but i do want to be just im not sure that daggett was aware of his partners dishonesty that isnt what worries me about the lad its his utter impossibility hes as crude as ironore when hes being careful he may manage to be inconspicuous but give him the chance  really im not exaggerating when i say that at thirtyfive hell be dining in his shirtsleeves and sitting down to read the paper with his shoes off and feet up on the table but claireyou know what a dear quixotic soul she isshe fancies that because this fellow repaired a puncture or something of the sort for her on the road shes indebted to him and the worse he is the more she feels that she must help him and affairs of that kind oh its quite too horrible but there have been cases you know where girls as splendid and fine and wellbred as claire herself have been trapped into low marriages by their loyalty to cadging adventurers  oh groaned mrs gilson and good lord lamented mr gilson delighted by the possibility of tragedy and really im not exaggerating said jeff enthusiastically  what are we going to do demanded mrs gilson while mr gilson being of a ready and inventive mind exclaimed by jove you ought to kidnap her and marry her yourself jeff  id like to but im too old  they beautifully assured him that he was a blithe young thing with milk teeth and with a certain satisfaction jeff suggested i tell you what we might do of course its an ancient stunt but its good i judge that daggett hasnt been here at the house much why not have him here so often that claire will awaken to his crudity and get sick of him  well do it thrilled mrs gilson well have him for everything from ninecourse dinners with grandmother eatons napkins on view to milk and cold ham out of the icebox when claire doesnt invite him i will     chapter xxxi  the kitchen intimate   milt had become used to the gilson drawingroom he was no longer uncomfortable in the presence of its sleek fatness though at first not knowing that there were such resources as interior decorators he had been convinced that to have created the room the gilsons must have known everything in the world now he glanced familiarly at its white paneling its sconces like silver candlesticks the inevitable davenport inevitably backed by an amethystshaded piano lamp and a table crowded with silver boxes and pictureframes he liked the winsomeness of light upon velvet and polished wood  it was not the drawingroom but the kitchen that dismayed him  in schoenstrom he had known that there must somewhere be beautiful parlors but he had trusted in his experience of kitchens kitchens according to his philosophy were small smelly rooms of bare floors and provided with one oilclothcovered table one stove the front draft always broken and propped up with the lidlifter one cupboard with panes of tin pierced in rosettes and one stack of dirty dishes  but the gilson kitchen had the efficiency of a laboratory and the superciliousness of a hairdressers booth with awe milt beheld walls of white tiles a cork floor a gasrange large as a hotelstove a ceilinghigh refrigerator of enamel and nickel zinctopped tables and a case of utensils like a surgeons knives it frightened him it made more hopelessly unapproachable than ever the alexandrian luxury of the great gilsons the vanderbilts kitchen must be like this and maybe king georges  he was viewing the kitchen upon the occasion of an intimate sunday evening supper to which he had been yearningly invited by mrs gilson the maids were all out the gilsons and claire milt and jeff saxton shoutingly prepared their own supper while mrs gilson scrambled eggs and made coffee the others set the table and brought cold ham and a bowl of salad from the icebox  milt had intended to be a silent but deft servitor when he had heard that he was to come to supper with the returned mr geoffrey saxton he had first been panicshaken then resolved hed let old ironface saxton do the high and mighty let him stand around and show off his clothes and adjectives way he did at flathead lake but he milt would be on the job hed help get supper and calmly ignore jeffs rudeness  onlyjeff wasnt rude he greeted milt with ah daggett this is so nice and milt had no chance to help it was jeff who anticipated him and with a pleasant let me get thatim kitchenbroke snatched up the cold ham and salad it was jeff who found the supper plates while milt was blunderingly wondering how any one family could use a whole furniturestorefull of different kinds of china it was jeff who sprang to help claire wheel in the teawagon and so captured the chance to speak to her for which milt had been maneuvering these five minutes  when they were settled jeff glowed at him and respectfully offered i thought of you so often daggett on a recent little jaunt of mine youd have been helpful  where was that asked milt suspiciously wondering and waiting to see whether you could take cold ham in your fingers  oh in alaska  inalaska milt was dismayed  yes just a business trip there theres something i wish youd advise me about  he was humble and milt was uneasy he grumbled whats that  ive been wondering whether it would be possible to use wireless telephony in alaska but im such a dub at electricity do you know what would be the cost of installing a wireless telephone plant with a hundredmile radius  gee i dont know  oh so sorry well i wonder if you can tell me about wireless telegraphy then  no i dont know anything about that either  milt had desperately tried to make his answer gracious but somehow he hated this devils obsequiousness more than he had his chilliness at flathead lake he had a feeling that the gilsons had delightedly kicked each other under the table that for all her unchanging smile claire was unhappy and she was so far off a white wraith floating beyond his frantic grasp  it doesnt matter really but i didnt know so youve started in the engineering school at the university of washington saxton was purring have you met gid childers thereson of old senator childerscharming people  ive seen him he has a stutzno his is the mercer sighed milt  he hated himself for it but he couldnt quite keep the awe out of his voice people with mercers  claire seemed to be trying to speak she made a delicate feminine clairesque approximation to clearing her throat but jeff ignored her and with almost osculatory affection continued to milt  do let me know if theres anything i can do to help you were acquainted with two or three of your engineering faculty at the office they write in about various things do you happen to know dr philgren  oh yes say hes a wonder milt was betrayed into exclaiming  yes good chap i believe hes been trying to get a job with us we may give him one just tell him youre a friend of mine and that hes to give you any help he can  milt choked on a thanks  andnow that were just the family here togetherhow goes the financial side can i be of any assistance in introducing you to some engineering firm where you could do a little work on the side you could make quite a little money  so confoundedly affectionate and paternal  milt said irritably thanks but i dont need to do any work ive got plenty of money  how pleasant saxtons voice was smooth as marshmallow youre fortunate i had quite a struggle to get through princeton  wasnt mr gilson contrasting saxtons silk shirt with milts darned cotton covering and in light of that contrast chuckling at milts boast and saxtons modesty milt became overheated his scalp prickled and his shoulderblades were damp as saxton turned from him and crooned to claire more ham honey milt hated himself he was in much of the dramatic but undesirable position of a man in pajamas not very good pajamas who has been locked out in the hotel corridor by the slamming of his door he was in the frame of mind of a mongrel of a real boysdog at a madison square dogshow he had a faint shrewd suspicion of saxtons game but what could he do about it  he felt even more out of place when the family forgot him and talked about people of whom he had never heard  he sat alone on an extremely distant desert isle and ate cold ham and wished he were in schoenstrom  claire had recovered her power of speech she seemed to be trying to bring him into the conversation so that the family might appreciate him  she hesitated and thought with creased brows and brought out uh uh oh oh milt how much is gas selling at now                                       milt left that charming and intimate supperparty at nine he said got to work onon my analytical geometry as though it was a lie and he threw good night at saxton as though he hated his kind good benefactor and when he tried to be gracious to mrs gilson the best he could get out was thanks f inviting me they expansively saw him to the door just as he thought that he had escaped saxton begged oh daggett i was arguing with a chap what color are holsteinfriesian cattle red  black and white milt said eagerly  he heard mrs gilson giggle  he stood on the terrace wiping his forehead and without the least struggle finally and irretrievably admitting that he would never see claire boltwood or any of her friends again notnever                                       he had received from mrs gilson a note inviting him to share their box at the first night of a threenight opera season he had spent half a day in trying to think of a courteously rude way of declining  a straggly little girl came up from the candyshop below his room demanding say are you mr daggett say theres some woman wants to talk to you on our telephone say tell them we aint supposed to be no messengeroffice you aint supposed to call no upstairs people on our telephone we aint supposed to leave the store and go trotting all over town to gee a nickel gee thank you dont mind what ma says shes always kicking  on the telephone he heard claires voice in an agitated milt meet me downtown at the imperial motion picture theater right away something ive got to tell you ill be in the lobby hurry  when he bolted in she was already in the lobby agitatedly looking over a frame of stills she ran to him hooked her fingers in his lapel poured out theyve invited you to the opera i want you to come and put it all over them im almost sure theres a plot they want to show me that you arent used to tiaras and saxophones and creaking dowagers and tulle beat em beat em come to the opera and be awfly aloof and supercilious you can yes you can and be surewear evening clothes now ive got to hurry  bbut  dont disappoint me i depend on you oh say you will  i will  she was gone whisking into the gilson limousine he was in a glow at her loyalty in a tremor of anger at the meddlers  but he had never worn evening clothes  he called it a dresssuit and before the complications of that exotic garb he was flabby with anxiety to milt and to schoenstromto bill mcgolwey even to prof jones and the greasily prosperous heinie rauskuklethe dresssuit was the symbol and proof the indication and manner of sophisticated wealth in schoenstrom even waiters do not wear dresssuits for one thing there arent any waiters there is one waitress at the leipzig house miss annie schweigenblat but you wouldnt expect miss schweigenblat to deal them off the arm in black trousers with braid down the side  no a dresssuit was what the hero wore in the movies and the hero in the movies when he wasnt a cowpuncher was an excaptain of the yale football team and had chambers and a valet you could tell him from the valet because he wasnt so bald it is true that milt had heard that in st cloud there were people who wore dresssuits at parties but then st cloud was a city fifteen or sixteen thousand  how could he get away with a dresssuit how could he keep from feeling foolish in a lowcut vest and what the deuce would he do with the tails did you part em or roll em up when you sat down and wouldnt everybody be able to tell from his foolish look that he didnt belong in one he could hear adt boys and loafers in front of pool rooms whispering look at the piker in the rented soup and fish  for of course hed rent one nobody bought themexcept plutes like henry b boltwood  he agitatedly walked up and down for an hour peering into haberdashery windows looking for a kindfaced young man he found him in ye pall mall toggery shoppe  shoes an openfaced young man who was gazing through the window as sparklingly as though he was thinking of going as a missionary to indiaand liked curry milt ironed out his worried face clumped in demanded fraternally say old man dont some of these gents furnishings stores have kind of little charts that tell just what you wear with dresssuits and prince alberts and everything  you bet said the kindfaced young man  west of chicago you bet means rather and yes indeed and on the whole i should be inclined to fancy that there may be some vestiges of accuracy in your curious opinion and youre a liar but i cant afford to say so  the kindfaced young man brought from behind the counter a beautiful brochure illustrated with photographs of phoebus apollo in what were described as american beauty garmentsneat natty nobby new the center pages faithfully catalogued the ties shirts cufflinks spats boots hats to wear with evening clothes morning clothes riding clothes tennis costumes polite mourning  as he looked it over milt felt that his wardrobe already contained all these gentlemanly possessions  with the aid of the clerk and the chart he purchased a traditionhaunted garment with a platearmor bosom and an opening as crooked as the missouri river a white tie which in his strong red hands looked as silly as a dead fish waistcoat pearl links and studs for the first time except for seizures of madness during two or three visits to minneapolis motor accessory stores he caught the shoppingfever the long shining counter the trim redstained shelves the glittering cases the racks of flaunting ties were beautiful to him and beckoning he revolved a pleasantly clicking rack of ties then turned and fought his way out  he bought pumpswhich cost exactly twice as much as the largest sum which he had allowed himself he bought a newspaper and in the wantcolumns found the advertisement   silberfarb the society tailor       dress suits to rent      snappiest in the city  despite the superlative snappiness of mr silberfarbs dresssuits his establishment was a loft over a delicatessen approached by a splintery stairway along which hung shabby signs announcing the upstairs offices of j l  t j oregan private detectives the zenith spiritualist church messages by rev lulu paughouse the international order of live ones seattle wigwam and mme lavourie sulphur baths the dead air of the hallway suggested petty crookedness milt felt that he ought to fight somebody but there being no one to fight he banged along the flapping boards of the secondfloor hallway to the groundglass door of silberfarb the society tailor who was also as an afterthought on a straggly placard pressng  cleang while u wait  he belligerently shouldered into a low room the light from the one window was almost obscured by racks of mustysmelling black clothes which stretched away from him in two dismal aisles that resembled a morgue of unhappy dead men indecently hung up on hooks on a long clumsily carpentered table a small jew collarless sweaty unshaven was darning trousers under an evil mantle gaslight the jew wrung out his hands and tried to look benevolent  want to rent a dresssuit said milt  i got just the ting for you  the little man unfolded himself galloped down the aisle seized the first garment that came to hand and came back to lay it against milts uncomfortable frame bumbling fine mister fyen  milt studied the shinyseamed wornbuttonholed limp object with dislike its personality was disintegrated the only thing he liked about it was the good garage stink of gasoline  thats almost worn out he growled  at this sacrilege mr silberfarb threw up his hands with the dingy suit flapping in them like a bedquilt shaken from a tenement window he looked milt all over coldly his red but shining eyes hinted that milt was a clodhopper and no honest wearer of evening clothes milt felt humble but he snapped no good want something with class  vell that was good enough for a university professor at the big dance but if you say so  in the manner of one who is being put to an unfair amount of trouble mr silberfarb returned the paranoiac dresssuit to the rack sighing patiently as he laboriously draped it on a hanger he peered and pawed he crowed with throaty triumph and brought back a rich ripe thing of velvet collar and cuffs he fixed milt with eyes that had become as sulky as the eyes of a dog in august dust  now thatyou cant beat that if you vant class and itll fit you like a glove oh thats an ellllegant garment  shaking himself out of the spell of those contemptuous eyes milt opened his brochure studied the chart and in a footnote found never wear velvet collars or cuffs with evening coat  nope nix on the velvet he remarked  then the little man went mad and ran around in circles he flung the ellllegant garment on the table he flapped his arms and wailed what do you vant what do you vannnnt thats a hundredandfiftydollar dresssuit that belonged to one of the richest men in the city he sold it to me because he was going to japan  well you can send it to japan after him i want something decent have you got itor shall i go some place else  the tailor instantly became affectionate how about a nice tuxedo he coaxed  nope it says herelet me seeoh yes here it isit says here in the book that for the theaterwithladies should not wear dinnercoat or socalled tuxedo but  oh dem fellows what writes books they dont know nothing absolute they make it up  huh well i guess ill take my chance on them the factory knows the ignition better n any repairman  vell say youre a hard fellow to please ill give you one of my reserve stock but you got to leave me ten dollars deposit instead of five  mr silberfarb quite cheerfully unlocked a glass case behind the racked and ghostly dead he brought out a suit that seemed to milt almost decent and it almost fitted when after changing clothes in a broiling boiling reeking gasolinepulsing hole behind the racks he examined it before a pierglass but he caught the tailor assisting the fit by bunching up a roll of cloth at the shoulder again milt snapped and again the tailor suffered and died and to a doubting heathen world maintained the true gospel of what do you vannnnt it aint stylish to have the dresssuit too tight all the gents is wearing em loose and graceful but in the end after milt had gone as far as the door mr silberfarb admitted that one dresscoat wouldnt always fit all persons without some alterations  the coat did bag a little and it was too long in the sleeves but as milt studied himself in his roomby placing his small melancholy mirror on the bureau then on a chair then on the floor finally to get a complete view clear out in the hallhe admitted with stirring delight that he looked pretty fair in the bloomin outfit his clear face his shining hair his straight shoulders seemed to go with the costume  he wriggled into his topcoat and marched out of his room theaterbound with the wellfed satisfaction of a man who is certain that no one is giggling look at the handmedowns his pumps did alternately pinch his toes and rub his heels the trousers cramped his waist and he suspected that his tie had gone wandering but he swaggered to the trolley and sat as one rich and famous and very kind to the common people till  another man in evening clothes got on the car and milt saw that he wore a silk hat and a white knitted scarf that he took out and examined a pair of white kid gloves  hed forgotten the hat he was wearing his gray felt he could risk the gloves but the hatthe stovepipeand the chart had said to wear onehe was ruined  he turned up the collar of his topcoat to conceal his white tie tried to hide each of his feet behind the other to cover up his pumps sought to change his expression from that of a superior person in evening clothes to that of a decent fellow in honest regular clothes had the conductor or any of the passengers realized that he was a dub in a dresssuit without the hat  once he thought that the real person in real evening clothes was looking at him he turned his head and bore the probable insult in weak misery  too feeble for anything but thick suffering he was dragged on toward the theater the opera people in silk hatstoward jeff saxton and exposure  but his success in bullying the tailor had taught him that dressing wasnt really a hidden lore to be known only by initiates that some day he too might understand the black and white magic of clothes his bruised selfconsciousness healed ill dosomething he determined he waited vacuously  the gilson party was not in the lobby when he arrived he tore off his topcoat he draped it over his felt hat so that no one could be sure what sort of hat it shamefully concealed that unveiling did expose him to the stare of everybody waiting in the lobby he was convinced that the entire ticketbuying cue was glumly resenting him peeping down at the unusual white glare of his shirtfront he felt naked and indecent nice kind o vest must make em out of old piqu√© collars  he endured his martyrdom till his party arrivedthe gilsons claire jeff saxton and a glittering young woman whose name milt thought was mrs corey  and saxton wasnt wearing a high hat he wore a soft one and he didnt seem to care  milt straightened up followed them through the manifold dangers of the lobby down a perilous aisle of uptilted scornful faces to a red narrow corridor winding stairs a secret passage a mysterious dark closetand he walked out into a room with one side missing and on that side ten trillion people in a well and nine trillion of them staring at him and noticing that hed rented his dresssuit hot about the neck he stumbled over one or two chairs and was permitted to rest in a foolish little gilt chair in the farthest corner  once safe he felt much better except that jeff did put on white kid gloves milt couldnt see that they two looked so different and neither of the two men in the next box wore gloves milt made sure of that comfort he reveled in it he looked at claire and in her loyal smile found ease  he snarled she trusts you forget youre a dub try to be human hang it im no greener at the opera than old horsehair sofa there would be at a garage  there was something what was it he was trying to remember oh yes when hed worked in the schoenstrom flourmill as engineer at eighteen the owner had tried to torment him to get his goat milt put it and milt had found that the one thing that would save him was to smile as though he knew more than he was telling it did not he remembered make any difference whether or not the smile was real if he merely looked the miller up and down and smiled cynically he was let alone  why not  saxton was bending toward him asking in honeyed respectfulness  dont you think that the new school in musicaudible pointillage one might call itmistakes cacophony for power  milt smiled paternally  saxton waited for something more he dug the nail of his right middle finger into his thumb looked thoughtful and attacked again  which do you like better the new italian music or the orthodox german  milt smiled like two uncles watching a clever baby and patronized saxton with they both have their points  he saw that claire was angry but that the gilsons and mrs corey flapeared gapemouthed forwardbending were very proud of their little jeff he saw that except for their clothes and selfconscious coiffures they were exactly like a gang of crackerbox loafers at heinie rauskukles badgering a new boy in town  saxton looked badtempered then mrs corey bustled with her face and yearned at milt do tell me what is the theme of the opera tonight ive rather forgotten  milt ceased to smile while all of them regarded him with interest he said clearly i havent got the slightest idea i dont know anything about music some day i hope i can get a clever woman like you to help me mrs corey it must be great to know all about all these arts the way you do i wish youd explain thatoverture they call it dont they  for some reason mr gilson was snickering mrs corey flushing claire looking well pleased milt had tried to be insulting but had got lost in the intricacies of the insult he felt that hed better leave it in its apparently safe state and he leaned back and smiled again as though he was waiting mrs corey did not explain the overture she hastily explained her second maid to mrs gilson  the opera was il amore dei tre re milt was bewildered to him who had never seen an opera the convention that a girl cannot hear a man who is bellowing ten feet away from her was absurd and he wished that the singers would do something besides making their arms swim  he discovered that by moving his chair forward he could get within a foot of claire his hand slipped across touched hers she darted a startled backward glance her fingers closed tight about his then restlessly snuggled inside his palmand milt was lost in enchantment  stately kings of bloodred cloaks and chrysoberyls malevolent in crowns of ancient and massy goldthe quick dismaying roll of drums and the shadow of passing banners below a towera woman tall and mistyveiled and pale with dreamsa world of spirit where the soul had power over unseen dominionsthis he saw and heard and tasted in the music what the actual plot was or the technique of the singing he did not know but it bore him beyond all reality save the sweet sure happiness of claires nestling hand  he held her fingers so firmly that he could feel the pulse beat in them                                       in the clamminess of his room when the enchantment was gone he said gravely  how much longer can i keep this up sooner or later i bust loose and smash little jeff one in the snoot and he takes the count and im never allowed to see claire again turn the roughneck out on his ear i spose im vulgar i spose that fellow michael in youths encounter wouldnt talk about snoots i dont care ill if i poke saxton one im not afraid of the kidglove precinct any more my brains as good as theirs give it a chance but oh theyre all against me and they bust the athletic unions wrestling rule that striking kicking gouging hairpulling butting and strangling will not be allowed how long can i go on being goodnatured when i do break loose  slowly beneath the moral cuff of his dressshirt milts fist closed in a brown broadknuckled lump and came up in the gesture of a right to the jaw but it came up only a foot the hand opened climbed to milts face rubbed his temples while he sighed  nope cant even do that bigger game now used to couldused to be able to settle things with a punch but ive got to be moreoh more diplomatic now oh lord how lonely i get for bill mcgolwey no that isnt true i couldnt stand bill now claire took all that out of me where am i where am i why did i ever get a car that takes a 36 √ó 6     chapter xxxii  the cornfield aristocrat   it was an innocent little note from jeff saxton a polite humble little note it said that jeff had a card to the astoria club and wouldnt milt please have lunch with him but milt dropped it on the table and he walked round it as though it were a dictagraph which hed discovered in the table drawer after happy happy hidden hours at counterfeiting  it seemed more dangerous to refuse than to go he browned the celebrated new shoes he pressed the distinguished new trousers with a light and quite unsatisfactory flatiron he rereretied his best spotted blue bowit persisted in having the top flaps too short but the retying gave him spiritual strengthand he modestly clumped into the aloof brick portal of the astoria club on time  he had never been in a club before  he looked at the red tiled floor of the entrance hall he stared through the hall into an immense lounge with the largest and softest chairs in the world with oil portraits of distinguished old bucks and ninety per cent of the wealth and power of seattle pulling its several mustaches reading the pi and ignoring the lone intruder out in the hall  a small zulu in blue tights and brass buttons glared at milt and a large soft suave insulting young man demanded yes sir  mr gggeoffrey saxton ventured milt  not in sir the sir sounded like and you know it the flaming guardian retired behind a narrow section of a bookkeepers desk and ignored him  im to meet him for lunch milt forlornly persisted  the young man looked up hurt and annoyed at finding that the person was still to be dealt with  if you will wait in there he groaned  milt sat in there which was a small blue tapestry room with hard chairs intended to discourage billcollectors he turned his hat round and round and round till he saw jeff saxton slim and straight and hard as the stick hooked over his arm sailing into the hall he plunged out after him took refuge with him from the still unconvinced inspection of the hallman for twenty seconds he loved jeff saxton  and jeff seemed to adore him in turn he solicitously led milt to the hatchecking counter he showed milt the lounge and the billiard room through which milt crept with erect shoulders and easy eyes and a heart simply paralyzed with fear that one of these grizzled clubmen with clipped mustaches would look at him he coaxed milt into a grill that was a cross between the chinese throneroom and a viennese weinstube and he implored his friend milt to do him the favor of trying the very fair english mutton chops and potatoes au gratin  i did want to see you again before we go east daggett he said pleasantly  ththanks when do you go  im trying to get miss boltwood to start soon now the season is opening in the east she does like your fine sturdy west as i do but still when we think of the exciting new shows opening and the dances and the touch with the great world oh it does make one eager to get back  thats so risked milt  we uh daggett in fact im going to call you milt as claire does you dont know what a pleasure it has been to have encountered you theres a fine keen courage about you western chaps that makes a cautious old fogy like me envious i shall remember meeting you with a great deal of pleasure  ththanks been pleasure meet you  and i know claire will too  milt felt that he was being dealt with foully he wanted to object to saxtons acting as agent for claire as incompetent irrelevant immaterial and no foundation laid but he could not see just where he was being led and with saxton glowing at him as warmly and greasily as the mutton chops milt could only smile wanly and reflectively feel the table leg to see if it was loose enough to jerk out in case of need  saxton was being optimistic  in fact claire and i both hope that some day when youve finished your engineering course well see you in the east i wonder as i say my dear fellow ive taken the greatest fancy to you and i do hope you wont think im too intimate if i say that i imagine that even in your charming friendship with miss boltwood youve probably never learned what important people the boltwoods are i thought id tell you so that you could realize the privilege both you and i have in knowing them henry b iswhile not a man of any enormous wealthregarded as one of the keenest intellects in new york wholesale circles but beyond that he is a scholar and a man of the broadest interests of course the boltwoods are too modest to speak of it but he was chiefly instrumental in the establishment of the famous brooklyn symphony orchestra and his ancestors clear throughhis father was a federal judge and his mothers brother was a general in the civil war and afterwards an ambassador so you can guess something of the position claire holds in that fine quiet solid old brooklyn set henry ward beecher himself was complimented at being asked to dine with the boltwoods of his day and  no the table leg wouldnt come loose so it was only verbally that the suddenly recovered milt attacked  certainly is nice to have one of those old families its something like as you say you and i have gotten pretty well acquainted along the line so i guess i can say it to you my father and his folks came from that same kind of family fathers dad was a judge back in maine and in the war granddad was quite friendly with grant  this tribute of milt to his grandsire was loyal but inaccurate judge daggett who wasnt a judge at all but a j p had seen general grant only once and at the time the judge had been in company with all the other privates in the fourteenth maine  dad was a pioneer he was a doctor he had to give up all this easygoing stuff in order to help open up the west to civilization but i guess it was worth it he used to do the hardest kind of operations on kitchen tables with his driver giving the chloroform im mighty proud of him as you say its kind of what you might call inspiring to belong to the old pilgrim aristocracy  never before had milt claimed relation to a group regarding which his only knowledge was the information derived from the red schoolhistory to the effect that they all carried blunderbusses put people in the stocks for whistling and frequently said why dont you speak for yourself john but he had made his boast with a clear eye and a pleasant superior calm smile  oh very interesting grunted saxton  would you like to see grandfathers daguerreotype  oh yes yes uh thanks that would be very interesting do let me see it when uh as i was saying claire doubtless has a tremendous social career before her so many people expecting her to marry well of course she has a rather unusual combination of charm and intelligence and in fact i think we may both be glad that  yes thats right and the best thing about her is the way she can shake off all the social stuff and go camping and be a regular human being milt caressed  um uh no doubt no doubt though of course though that isnt an inherent part of her i fancy shes been rather tired by this long trip poor child of course she isnt very strong  thats right real pluck and of course shell get stronger by hiking youve never seen her bucking a dangerous hilli kind of feel that a person who hasnt seen her in the wilds doesnt know her  i dont want to be contradictory old man but i feel on the other hand that no one who has failed to see her at the junior league dances in a poiret frock can know her come come dont know how we drifted into this chorus of praise of claire what i wanted to ask was your opinion of the piercearrow im thinking of buying one do you think that  all the way home milt exulted i put it all over him i wasnt scared by the dont butt into the aristocracy my young friend stuff i lied handsome but darn it now ill have to live up to my new england aristocracy wonder if my granddads dad was a hired man or a woodsawyer ne mine im daggett of daggett from now on he bounded up to his room vaingloriously remarking im there with the ancestors i was brought up in the handsome city of schoenstrom which was founded by a colony of vermont yankees headed by herman skumautz i was never allowed to play with the dutch kids and he opened the door the schoenstrom minister taught me greek and was my bosom frien  he stopped with his heart in his ankles lolling on the bed grinning waving a cigarette was bill mcgolwey proprietor of the old home lunch of schoenstrom minnesota  wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhy where the heck did you come from stammered the deposed aristocrat to his bosom friend bill  you old lemonpiefaced lollygagging flapfooted crabnosed son of misery gee but its good to see you milt  bill was off the bed wringing milts hand with simple joy with perfect faith that in finding his friend all the troubles of life were over and milt was gloomily discovering the art of diplomacy bill was his friend yes but  it was hard enough to carry his own self  he pictured jeff saxton leering at the door and while he pounded bills shoulder and called him the name which west of chicago is the token of hatred and of extreme gladness at meeting he discovered that some one had stolen his stomach and left a piece of ice in its place  they settled down on bed and chair bills ears red with joy while milt demanded  how the deuce did you get here  well tell you old hoss schoenstrom got so darn lonely after you left and when ben and heinie got your address and bought the garage thinks i lez go off on a little bum  milt was realizingand hating himself for realizingthat bills face was dirty his hair linty the bottoms of his trousers frayed masses of mud while bill chuckled  i figured out maybe i could get a job here in a restaurant and you and me could room together i sold out my good will in the old home lunch for a hundred bucks i was going to travel swell riding the cushions but pete swanson wanted me to go down to the cities first and we run into some pretty swift travelers in minneapolis and a couple of girlssaaaaaaay kid some class  bill winked and miltmilt was rather sick he knew bills conception of class in young women was this the fellow he had liked so well these the ideas which a few months ago he had taken as natural and extremely amusing  and i got held up in an alley off washington avenue and they got the last twenty bones offn me and i was flatter n a pancake so i says ish kabibble and i sneaks onto the blind baggage and bums my way west youd a died laughing to seen me throwing my feet for grub oh im some panhandler there was one frau sicked her dog onto me and i kicked him in the jaw and oh it was one swell hike  milt was trying to ignore the voice that was raging and now he expects to live on me after throwing his own money away the waster the hobo hell expect to meet claire id kill him before id let him soil her by looking at her him and his classy girls milt tried to hear only the other inner voice which informed him he looks at you so trustingly hed give you his shirt if you needed itand he wouldnt make you ask for it  milt tried to be hearty whatre you going to do old kid  well the first thing im going to do is to borrow ten ironmen and a pair of pants  you bet here she is havent got any extra pants tell you heres another five and you can get the pants at the store in the next block this side of the street hustle along now and get em he chuckled at bill he patted his arm he sought to hurry him out he had to be alone to think  but bill kissed the fifteen dollars carelessly rammed it into his pocket crawled back on the bed yawned whats the rush gosh im sleepy say milt whadyuh think of me and you starting a lunchroom here together you got enough money out of the garage  oh no noooo gee id like to bill but you see well ive got to hold onto what little ive got so i can get through engineering school  sure but you could cash in on a restaurantyou could work evenings in the dump and thered be a lot of city sports hanging around and wed have the time of our lives  no i i study evenings and i the fact is bill ive met a lot of nice fellows at the university and i kind of go around with them  aw how dyou get that way rats you dont want to go tagging after them willyboys damn dirty snobs and the girls are worse i tell you milt these hooptedoodle society janes may look all right to hicks like us but on the side they raise more hell than any milliners trimmer from chi that ever vamped a rube burg  what do you know about them  now dont get sore im telling you i dont like to see any friend of mine make a fool of himself hanging around with a bunch that despises him because he aint rich thats all met any of the hightoned skirts  yesihave  trot em up and lemme give em the onceover  wewell see about it now i got to go to a mathematics recitation bill you make yourself comfortable and ill be back at five  milt did not have to go to a recitation he marched out with briskness in his step and a book under his arm but when he reached the corner the briskness proved to be spurious and the mathematics book proved to be william rose ben√©ts merchants of cathay which claire had given him in the yellowstone and which he had rescued from the wrecked bug  he stood staring at it he opened it with unhappy tenderness he had been snatched from the world of beautiful words and serene dignity of soaring mountains and companionship with claire in the radiant morning back to the mud and dust of schoenstrom from the opera to city sports in a lunchroom he hated bill mcgolwey and his sneering assumption that milt belonged in the filth with him and he hated himself for not being enough of a genius to combine bill mcgolwey and claire boltwood but not once in his maelstrom of worry on that street corner did he expect claire to like bill through all his youthful agonizing he had enough common sense to know that though claire might conquer a mountain pass she could never be equal to the social demands of schoenstrom and bill mcgolwey  he wandered for an hour and came back to find that in a dry city which he had never seen before the crafty bill had obtained a quart of bourbon and was in a state of unsteady beatitude he wanted he announced to dance  milt got him into the community bathtub and soused him under but bills wet body was slippery and bills merry soul was all for frolicsome gamboling and he slid out of milts grasp he sloshed around in the tub he sprinkled milts sacred good suit with soapy water and escaped and in the costume of adam he danced orientally in milts room till he was seized with sleepiness and cosmic grief and retired to milts bed in tears and nothing else  the room dimmed grew dark the street lamps outside sent a wan wavery gleam into the room evening crowds went by and in a motionpicture theater a banging piano struck up bill breathed in choking snorts milt sat unmoving feeling very old very tired too dumbly unhappy to be frightened of the dreadful coming hour when claire and jeff should hear of bill and discover milts real world  he was not so romantically loyal not so inhumanly heroic that it can truthfully be reported that he never thought of getting rid of bill he did think of it again and again but always he was touched by bills unsuspecting trust and shook his head and sank again into the fog  what was the use of trying to go ahead wasnt he after all merely a bill mcgolwey himself  if he was he wouldnt inflict himself on claire  for several minutes he gave up forever the zest of climbing  when bill awoke brightly solicitous about the rest of the quart of bourbon and bouncingly ready to go out and have a time milt loafed about the streets with him showing him the city he dully cut his classes next morning and took bill to the wharves  it was late in the afternoon when they were lounging in the room and bill was admiring his new pantshe boasted of having bought them for three dollars and pointed out that milt had been a galoot to spend ten dollars for shoesthat some one knocked at the door sleepily expectant of his landlady milt opened it on miss claire boltwood mr and mrs eugene gilson and mr geoffrey saxton  saxton calmly looked past him at bill smiled slightly and condescended i thought we ought to call on you so weve dropped in to beg for tea  bill had stopped midway in scratching his head to gape at claire claire returned the look stared at bills frowsy hair his red wrists his wrinkled greasestained coat his expression of impertinent stupidity then she glanced questioningly at milt who choked  oh yes yes sure glad see you come in get some tea so glad see you come in     chapter xxxiii  toothmug tea   my friend mr mcgolweyi knew him in schoenstromcome on to seattle for a while bill these are some people i met along the road milt grumbled  glad to meet em have a chair have two chairs say milt yought to have more chairs if youre going to have a bunch of swells coming to call on you ha ha ha say i guess i better pike out and give the folks a chance to chin with you bill fondly offered  oh sit down milt snapped at him  they all sat down four on the bed and milts inner ear heard a mute snicker from the gilsons and saxton he tried to talk he couldnt bill looked at him and perceiving the dumbness gallantly helped out  so you met the kid on the road eh good scout milt is we always used to say at schoenstrom that he was the best darn hand at fixing a flivver in seven townships  so you knew mr daggett at home now isnt that nice said mrs gilson  knew him saaaaay milt and i was brung up together why him and i have bummed around together and worked on farms summers and fished for bullheads ever catch a bullhead damnedest slipperiest fish you ever saw and got horns that sting the stuffins out of you and say i wonder if milts told you about the time we had at a barndance once there was a bunch of hicks there and i says say kid lez puncture their tires and hide back of the manure pile and watch the fun when they come out i guess maybe i was kind of stewed a little tell the truth but course milt he dont drink much hardly at all nice straight kid if i do say so  bill milt ordered we must have some tea heres sixbits you run down to the corner grocery and get some tea and a little cream oh you better buy threefour cups too hustle now son  attaboy yours to command ladies and gents like the fellow says bill boomed delightedly he winked at jeff saxton airily spun his broken hat on his dirty forefinger and sauntered out  charming fellow a real original crooned mrs gilson  did he know your friend mr pinky asked saxton  before milt could answer claire rose from the bed inspected the gilsons and jeff with cold dislike and said quietly to milt the poor dear thinghe was dreadfully embarrassed its so good of you to be nice to him i believe in being loyal to your old friends  oh so do i babbled mrs gilson its just too splendid and we must do something for him im going to invite mr daggett and mrmr mcgollups was itto dinner this evening i do want to hear him tell about your boyhood it must have been so interesting  it was mused milt it was poor and miserable we had to work hardwe had to fight for whatever education we gotwe had no one to teach us courtesy  oh now with your fine old doctor father surely he was an inspiration jeff didnt this time trouble to hide the sneer  yes he was he gave up the chance to be a rich loafer in order to save farmers babies for fees that he never got  im sure he did i wish id known him we need to know men like that in this pinkfrosting playing at living we have in cities claire said sweetlynot to milt but to jeff  mrs gilson had ignored them waiting with the patience of a cat at a mousehole and she went on but you havent said youd come this evening do say you will i dont suppose mr mcgollups will care to dress for dinner  with saccharin devotion milt yearned back no mrs gilson no mr mcgolwey wont care to dress hes eccentric  but youll make him come  milt was tactfully beginning to refuse when gene gilson at last exploded turned purple covered his dripping toored lips with his handkerchief  then abruptly milt hurled at mrs gilson all right well come billll be awfully funny hes never been out of a jerkwater burg in his life hardly hes an amusing cuss he thinks im smart he loves me like a dog oh hes rich ha ha ha  milt might have gone on  if he had mr and mrs gilson would have gone away much displeased but bill arrived with some of the worst tea in the world and four cups tastefully done in cupids heads and much gilt  milt made tea ignoring them while bill entertained the gilsons and saxtons with rabelaisian stories of threshingtime when shirts prickly with chaff and gritty with dust stuck to sweatdripping backs of the funny thing of milt and bill being hired to move a garbagepile and swiping their employers mushmelons of knotting shirts at the swimminghole so that the bawling youngsters had to chaw beef of drinking beer in the liverystable at melrose of dropping the waterpitcher from a st klopstock hotel window upon the head of the constabule and escaping from him across the leanto roof  mrs gilson encouraged him bill sat with almost closed eyes glorying in the saga of smalltown life saxton and gilson did not conceal their contemptuous grins  but claire after nervously rubbing the tips of her thumbs with flickering agitated fingers she had paid no attention to bill and the revelation of milts rustic life she had quietly gone to milt to help him prepare the scanty tea  she whispered never mind dear i dont care it was all twice as much fun as being wheeled in lacy prams by cranky nurses as jeff and i were but i know how you feel are you ashamed of having been a prairie pirate  no im not we were wild kidswe raised a lot of cainbut im glad we did  so am i i couldnt stand it if you were ashamed listen to me and remember little claires words of wisdom these fools are tryingoh theyre so obvioustheyre trying to make me feel that the prim miss boltwood of brooklyn heights is a stranger to you well theyre succeeding in making me a strangerto them  claire dear you dont mind bill  yes i do and so do you youve grown away from him  i dont know but today has been quite a test  yes it has because if i can stand your friend mr mcgolwey  then you do care  perhaps and if i think that hes oh not much good and i remember that for a long time you just had him to play with then im all the more anxious to make it up to you  dont be sorry for me i cant stand that after all it was a good town and good folks  no no im not sorry for you i just mean you couldnt have had so terribly much fun after you were eighteen or so schoenstrom must have been a little dull after very many years there this stuff about the charm of backwoods villagesthe people that write it seem to take jolly good care to stay in long island suburbs  claire he was whispering desperately the teas most done oh my dear im crazy with this puttering around trying to woo you and having to woo the entire gilson tribe lets run away  no first im going to convince them that you arewhat i know you are  but you cant  huh you wait ive thought of the most beautiful beastly cruel plan for the reduction of social obesity  then she was jauntily announcing tea my dears jeff you get the toothmug isnt this jolly  yes oh yes very jolly jeff was thoroughly patronizing but she didnt look offended she made them drink the acid tea and taste the chalklike bread and butter sandwiches she coaxed bill to go on with his stories and when the persistent mrs gilson again asked the pariahs to come to dinner claire astonished milt and still more astonished mrs gilson by begging oh yes please do come milt  he consented savagely  but first claire added to mrs gilson i want us to take the boys to oh i have the bulliest idea come everybody were going riding  uh where hinted mr gilson  thats my secret come  claire pranced to the door herded all of them down to the limousine whispered an address to the chauffeur  milt didnt care much for that ride bill was somewhat too evidently not accustomed to limousines he wiped his shoes caked with red mud upon the seatcushions and apologized perspiringly he said gee whillikens thats a dandy idee telephone to bawl the shuffer out with and are them flowers real the bokay in the vase  but the gilsons and jeff saxton were happy about it alltill the car turned from a main thoroughfare upon a muddy street of shacks that clung like goats to the sides of a high cut a street unchanged from the pioneer days of seattle  good heavens claire you arent taking us to see aunt hatty are you wailed mrs gilson  oh yes indeed i knew the boys would like to meet her  no really i dont think  eva my soul jeff and you planned our tea party today and assured me id be so interested in milts bachelor apartment by the way id been up there already so it wasnt entirely a surprise its my turn to lead she confided to milt dear old aunt hatty is related to all of us shes genes aunt and my fourth cousin and i think shes distantly related to jeff she came west early and had a hard time but shes real brooklyn heightsand she belongs to gramercy park and north washington square and rittenhouse square and back bay too though she has got out of touch a little so i wanted you to meet her  milt wondered what unperceived bag of cement had hardened the faces of saxton and the gilsons  silent save for polite observations of claire upon tight skirts and lumbering the merry company reached the foot of a lurching flight of steps that scrambled up a clay bank to a cottage like a hen that has set too long milt noticed that mrs gilson made efforts to remain in the limousine when it stopped and he caught gilsons mutter to his wife no its claires turn be a sport eva  claire led them up the badly listed steps to an unpainted porch on which sat a little old lady very neat very respectable very interested and reflectively holding in one ivory hand a dainty handkerchief and a black clay pipe  hello claire my dear youve broken the relatives recordyouve called twice in less than a year said the little old lady  how do you do aunt harriet remarked mrs gilson with great lack of warmth  hello eva sit down on the edge of the porch those chickens have made it awful dirty though havent they bring out some chairs theres two chairs that dont go down under youoften aunt harriet was very cheerful  the group lugubriously settled in a circle upon an assemblage of windbroken red velvet chairs and wooden stools they resembled the aftermath of a funeral on a damp day  claire was the cheerful undertaker mrs gilson the griefstricken widow  claire waved at milt and conversed with aunt hatty in a high brisk voice this is the nice boy i met on the road that i think i told you about cousin hatty  the little old lady screwed up the delicate skin about her eyes examined milt and cackled boy theres something wrong here you dont belong with my family why you look like an american you havent got an imitation monocle and i bet you cant talk with a new yorklondon accent why claire im ashamed of you for bringing a human being into the boltwoodgilsonsaxton tomb and expecting  then was the smile of mrs gilson lost forever it was simultaneously torpedoed mined scuttled and bombed it went to the bottom without a ripple while mrs gilson snapped aunt hatty please dont be vulgar  me croaked the little old lady she puffed at her pipe and dropped her elbows on her knees my aint it hard to please some folks  cousin hatty i want milt to know about our families i love the dear old stories claire begged prettily  mrs gilson snarled claire really  oh do shut up eva and dont be so bossy yelped the dear little old lady in sudden and dismaying rage ill talk if i want to have they been bullying you claire or your boy i tell you boy these families are fierce i was brought up in brooklynwent through all the schoolsused to be able to misplay the piano and mispronounce french with the best of em then genes pa and i came west togetherhe had an idea hed get rich robbing the injuns of their land and we went broke i took in washing i learned a lot i learned a gilson was just the same common stuff as a redshirt miner when he was up against it but genes pa succeededthere was something about practically stealing a fur schoonerbut i never was one to tattle on my kin anyway by the time gene come along his pa was rich and that means aristocratic  this aristocracy west of pittsburgh is just twice as bad as the snobbery in boston or new york because back there the families have had their wealth long enoughsome of em got it by stealing real estate in 1820 and some by selling jamaica rum and niggers way back before the revolutionary wartheyve been respectable so long that they know mighty well and good that nobody except a britisher is going to question their blue bloodand oh my what good blueing thirdgeneration money does make but out here in gods country the marquises of milling and the barons of beef are still uneasy even their pretty women after going to the best hairdressers and patronizing the best charities sometimes get scared lest somebody think they havent either brains or breeding  so theyre nasty to all low pussons like you and me to make sure we understand how important they are but lands i know em boy im kept pensioned up here out of the way but i read the social notes in the papers and i chuckle when theres a big reception and i read about mrs vogelands pearls and her beautiful daughterinlaw i remember how she used to run a boardinghouse for miners  well i guess its just as shoddy in the east if you go far enough back claire youre a nice comforting body and i hate to say it but the truth is your greatgrandfather was an hostler and made his first money betting on horses now my i oughtnt to tell that do you mind dearie  not a bit isnt it delightful that this is such a democratic country with no castes said claire  at this the first break in the little old ladys undammable flood mrs gilson sprang up yammering the rest of you may stay as long as you like but if im to be home in time to dress for dinner  yes and i must be going babbled saxton  milt noted that his lower lip showed white toothmarks  it must be admitted that all of them rather ignored the little old lady for a moment milt was apologetically hinting i dont really think bill and id better come to dinner this evening mrs gilson thanks a lot but its kind of sudden  claire again took charge not at all milt of course youre coming it was eva herself who invited you im sure shell be delighted  charmed said mrs gilson with the expression of one who has swallowed castor oil and doubts the unity of the universe  there was a lack of ease about the farewells to aunt harriet as they all turned away she beckoned milt and murmured did i raise the dickens i tried to its the only solace besides smoking that a moral old lady can allow herself after she gets to be eightytwo and begins to doubt everything they used to teach her come and see me boy now get out and boy beat up gene gilson dont be scared of his wifes hoitytoity ways just sail in  i will said milt  he had one more surprise before he reached the limousine  bill mcgolwey who had sat listening to everything and scratching his cheek in a puzzled way seized milts sleeve and rumbled  goodby old hoss im not going to butt in on your game and get you in dutch gosh i never supposed you had enough class to mingle with elittys like this gang but i know when im in wrong you were too darn decent to kick me out do it myself youre best friend i ever had and good luck old man god bless you  bill was gone running stumbling fleeing past aunt harriets cottage off into a sandy hilltop vacancy the last milt saw of him was when on the skyline bill stopped for a glance back and seemed to be digging his knuckles into his eyes  then milt turned resolutely marched down the stairs said to his hosts with a curious quietness thank you for asking me to dinner but im afraid i cant come claire will you walk a few blocks with me  during the half minute it had taken to descend the steps milt had reflected with an intensity which forgot bill that he had been selfish that he had thought only of the opinion of these nice people regarding himself instead of understanding that it was his duty to save claire from their enervating niceness not that he phrased it quite in this way what he had been muttering was  rotten shameme so scared of folks clothes that i dont stand up to em and keep em from smothering claire lord it would be awful if she settled down to being a mrs jeff saxton got to save hernot for myselffor her  it may have been aunt harriet it may have been milts resolution but mrs gilson answered almost meekly well if you think would you like to walk claire  as he tramped off with claire milt demanded glad to escape  yes and im glad you refused dinner it really has been wearing this trial by food  this is the last time ill dare to meet the gilsons  and ill have to be going back east i hope the gilsons will forgive me some day  im afraid you didnt win them over by aunt hatty  no theyre probably off me for life oh these horrible social complicationsworse than any real dangerfire or earthquake  oh these complicationsthey dont exist we just make em like we make rules for a card game what the deuce do we care about the opinions of people we dont like and who appointed these people to a fixed social position did the president make saxton high cockalorum of dresssuits or something why these are just folks the same as kings and coalheavers theres no army weve got to fight theres just you and meyou and iand if we stick together then we have all society we are all society  yees but milt dear i dont want to be an outcast  you wont be in the long run if you dont take these aristocrats seriously theyll be all the more impressed by you  no that sounds cheering in stories and these optimistic editorials in the magazines but it isnt true and you dont know how pleasant it is to be in ive always been more or less on the inside and thought outsiders dreadful but oh i dont care i dont care with youim happy thats all i know and all i want to know ive just grown up ive just learned the greatest wisdomto know when im happy but milt dear i say this because i love you yes i do love you no dont kiss me yes it is too its far too public and i want to talk seriously you cant have any idea how strong social distinctions are dont despise them just because you dont know them  no i wont ill learn probably america will get into the war ill be an engineering officer ill learn this social dope from the collegeboy officers and ill come to brooklyn with shoulderstraps and bells on and will you be waiting  ohyes but milt if the war comes you must be very careful not to get shot  all right if you insist good lord claire i dont know what put it into my head but do you realize that a miracle has happened were no longer miss boltwood and a fellow named daggett we have been even when weve liked each other up to today always theres been a kind of fence between us we had to explain and defend ourselves and scrap but now were us and the rest of the world has disappeared and  and nothing else matters said claire     chapter xxxiv  the beginning of a story   it was the farewell to claire and jeff saxton a picnic in the cascades near snoqualmie fallsa decent and decidedly miltless fiesta mrs gilson was going to show claire that they were just as hardy adventurers as that horrid daggett person so she didnt take the limousine but merely the sevenpassenger locomobile with the special body  they were ever so rough and wild they had no maid the chauffeur was absolutely the only help to the gilsons claire jeff and the temporarily and ejaculatorily natureloving mrs betz in the daring task of setting out two folding camptables covering them with a linen cloth and opening the picnic basket claire had to admit that she wished that she could steal the picnic basket for milt there were vacuum bottles of hot coffee there were sandwiches of anchovy and pat√© de foie gras there were cream cakes with almonds hidden in the suave cream and there was a chicken salad with huge chunks of pure white meat wallowing in a sea of mayonnaise  when the gorging was done and the cigarettes brought out the chauffeur passed a spirit lamp they stretched on rubber blankets and groaned a little and spoke well of nature and the delights of roughing it  what is it whats wrong theyre sooh so polite they dont mean what they say and they dont dare to say what they mean is that it worried claire  she started she discovered that she was looking at a bristle of ropecolored hair and a grin projected from the shelter of a manzanita bush  for the she gasped she was too startled to be able to decide what was forthe she spoke judiciously to jeff saxton about upper montclair the subway and tennis she rose to examine the mountains strolled away darted down a gully and pounced on milt daggett with  how in heavens name  found out where youall were going look got a bug rented it come on lets duck drive back with me at the end of the gully was a new teal bug shinier than the ancient lost chariot but equally gay and uncomfortable  cant like to but be awfully rude to them wont do thatnot more than is good for their soulseven for you now dont be sulky  i wont nev be sulky again because youre crazy about me and i dont have to be sulky  oh i am am i good heavens the inconceivable conceit of the child  she turned her back he darted to her caught her hands behind her kissed her hair and whispered you are  i am not  well then youre not lord youre sweet your hair smells like cinnamon and clean kittens youd rather go bumping off in my flivver than sailing in that big loco theyve got there  yes defiantly i would and im ashamed of myself im a throwback to my horrid ancestor the betting hostler  probably im a throwback to my ancestor the judge ill train you to meet my fine friends  welluponmywordi oh do stop being idiotic we talk like children you reduce me to the rank of a gibbering schoolgirl and i like it its sooh i dont knowso darn human i suppose now hurrykiss me and get out before they suspect  listen  yes  ill accidentally meet your car along the road invite you to ride all right  yes do oh we are two forlorn babes in the woods gby  she sauntered back to the picnic and observed what is that purple flower up on the mountain side  the big car was sedately purring back when it was insulted by an intermediate host of a machine that came jumping out of a side road the vulgar driver hailed them with uncouth howling the gilsons chauffeur stopped annoyed  why hello folks bawled the social bandit  oh how do you do refuted mrs gilson  jeff saxton turned a ripe purple  how do you like my new bug claire awful little object but i can make fifty an hour come and try it claire cant you  why claire was obviously shocked by the impropriety of the suggestion she looked at mrs gilson who was breathing as though she was just going under the ether claire said doubtfully well if you can get me right back to the house  sure agreed milt  when the loco was gone milt drove the bug to the side of the road yanked up the emergency brake and carefully kissed the girl who was snuggled down into the absurd low tinsided seat  do we have to get back soon he begged  oh i dont care if we never get back lets shoot up into the mountains side road lets pretend were driving across the continent again  firs dashing byrocks in the sunshineclouds jaunty beyond the inviting mouth of a mountain passeven the ruts and bumps and culvertsshe seemed a part of them all in the gilsons huge cars she had been shut off from the road but in this tiny bug so close to earth she recovered the feeling of struggle of triumph over difficulties of freedom unbounded and she could be herself good or bad ignorant or wise with this boy beside her all of which she expressed in the most eloquent speech she had ever uttered namely  oh milt  and to herself golly its such a relief not to have to try to be gracious and aphoristic and repartistic and everything with jeff  and but i wonder if i am aphoristic and subtle i wonder if when she gets the ricepowder off claire isnt a lot more like milt than she thought  and aloud again oh this is  yump it sure is milt agreed  they had turned from a sideroad into a sidesideroad they crossed an upland valley the fall rains had flooded a creek till it had cut across the road washed through the thin gravel left across the road a shallow violent stream milt stopped abruptly at its margin  heres where we turn back i guess he sighed  oh no cant we get across its only a couple of feet deep and gravel bottom insisted the restored adventurer  yes but look at the steep bank never get up it  i dont care lets try it we can woggle around and dig it out somehow i bet you twobits we can said the delicate young woman whom mrs gilson was protecting  all right in she goes  the bug went inshot over the bank dipped down till the little hood sloped below them as though they were looping the loop struck the rushing water with a splash which hurled yellow drops over claires rose jersey suit lumbered ahead struck the farther bank pawed at it feebly rose two inches slipped back and sat there with the gurgling water all around it turned into a motorboat  no can do grunted milt scared  nope love it this is a real campthe brush on the bank and the streamlisten to it chuckle under the runningboard  do you like to camp with me  love it  say gee never thought claire got your transportation back east  my ticket yes why  well im sure you can turn it in and get a refund so thats all right  are you going to let me in on the secret  oh yes mights well i was just wondering i dont think much of wasting all our youth waiting twothree years in engineering school and maybe going to war and starting in on an engineering job and me lonely as a turkey in a chicken yard and you doing the faithful young lady in brooklyn i think perhaps we might get married tomorrow and  good heavens what do you  do you want to go back to brooklyn gilsonses  no but  dear cant we be crazy once while were youngsters  dont bombard me so let me think one must be practical even in craziness  i am i have over a thousand dollars from the garage and i can work eveningsas dear jeff suggested wed have a twobyfour flat claire  oh let me think i suppose i could go to the university too and learn a little about food and babies and building houses and government i need to go to school a lot more than you do besides auction and the pianowhich i play very badlyand clothes and how to get hold of tickets for successful plays i dont know one single thing  will you marry me tomorrow  well uh  think of mrs gilsons face when she learns it and saxton and that mrs betz  it was to no spoken sentence but to her kiss that she added providing we ever get the car out of this river that is  oh my dear my dear and all the romantic ways i was going to propose i had the best line about roses and stars and angels and everything  they always use those but nobody ever proposed to me in a bug in a flood before oh milt life is fun i never knew it till you kidnapped me if you kiss me again like that well both topple overboard by the way can we get the car out  i think so if we put on the chains well have to take off our shoes and stockings  shyly turning from him a little she stripped off her stockings and pumps while he changed from a flivverdriver into a young viking with bare white neck pale hair ruffled about his head trousers rolled up above his straight kneesa young seaman of the crew of eric the red  they swung out on the runningboard now awash with slight squeals they dropped into the cold stream dripping laughing his clothes clinging to him he ducked down behind the car to get the jack under the back axle and with the water gurgling about her and splashing its exhilarating coldness into her face she stooped beside him to yank the stiff new chains over the rear wheels  they climbed back into the car joyously raffish as a pair of gipsies she wiped a dab of mud from her cheek and remarked with an earnestness and a naturalness which that jeff saxton who knew her so well would never have recognized as hers  gee i hope the old bird crawls out now  milt let in the reverse raced the engine started backward with a burst of muddy water churned up by the whirling wheels they struck the bank sickeningly hung there for two seconds began to crawl up up with a feeling that at any second they would drop back again  then instantly they were out on the shore and it was absurd to think that they had ever been boating down there in the stream they washed each others muddy faces and laughed a great deal and rubbed their legs with their stockings and resumed something of a dull and civilized aspect and singing sentimental ballads turned back found another road and started toward a peak  i wonder what lies beyond the top of this climb said claire  more mountains and more and more and were going to keep on climbing them forever at dawn well still be going on and thats our life  yees providing we can still buy gas  lord thats so  speaking of which did you know that i have a tiny bit of moneyits about five thousand dollarsof my own  but that makes it impossible young tramp marrying lady of huge wealth  no you dont ive accepted you do you think im going to lose the one real playmate ive ever had it was so lonely on the boltwoods brown stoop till milt came along and whistled impertinently and made the solemn little girl in frills play marbles and watch out for that turn heavens how i have to look after you is there a class in cooking at your university

not without quarrels and barren hours not free from ignorance and the discomfort of finding that between the mountain peaks they must for long gray periods dwell in the dusty valleys they yet start their drama with the distinction of being able to laugh together with the advantage of having discovered that neither schoenstrom nor brooklyn heights is quite all of life with the cosmic importance
