19071850	a little tour in france  by henry james     we good americans  i say it without presumption  are too apt to think that france is paris just as we are accused of being too apt to think that paris is the celestial city  this is by no means the case fortun ately for those persons who take an interest in modern gaul and yet are still left vaguely unsatisfied by that epitome of civilization which stretches from the arc de triomphe to the gymnase theatre  it had already been intimated to the author of these light pages that there are many good things in the doux pays de france of which you get no hint in a walk between those ornaments of the capital but the truth had been re vealed only in quickflashing glimpses and he was conscious of a desire to look it well in the face  to this end he started one rainy morning in midseptem ber for the charming little city of tours from which point it seemed possible to make a variety of fruitful excursions  his excursions resolved themselves ulti mately into a journey through several provinces  a journey which had its dull moments as one may defy any journey not to have but which enabled him to feel that his proposition was demonstrated  france may be paris but paris is not france that was perfectly evident on the return to the capital  i must not speak however as if i had discovered the provinces  they were discovered or at least re vealed by baizac if by any one and are now easily accessible to visitors  it is true i met no visitors or only one or two whom it was pleasant to meet throughout my little tour i was almost the only tourist that is perhaps one reason why it was so successful    i  i am ashamed to begin with saying that touraine is the garden of france that remark has long ago lost its bloom  the town of tours however has some thing sweet and bright which suggests that it is sur rounded by a land of fruits  it is a very agreeable little city few towns of its size are more ripe more complete or i should suppose in better humor with themselves and less disposed to envy the responsibili ties of bigger places  it is truly the capital of its smil ing province a region of easy abundance of good living of genial comfortable optimistic rather indolent opinions  balzac says in one of his tales that the real tourangeau will not make an effort or displace him self even to go in search of a pleasure and it is not difficult to understand the sources of this amiable cynicism  he must have a vague conviction that he can only lose by almost any change  fortune has been kind to him he lives in a temperate reasonable sociable climate on the banks of  a river which it is true sometimes floods the country around it but of which the ravages appear to be so easily repaired that its aggressions may perhaps be regarded in a region where so many good things are certain merely as an occasion for healthy suspense  he is surrounded by fine old traditions religious social architectural culi nary and he may have the satisfaction of feeling that he is french to the core  no part of his admirable country is more characteristically national  normandy is normandy burgundy is burgundy provence is pro vence but touraine is essentially france  it is the land of rabelais of descartes of balzac of good books and good company as well as good dinners and good houses  george sand has somewhere a charm ing passage about the mildness the convenient quality of the physical conditions of central france  son climat souple et chaud ses pluies abondantes et courtes  in the autumn of 1882 the rains perhaps were less short than abundant but when the days were fine it  was impossible that anything in the way of weather could be more charming  the vineyards and orchards looked rich in the fresh gay light cultivation was everywhere but everywhere it seemed to be easy there was no visible poverty thrift and success pre sented themselves as matters of good taste  the white caps of the women glittered in the sunshire and their wellmade sabots clicked cheerfully on the hard clean roads  touraine is a land of old chateaux  a gallery of architectural specimens and of large hereditary pro perties  the peasantry have less of the luxury of ownership than in most other parts of france though they have enough of it to give them quite their share of that shrewdly conservative look which in the little chaffering place of the markettown the stranger ob serves so often in the wrinkled brown masks that sur mount the agricultural blouse  this is moreover the heart of the old french monarchy and as that monarchy was splendid and picturesque a reflection of the splen dor still glitters in the current of the loire  some of the most striking events of french history have occurred on the banks of that river and the soil it waters bloomed for a while with the flowering of the renais sance  the loire gives a great style to a landscape of which the features are not as the phrase is promi nent and carries the eye to distances even more poetic than the green horizons of touraine  it is a very fit ful stream and is sometimes observed to run thin and expose all the crudities of its channel  a great defect certainly in a river which is so much depended upon to give an air to the places it waters  but i speak of it as i saw it last full tranquil powerful bending in large slow curves and sending back half the light of the sky  nothing can be finer than the view of its course which you get from the battlements and ter races of amboise  as i looked down on it from that elevation one lovely sunday morning through a mild glitter of autumn sunshine it seemed the very model of a generous beneficent stream  the most charming part of tours is naturally the shaded quay that over looks it and looks across too at the friendly faubourg of saint symphorien and at the terraced heights which rise above this  indeed throughout touraine it is half the charm of the loire that you can travel beside it  the great dike which protects it or protects the country from it from blois to angers is an admirable road and on the other side as well the highway con stantly keeps it company  a wide river as you follow a wide road is excellent company it heightens and shortens the way  the inns at tours are in another quarter and one of them which is midway between the town and the station is very good  it is worth mentioning for the fact that every one belonging to it is extraordinarily polite  so unnaturally polite as at first to excite your suspicion that the hotel has some hidden vice so that the waiters and chambermaids are trying to pacify you in advance  there was one waiter in especial who was the most accomplished social being i have ever encountered from morning till night he kept up an inarticulate murmur of urbanity like the hum of a spinningtop  i may add that i discovered no dark secrets at the hotel de lunivers for it is not a secret to any traveller today that the obligation to partake of a lukewarm dinner in an overheated room is as imperative as it is detestable  for the rest at tours there is a certain rue royale which has pretensions to the monumental it was constructed a hundred years ago and the houses all alike have on a moderate scale a pompous eighteenthcentury look  it connects the palais de justice the most important secular building in the town with the long bridge which spans the loire  the spacious solid bridge pronounced by balzac in le cure de tours one of the finest monuments of french architecture  the palais de justice was the seat of the government of leon gambetta in the autumn of 1870 after the dictator had been obliged to retire in his balloon from paris and before the assembly was constituted at bordeaux  the germans occupied tours during that terrible winter it is astonishing the number of places the germans occupied  it is hardly too much to say that wherever one goes in certain parts of france one encounters two great historic facts one is the revolution the other is the german invasion the traces of the revolution remain in a hundred scars and bruises and mutilations but the visible marks of the war of 1870 have passed away  the country is so rich so living that she has been able to dress her wounds to hold up her head to smile again so that the shadow of that darkness has ceased to rest upon her  but what you do not see you still may hear and one remembers with a certain shudder that only a few short years ago this province so intimately french was under the heel of a foreign foe  to be intimately french was apparently not a safeguard for so successful an invader it could only be a challenge peace and plenty however have succeeded that episode and among the gardens and vineyards of touraine it seems only a legend the more in a country of legends  it was not all the same for the sake of this check ered story that i mentioned the palais de justice and the rue royale  the most interesting fact to my mind about the highstreet of tours was that as you walked toward the bridge on the righthand trottoir you can look up at the house on the other side of the way in which honore de balzac first saw the light  that violent and complicated genius was a child of the goodhumored and succulent touraine there is something anomalous in the fact though if one thinks about it a little one may discover certain correspondences between his character and that of his native province  strenuous laborious constantly in felicitous in spite of his great successes he suggests at times a very different set of influences  but he had his jovial fullfeeding side  the side that comes out in the contes drolatiques which are the romantic and epicurean chronicle of the old manors and abbeys of this region  and he was moreover the product of a soil into which a great deal of history had been trodden  balzac was genuinely as well as affectedly monarchical and he was saturated with a sense of the past  number 39 rue royale  of which the base ment like all the basements in the rue royale is occupied by a shop  is not shown to the public and i know not whether tradition designates the chamber in which the author of le lys dans la vallee opened his eyes into a world in which he was to see and to imagine such extraordinary things  if this were the case i would willingly have crossed its threshold not for the sake of any relic of the great novelist which it may possibly contain nor even for that of any mystic virtue which may be supposed to reside within its walls but simply because to look at those four modest walls can hardly fail to give one a strong impression of the force of human endeavour balzac in the maturity of his vision took in more of human life than any one since shakspeare who has attempted to tell us stories about it and the very small scene on which his consciousness dawned is one end of the immense scale that he traversed  i confess it shocked me a little to find that he was born in a house in a row  a house moreover which at the date of his birth must have been only about twenty years old  all that is contradictory  if the tenement selected for this honour could not be ancient and em browned it should at least have been detached  there is a charming description in his little tale of la grenadiere of the view of the opposite side of the loire as you have it from the square at the end of the rue royale  a square that has some preten sions to grandeur overlooked as it is by the hotel de ville and the musee a pair of edifices which directly contemplate the river and ornamented with marble images of francois rabelais and rene descartes the former erected a few years since is a very honor able production the pedastal of the latter could as a matter of course only be inscribed with the cogito ergo sum  the two statues mark the two opposite poles to which the brilliant french mind has travelled and if there were an effigy of balzac at tours it ought to stand midway between them  not that he by any means always struck the happy mean between the sensible and the metaphysical but one may say of him that half of his genius looks in one direction and half in the other  the side that turns toward francois rabelais would be on the whole the side that takes the sun  but there is no statue of balzac at tours there is only in one of the chambers of the melancholy museum a rather clever coarse bust the description in la grenadiere of which i just spoke is too long to quote neither have i space for any one of the brilliant attempts at landscape paint ing which are woven into the shimmering texture of le lys dans la vallee  the little manor of cloche gourde the residence of madame de mortsauf the heroine of that extraordinary work was within a moderate walk of tours and the picture in the novel is presumably a copy from an original which it would be possible today to discover  i did not however even make the attempt  there are so many chateaux in touraine commemorated in history that it would take one too far to look up those which have been com memorated in fiction  the most i did was to endeavor to identify the former residence of  mademoiselle gamard the sinister old maid of le cure de tours this terrible woman occupied a small house in the rear of the cathedral where i spent a whole morning in wondering rather stupidly which house it could be to reach the cathedral from the little place where we stopped just now to look across at the grenadiere without it must be confessed very vividly seeing it you follow the quay to the right and pass out of sight of the charming coteau which from beyond the river faces the town  a soft agglomeration of gardens vine yards scattered villas gables and turrets of slate roofed chateaux terraces with gray balustrades moss grown walls draped in scarlet virginiacreeper  you turn into the town again beside a great military barrack which is ornamented with a rugged mediaeval tower a relic of the ancient fortifications known to the tourangeaux of today as the tour de guise the young prince of joinville son of that duke of guise who was murdered by the order of henry ii at blois was after the death of his father confined here for more than two years but made his escape one summer evening in 1591 under the nose of his keepers with a gallant audacity which has attached the memory of the exploit to his sullenlooking prison  tours has a garrison of five regiments and the little redlegged soldiers light up the town  you see them stroll upon the clean uncommercial quay where there are no signs of navigation not even by oar no barrels nor bales no loading nor unloading no masts against the sky nor booming of steam in the air  the most active business that goes on there is that patient and fruitless angling in which the french as the votaries of art for art excel all other people  the little soldiers weighed down by the contents of their enormous pockets pass with respect from one of these masters of the rod to the otheras he sits soaking an indefinite bait in the large indifferent stream  after you turn your back to the quay you have only to go a little way before you reach the cathedral    ii  it is a very beautiful church of the second order of importance with a charming mousecolored com plexion and a pair of fantastic towers  there is a commodious little square in front of it from which you may look up at its very ornamental face but for purposes of frank admiration the sides and the rear are perhaps not sufficiently detached  the cathedral of tours which is dedicated to saint gatianus took a long time to build  begun in 1170 it was finished only in the first half of the sixteenth century but the ages and the weather have interfused so well the tone of the different parts that it presents at first at least no striking incongruities and looks even exception ally harmonious and complete  there are many grander cathedrals but there are probably few more pleasing and this effect of delicacy and grace is at its best toward the close of a quiet afternoon when the densely decorated towers rising above the little place de larcheveche lift their curious lanterns into the slanting light and offer a multitudinous perch to troops of circling pigeons  the whole front at such a time has an appearance of great richness although the niches which surround the three high doors with recesses deep enough for several circles of sculpture and indent the four great buttresses that ascend beside the huge rosewindow carry no figures beneath their little chiselled canopies  the blast of the great revo lution blew down most of the statues in france and the wind has never set very strongly toward putting them up again  the embossed and crocketed cupolas which crown the towers of saint gatien are not very pure in taste but like a good many impurities they have a certain character  the interior has a stately slimness with which no fault is to be found and which in the choir rich in early glass and surrounded by a broad passage becomes very bold and noble its principal treasure perhaps is the charming little tomb of the two children who died young of charles viii and anne of brittany in white marble embossed with sym bolic dolphins and exquisite arabesques  the little boy and girl lie side by side on a slab of black marble and a pair of small kneeling angels both at their head and at their feet watch over them  nothing could be more perfect than this monument which is the work of michel colomb one of the earlier glories of the french renaissance it is really a lesson in good taste originally placed in the great abbeychurch of saint martin which was for so many ages the holy place of tours it happily survived the devastation to which that edifice already sadly shattered by the wars of religion and successive profanations finally succumbed in 1797  in 1815 the tomb found an asylum in a quiet corner of the cathedral  i ought perhaps to be ashamed to acknowledge that i found the profane name of balzac capable of adding an interest even to this venerable sanctuary those who have read the terrible little story of le cure de tours will perhaps remember that as i have already mentioned the simple and childlike old abbe birotteau victim of the infernal machinations of the abbe troubert and mademoiselle gamard had his quarters in the house of that lady she had a speciality of letting lodgings to priests which stood on the north side of the cathedral so close under its walls that the supporting pillar of one of the great flying buttresses was planted in the spinsters garden if you wander round behind the church in search of this more than historic habitation you will have oc casion to see that the side and rear of saint gatien make a delectable and curious figure  a narrow lane passes beside the high wall which conceals from sight the palace of the archbishop and beneath the flying buttresses the farprojecting gargoyles and the fine south porch of the church  it terminates in a little dead grassgrown square entitled the place gregoire de tours  all this part of the exterior of the cathe dral is very brown ancient gothic grotesque balzac calls the whole place a desert of stone  a battered and gabled wing or outhouse as it appears to be of the hidden palace with a queer old stone pulpit jutting out from it looks down on this melancholy spot on the other side of which is a seminary for young priests one of whom issues from a door in a quiet corner and holding it open a moment behind him shows a glimpse of a sunny garden where you may fancy other black young figures strolling up and down  mademoiselle gamards house where she took her two abbes to board and basely conspired with one against the other is still further round the cathe dral  you cannot quite put your hand upon it to day for the dwelling which you say to yourself that it must have been mademoiselle gamards does not fulfil all the conditions mentioned in baizacs de scription  the edifice in question however fulfils con ditions enough in particular its little court offers hospitality to the big buttress of the church  another buttress corresponding with this the two between them sustain the gable of the north transept is planted in the small cloister of which the door on the further side of the little soundless rue de la psalette where nothing seems ever to pass opens opposite to that of mademoiselle gamard  there is a very genial old sacristan who introduced me to this cloister from the church  it is very small and solitary and much mutilated but it nestles with a kind of wasted friend liness beneath the big walls of the cathedral  its lower arcades have been closed and it has a small plot of garden in the middle with fruittrees which i should imagine to be too much overshadowed  in one corner is a remarkably picturesque turret the cage of a winding staircase which ascends no great distance to an upper gallery where an old priest the chanoinegardien of the church was walking to and fro with his breviary  the turret the gallery and even the chanoinegardien belonged that sweet september morning to the class of objects that are dear to paint ers in watercolors    iii  i have mentioned the church of saint martin which was for many years the sacred spot the shrine of pilgrimage of tours  originally the simple burial place of the great apostle who in the fourth century christianized gaul and who in his day a brilliant missionary and worker of miracles is chiefly known to modem fame as the worthy that cut his cloak in two at the gate of amiens to share it with a beggar tradition fails to say i believe what he did with the other half the abbey of saint martin through the middle ages waxed rich and powerful till it was known at last as one of the most luxurious religious houses in christendom with kings for its titular ab bots who like francis i sometimes turned and despoiled it and a great treasure of precious things it passed however through many vicissitudes  pillaged by the normans in the ninth century and by the huguenots in the sixteenth it received its deathblow from the revolution which must have brought to bear upon it an energy of destruction proportionate to its mighty bulk  at the end of the last century a huge group of ruins alone remained and what we see today may be called the ruin of a ruin  it is difficult to understand how so vast an ediface can have been so completely obliterated  its site is given up to several ugly streets and a pair of tall towers separated by a space which speaks volumes as to the size of the church and looking across the closepressed roofs to the happier spires of the cathedral preserved for the modern world the memory of a great fortune a great abuse perhaps and at all events a great pen alty  one may believe that to this day a consider able part of the foundations of the great abbey is buried in the soil of tours  the two surviving towers which are dissimilar in shape are enormous with those of the cathedral they form the great landmarks of the town  one of them bears the name of the tour de lhorloge the other the socalled tour charle magne was erected two centuries after her death over the tomb of luitgarde wife of the great em peror who died at tours in 800  i do not pretend to understand in what relation these very mighty and effectually detached masses of masonry stood to each other but in their gray elevation and loneliness they are striking and suggestive today holding their hoary heads far above the modern life of the town and looking sad and conscious as they had outlived all uses  i know not what is supposed to have become of the bones of the blessed saint during the various scenes of confusion in which they may have got mis laid but a mystic connection with his wonderworking relics may be perceived in a strange little sanctuary on the left of the street which opens in front of the tour charlemagne  the rugged base of which by the way inhabited like a cave with a diminutive doorway in which as i passed an old woman stood cleaning a pot and a little dark window decorated with homely flowers would be appreciated by a painter in search of bits  the present shrine of saint martin is enclosed provisionally i suppose in a very modem structure of timber where in a dusky cellar to which you descend by a wooden staircase adorned with votive tablets and paper roses is placed a tabernacle surrounded by twinkling tapers and pros trate worshippers  even this crepuscular vault how ever fails i think to attain solemnity for the whole place is strangely vulgar and garish  the catholic church as churches go today is certainly the most spectacular but it must feel that it has a great fund of impressiveness to draw upon when it opens such sordid little shops of sanctity as this  it is impos sible not to be struck with the grotesqueness of such an establishment as the last link in the chain of a great ecclesiastical tradition  in the same street on the other side a little below is something better worth your visit than the shrine of saint martin  knock at a high door in a white wall there is a cross above it and a freshfaced sister of the convent of the petit saint martin will let you into the charming little cloister or rather fragment of a cloister  only one side of this exqui site structure remains but the whole place is effective in front of the beautiful arcade which is terribly bruised and obliterated is one of those walks of inter laced tilleuls which are so frequent in touraine and into which the green light filters so softly through a lattice of clipped twigs  beyond this is a garden and beyond the garden are the other buildings of the convent  where the placid sisters keep a school  a test doubtless of placidity  the imperfect arcade which dates from the beginning of the sixteenth cen tury i know nothing of it but what is related in mrs pattisons rennaissance in france is a truly en chanting piece of work the cornice and the angles of the arches being covered with the daintiest sculpture of arabesques flowers fruit medallions cherubs griffins all in the finest and most attenuated relief  it is like the chasing of a bracelet in stone  the taste the fancy the elegance the refinement are of those things which revive our standard of  the exquisite  such a piece of work is the purest flower of the french renaissance there is nothing more delicate in all touraine  there is another fine thing at tours which is not particularly delicate but which makes a great impres sion  the very interesting old church of saint julian lurking in a crooked corner at the right of the rue royale near the point at which this indifferent thorough fare emerges with its little cry of admiration on the bank of the loire  saint julian stands today in a kind of neglected hollow where it is much shut in by houses but in the year 1225 when the edifice was begun the site was doubtless as the architects say more eligible  at present indeed when once you have caught a glimpse of the stout serious romanesque tower  which is not high but strong  you feel that the building has something to say and that you must stop to listen to it  within it has a vast and splendid nave of immense height  the nave of a cathedral  with a shallow choir and transepts and some admir able old glass  i spent half an hour there one morn ing listening to what the church had to say in perfect solitude  not a worshipper entered  not even an old man with a broom  i have always thought there is a sex in fine buildings and saint julian with its noble nave is of the gender of the name of its patron  it was that same morning i think that i went in search of the old houses of tours for the town con tains several goodly specimens of the domestic archi tecture of the past  the dwelling to which the average anglosaxon will most promptly direct his steps and the only one i have space to mention is the socalled maison de tristan lhermite  a gentleman whom the readers of quentin durward will not have forgotten  the hangmaninordinary to the great king louis xi unfortunately the house of tristan is not the house of tristan at all this illusion has been cruelly dispelled there are no illusions left at all in the good city of tours with regard to louis xi  his terrible castle of plessis the picture of which sends a shiver through the youthful reader of scott has been reduced to sub urban insignificance and the residence of his triste compere on the front of which a festooned rope figures as a motive for decoration is observed to have been erected in the succeeding century  the maison de tristan may be visited for itself however if not for walter scott it is an exceedingly picturesque old facade to which you pick your way through a narrow and tortuous street  a street terminating a little be yond it in the walk beside the river  an elegant gothic doorway is let into the rustyred brickwork and strange little beasts crouch at the angles of the windows which are surmounted by a tall graduated gable pierced with a small orifice where the large surface of brick lifted out of the shadow of the street looks yellow and faded  the whole thing is disfigured and decayed but it is a capital subject for a sketch in colors  only i must wish the sketcher better luck  or a better temper  than my own  if he ring the bell to be admitted to see the court which i believe is more sketchable still let him have patience to wait till the bell is answered  he can do the outside while they are coming  the maison de tristan i say may be visited for itself but i hardly know what the remnants of plessis lestours may be visited for  to reach them you wander through crooked suburban lanes down the course of the loire to a rough undesirable incon gruous spot where a small crude building of red brick is pointed out to you by your cabman if you happen to drive as the romantic abode of a super stitious king and where a strong odor of pigsties and other unclean things so prostrates you for the moment that you have no energy to protest against the obvious fiction  you enter a yard encumbered with rubbish and a defiant dog and an old woman emerges from a shabby lodge and assures you that you are indeed in an historic place  the red brick building which looks like a small factory rises on the ruins of the favorite residence of the dreadful louis  it is now occupied by a company of nightscavengers whose huge carts are drawn up in a row before it  i know not whether this be what is called the irony of fate at any rate the effect of it is to accentuate strongly the fact and through the most susceptible of our senses that there is no honor for the authors of great wrongs  the dreadful louis is reduced simply to an offence to the nostrils  the old woman shows you a few fragments  several dark damp muchencumbered vaults de nominated dungeons and an old tower staircase in good condition  there are the outlines of the old moat there is also the outline of the old guardroom which is now a stable and there are other vague out lines and inconsequent lumps which i have forgotten you need all your imagination and even then you cannot make out that plessis was a castle of large ex tent though the old woman as your eye wanders over the neighboring potagers talks a good deal about the gardens and the park  the place looks mean and flat and as you drive away you scarcely know whether to be glad or sorry that all those bristling horrors have been reduced to the commonplace  a certain flatness of impression awaits you also i think at marmoutier which is the other indisuensable excursion in the near neighborhood of tours  the remains of this famous abbey lie on the other bank of the stream about a mile and a half from the town you follow the edge of the big brown river of a fine afternoon you will be glad to go further still  the abbey has gone the way of most abbeys but the place is a restoration as well as a ruin inasmuch as the sisters of the sacred heart have erected a terribly modern convent here  a large gothic doorway in a high fragment of ancient wall admits you to a garden like enclosure of great extent from which you are further introduced into an extraordinarily tidy little parlor where two good nuns sit at work  one of these came out with me and showed me over the place  a very definite little woman with pointed features an intensely distinct enunciation and those pretty man ners which for whatever other teachings it may be responsible the catholic church so often instils into its functionaries  i have never seen a woman who had got her lesson better than this little trotting murmur ing edifying nun  the interest of marmoutier today is not so much an interest of vision so to speak as an interest of reflection  that is if you choose to reflect for instance upon the wondrous legend of the seven sleepers you may see where they lie in a row who lived together  they were brothers and cousins  in primitive piety in the sanctuary constructed by the blessed saint martin emulous of his precursor saint gatianus in the face of the hillside that overhung the loire and who twentyfive years after his death yielded up their seven souls at the same moment and enjoyed the curious privilege of retaining in their faces in spite of this process the rosy tints of life  the abbey of marmoutier which sprung from the grottos in the cliff to which saint gatianus and saint martin re tired to pray was therefore the creation of the latter worthy as the other great abbey in the town proper was the monument of his repose  the cliff is still there and a winding staircase in the latest taste en ables you conveniently to explore its recesses  these sacred niches are scooped out of the rock and will give you an impression if you cannot do without one you will feel them to be sufficiently venerable when you learn that the particular pigeonhole of saint gatianus the first christian missionary to gaul dates from the third century  they have been dealt with as the catholic church deals with most of such places to day polished and furnished up labelled and ticketed  edited with notes in short like an old book  the process is a mistake  the early editions had more sanctity  the modern buildings of the sacred heart on which you look down from these points of vantage are in the vulgar taste which seems doomed to stamp itself on all new catholic work but there was never theless a great sweetness in the scene  the afternoon was lovely and it was flushing to a close  the large garden stretched beneath us blooming with fruit and wine and succulent vegetables and beyond it flowed the shining river  the air was still the shadows were long and the place after all was full of memories most of which might pass for virtuous  it certainly was better than plessislestours    iv  your business at tours is to make excursions and if you make them all you will be very well occupied touraine is rich in antiquities and an hours drive from the town in almost any direction will bring you to the knowledge of some curious fragment of domestic or ecclesiastical architecture some turreted manor some lonely tower some gabled village or historic site  even however if you do everything  which was not my case  you cannot hope to relate everything and fortunately for you the excursions divide them selves into the greater and the less  you may achieve most of the greater in a week or two but a summer in touraine which by the way must be a charming thing would contain none too many days for the others if you come down to tours from paris your best economy is to spend a few days at blois where a clumsy but rather attractive little inn on the edge of the river will offer you a certain amount of that familiar and intermittent hospitality which a few weeks spent in the french provinces teaches you to regard as the highest attainable form of accommodation  such an economy i was unable to practise  i could only go to blois from tours to spend the day but this feat i accomplished twice over  it is a very sympathetic little town as we say nowadays and one might easily resign ones self to a week there  seated on the north bank of the loire it presents a bright clean face to the sun and has that aspect of cheerful leisure which belongs to all white towns that reflect themselves in shining waters  it is the waterfront only of blois however that exhibits this fresh complexion the in terior is of a proper brownness as befits a signally historic city  the only disappointment i had there was the discovery that the castle which is the special object of ones pilgrimage does not overhang the river as i had always allowed myself to understand  it overhangs the town but it is scarcely visible from the stream  that peculiar good fortune is reserved for amboise and chaurnont  the chateau de blois is one of the most beautiful and elaborate of all the old royal residences of this part of france and i suppose it should have all the honors of my description  as you cross its threshold you step straight into the brilliant movement of the french renaissance  but it is too rich to describe  i can only touch it here and there  it must be pre mised that in speaking of it as one sees it today one speaks of a monument unsparingly restored  the work of restoration has been as ingenious as it is pro fuse but it rather chills the imagination  this is perhaps almost the first thing you feel as you ap proach the castle from the streets of the town  these little streets as they leave the river have pretensions to romantic steepness one of them indeed which resolves itself into a high staircase with divergent wings the escalier monumental achieved this result so successfully as to remind me vaguely  i hardly know why  of the great slope of the capitol beside the ara coeli at rome  the view of that part of the castle which figures today as the back it is the only aspect i had seen reproduced exhibits the marks of restoration with the greatest assurance  the long facade consisting only of balconied windows deeply recessed erects itself on the summit of a considerable hill which gives a fine plunging movement to its foundations  the deep niches of the windows are all aglow with color  they have been repainted with red and blue relieved with gold figures and each of them looks more like the royal box at a theatre than like the aperture of a palace dark with memories  for all this however and in spite of the fact that as in some others of the chateaux of touraine always excepting the colossal chambord which is not in touraine there is less vastness than one had expected the least hospitable aspect of blois is abundantly impressive here as elsewhere lightness and grace are the key note and the recesses of the windows with their happy proportions their sculpture and their color are the empty frames of brilliant pictures  they need the figure of a francis i to complete them or of a diane de poitiers or even of a henry iii  the base of this exquisite structure emerges from a bed of light verdure which has been allowed to mass itself there and which contributes to the springing look of the walls while on the right it joins the most modern portion of the castle  the building erected on founda tions of enormous height and solidity in 1635 by gaston dorleans  this fine frigid mansion  the proper view of it is from the court within  is one of the masterpieces of francois mansard whom a kind pro vidence did not allow to make over the whole palace in the superior manner of his superior age  this had been a part of gastons plan  he was a blunderer born and this precious project was worthy of him this execution of it would surely have been one of the great misdeeds of history  partially performed the misdeed is not altogether to be regretted for as one stands in the court of the castle and lets ones eye wander from the splendid wing of francis i  which is the last work of free and joyous invention  to the ruled lines and blank spaces of the ponderous pavilion of mansard one makes ones reflections upon the advantage in even the least personai of the arts of having something to say and upon the stupidity of a taste which had ended by becoming an aggregation of negatives  gastons wing taken by itself has much of the bel air which was to belong to the architecture of louis xiv but taken in contrast to its flowering laughing living neighbor it marks the difference be tween inspiration and calculation  we scarcely grudge it its place however for it adds a price to the rest of the chateau  we have entered the court by the way by jump ing over the walls  the more orthodox method is to follow a modern terrace which leads to the left from the side of the chateau that i began by speaking of and passes round ascending to a little square on a considerably higher level which is not like a very modern square on which the back as i have called it looks out a thoroughfare  this small empty place oblong in form at once bright and quiet with a cer tain grassgrown look offers an excellent setting to the entrancefront of the palace  the wing of louis xii the restoration here has been lavish but it was per haps but an inevitable reaction against the injuries still more lavish by which the unfortunate building had long been overwhelmed  it had fallen into a state of ruinous neglect relieved only by the misuse pro ceeding from successive generations of soldiers for whom its charming chambers served as barrackroom whitewashed mutilated dishonored the castle of blois may be said to have escaped simply with its life  this is the history of amboise as well and is to a certain extent the history of chambord  delightful at any rate was the refreshed facade of louis xii as i stood and looked at it one bright september morning  in that soft clear merry light of touraine everything shows everything speaks  charming are the taste the happy proportions the color of this beautiful front to which the new feeling for a purely domestic architec ture  an architecture of security and tranquillity in which art could indulge itself  gave an air of youth and gladness  it is true that for a long time to come the castle of blois was neither very safe nor very quiet but its dangers came from within from the evil passions of its inhabitants and not from siege or in vasion  the front of louis xii is of red brick crossed here and there with purple and the purple slate of the high roof relieved with chimneys beautifully treated and with the embroidered caps of pinnacles and arches with the porcupine of louis the ermine and the festooned rope which formed the devices of anne of brittany  the tone of this richlooking roof carries out the mild glow of the wall  the wide fair windows look as if they had expanded to let in the rosy dawn of the renaissance  charming for that matter are the windows of all the chateaux of touraine with their squareness corrected as it is not in the tudor architecture by the curve of the upper corners which makes this line look  above the expressive aperture  like a pencilled eyebrow  the low door of this front is crowned by a high deep niche in which under a splendid canopy stiffly astride of a stiffly draped charger sits in profile an image of the good king louis  good as he had been  the father of his people as he was called i believe he remitted various taxes  he was not good enough to pass muster at the revolution and the effigy i have just described is no more than a reproduction of the primitive statue demolished at that period  pass beneath it into the court and the sixteenth century closes round you  it is a pardonable flight of fancy to say that the expressive faces of an age in which human passions lay very near the surface seem to look out at you from  the windows from the balconies from the thick foliage of the sculpture  the portion of the wing of louis xii that looks toward the court is supported on a deep arcade  on your right is the wing erected by francis i the reverse of the mass of building which you see on approaching the castle  this exquisite this extravagant this trans cendent piece of architecture is the most joyous ut terance of the french renaissance  it is covered with an embroidery of sculpture in which every detail is worthy of the hand of a goldsmith  in the middle of it or rather a little to the left rises the famous wind ing staircase plausibly but i believe not religiously restored which even the ages which most misused it must vaguely have admired  it forms a kind of chiselled cylinder with wide interstices so that the stairs are open to the air  every inch of this structure of its balconies its pillars its great central columns is wrought over with lovely images strange and ingenious devices prime among which is the great heraldic sala mander of francis i  the salamander is everywhere at blois  over the chimneys over the doors on the walls  this whole quarter  of the castle bears the stamp of that eminently pictorial prince  the run ning cornice along the top of the front is like all un folded an elongated bracelet  the windows of the attic are like shrines for saints  the gargoyles the medallions the statuettes the festoons are like the elaboration of some precious cabinet rather than the details of a building exposed to the weather and to the ages  in the interior there is a profusion of res toration and it is all restoration in color  this has been evidently a work of great energy and cost but it will easily strike you as overdone  the universal freshness is a discord a false note it seems to light up the dusky past with an unnatural glare  begun in the reign of louis philippe this terrible process  the more terrible always the more you admit that it has been necessary  has been carried so far that there is now scarcely a square inch of the interior that has the color of the past upon it  it is true that the place had been so coated over with modern abuse that something was needed to keep it alive it is only per haps a pity that the restorers not content with saving its life should have undertaken to restore its youth the love of consistency in such a business is a dangerous lure  all the old apartments have been rechristened as it were the geography of the castle has been reestablished  the guardrooms the bed rooms the closets the oratories have recovered their identity  every spot connected with the murder of the duke of guise is pointed out by a small shrill boy who takes you from room to room and who has learned his lesson in perfection  the place is full of catherine de medici of henry iii of memories of ghosts of echoes of possible evocations and revivals it is covered with crimson and gold  the fireplaces and the ceilings are magnificent they look like ex pensive sets at the grand opera  i should have mentioned that below in the court the front of the wing of gaston dorleans faces you as you enter so that the place is a course of french history  inferior in beauty and grace to the other portions of the castle the wing is yet a nobler monu ment than the memory of gaston deserves  the second of the sons of henry iv  who was no more fortunate as a father than as a husband  younger brother of louis xiii and father of the great mademoiselle the most celebrated most ambitious most selfcomplacent and most unsuccessful fille a marier in french history passed in enforced retirement at the castle of blois the close of a life of clumsy intrigues against cardinal richelieu in which his rashness was only equalled by his pusillanimity and his illluck by his inaccessibility to correction and which after so many follies and shames was properly summed up in the project  be gun but not completed  of demolishing the beautiful habitation of his exile in order to erect a better one with gaston dorleans however who lived there with out dignity the history of the chateau de blois de clines  its interesting period is that of the wars of religion  it was the chief residence of henry iii and the scene of the principal events of his depraved and dramatic reign  it has been restored more than enough as i have said by architects and decorators the visitor as he moves through its empty rooms which are at once brilliant and illlighted they have not been re furnished undertakes a little restoration of his own his imagination helps itself from the things that re main he tries to see the life of the sixteenth century in its form and dress  its turbulence its passions its loves and hates its treacheries falsities touches of faith its latitude of personal development its presen tation of the whole nature its nobleness of costume charm of speech splendor of taste unequalled pic turesqueness  the picture is full of movement of contrasted light and darkness full altogether of abomi nations  mixed up with them all is the great name of religion so that the drama wants nothing to make it complete  what episode was ever more perfect  looked at as a dramatic occurrence  than the murder of the duke of guise  the insolent prosperity of the victim the weakness the vices the terrors of the author of the deed the perfect execution of the plot the accu mulation of horror in what followed it  give it as a crime a kind of immortal solidity  but we must not take the chateau de blois too hard i went there after all by way of entertainment if among these sinister memories your visit should threaten to prove a tragedy there is an excellent way of removing the impression  you may treat yourself at blois to a very cheerful afterpiece  there is a charming industry practised there and practised in charming conditions  follow the bright little quay down the river till you get quite out of the town and reach the point where the road beside the loire be comes sinuous and attractive turns the corner of dimi nutive headlands and makes you wonder what is be yond  let not your curiosity induce you however to pass by a modest white villa which overlooks the stream enclosed in a fresh little court for here dwells an artist  an artist in faience  there is no sort of sign and the place looks peculiarly private  but if you ring at the gate you will not be turned away you will on the contrary be ushered upstairs into a parlor  there is nothing resembling a shop encum bered with specimens  of remarkably handsome pottery the work is of the best  a careful reproduction of old forms colors devices and the master of the establishment is one of those completely artistic types that are often found in france  his reception is as friendly as his work is ingenious and i think it is not too much to say that you like the work the better be cause he has produced it  his vases cups and jars lamps platters plaques with their brilliant glaze their innumerable figures their family likeness and wide variations are scattered through his occupied rooms they serve at once as his stockintrade and as house hold ornament  as we all know this is an age of prose of machinery of wholesale production of coarse and hasty processes  but one brings away from the establishment of the very intelligent m ulysse the sense of a less eager activity and a greater search for perfection  he has but a few workmen and he gives them plenty of time  the place makes a little vignette leaves an impression  the quiet white house in its garden on the road by the wide clear river without the smoke the bustle the ugliness of so much of our modern industry  it ought to gratify mr ruskin    v  the second time i went to blois i took a carriage for chambord and came back by the chateau de cheverny and the forest of russy  a charming little expedition to which the beauty of the afternoon the finest in a rainy season that was spotted with bright days contributed not a little  to go to chambord you cross the loire leave it on one side and strike away through a country in which salient features be come less and less numerous and which at last has no other quality than a look of intense and peculiar rurality  the characteristic even when it is not the charm of so much of the landscape of france  this is not the appearance of wildness for it goes with great cultivation it is simply the presence of the delving drudging economizing peasant  but it is a deep unrelieved rusticity  it is a peasants landscape not as in england a landlords  on the way to cham bord you enter the flat and sandy sologne  the wide horizon opens out like a great potager without inter ruptions without an eminence with here and there a long low stretch of wood  there is an absence of hedges fences signs of property everything is ab sorbed in the general flatness  the patches of vine yard the scattered cottages the villages the children planted and staring and almost always pretty the women in the fields the white caps the faded blouses the big sabots  at the end of an hours drive they assure you at blois that even with two horses you will spend double that time i passed through a sort of gap in a wall which does duty as the gateway of the domain of an exiled pretender  i drove along a straight avenue through a disfeatured park  the park of chambord has twentyone miles of circumference  a very sandy scrubby melancholy plantation in which the timber must have been cut many times over and is today a mere tangle of brushwood  here as in so many spots in france the traveller perceives that he is in a land of revolutoins  nevertheless its great ex tent and the long perspective of its avenues give this desolate boskage a certain majesty just as its shabbi ness places it in agreement with one of the strongest impressions of the chateau  you follow one of these long perspectives a proportionate time and at last you see the chimneys and pinnacles of chambord rise ap parently out of the ground  the fillingin of the wide moats that formerly surrounded it has in vulgar par lance let it down bud given it an appearance of top heaviness that is at the same time a magnificent orien talism  the towers the turrets the cupolas the gables the lanterns the chimneys look more like the spires of a city than the salient points of a single building you emerge from the avenue and find yourself at the foot of an enormous fantastic mass  chambord has a strange mixture of society and solitude  a little village clusters within view of its stately windows and a couple of inns near by offer entertainment to pilgrims  these things of course are incidents of the political pro scription which hangs its thick veil over the place chambord is truly royal  royal in its great scale its grand air its indifference to common considerations if a cat may look at a king a palace may lock at a tavern  i enjoyed my visit to this extraordinary struc ture as much as if i had been a legitimist and indeed there is something interesting in any monument of a great system any bold presentation of a tradition  you leave your vehicle at one of the inns which are very decent and tidy and in which every one is very civil as if in this latter respect the influence of the old regime pervaded the neighborhood and you walk across the grass and the gravel to a small door  a door infinitely subordinate and conferring no title of any kind on those who enter it  here you ring a bell which a highly respectable person answers a per son perceptibly affiliated again to the old regime after which she ushers you across a vestibule into an inner court  perhaps the strongest impression i got at chambord came to me as i stood in this court the woman who admitted me did not come with me i was to find my guide somewhere else  the specialty of chambord is its prodigious round towers there are i believe no less than eight of them placed at each angle of the inner and outer square of buildings for the castle is in the form of a larger structure which encloses a smaller one  one of these towers stood before me in the court it seemed to fling its shadow over the place while above as i looked up the pinnacles and gables the enormous chimneys soared into the bright blue air  the place was empty and silent shadows of gargoyles of extra ordinary projections were thrown across the clear gray surfaces  one felt that the whole thing was monstrous  a cicerone appeared a languid young man in a rather shabby livery and led me about with a mixture of the impatient and the desultory of con descension and humility  i do not profess to under stand the plan of chambord and i may add that i do not even desire to do so for it is much more entertaining to think of it as you can so easily as an irresponsible insoluble labyrinth  within it is a wilderness of empty chambers a royal and romantic barrack  the exiled prince to whom it gives its title has not the means to keep up four hundred rooms he contents himself with preserving the huge outside the repairs of the prodigious roof alone must absorb a large part of his revenue  the great feature of the interior is the celebrated double staircase rising straight through the building with two courses of steps so that people may ascend and descend without meeting  this staircase is a truly majestic piece of humor it gives you the note as it were of chambord it opens on each landing to a vast guardroom in four arms radiations of the winding shaft  my guide made me climb to the great openwork lantern which springing from the roof at the termination of the rotund staircase surmounted here by a smaller one forms the pinnacle of the bristling crown of cham bord  this lantern is tipped with a huge fleurdelis in stone  the only one i believe that the revolution did not succeed in pulling down  here from narrow windows you look over the wide flat country and the tangled melancholy park with the rotation of its straight avenues  then you walk about the roof in a complication of galleries terraces balconies through the multitude of chimneys and gables  this roof which is in itself a sort of castle in the air has an extravagant faboulus quality and with its profuse ornamentation  the salamander of francis i is a con tant motive  its lonely pavements its sunny niches the balcony that looks down over the closed and grassgrown main entrance a strange halfsad half brilliant charm  the stonework is covered with fine mould  there are places that reminded me of some of those quiet mildewed corners of courts and ter races into which the traveller who wanders through the vatican looks down from neglected windows  they show you two or three furnished rooms with bourbon portraits hideous tapestries from the ladies of france a collection of the toys of the enfant du miracle all military and of the finest make  tout cela fonc tionne the guide said of these miniature weapons and i wondered if he should take it into his head to fire off his little canon how much harm the comte de chambord would do  from below the castle would look crushed by the redundancy of its upper protuberances if it were not for the enormous girth of its round towers which appear to give it a robust lateral development  these towers however fine as they are in their way struck me as a little stupid they are the exaggeration of an exaggeration  in a building erected after the days of defence and proclaiming its peaceful character from its hundred embroideries and cupolas they seem to indicate a want of invention  i shall risk the ac cusation of bad taste if i say that impressive as it is the chateau de chambord seemed to me to have al together a little of that quality of stupidity  the trouble is that it represents nothing very particular it has not happened in spite of sundry vicissitudes to have a very interesting history  compared with that of blois and amboise its past is rather vacant and one feels to a certain extent the contrast between its pompous appearance and its spacious but some what colorless annals  it had indeed the good for tune to be erected by francis i whose name by itself expresses a good deal of history  why he should have built a palace in those sandy plains will ever remain an unanswered question for kings have never been obliged to give reasons  in addition to the fact that the country was rich in game and that francis was a passionate hunter it is suggested by m de la saussaye the author of the very complete little history of chambord which you may buy at the booksellers at blois that he was govemed in his choice of the site by the accident of a charming woman having formerly lived there  the comtesse de thoury had a manor in the neighborhood and the comtesse de thoury had been the object of a youthful passion on the part of the most susceptible of princes before his accession to the throne  this great pile was reared therefore according to m de la saussaye as a souvenir de premieres amours  it is certainly a very massive memento and if these tender passages were propor tionate to the building that commemorates them they were tender indeed  there has been much discus sion as to the architect employed by francis i and the honor of having designed this splendid residence has been claimed for several of the italian artists who early in the sixteenth century came to seek patronage in france  it seems well established today however that chambord was the work neither of primaticcio of vignola nor of il rosso all of whom have left some trace of their sojourn in france but of an obscure yet very complete genius pierre nepveu known as pierre trinqueau who is designated in the papers which preserve in some degree the history of the origin of the edifice as the maistre de loeuvre de maconnerie  behind this modest title apparently we must recognize one of the most original talents of the french renaissance and it is a proof of the vigor of the artistic life of that period that brilliant pro duction being everywhere abundant an artist of so high a value should not have been treated by his con temporaries as a celebrity  we manage things very differently today  the immediate successors of francis i continued to visit chambord but it was neglected by henry iv and was never afterwards a favorite residence of any french king  louis xiv appeared there on several occasions and the apparition was characteristically brilliant but chambord could not long detain a monarch who had gone to the expense of creating a versailles ten miles from paris  with versailles fon tainebleau saintgermain and saintcloud within easy reach of their capital the later french sovereigns had little reason to take the air in the dreariest province of their kingdom  chambord therefore suffered from royal indifference though in the last century a use was found for its deserted halls  in 1725 it was oc cupied by the luckless stanislaus leszczynski who spent the greater part of his life in being elected king of poland and being ousted from his throne and who at this time a refugee in france had found a compensation for some of his misfortunes in marry ing his daughter to louis xv  he lived eight years at chambord and filled up the moats of the castle in 1748 it found an illustrious tenant in the person of maurice de saxe the victor of fontenoy who how ever two years after he had taken possession of it terminated a life which would have been longer had he been less determined to make it agreeable  the revolution of course was not kind to chambord it despoiled it in so far as possible of every vestige of its royal origin and swept like a whirlwind through apartments to which upwards of two centuries had contributed a treasure of decoration and furniture  in that wild blast these precious things were destroyed or forever scattered  in 1791 an odd proposal was made to the french government by a company of english quakers who had conceived the bold idea of establishing in the palace a manufacture of some peaceful commodity not today recorded  napoleon allotted chambord as a dotation to one of his marshals berthier for whose benefit it was converted in napoleonic fashion into the socalled principality of wagram  by the princess of wagram the marshals widow it was after the restoration sold to the trustees of a national subscription which had been established for the purpose of presenting it to the in fant duke of bordeaux then prospective king of france  the presentation was duly made but the comte de chambord who had changed his title in recognition of the gift was despoiled of his property by the government of louis philippe  he appealed for redress to the tribunals of his country and the consequence of his appeal was an interminable litiga tion by which however finally after the lapse of twentyfive years he was established in his rights  in 1871 he paid his first visit to the domain which had been offered him half a century before a term of which he had spent forty years in exile  it was from chambord that he dated his famous letter of the 5th of july of that year  the letter directed to his so called subjects in which he waves aloft the white flag of the bourbons  this amazing epistle which is virtually an invitation to the french people to re pudiate as their national ensign that immortal tricolor the flag of the revolution and the empire under which they have won the glory which of all glories has hitherto been dearest to them and which is as sociated with the most romantic the most heroic the epic the consolatory period of their history  this luckless manifesto i say appears to give the measure of the political wisdom of the excellent henry v  it is the most factitious proposal ever addressed to an eminently ironical nation  on the whole chambord makes a great impression and the hour i was there while the yellow afternoon light slanted upon the september woods there was a dignity in its desolation  it spoke with a muffled but audible voice of the vanished monarchy which had been so strong so splendid but today has be come a sort of fantastic vision like the cupolas and chimneys that rose before me  i thought while i lingered there of all the fine things it takes to make up such a monarchy and how one of them is a su perfluity of mouldering empty palaces  chambord is touching  that is the best word for it and if the hopes of another restoration are in the follies of the republic a little reflection on that eloquence of ruin ought to put the republic on its guard  a sentimental tourist may venture to remark that in the presence of several chateaux which appeal in this mystical manner to the retrospective imagination it cannot afford to be foolish  i thought of all this as i drove back to blois by the way of the chateau de cheverny  the road took us out of the park of chambord but through a region of flat woodland where the trees were not mighty and again into the prosy plain of the sologne  a thankless soil all of it i believe but lately much amended by the magic of cheerful french industry and thrift  the light had already begun to fade and my drive reminded me of a passage in some rural novel of madame sand  i passed a couple of timber and plaster churches which looked very old black and crooked and had lumpish wooden porches and galleries encircling the base  by the time i reached cheverny the clear twilight had approached  it was late to ask to be allowed to visit an inhabited house but it was the hour at which i like best to visit almost anything  my coachman drew up before a gateway in a high wall which opened upon a short avenue along which i took my way on foot the coachmen in those parts being for reasons best known to them selves mortally averse to driving up to a house  i answered the challenge of a very tidy little portress who sat in company with a couple of children en joying the evening air in front of her lodge and who told me to walk a little further and turn to the right i obeyed her to the letter and my turn brought me into sight of a house as charming as an old manor in a fairy tale  i had but a rapid and partial view of cheverny but that view was a glimpse of perfection a light sweet mansion stood looking over a wide green lawn over banks of flowers and groups of trees  it had a striking character of elegance produced partly by a series of renaissance busts let into circular niches in the facade  the place looked so private so reserved that it seemed an act of violence to ring a stranger and foreigner at the graceful door  but if i had not rung i should be unable to express  as it is such a pleasure to do  my sense of the exceeding courtesy with which this admirable house is shown  it was near the dinnerhour  the most sacred hour of the day but i was freely conducted into the inhabited apartments  they are extremely beautiful  what i chiefly remember is the charming staircase of white embroidered stone and the great salle des gardes and chambre a coucher du roi on the second floor  che verny built in 1634 is of a much later date than the other royal residences of this part of france it be longs to the end of the renaissance and has a touch of the rococo  the guardroom is a superb apartment and as it contains little save its magnificent ceiling and fireplace and certain dim tapestries on its walls you the more easily take the measure of its noble proportions  the servant opened the shutters of a single window and the last rays of the twilight slanted into the rich brown gloom  it was in the same pic turesque fashion that i saw the bedroom adjoining of henry iv where a legendarylooking bed draped in folds long unaltered defined itself in the haunted dusk  cheverny remains to me a very charming a partly mysterious vision  i drove back to blois in the dark some nine miles through the forest of russy which belongs to the state and which though con sisting apparently of small timber looked under the stars sufficiently vast and primeval  there was a damp autumnal smell and the occasional sound of a stirring thing and as i moved through the evening air i thought of francis i and henry iv    vi  you may go to amboise either from blois or from tours it is about halfway between these towns  the great point is to go especially if you have put it off repeatedly and to go if possible on a day when the great view of the loire which you enjoy from the battlements and terraces presents itself under a friendly sky  three persons of whom the author of these lines was one spent the greater part of a perfect sunday morning in looking at it  it was astonishing in the course of the rainiest season in the memory of the oldest tourangeau how many perfect days we found to our hand  the town of amboise lies like tours on the left bank of the river a little white faced town staring across an admirable bridge and leaning behind as it were against the pedestal of rock on which the dark castle masses itself  the town is so small the pedestal so big and the castle so high and striking that the clustered houses at the base of the rock are like the crumbs that have fallen from a wellladen table  you pass among them however to ascend by a circuit to the chateau which you attack obliquely from behind  it is the property of the comte de paris another pretender to the french throne having come to him remotely by inheritance from his ancestor the duc de penthievre who toward the close of the last century bought it from the crown which had recovered it after a lapse  like the castle of blois it has been injured and defaced by base uses but unlike the castle of blois it has not been com pletely restored  it is very very dirty but very curious  it is in these terms that i heard it described by an english lady who was generally to be found engaged upon a tattered tauchnitz in the little salon de lecture of the hotel at tours  the description is not inaccurate but it should be said that if part of the dirtiness of amboise is the result of its having served for years as a barrack and as a prison part of it comes from the presence of restoring stonemasons who have woven over a considerable portion of it a mask of scaffolding  there is a good deal of neatness as well and the restoration of some of the parts seems finished  this process at amboise consists for the most part of simply removing the vulgar excrescences of the last two centuries  the interior is virtually a blank the old apart ments having been chopped up into small modern rooms it will have to be completely reconstructed  a worthy woman with a military profile and that sharp positive manner which the goodwives who show you through the chateaux of touraine are rather apt to have and in whose high respectability to say nothing of the frill of her cap and the cut of her thick brown dress my companions and i thought we discovered the particular note or nuance of orleanism  a com petent appreciative peremptory person i say  at tended us through the particularly delightful hour we spent upon the ramparts of amboise  denuded and disfeatured within and bristling without with brick layers ladders the place was yet extraordinarily im pressive and interesting  i should confess that we spent a great deal of time in looking at the view sweet was the view and magnificent we preferred it so much to certain portions of the interior and to oc casional effusions of historical information that the old lady with the prove sometimes lost patience with us  we laid ourselves open to the charge of pre ferring it even to the little chapel of saint hubert which stands on the edge of the great terrace and has over the portal a wonderful sculpture of the mi raculous hunt of that holy man  in the way of plastic art this elaborate scene is the gem of amboise  it seemed to us that we had never been in a place where there are so many points of vantage to look down from  in the matter of position amboise is certainly supreme among the old houses of the loire and i say this with a due recollection of the claims of chau mont and of loches  which latter by the way ex cuse the afterthought is not on the loire  the plat forms the bastions the terraces the highperched windows and balconies the hanging gardens and dizzy crenellations of this complicated structure keep you in perpetual intercourse with an immense horizon the great feature of theplace is the obligatory round tower which occupies the northern end of it and which has now been completely restored  it is of astounding size a fortress in itself and contains instead of a staircase a wonderful inclined plane so wide and gradual that a coach and four may be driven to the top  this colossal cylinder has today no visible use but it corresponds happily enough with the great circle of the prospect  the gardens of am boise perched in the air covering the irregular rem nants of the platform on which the castle stands and making up in picturesqueness what they lack in ex tent constitute of come but a scanty domain  but bathed as we found them in the autumn sunshine and doubly private from their aerial site they offered irresistible opportunities for a stroll interrupted as one leaned against their low parapets by long con templative pauses  i remember in particular a certain terrace planted with clipped limes upon which we looked down from the summit of the big tower  it seemed from that point to be absolutely necessary to ones happiness to go down and spend the rest of the morning there it was an ideal place to walk to and fro and talk  our venerable conductress to whom our relation had gradually become more filial per mitted us to gratify this innocent wish  to the extent that is of taking a turn or two under the mossy tilleuls at the end of this terrace is the low door in a wall against the top of which in 1498 charles viii ac cording to an accepted tradition knocked his head to such good purpose that he died  it was within the walls of amboise that his widow anne of brittany already in mourning for three children two of whom we have seen commemorated in sepulchral marble at tours spent the first violence of that grief which was presently dispelled by a union with her husbands cousin and successor louis xii  amboise was a fre quent resort of the french court during the sixteenth century it was here that the young mary stuart spent sundry hours of her first marriage  the wars of re ligion have left here the ineffaceable stain which they left wherever they passed  an imaginative visitor at amboise today may fancy that the traces of blood are mixed with the red rust on the crossed iron bars of the grimlooking balcony to which the heads of the huguenots executed on the discovery of the con spiracy of la renaudie are rumored to have been suspended  there was room on the stout balustrade  an admirable piece of work  for a ghastly array  the same rumor represents catherine de medici and the young queen as watching from this balcony the noyades of the captured huguenots in the loire  the facts of history are bad enough the fictions are if possible worse but there is little doubt that the future queen of scots learnt the first lessons of life at a horrible school  if in subsequent years she was a prodigy of innocence and virtue it was not the fault of her whilom  motherinlaw of her uncles of the house of guise or of the examples presented to her either at the windows of the castle of amboise or in its more pri vate recesses  it was difficult to believe in these dark deeds how ever as we looked through the golden morning at the placidity of the farshining loire  the ultimate con sequence of this spectacle was a desire to follow the river as far as the castle of chaumont  it is true that the cruelties practised of old at amboise might have seemed less phantasmal to persons destined to suffer from a modern form of inhumanity  the mis tress of the little inn at the base of the castlerock  it stands very pleasantly beside the river and we had breakfasted there  declared to us that the chateau de chaumont which is often during the autumn closed to visitors was at that particular moment standing so wide open to receive us that it was our duty to hire one of her carriages and drive thither with speed this assurance was so satisfactory that we presently found ourselves seated in this wily womans most com modious vehicle and rolling neither too fast nor too slow along the margin of the loire  the drive of about an hour beneath constant clumps of chestnuts was charming enough to have been taken for itself and indeed when we reached chaumont we saw that our reward was to be simply the usual reward of virtue  the consciousness of having attempted the right  the chateau de chaumont was inexorably closed so we learned from a talkative lodgekeeper who gave what grace she could to her refusal  this good womans dilemma was almost touching she wished to reconcile two impossibles  the castle was not to be visited for the family of its master was staying there and yet she was loath to turn away a party of which she was good enough to say that it had a grand genre for as she also remarked she had her living to earn  she tried to arrange a compromise one of the elements of which was that we should descend from our carriage and trudge up a hill which would bring us to a designated point where over the paling of the garden we might obtain an oblique and surreptitious view of a small portion of the castle walls this suggestion led us to inquire of each other to what degree of baseness it is allowed to an enlightened lover of the picturesque to resort in order to catch a glimpse of a feudal chateau  one of our trio decided characteristically against any form of derogation so she sat in the carriage and sketched some object that was public property while her two companions who were not so proud trudged up a muddy ascent which formed a kind of backstairs  it is perhaps no more than they deserved that they were disappointed  chau mont is feudal if you please but the modern spirit is in possession  it forms a vast cleanscraped mass with big round towers ungarnished with a leaf of ivy or a patch of moss surrounded by gardens of moderate extent save where the muddy lane of which i speak passes near it and looking rather like an enormously magnified villa  the great merit of chaumont is its position which almost exactly resembles that of am boise it sweeps the river up and down and seems to look over half the province  this however was better appreciated as after coming down the hill and re entering the carriage we drove across the long sus pensionbridge which crosses the loire just beyond the village and over which we made our way to the small station of onzain at the farther end to take the train back to tours  look back from the middle of this bridge the whole picture composes as the painters say  the towers the pinnacles the fair front of the chateau perched above its fringe of garden and the rusty roofs of the village and facing the afternoon sky which is reflected also in the great stream that sweeps below  all this makes a contribution to your happiest memories of touraine    vii  we never went to chinon it was a fatality  we planned it a dozen times but the weather interfered or the trains didnt suit or one of the party was fatigued with the adventures ofthe day before  this excursion was so much postponed that it was finally postponed to everything  besides we had to go to chenonceaux to azaylerideau to langeais to loches so i have not the memory of chinon i have only the regret  but regret as well as memory has its visions especially when like memory it is assisted by photo graphs  the castle of chinon in this form appears to me as an enormous ruin a mediaeval fortress of the extent almost of a city  it covers a hill above the vienne and after being impregnable in its time is in destructible today  i risk this phrase in the face of the prosaic truth  chinon in the days when it was a prize more than once suflered capture and at present it is crumbling inch by inch  it is apparent however i believe that these inches encroach little upon acres of masonry  it was in the castle that jeanne darc   had her first interview with charles vii and it is in the town that francois rabelais is supposed to have been born  to the castle moreover the lover of the picturesque is earnestly recommended to direct his steps  but one cannot do everything and i would rather have missed chinon than chenonceaux  for tunate exceedingly were the few hours that we passed at this exquisite residence  in 1747 says jeanjacques rousseau in his confessions we went to spend the autumn in tou raine at the chateau of chenonceaux a royal resi dence upon the cher built by henry ii for diana of poitiers whose initials are still to be seen there and now in possession of m dupin the farmergeneral we amused ourselves greatly in this fine spot the liv ing was of the best and i became as fat as a monk we made a great deal of music and acted comedies  this is the only description that rousseau gives of one of the most romantic houses in france and of an episode that must have counted as one of the most agreeable in his uncomfortable career  the eighteenth century contented itself with general epithets and when jeanjacques has said that chenonceaux was a beau lieu he thinks himself absolved from further characterization  we later sons of time have both for our pleasure and our pain invented the fashion of special terms and i am afraid that even common decency obliges me to pay some larger tribute than this to the architectural gem of touraine  fortunately i can discharge my debt with gratitude  in going from tours you leave the valley of the loire and enter that of the cher and at the end of about an hour you see the turrets of the castle on your right among the trees down in the meadows beside the quiet little river  the station and the village are about ten minutes walk from the chateau and the village con tains a very tidy inn where if you are not in too great a hurry to commune with the shades of the royal favorite and the jealous queen you will perhaps stop and order a dinner to be ready for you in the evening a straight tall avenue leads to the grounds of the castle what i owe to exactitude compels me to add that it is crossed by the railwayline  the place is so arranged however that the chateau need know nothing of passing trains  which pass indeed though the grounds are not large at a very sufficient distance i may add that the trains throughout this part of france have a noiseless desultory dawdling almost stationary quality which makes them less of an offence than usual  it was a sunday afternoon and the light was yellow save under the trees of the avenue where in spite of the waning of september it was duskily green  three or four peasants in festal attire were strolling about  on a bench at the beginning of the avenue sat a man with two women  as i advanced with my companions he rose after a sudden stare and approached me with a smile in which to be johnsonian for a moment certitude was mitigated by modesty and eagerness was embellished with respect he came toward me with a salutation that i had seen before and i am happy to say that after an instant i ceased to be guilty of the brutality of not knowing where  there was only one place in the world where people smile like that  only one place where the art of salutation has that perfect grace  this excellent creature used to crook his arm in venice when i stepped into my gondola and i now laid my hand on that member with the familiarity of glad recognition for it was only surprise that had kept me even for a moment from accepting the genial francesco as an ornament of the landscape of touraine  what on earth  the phrase is the right one  was a venetian gondolier doing at chenonceaux  he had been brought from venice gondola and all by the mistress of the charming house to paddle about on the cher our meeting was affectionate though there was a kind of violence in seeing him so far from home  he was too well dressed too well fed he had grown stout and his nose had the tinge of good claret  he re marked that the life of the household to which he had the honor to belong was that of a casa regia which must have been a great change for poor checco whose habits in venice were not regal  however he was the sympathetic checco still and for five minutes after i left him i thought less about the little plea surehouse by the cher than about the palaces of the adriatic  but attention was not long in coming round to the charming structure that presently rose before us  the pale yellow front of the chateau the small scale of which is at first a surprise rises beyond a consider able court at the entrance of which a massive and detached round tower with a turret on its brow a relic of the building that preceded the actual villa appears to keep guard  this court is not enclosed  or is enclosed at least only by the gardens portions of which are at present in a state of violent reforma tion  therefore though chenonceaux has no great height its delicate facade stands up boldly enough this facade one of the most finished things in tou raine consists of two stories surmounted by an attic which as so often in the buildings of the french renaissance is the richest part of the house  the highpitched roof contains three windows of beautiful design covered with embroidered caps and flowering into crocketed spires  the window above the door is deeply niched it opens upon a balcony made in the form of a double pulpit  one of the most charm ing features of the front  chenonceaux is not large as i say but into its delicate compass is packed a great deal of history  history which differs from that of amboise and blois in being of the private and sen timental kind  the echoes of the place faint and far as they are today are not political but personal chenonceaux dates as a residence from the year 1515 when the shrewd thomas bohier a public functionary who had grown rich in handling the finances of nor mandy and had acquired the estate from a family which after giving it many feudal lords had fallen into poverty erected the present structure on the foundations of an old mill  the design is attributed with i know not what justice to pierre nepveu alias trinqueau the audacious architect of chambord  on the death of bohier the house passed to his son who however was forced under cruel pressure to surrender it to the crown in compensation for a socalled deficit in the accounts of the late superintendent of the trea sury  francis i held the place till his death but henry ii on ascending the throne presented it out of hand to that mature charmer the admired of two generations diana of poitiers  diana enjoyed it till the death of her protector but when this event oc curred the widow of the monarch who had been obliged to submit in silence for years to the ascend ency of a rival took the most pardonable of all the revenges with which the name of catherine de medici is associated and turned her outofdoors  diana was not in want of refuges and catherine went through the form of giving her chaumont in exchange but there was only one chenonceaux  catherine devoted herself to making the place more completely unique the feature that renders it sole of its kind is not ap preciated till you wander round to either side of the house  if a certain springing lightness is the charac teristic of chenonceaux if it bears in every line the aspect of a place of recreation  a place intended for delicate chosen pleasures  nothing can confirm this expression better than the strange unexpected move ment with which from behind it carries itself across the river  the earlier building stands in the water it had inherited the foundations of the mill destroyed by thomas bohier  the first step therefore had been taken upon solid piles of masonry and the ingenious catherine  she was a raffinee  simply proceeded to take the others  she continued the piles to the op posite bank of the cher and over them she threw a long straight gallery of two stories  this part of the chateau which looks simply like a house built upon a bridge and occupying its entire length is of course the great curiosity of chenonceaux  it forms on each floor a charming corridor which within is illuminated from either side by the flickering riverlight  the architecture of these galleries seen from without is less elegant than that of the main building but the aspect of the whole thing is delightful  i have spoken of chenonceaux as a villa using the word ad visedly for the place is neither a castle nor a palace it is a very exceptional villa but it has the villa quality  the look of being intended for life in com mon  this look is not at all contradicted by the wing across the cher which only suggests intimate pleasures as the french say  walks in pairs on rainy days games and dances on autumn nights together with as much as may be of moonlighted dialogue or silence in the course of evenings more genial still in the well marked recesses of windows  it is safe to say that such things took place there in the last century during the kindly reign of mon sieur and madame dupin  this period presents itself as the happiest in the annals of chenonceaux  i know not what festive train the great diana may have led and my imagination i am afraid is only feebly kindled by the records of the luxurious pastimes organized on the banks of the cher by the terrible daughter of the medici whose appreciation of the good things of life was perfectly consistent with a failure to perceive why others should live to enjoy them  the best society that ever assembled there was collected at chenon ceaux during the middle of the eighteenth century this was surely in france at least the age of good society the period when it was well for appreciative people to have been born  such people should of course have belonged to the fortunate few and not to the miserable many for the prime condition of a society being good is that it be not too large  the sixty years that preceded the french revolution were the golden age of fireside talk and of those pleasures which proceed from the presence of women in whom the social art is both instinctive and acquired  the women of that period were above all good company the fact is attested by a thousand documents  chenon ceaux offered a perfect setting to free conversation and infinite joyous discourse must have mingled with the liquid murmur of the cher  claude dupin was not only a great man of business but a man of honor and a patron of knowledge and his wife was gracious clever and wise  they had acquired this famous pro perty by purchase from one of the bourbons for chenonceaux for two centuries after the death of catherine de medici remained constantly in princely hands and it was transmitted to their son dupin de francueil grandfather of madame george sand  this lady in her correspondence lately published describes a visit that she paid more than thirty years ago to those members of her family who were still in posses sion  the owner of chenonceaux today is the daughter of an englishman naturalized in france  but i have wandered far from my story which is simply a sketch of the surface of the place  seen obliquely from either side in combination with its bridge and gallery the chateau is singular and fantastic a striking example of a wilful and capricious conception  unfortunately all caprices are not so graceful and successful and i grudge the honor of this one to the false and blood polluted catherine  to be exact i believe the arches of the bridge were laid by the elderly diana  it was catherine however who completed the monument within the house has been as usual restored  the staircases and ceilings in all the old royal residences of this part of france are the parts that have suffered least many of them have still much of the life of the old time about them  some of the chambers of che nonceaux however encumbered as they are with mo dern detail derive a sufficiently haunted and suggestive look from the deep setting of their beautiful windows which thickens the shadows and makes dark corners there is a charming little gothic chapel with its apse hanging over the water fastened to the left flank of the house  some of the upper balconies which look along the outer face of the gallery and either up or down the river are delightful protected nooks  we walked through the lower gallery to the other bank of the cher this fine apartment appeared to be for the moment a purgatory of ancient furniture  it terminates rather abruptly it simply stops with a blank wall there ought of course to have been a pavilion here though i prefer very much the old defect to any mo dern remedy  the wall is not so blank however but that it contains a door which opens on a rusty draw bridge  this drawbridge traverses the small gap which divides the end of the gallery from the bank of the stream  the house therefore does not literally rest on opposite edges of the cher but rests on one and just fails to rest on the other  the pavilion would have made that up but after a moment we ceased to miss this imaginary feature  we passed the little drawbridge and wandered awhile beside the river from this opposite bank the mass of the chateau looked more charming than ever and the little peaceful lazy cher where two or three men were fishing in the eventide flowed under the clear arches and between the solid pedestals of the part that spanned it with the softest vaguest light on its bosom  this was the right perspective we were looking across the river of time  the whole scene was deliciously mild  the moon came up we passed back through the gallery and strolled about a little longer in the gardens  it was very still  i met my old gondolier in the twilight he showed me his gondola but i hated somehow to see it there  i dont like as the french say to meler les genres  a gondola in a little flat french river the image was not less irritating if less injurious than the spectacle of a steamer in the grand canal which had driven me away from venice a year and a half before  we took our way back to the grand monarque and waited in the little innparlor for a late train to tours  we were not impatient for we had an ex cellent dinner to occupy us and even after we had dined we were still content to sit awhile and exchange remarks upon the superior civilization of france where else at a village inn should we have fared so well  where else should we have sat down to our refreshment without condescension  there were two or three countries in which it would not have been happy for us to arrive hungry on a sunday evening at so modest an hostelry  at the little inn at chenon ceaux the cuisine was not only excellent but the ser vice was graceful  we were waited on by mademoiselle and her mamma it was so that mademoiselle alluded to the elder lady as she uncorked for us a bottle of vouvray mousseux  we were very comfortable very genial we even went so far as to say to each other that vouvray mousseux was a delightful wine  from this opinion indeed one of our trio differed but this member of the party had already exposed herself to the charge of being too fastidious by declining to de scend from the carriage at chaumont and take that backstairs view of the castle    viii  without fastidiousness it was fair to declare on the other hand that the little inn at azaylerideau was very bad  it was terribly dirty and it was in charge of a fat megere whom the appearance of four trustful travellers  we were four with an illustrious fourth on that occasion  roused apparently to fury i attached great importance to this incongruous hostess for she uttered the only uncivil words i heard spoken in connection with any business of my own during a tour of some six weeks in france  breakfast not at azaylerideau therefore too trustful traveller or if you do so be either very meek or very bold breakfast not save under stress of circumstance but let no circumstance whatever prevent you from going to see the admirable chateau which is almost a rival of chenonceaux  the village lies close to the gates though after you pass these gates  you leave it well behind  a little avenue as at chenonceaux leads to the house making a pretty vista as you approach the sculptured doorway  azay is a most perfect and beautiful thing i should place it third in any list of the great houses of this part of france in which these houses should be ranked according to charm  for beauty of detail it comes after blois and chenon ceaux but it comes before amboise and chambord on the other hand of course it is inferior in majesty to either of these vast structures  like chenonceaux it is a watery place though it is more meagrely moated than the little chateau on the cher  it consists of a large square corps de logis with a round tower at each angle rising out of a somewhat too slumberous pond  the water  the water of the indre  sur rounds it but it is only on one side that it bathes its feet in the moat  on one of the others there is a little terrace treated as a garden and in front there is a wide court formed by a wing which on the right comes forward  this front covered with sculptures is of the richest stateliest effect  the court is ap proachcd by a bridge over the pond and the house would reflect itself in this wealth of water if the water were a trifle less opaque  but there is a certain stagnation  it affects more senses than one  about the picturesque pools of azay  on the hither side of the bridge is a garden overshadowed by fine old sycamores  a garden shut in by greenhouses and by a fine lastcentury gateway flanked with twin lodges beyond the chateau and the standing waters behind it is a socalled parc which however it must be con fessed has little of parklike beauty  the old houses many of them that is remain in france but the old timber does not remain and the denuded aspect of the few acres that surround the chateaux of touraine is pitiful to the traveller who has learned to take the measure of such things from the manors and castles of england  the domain of the lordly chaumont is that of an english suburban villa and in that and in other places there is little suggestion in the untended aspect of walk and lawns of the vigilant british gardener  the manor of azay as seen today dates from the early part of the sixteenth century and the industrious abbe chevalier in his very entertaining though slightly rosecolored book on touraine  promenades pittoresque en touraine tours 1869 speaks of it as perhaps the purest expres sion of the belle renaissance francaise  its height he goes on is divided between two stories terminat ing under the roof in a projecting entablature which imitates a row of machicolations  carven chimneys and tall dormer windows covered with imagery rise from the roofs turrets on brackets of elegant shape hang with the greatest lightness from the angles of the building  the soberness of the main lines the harmony of the empty spaces and those that are filled out the prominence of the crowning parts the delicacy of all the details constitute an enchanting whole  and then the abbe speaks of the admirable staircase which adorns the north front and which with its extention inside constitutes the principal treasure of azay  the staircase passes beneath one of the richest of porticos  a portico over which a monumental salamander indulges in the most deco rative contortions  the sculptured vaults of stone which cover the windings of the staircase within the fruits flowers ciphers heraldic signs are of the noblest effect  the interior of the chateau is rich comfortable extremely modern but it makes no picture that compares with its external face about which with its charming proportions its profuse yet not extravagant sculpture there is something very tranquil and pure  i took particular fancy to the roof high steep old with its slope of bluish slate and the way the weatherworn chimneys seemed to grow out of it like living things out of a deep soil the only defect of the house is the blankness and bareness of its walls which have none of those delicate parasites attached to them that one likes to see on the surface of old dwellings  it is true that this bareness results in a kind of silvery whiteness of complexion which carries out the tone of the quiet pools and even that of the scanty and shadeless park    ix  i hardly know what to say about the tone of langeais which though i have left it to the end of my sketch formed the objective point of the first ex cursion i made from tours  langeais is rather dark and gray it is perhaps the simplest and most severe of all the castles of the loire  i dont know why i should have gone to see it before any other unless it be because i remembered the duchesse de langeais who figures in several of balzacs novels and found this association very potent  the duchesse de lan geais is a somewhat transparent fiction but the castle from which balzac borrowed the title of his heroine is an extremely solid fact  my doubt just above as to whether i should pronounce it excep tionally grey came from my having seen it under a sky which made most things look dark  i have how ever a very kindly memory of that moist and melan choly afternoon which was much more autumnal than many of the days that followed it  langeais lies down the loire near the river on the opposite side from tours and to go to it you will spend half an hour in the train  you pass on the way the chateau de luynes which with its round towers catching the afternoon light looks uncommonly well on a hill at a distance you pass also the ruins of the castle of cinqmars the ancestral dwelling of the young favorite of louis xiii the victim of richelieu the hero of alfred de vignys novel which is usually re commended to young ladies engaged in the study of french  langeais is very imposing and decidedly sombre it marks the transition from the architecture of defence to that of elegance  it rises massive and perpendicular out of the centre of the village to which it gives its name and which it entirely domi nates so that as you stand before it in the crooked and empty street there is no resource for you but to stare up at its heavy overhanging cornice and at the huge towers surmounted with extinguishers of slate if you follow this street to the end however you encounter in abundance the usual embellishments of a french village little ponds or tanks with women on their knees on the brink pounding and thumping a lump of saturated linen brown old crones the tone of whose facial hide makes their nightcaps worn by day look dazzling little alleys perforating the thick ness of a row of cottages and showing you behind as a glimpse the vividness of a green garden  in the rear of the castle rises a hill which must formerly have been occupied by some of its appurtenances and which indeed is still partly enclosed within its court  you may walk round this eminence which with the small houses of the village at its base shuts in the castle from behind  the enclosure is not defiantly guarded however for a small rough path which you presently reach leads up to an open gate this gate admits you to a vague and rather limited parc which covers the crest of the hill and through which you may walk into the gardens of castle these gardens of small extent confront the dark walls with their brilliant parterres and covering the gradual slope of the hill form as it were the fourth side of the court  this is the stateliest view of the chateau which looks to you sufficiently grim and gray as after asking leave of a neat young woman who sallies out to learn your errand you sit there on a garden bench and take the measure of the three tall towers attached to this inner front and forming sever ally the cage of a staircase  the huge bracketed cor nice one of the features of langeais which is merely ornamental as it is not machicolated though it looks so is continued on the inner face as well  the whole thing has a fine feudal air though it was erected on the rains of feudalism  the main event in the history of the castle is the marriage of anne of brittany to her first husband charles viii which took place in its great hall in 1491  into this great hall we were introduced by the neat young woman  into this great hall and into sundry other halls winding staircases galleries chambers  the cicerone of langeais is in too great a hurry the fact is pointed out in the excellent guide joanne  this illdissimulated vice however is to be observed in the country of the loire in every one who carries a key  it is true that at langeais there is no great occasion to indulge in the tourists weak ness of dawdling for the apartments though they contain many curious odds and ends of antiquity are not of firstrate interest  they are cold and musty indeed with that touching smell of old furniture as all apartments should be through which the insatiate american wanders in the rear of a bored domestic pausing to stare at a faded tapestry or to read the name on the frame of some simpering portrait  to return to tours my companion and i had counted on a train which as is not uncommon in france existed only in the indicateur des chemins de fer and instead of waiting for another we engaged a vehicle to take us home  a sorry carriole or patache it proved to be with the accessories of a lumbering white mare and a little wizened ancient peasant who had put on in honor of the occasion a new blouse of extraordinary stiffness and blueness  we hired the trap of an energetic woman who put it to with her own hands women in touraine and the b1esois appearing to have the best of it in the business of letting vehicles as well as in many other industries  there is in fact no branch of human activity in which one is not liable in france to find a woman engaged  women indeed are not priests but priests are more or less women  they are not in the army it may be said but then they are the army  they are very formidable  in france one must count with the women  the drive back from langeais to tours was long slow cold we had an occasional spatter of rain  but the road passes most of the way close to the loire and there was some thing in our jogtrot through the darkening land beside the flowing river which it was very possible to enjoy    x  the consequence of my leaving to the last my little mention of loches is that space and opportunity fail me and yet a brief and hurried account of that extra ordinary spot would after all be in best agreement with my visit  we snatched a fearful joy my companion and i the afternoon we took the train for loches the weather this time had been terribly against us again and again a day that promised fair became hope lessly foul after lunch  at last we determined that if we could not make this excursion in the sunshine we would make it with the aid of our umbrellas  we grasped them firmly and started for the station where we were detained an unconscionable time by the evolu tions outside of certain trains laden with liberated and exhilarated conscripts who their term of service ended were about to be restored to civil life  the trains in touraine are provoking they serve as little as possible for excursions  if they convey you one way at the right hour it is on the condition of bring ing you back at the wrong they either allow you far too little time to examine the castle or the ruin or they leave you planted in front of it for periods that outlast curiosity  they are perverse capricious ex asperating  it was a question of our having but an hour or two at loches and we could ill afford to sacri fice to accidents  one of the accidents however was that the rain stopped before we got there leaving be hind it a moist mildness of temperature and a cool and lowering sky which were in perfect agreement with the gray old city  loches is certainly one of the greatest impressions of the traveller in central france  the largest cluster of curious things that presents itself to his sight  it rises above the valley of the indre the charming stream set in meadows and sedges which wanders through the province of berry and through many of the novels of madame george sand lifting from the summit of a hill which it covers to the base a confusion of terraces ramparts towers and spires  having but little time as i say we scaled the hill amain and wandered briskly through this labyrinth of antiquities  the rain had decidedly stopped and save that we had our train on our minds we saw loches to the best advantage  we enjoyed that sensation with which the conscientious tourist is  or ought to be  well acquainted and for which at any rate he has a formula in his roughandready language  we experienced as they say most odious of verbs an agreeable disappointment  we were surprised and delighted we had not suspected that loches was so good  i hardly know what is best there the strange and impressive little collegial church with its romanesque atrium or narthex its doorways covered with primitive sculpture of the richest kind its treasure of a socalled pagan altar embossed with fighting warriors its three pyramidal domes so unexpected so sinister which i have not met elsewhere in church architecture or the huge square keep of the eleventh century  the most clifflike tower i remember whose immeasurable thick ness i did not penetrate or the subterranean mysteries of two other less striking but not less historic dungeons into which a terribly imperative little cicerone intro duced us with the aid of downward ladders ropes torches warnings extended hands and many fearful anecdotes  all in impervious darkness  these horrible prisons of loches at an incredible distance below the daylight were a favorite resource of louis xi and were for the most part i believe constructed by him one of the towers of the castle is garnished with the hooks or supports of the celebrated iron cage in which he confined the cardinal la balue who survived so much longer than might have been expected this extra ordinary mixture of seclusion and exposure  all these things form part of the castle of loches whose enorm ous enceinte covers the whole of the top of the hill and abounds in dismantled gateways in crooked passages in winding lanes that lead to postern doors in long facades that look upon terraces interdicted to the visitor who perceives with irritation that they com mand magnificent views  these views are the property of the subprefect of the department who resides at the chateau de loches and who has also the enjoy ment of a garden  a garden compressed and curtailed as those of old castles that perch on hilltops are apt to be  containing a horsechestnut tree of fabulous size a tree of a circumference so vast and so perfect that the whole population of loches might sit in con centric rows beneath its boughs  the gem of the place however is neither the big marronier nor the collegial church nor the mighty dungeon nor the hideous prisons of louis xi it is simply the tomb of agnes sorel la belle des belles so many years the mistress of charles vii she was buried in 1450 in the collegial church whence in the beginning of the present century her remains with the monument that marks them were transferred to one of the towers of the castle  she has always i know not with what justice enjoyed a fairer fame than most ladies who have occupied her position and this fairness is expressed in the delicate statue that surmounts her tomb  it represents her lying there in lovely demureness her hands folded with the best modesty a little kneeling angel at either side of her head and her feet hidden in the folds of her decent robe resting upon a pair of couchant lambs innocent reminders of her name  agnes however was not lamblike inasmuch as according to popular tradition at least she exerted herself sharply in favor of the ex pulsion of the english from france  it is one of the suggestions of loches that the young charles vii hard put to it as he was for a treasury and a capital  le roi de bourges he was called at paris  was yet a rather privileged mortal to stand up as he does before posterity between the noble joan and the gentille agnes deriving however much more honor from one of these companions than from the other  almost as delicate a relic of antiquity as this fascinating tomb is the exquisite oratory of anne of brittany among the apartments of the castle the only chamber worthy of note  this small room hardly larger than a closet and forming part of the addition made to the edifice by charles viii is embroidered over with the curious and remarkably decorative device of the ermine and festooned cord  the objects in themselves are not especially graceful but the constant repetition of the figure on the walls and ceiling produces an effect of richness in spite of the modern whitewash with which if i remember rightly they have been endued  the little streets of loches wander crookedly down the hill and are full of charming pictorial  bits an old town gate passing under a mediaeval tower which is orna mented by gothic windows and the empty niches of statues a meagre but delicate hotel de ville of the renaissance nestling close beside it a curious chancel lerie of the middle of the sixteenth century with mythological figures and a latin inscription on the front  both of these latter buildings being rather un expected features of the huddled and precipitous little town  loches has a suburb on the other side of the indre which we had contented ourselves with looking down at from the heights while we wondered whether even if it had not been getting late and our train were more accommodating we should care to take our way across the bridge and look up that bust in terracotta of francis i which is the principal ornament of the chateau de sansac and the faubourg of beaulieu  i think we decided that we should not that we were already quite well enough acquainted with the nasal profile of that monarch    xi  i know not whether the exact limits of an excur sion as distinguished from a journey have ever been fixed at any rate it seemed none of my business at tours to settle the question  therefore though the making of excursions had been the purpose of my stay i thought it vain while i started for bourges to determine to which category that little expedition might belong  it was not till the third day that i re turned to tours and the distance traversed for the most part after dark was even greater than i had sup posed  that however was partly the fault of a tire some wait at vierzon where i had more than enough time to dine very badly at the buffet and to observe the proceedings of a family who had entered my rail way carriage at tours and had conversed unreservedly for my benefit all the way from that station  a family whom it entertained me to assign to the class of petite noblesse de province  their noble origin was confirmed by the way they all made maigre in the refreshment oom it happened to be a friday as if it had been possible to do anything else  they ate two or three omelets apiece and ever so many little cakes while the positive talkative mother watched her children as the waiter handed about the roast fowl  i was destined to share the secrets of this family to the end for when i had taken place in the empty train that was in waiting to convey us to bourges the same vigilant woman pushed them all on top of me into my com partment though the carriages on either side con tained no travellers at all  it was better i found to have dined even on omelets and little cakes at the station at vierzon than at the hotel at bourges which when i reached it at nine oclock at night did not strike me as the prince of hotels  the inns in the smaller provincial towns in france are all as the term is commercial and the commisvoyageur is in triumphant possession  i saw a great deal of him for several weeks after this for he was apparently the only traveller in the southern provinces and it was my daily fate to sit opposite to him at tables dhote and in railway trains  he may be known by two infallible signs  his hands are fat and he tucks his napkin into his shirtcollar  in spite of these idiosyncrasies he seemed to me a reserved and inoffensive person with singularly little of the demonstrative goodhumor that he has been described as possessing  i saw no one who re minded me of balzacs illustre gaudissart and in deed in the course of a months journey through a large part of france i heard so little desultory con versation that i wondered whether a change had not come over the spirit of the people  they seemed to me as silent as americans when americans have not been introduced and infinitely less addicted to ex changing remarks in railway trains and at tables dhote the colloquial and cursory english a fact per haps not worth mentioning were it not at variance with that reputation which the french have long en joyed of being a preeminently sociable nation  the common report of the character of a people is how ever an indefinable product and it is apt to strike the traveller who observes for himself as very wide of the mark  the english who have for ages been de scribed mainly by the french as the dumb stiff unapproachable race present today a remarkable ap pearance of goodhumor and garrulity and are dis tinguished by their facility of intercourse  on the other hand any one who has seen half a dozen frenchmen pass a whole day together in a railway carriage without breaking silence is forced to believe that the traditional reputation of these gentlemen is simply the survival of some primitive formula  it was true doubtless before the revolution but there have been great changes since then  the question of which is the better taste to talk to strangers or to hold your tongue is a matter apart i incline to believe that the french reserve is the result of a more definite con ception of social behavior  i allude to it only be came it is at variance with the national fame and at the same time is compatible with a very easy view of life in certain other directions  on some of these latter points the boule dor at bourges was full of instruction boasting as it did of a hall of reception in which amid old boots that had been brought to be cleaned old linen that was being sorted for the wash and lamps of evil odor that were awaiting replenish ment a strange familiar promiscuous household life went forward  small scullions in white caps and aprons slept upon greasy benches the boots sat staring at you while you fumbled helpless in a row of pigeon holes for your candlestick or your key and amid the coming and going of the commisvoyageurs a little sempstress bent over the undergarments of the hostess  the latter being a heavy stem silent woman who looked at people very hard  it was not to be looked at in that manner that one had come all the way from tours so that within ten minutes after my arrival i sallied out into the dark ness to get somehow and somewhere a happier im pression  however late in the evening i may arrive at a place i cannot go to bed without an impression the natural place at bourges to look for one seemed to be the cathedral which moreover was the only thing that could account for my presence dans cette galere  i turned out of a small square in front of the hotel and walked up a narrow sloping street paved with big rough stones and guiltless of a footway it was a splendid starlight night the stillness of a sleeping ville de province was over everything i had the whole place to myself  i turned to my right at the top of the street where presently a short vague lane brought me into sight of the cathedral  i ap proached it obliquely from behind it loomed up in the darkness above me enormous and sublime  it stands on the top of the large but not lofty eminence over which bourges is scattered  a very good position as french cathedrals go for they are not all so nobly situated as chartres and laon  on the side on which i approached it the south it is tolerably well ex posed though the precinct is shabby in front it is rather too much shut in  these defects however it makes up for on the north side and behind where it presents itself in the most admirable manner to the garden of the archeveche which has been arranged as a public walk with the usual formal alleys of the jardin francais  i must add that i appreciated these points only on the following day  as i stood there in the light of the stars many of which had an autumnal sharpness while others were shooting over the heavens the huge rugged vessel of the church overhung me in very much the same way as the black hull of a ship at sea would overhang a solitary swimmer  it seemed colossal stupendous a dark leviathan  the next morning which was lovely i lost no time in going back to it and found with satisfaction that the daylight did it no injury  the cathedral of bourges is indeed magnificently huge and if it is a good deal wanting in lightness and grace it is perhaps only the more imposing  i read in the excellent hand book of m joanne that it was projected des 1172 but commenced only in the first years of the thirteenth century  the nave the writer adds was finished tant bien que mal faute de ressources the facade is of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in its lower part and of the fourteenth in its upper  the allusion to the nave means the omission of the transepts  the west front consists of two vast but imperfect towers one of which the south is immensely buttressed so that its outline slopes forward like that of a pyramid being the taller of the two  if they had spires these towers would be prodigious as it is given the rest of the church they are wanting in elevation  there are five deeply recessed portals all in a row each surmounted with a gable the gable over the central door being exceptionally high  above the porches which give the measure of its width the front rears itself piles itself on a great scale carried up by gal leries arches windows sculptures and supported by the extraordinarily thick buttresses of which i have spoken and which though they embellish it with deep shadows thrown sidewise do not improve its style the portals especially the middle one are extremely interesting they are covered with curious early sculp tures  the middle one however i must describe alone  it has no less than six rows of figures  the others have four  some of which notably the upper one are still in their places  the arch at the top has three tiers of elaborate imagery  the upper of these is divided by the figure of christ in judgment of great size stiff and terrible with outstretched arms  on either side of him are ranged three or four angels with the instruments of the passion  beneath him in the second frieze stands the angel of justice with his scales and on either side of him is the vision of the last judgment  the good prepare with infinite titilla tion and complacency to ascend to the skies while the bad are dragged pushed hurled stuffed crammed into pits and caldrons of fire  there is a charming detail in this section  beside the angel on the right where the wicked are the prey of demons stands a little female figure that of a child who with hands meekly folded and head gently raised waits for the stern angel to decide upon her fate  in this fate how ever a dreadful big devil also takes a keen interest he seems on the point of appropriating the tender creature he has a face like a goat and an enormous hooked nose  but the angel gently lays a hand upon the shoulder of the little girl  the movement is full of dignity  as if to say no she belongs to the other side  the frieze below represents the general re surrection with the good and the wicked emerging from their sepulchres  nothing can be more quaint and charming than the difference shown in their way of responding to the final trump  the good get out of their tombs with a certain modest gayety an alacrity tempered by respect one of them kneels to pray as soon as he has disinterred himself  you may know the wicked on the other hand by their extreme shy ness they crawl out slowly and fearfully they hang back and seem to say oh dear  these elaborate sculptures full of ingenuous intention and of the reality of early faith are in a remarkable state of pre servation they bear no superficial signs of restoration and appear scarcely to have suffered from the centu ries  they are delightfully expressive the artist had the advantage of knowing exactly the effect he wished to produce  the interior of the cathedral has a great simplicity and majesty and above all a tremendous height  the nave is extraordinary in this respect it dwarfs every thing else i know  i should add however that i am in architecture always of the opinion of the last speaker  any great building seems to me while i look at it the ultimate expression  at any rate during the hour that i sat gazing along the high vista of bourges the interior of the great vessel corresponded to my vision of the evening before  there is a tranquil largeness a kind of infinitude about such an edifice it soothes and purifies the spirit it illuminates the mind  there are two aisles on either side in addi tion to the nave  five in all  and as i have said there are no transepts an omission which lengthens the vista so that from my place near the door the central jewelled window in the depths of the perpen dicular choir seemed a mile or two away  the second or outward of each pair of aisles is too low and the first too high without this inequality the nave would appear to take an even more prodigious flight  the double aisles pass all the way round the choir the windows of which are inordinately rich in magnificent old glass  i have seen glass as fine in other churches but i think i have never seen so much of it at once  beside the cathedral on the north is a curious structure of the fourteenth or fifteenth century which looks like an enormous flying buttress with its sup port sustaining the north tower  it makes a massive arch high in the air and produces a romantic effect as people pass under it to the open gardens of the archeveche which extend to a considerable distance in the rear of the church  the structure supporting the arch has the girth of a largeish house and con tains chambers with whose uses i am unacquainted but to which the deep pulsations of the cathedral the vibration of its mighty bells and the roll of its organ tones must be transmitted even through the great arm of stone  the archiepiscopal palace not walled in as at tours is visible as a stately habitation of the last century now in course of reparation in consequence of a fire from this side and from the gardens of the palace the nave of the cathedral is visible in all its great length and height with its extraordinary multitude of supports  the gardens aforesaid accessible through tall iron gates are the promenade  the tuileries  of the town and very pretty in themselves are immensely set off by the overhanging church  it was warm and sunny the benches were empty i sat there a long time in that pleasant state of mind which visits the traveller in foreign towns when he is not too hurried while he wonders where he had better go next  the straight unbroken line of the roof of the cathedral was very noble but i could see from this point how much finer the effect would have been if the towers which had dropped almost out of sight might have been carried still higher  the archiepiscopal gardens look down at one end over a sort of esplanade or suburban avenue lying on a lower level on which they open and where several detachments of soldiers bourges is full of soldiers had just been drawn up the civil population was also collecting and i saw that something was going to happen  i learned that a private of the chasseurs was to be broken for stealing and every one was eager to behold the cere mony  sundry other detachments arrived on the ground besides many of the military who had come as a matter of taste  one of them described to me the process of degradation from the ranks and i felt for a moment a hideous curiosity to see it under the influence of which i lingered a little  but only a little the hateful nature of the spectacle hurried me away at the same time that others were hurrying for ward  as i turned my back upon it i reflected that human beings are cruel brutes though i could not flatter myself that the ferocity of the thing was ex clusively french  in another country the concourse would have been equally great and the moral of it all seemed to be that military penalties are as terrible as military honors are gratifying    xii  the cathedral is not the only lion of bourges the house of jacques coeur is an object of interest scarcely less positive  this remarkable man had a very strange history and he too was broken like the wretched soldier whom i did not stay to see  he has been re habilitated however by an age which does not fear the imputation of paradox and a marble statue of him ornaments the street in front of his house  to interpret him according to this image  a womanish figure in a long robe and a turban with big bare arms and a dramatic pose  would be to think of him as a kind of truculent sultana  he wore the dress of his period but his spirit was very modern he was a van derbilt or a rothschild of the fifteenth century  he supplied the ungrateful charles vii with money to pay the troops who under the heroic maid drove the english from french soil  his house which today is used as a palais de justice appears to have been re garded at the time it was built very much as the resi dence of mr vanderbilt is regarded in new york today it stands on the edge of the hill on which most of the town is planted so that behind it plunges down to a lower level and if you approach it on that side as i did to come round to the front of it you have to ascend a longish flight of steps  the back of old must have formed a portion of the city wall at any rate it offers to view two big towers which joanne says were formerly part of the defence of bourges from the lower level of which i speak  the square in front of the postoffice  the palace of jacques coeur looks very big and strong and feudal from the upper street in front of it it looks very handsome and deli cate  to this street it presents two stories and a con siderable length of facade and it has both within and without a great deal of curious and beautiful detail above the portal in the stonework are two false win dows in which two figures a man and a woman ap parently household servants are represented in sculp ture as looking down into the street  the effect is homely yet grotesque and the figures are sufficiently living to make one commiserate them for having been condemned in so dull a town to spend several cen turies at the window  they appear to be watching for the return of their master who left his beautiful house one morning and never came back  the history of jacques coeur which has been written by m pierre clement in a volume crowned by the french academy is very wonderful and in teresting but i have no space to go into it here there is no more curious example and few more tragical of a great fortune crumbling from one day to the other or of the antique superstition that the gods grow jealous of human success  merchant million naire banker shipowner royal favorite and minister of finance explorer of the east and monopolist of the glittering trade between that quarter of the globe and his own great capitalist who had anticipated the brilliant operations of the present time he expiated his prosperity by poverty imprisonment and torture the obscure points in his career have been elucidated by m clement who has drawn moreover a very vivid picture of the corrupt and exhausted state of france during the middle of the fifteenth century  he has shown that the spoliation of the great merchant was a deliberately calculated act and that the king sacrificed him without scruple or shame to the avidity of a sin gularly villanous set of courtiers  the whole story is an extraordinary picture of highhanded rapacity  the crudest possible assertion of the right of the stronger the victim was stripped of his property but escaped with his life made his way out of france and betak ing himself to italy offered his services to the pope it is proof of the consideration that he enjoyed in europe and of the variety of his accomplishments that calixtus iii should have appointed him to take command of a fleet which his holiness was fitting out against the turks  jacques coeur however was not destined to lead it to victory  he died shortly after the expedition had started in the island of chios in 1456  the house of bourges his native place testifies in some degree to his wealth and splendor though it has in parts that want of space which is striking in many of the buildings of the middle ages  the court indeed is on a large scale ornamented with turrets and arcades with several beautiful windows and with sculptures inserted in the walls representing the various sources of the great fortune of the owner  m pierre clement describes this part of the house as having been of an incomparable richesse  an estimate of its charms which seems slightly exaggerated today  there is however something delicate and familiar in the basreliefs of which i have spoken little scenes of agriculture and industry which show that the pro prietor was not ashamed of calling attention to his harvests and enterprises  today we should question the taste of such allusions even in plastic form in the house of a merchant prince say in the fifth avenue  why is it therefore that these quaint little panels at bourges do not displease us  it is perhaps because things very ancient never for some mysterious reason appear vulgar  this fifteenthcentury million naire with his palace his egotistical sculptures may have produced that impression on some critical spirits of his own day  the portress who showed me into the building was a dear litte old woman with the gentlest sweetest saddest face  a little white aged face with dark pretty eyes  and the most considerate manner  she took me up into an upper hall where there were a couple of curious chimneypieces and a fine old oaken roof the latter representing the hollow of a long boat there is a certain oddity in a native of bourges  an inland town if there ever was one without even a river to call a river to encourage nautical ambitions  hav ing found his end as admiral of a fleet but this boat shaped roof which is extremely graceful and is re peated in another apartment would suggest that the imagination of  jacques coeur was fond of riding the waves  indeed as he trafficked in oriental products and owned many galleons it is probable that he was personally as much at home in certain mediterranean ports as in the capital of the pastoral berry  if when he looked at the ceilings of his mansion he saw his boats upside down this was only a suggestion of the shortest way of emptying them of their treasures  he is presented in person above one of the great stone chimneypieces in company with his wife macee de leodepart  i like to write such an extraordinary name carved in white stone the two sit playing at chess at an open window through which they appear to give their attention much more to the passersby than to the game  they are also exhibited in other attitudes though i do not recognize them in the composition on top of one of the fireplaces which represents the battle ments of a castle with the defenders little figures be tween the crenellations hurling down missiles with a great deal of fury and expression  it would have been hard to believe that the man who surrounded himself with these friendly and humorous devices had been guilty of such wrongdoing as to call down the heavy hand of justice  it is a curious fact however that bourges contains legal associations of a purer kind than the prosecution of jacques coeur which in spite of the rehabilitations of history can hardly be said yet to have terminated inasmuch as the lawcourts of the city are installed in his quondam residence  at a short distance from it stands the hotel cujas one of the curiosities of bourges and the habitation for many years of the great juris consult who revived in the sixteenth century the study of the roman law and professed it during the close of his life in the university of the capital of berry the learned cujas had in spite of his sedentary pur suits led a very wandering life he died at bourges in the year 1590  sedentary pursuits is perhaps not exactly what i should call them having read in the biographie universelle sole source of my knowledge of the renowned cujacius that his usual manner of study was to spread himself on his belly on the floor he did not sit down he lay down and the biographie universelle has for so grave a work an amusing pic ture of the short fat untidy scholar dragging himself a plat ventre across his room from one pile of books to the other  the house in which these singular gym nastics took place and which is now the headquarters of the gendarmerie is one of the most picturesque at bourges  dilapidated and discolored it has a charm ing renaissance front  a high wall separates it from the street and on this wall which is divided by a large open gateway are perched two overhanging turrets  the open gateway admits you to the court beyond which the melancholy mansion erects itself decorated also with turrets with fine old windows and with a beautiful tone of faded red brick and rusty stone  it is a charming encounter for a provincial by street one of those accidents in the hope of which the traveller with a propensity for sketching whether on a little paper block or on the tablets of his brain decides to turn a corner at a venture  a brawny gen darme in his shirtsleeves was polishing his boots in the court an ancient knotted vine forlorn of its clusters hung itself over a doorway and dropped its shadow on the rough grain of the wall  the place was very sketchable  i am sorry to say however that it was almost the only bit  various other curious old houses are supposed to exist at bourges and i wandered vaguely about in search of them  but i had little success and i ended by becoming sceptical bourges is a ville de province in the full force of the term especially as applied invidiously  the streets narrow tortuous and dirty have very wide cobble stones the houses for the most part are shabby with out local color  the look of things is neither modern nor antique  a kind of mediocrity of middle age there is an enormous number of blank walls  walls of gardens of courts of private houses  that avert themselves from the street as if in natural chagrin at there being so little to see  round about is a dull flat featureless country on which the magnificent cathedral looks down  there is a peculiar dulness and ugliness in a french town of this type which i must immediately add is not the most frequent one in italy everything has a charm a color a grace even desolation and ennui  in england a cathedral city may be sleepy but it is pretty sure to be mellow  in the course of six weeks spent en province however i saw few places that had not more expression than bourges  i went back to the cathedral that after all was a feature  then i returned to my hotel where it was time to dine and sat down as usual with the commis voyageurs who cut their bread on their thumb and partook of every course and after this repast i re paired for a while to the cafe which occupied a part of the basement of the inn and opened into its court this cafe was a friendly homely sociable spot where it seemed the habit of the master of the establishment to tutoyer his customers and the practice of the cus tomers to tutoyer the waiter  under these circum stances the waiter of course felt justified in sitting down at the same table with a gentleman who had come in and asked him for writing materials  he served this gentleman with a horrible little portfolio covered with shiny black cloth and accompanied with two sheets of thin paper three wafers and one of those instruments of torture which pass in france for pens  these being the utensils invariably evoked by such a request and then finding himself at leisure he placed himself opposite and began to write a letter of his own  this trifling incident reminded me afresh that france is a democratic country  i think i re ceived an admonition to the same effect from the free familiar way in which the game of whist was going on just behind me  it was attended with a great deal of noisy pleasantry flavored every now and then with a dash of irritation  there was a young man of whom i made a note he was such a beautiful specimen of his class  sometimes he was very facetious chatter ing joking punning showing off then as the game went on and he lost and had to pay the consomma tion he dropped his amiability slanged his partner declared he wouldnt play any more and went away in a fury  nothing could be more perfect or more amusing than the contrast  the manner of the whole affair was such as i apprehend one would not have seen among our englishspeaking people both the jauntiness of the first phase and the petulance of the second  to hold the balance straight however i may remark that if the men were all fearful cads they were with their cigarettes and their inconsistency less heavy less brutal than our dear englishspeaking cad just as the bright little cafe where a robust mater familias doling out sugar and darning a stocking sat in her place under the mirror behind the comptoir was a much more civilized spot than a british public house or a commercial room with pipes and whiskey or even than an american saloon    xiii  it is very certain that when i left tours for le mans it was a journey and not an excursion for i had no intention of coming back  the question in deed was to get away  no easy matter in france in the early days of october when the whole jeunesse of the country is going back to school  it is accom panied apparently with parents and grandparents and it fills the trains with little palefaced lyceens who gaze out of the windows with a longing lingering air not unnatural on the part of small members of a race in which life is intense who are about to be restored to those big educative barracks that do such violence to our american appreciation of the oppor tunities of boyhood  the train stopped every five minutes but fortunately the country was charming  hilly and bosky eminently goodhumored and dotted here and there with a smart little chateau  the old capital of the province of the maine which has given its name to a great american state is a fairly interest ing town but i confess that i found in it less than i expected to admire  my expectations had doubtless been my own fault there is no particular reason why le mans should fascinate  it stands upon a hill indeed  a much better hill than the gentle swell of bourges  this hill however is not steep in all direc tions from the railway as i arrived it was not even perceptible  since i am making comparisons i may remark that on the other hand the boule dor at le mans is an appreciably better inn than the boule dor at bourges  it looks out upon a small marketplace which has a certain amount of character and seems to be slipping down the slope on which it lies though it has in the middle an ugly halle or circular market house to keep it in position  at le mans as at bourges my first business was with the cathedral to which i lost no time in directing my steps  it suf fered by juxtaposition to the great church i had seen a few days before yet it has some noble features  it stands on the edge of the eminence of the town which falls straight away on two sides of it and makes a striking mass bristling behind as you see it from below with rather small but singularly numerous flying buttresses  on my way to it i happened to walk through the one street which contains a few ancient and curious houses  a very crooked and untidy lane of really mediaeval aspect honored with the denomina tion of the grand rue  here is the house of queen berengaria  an absurd name as the building is of a date some three hundred years later than the wife of richard coeur de lion who has a sepulchral monu ment in the south aisle of the cathedral  the structure in question  very sketchable if the sketcher could get far enough away from it  is an elaborate little dusky facade overhanging the street ornamented with panels of stone which are covered with delicate renaissance sculpture  a fat old woman standing in the door of a small grocers shop next to it  a most gracious old woman with a bristling moustache and a charming manner  told me what the house was and also in dicated to me a rottenlooking brown wooden mansion in the same street nearer the cathedral as the maison scarron  the author of the roman comique and of a thousand facetious verses enjoyed for some years in the early part of his life a benefice in the cathedral of le mans which gave him a right to reside in one of the canonical houses  he was rather an odd canon but his history is a combination of oddities  he wooed the comic muse from the armchair of a cripple and in the same position  he was unable even to go down on his knees  prosecuted that other suit which made him the first husband of a lady of whom louis xiv was to be the second  there was little of comedy in the future madame de maintenon though after all there was doubtless as much as there need have been in the wife of a poor man who was moved to compose for his tomb such an epitaph as this which i quote from the biographie universelle   celui qui cy maintenant dort  fit plus de pitie que denvie  et souffrit mille fois la mort  avant que de perdre la vie  passant ne fais icy de bruit  et garde bien quil ne seveille  car voicy la premiere nuit  que le pauvre scarron sommeille    there is rather a quiet satisfactory place in front of the cathedral with some good bits in it notably a turret at the angle of one of the towers and a very fine steeproofed dwelling behind low walls which it overlooks with a tall iron gate  this house has two or three little pointed towers a big black precipitous roof and a general air of having had a history  there are houses which are scenes and there are houses which are only houses  the trouble with the domestic architecture of the united states is that it is not scenic thank heaven and the good fortune of an old structure like the turreted mansion on the hillside of le mans is that it is not simply a house  it is a per son as it were as well  it would be well indeed if it might have communicated a little of its personality to the front of the cathedral which has none of its own  shabby rusty unfinished this front has a romanesque portal but nothing in the way of a tower one sees from without at a glance the peculiarity of the church  the disparity between the romanesque nave which is small and of the twelfth century and the immense and splendid transepts and choir of a period a hundred years later  outside this end of the church rises far above the nave which looks merely like a long porch leading to it with a small and curious romanesque porch in its own south flank  the transepts shallow but very lofty display to the spectators in the place the reach of their two clerestory windows which occupy above the whole expanse of the wall  the south transept terminates in a sort of tower which is the only one of which the cathedral can boast  within the effect of the choir is superb it is a church in it self with the nave simply for a point of view  as i stood there i read in my murray that it has the stamp of the date of the perfection of pointed gothic and i found nothing to object to the remark  it suffers little by confrontation with bourges and taken in itself seems to me quite as fine  a passage of double aisles surrounds it with the arches that divide them sup ported on very thick round columns not clustered there are twelve chapels in this passage and a charm ing little lady chapel filled with gorgeous old glass the sustained height of this almost detached choir is very noble its lightness and grace its soaring sym metry carry the eye up to places in the air from which it is slow to descend  like tours like chartres like bourges apparently like all the french cathedrals and unlike several english ones le mans is rich in splendid glass  the beautiful upper windows of the choir make far aloft a sort of gallery of pictures blooming with vivid color  it is the south transept that contains the formless image  a clumsy stone woman lying on her back  which purports to represent queen berengaria aforesaid  the view of the cathedral from the rear is as usual very fine  a small garden behind it masks its base but you descend the hill to a large place de foire ad jacent to a fine old pubic promenade which is known as les jacobins a sort of miniature tuileries where i strolled for a while in rectangular alleys destitute of herbage and received a deeper impression of vanished things  the cathedral on the pedestal of its hill looks considerably farther than the fairground and the jacobins between the rather bare poles of whose straightly planted trees you may admire it at a con venient distance  i admired it till i thought i should remember it better than the event has proved and then i wandered away and looked at another curious old church notredamedelacouture  this sacred edifice made a picture for ten minutes but the picture has faded now  i reconstruct a yellowishbrown facade and a portal fretted with early sculptures but the details have gone the way of all incomplete sensations after you have stood awhile in the choir of the cathedral there is no sensation at le mans that goes very far  for some reason not now to be traced i had looked for more than this  i think the reason was to some extent simply in the name of the place for names on the whole whether they be good reasons or not are very active ones  le mans if i am not mistaken has a sturdy feudal sound suggests some thing dark and square a vision of old ramparts and gates  perhaps i had been unduly impressed by the fact accidentally revealed to me that henry ii first of the english plantagenets was born there  of course it is easy to assure ones self in advance but does it not often happen that one had rather not be assured there is a pleasure sometimes in running the risk of disappointment  i took mine such as it was quietly enough while i sat before dinner at the door of one of the cafes in the marketplace with a bitteretcuracao invaluable pretext at such an hour to keep me com pany  i remember that in this situation there came over me an impression which both included and ex cluded all possible disappointments  the afternoon was warm and still the air was admirably soft  the good manceaux in little groups and pairs were seated near me my ear was soothed by the fine shades of french enunciation by the detached syllables of that perfect tongue  there was nothing in particular in the prospect to charm it was an average french view yet i felt a charm a kind of sympathy a sense of the completeness of french life and of the lightness and brightness of the social air together with a desire to arrive at friendly judgments to express a positive interest  i know not why this transcendental mood should have descended upon me then and there but that idle halfhour in front of the cafe in the mild october afternoon suffused with human sounds is perhaps the most definite thing i brought away from le mans    xiv  i am shocked at finding just after this noble de claration of principles that in a little notebook which at that time i carried about with me the celebrated city of angers is denominated a sell  i reproduce this vulgar term with the greatest hesitation and only because it brings me more quickly to my point  this point is that angers belongs to the disagreeable class of old towns that have been as the english say done up  not the oldness but the newness of the place is what strikes the sentimental tourist today as he wanders with irritation along secondrate boulevards looking vaguely about him for absent gables  black angers in short is a victim of modern improvements and quite unworthy of its admirable name  a name which like that of le mans had always had to my eyes a highly picturesque value  it looks particularly well on the shakspearean page in king john where we imagine it uttered though such would not have been the utterance of the period with a fine old in sular accent  angers figures with importance in early english history it was the capital city of the plantagenet race home of that geoffrey of anjou who married as second husband the empress maud daughter of henry i and competitor of stephen and became father of henry ii first of the plantagenet kings born as we have seen at le mans  the facts create a natural presumption that angers will look historic i turned them over in my mind as i travelled in the train from le mans through a country that was really pretty and looked more like the usual english than like the usual french scenery with its fields cut up by hedges and a considerable rotundity in its trees  on my way from the station to the hotel however it became plain that i should lack a good pretext for passing that night at the cheval blanc i foresaw that i should have con tented myself before th e end of the day  i remained at the white horse only long enough to discover that it was an exceptionally good provincial inn one of the best that i encountered during six weeks spent in these establishments  stupidly and vulgarly rnodernized  that is an other phrase from my notebook and notebooks are not obliged to be reasonable  there are some narrow and tortuousstreets with a few curious old houses  i continue to quote there is a castle of which the ex terior is most extraordinary and there is a cathedral of moderate interest  it is fair to say that the chateau dangers is by itself worth a pilgrimage the only drawback is that you have seen it in a quarter of an hour  you cannot do more than look at it and one good look does your business  it has no beauty no grace no detail nothing that charms or detains you it is simply very old and very big  so big and so old that this simple impression is enough and it takes its place in your recollections as a perfect specimen of a superannuated stronghold  it stands at one end of the town surrounded by a huge deep moat which originally contained the waters of the maine now divided from it by a quay  the waterfront of angers is poor  wanting in color and in movement and there is always an effect of perversity in a town lying near a great river and yet not upon it  the loire is a few miles off but angers contents itself with a meagre affluent of that stream  the effect was naturally much better when the huge dark mass of the castle with its seventeen prodigious towers rose out of the protecting flood  these towers are of tremendous girth and soli dity they are encircled with great bands or hoops of white stone and are much enlarged at the base between them hang vast curtains of infinitely oldlook ing masonry apparently a dense conglomeration of slate the material of which the town was originally built thanks to rich quarries in the neighborhood and to which it owed its appellation of the black there are no windows no apertures and today no battlements nor roofs  these accessories were removed by henry iii so that in spite of its grimness and blackness the place has not even the interest of look ing like a prison it being as i supposed the essence of a prison not to be open to the sky  the only features of the enormous structure are the black sombre stretches and protrusions of wall the effect of which on so large a scale is strange and striking  begun by philip augustus and terminated by st louis the chateau dangers has of course a great deal of history the luckless fouquet the extravagant minister of finance of louis xiv whose fall from the heights of grandeur was so sudden and complete was confined here in 1661 just after his arrest which had taken place at nantes  here also huguenots and vendeans have suffered effective captivity  i walked round the parapet which protects the outer edge of the moat it is all up hill and the moat deepens and deepens till i came to the entrance which faces the town and which is as bare and strong as the rest  the concierge took me into the court but there was nothing to see  the place is used as a magazine of ammunition and the yard con tains a multitude of ugly buildings  the only thing to do is to walk round the bastions for the view but at the moment of my visit the weather was thick and the bastions began and ended with themselves  so i came out and took another look at the big black ex terior buttressed with whiteribbed towers and per ceived that a desperate sketcher might extract a picture from it especially if he were to bring in as they say the little black bronze statue of the good king rene a weak production of david dangers which standing within sight ornaments the melancholy faubourg  he would do much better however with the very striking old timbered house i suppose of the fifteenth century which is called the maison dadam and is easily the first specimen at angers of the domestic architecture of the past  this admirable house in the centre of the town gabled elaborately timbered and much restored is a really imposing monument  the basement is occupied by a linen draper who flourishes under the auspicious sign of the mere de famille and above his shop the tall front rises in five overhanging stories  as the house occupies the angle of a little place this front is double and the black beams and wooden supports displayed over a large surface and carved and interlaced have a high picturesqueness  the maison dadam is quite in the grand style and i am sorry to say i failed to learn what history attaches to its name  if i spoke just above of the cathedral as moderate i suppose i should beg its pardon for this serious charge was probably prompted by the fact that it consists only of a nave without side aisles  a little reflection now convinces me that such a form is a distinction and indeed i find it mentioned rather inconsistently in my notebook a little further on as extremely simple and grand  the nave is spoken of in the same volume as big serious and gothic though the choir and transepts are noted as very shallow  but it is not denied that the air of the whole thing is original and striking and it would therefore appear after all that the cathedral of angers built during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is a sufficiently honorable church the more that its high west front adorned with a very primitive gothic portal supports two elegant tapering spires between which unfortunately an ugly modern pavilion has been inserted  i remember nothing else at angers but the curious old cafe serin where after i had had my dinner at the inn i went and waited for the train which at nine oclock in the evening was to convey me in a couple of hours to nantes  an establishment remarkable for its great size and its air of tarnished splendor its brown gilding and smoky frescos as also for the fact that it was hidden away on the second floor of an un assuming house in an unilluminated street  it hardly seemed a place where you would drop in but when once you had found it it presented itself with the cathedral the castle and the maison dadam as one of the historical monuments of angers    xv  if i spent two nights at nantes it was for reasons of convenience rather than of sentiment though in deed i spent them in a big circular room which had a stately lofty lastcentury look  a look that con soled me a little for the whole place being dirty  the high oldfashioned inn it had a huge windy porte cochere and you climbed a vast black stone staircase to get to your room looked out on a dull square sur rounded with other tall houses and occupied on one side by the theatre a pompous building decorated with columns and statues of the muses  nantes be longs to the class of towns which are always spoken of as fine and its position near the mouth of the loire gives it i believe much commercial movement it is a spacious rather regular city looking in the parts that i traversed neither very fresh nor very venerable  it derives its principal character from the handsome quays on the loire which are overhung with tall eighteenthcentury houses very numerous too in the other streets  houses with big entresols marked by arched windows classic pediments balcony rails of fine old ironwork  these features exist in still better form at bordeaux but putting bordeaux aside nantes is quite architectural  the view up and down the quays has the cool neutral tone of color that one finds so often in french waterside places  the bright grayness which is the tone of french land scape art  the whole city has rather a grand or at least an eminently wellestablished air  during a day passed in it of course i had time to go to the musee the more so that i have a weakness for provincial museums  a sentiment that depends but little on the quality of the collection  the pictures may be bad but the place is often curious and indeed from bad pictures in certain moods of the mind there is a degree of entertainment to be derived  if they are tolerably old they are often touching but they must have a relative antiquity for i confess i can do no thing with works of art of which the badness is of receat origin  the cool still empty chambers in which indifferent collections are apt to be preserved the red brick tiles the diffused light the musty odor the mementos around you of dead fashions the snuffy custodian in a black skull cap who pulls aside a faded curtain to show you the lustreless gem of the museum  these things have a mild historical quality and the sallow canvases after all illustrate something many of those in the museum of nantes illustrate the taste of a successful warrior having been bequeathed to the city by napoleons marshal clarke created duc de feltre  in addition to these there is the usual number of specimens of the contemporary french school culled from the annual salons and presented to the museum by the state  wherever the traveller goes in france he is reminded of this very honorable practice  the purchase by the government of a cer tain number of pictures of the year which are pre sently distributed in the provinces  governments suc ceed each other and bid for success by different devices but the patronage of art is a plank as we should say here in every platform  the works of art are often illselected  there is an official taste which you immediately recognize  but the custom is essen tially liberal and a government which should neglect it would be felt to be painfully common  the only thing in this particular musee that i remember is a fine portrait of a woman by ingres  very flat and chinese but with an interest of line and a great deal of style  there is a castle at nantes which resembles in some degree that of angers but has without much less of the impressiveness of great size and within much more interest of detail  the court contains the remains of a very fine piece of late gothic a tall ele gant building of the sixteenth century  the chateau is naturally not wanting in history  it was the residence of the old dukes of brittany and was brought with the rest of the province by the duchess anne the last representative of that race as her dowry to charles viii  i read in the excellent handbook of m joanne that it has been visited by almost every one of the kings of france from louis xi downward and also that it has served as a place of sojourn less voluntary on the part of various other distinguished persons from the horrible merechal de retz who in the fifteenth century was executed at nantes for the murder of a couple of hundred young children sacrificed in abomin able rites to the ardent duchess of berry mother of the count of chambord who was confined there for a few hours in 1832 just after her arrest in a neigh boring house  i looked at the house in question  you may see it from the platform in front of the chateau  and tried to figure to myself that embarrassing scene the duchess after having unsuccessfully raised the standard of revolt for the exiled bourbons in the legitimist bretagne and being wanted as the phrase is by the police of louis philippe had hidden herself in a small but loyal house at nantes where at the end of five months of seclusion she was betrayed for gold to the austere m guizot by one of her servants an alsatian jew named deutz  for many hours before her capture she had been compressed into an inter stice behind a fireplace and by the time she was drawn forth into the light she had been ominously scorched  the man who showed me the castle in dicated also another historic spot a house with little tourelles on the quai de la fosse in which henry iv is said to have signed the edict of nantes  i am however not in a position to answer for this pedigree  there is another point in the history of the fine old houses which command the loire of which i sup pose one may be tolerably sure that is their having placid as they stand there today looked down on the horrors of the terror of 1793 the bloody reign of the monster carrier and his infamous noyades  the most hideous episode of the revolution was enacted at nantes where hundreds of men and women tied to gether in couples were set afloat upon rafts and sunk to the bottom of the loire  the tall eighteenthcentury house full of the air noble in france always reminds me of those dreadful years  of the streetscenes of the revolution  superficially the association is incongru ous for nothing could be more formal and decorous than the patent expression of these eligible residences but whenever i have a vision of prisoners bound on tumbrels that jolt slowly to the scaffold of heads car ried on pikes of groups of heated citoyennes shaking their fists at closed coachwindows i see in the back ground the wellordered features of the architecture of the period  the clear gray stone the high pilasters the arching lines of the entresol the classic pediment the slatecovered attic  there is not much architecture at nantes except the domestic  the cathedral with a rough west front and stunted towers makes no im pression as you approach it  it is true that it does its best to recover its reputation as soon as you have passed the threshold  begun in 1434 and finished about the end of the fifteenth century as i discover in murray it has a magnificent nave not of great length but of extraordinary height and lightness  on the other hand it has no choir whatever  there is much entertainment in france in seeing what a cathedral will take upon itself to possess or to lack for it is only the smaller number that have the full complement of features  some have a very fine nave and no choir others a very fine choir and no nave  some have a rich outside and nothing within others a very blank face and a very glowing heart  there are a hundred possibilities of poverty and wealth and they make the most unexpected combinations  the great treasure of nantes is the two noble se pulchral monuments which occupy either transept and one of which has in its nobleness the rare distinction of being a production of our own time  on the south side stands the tomb of francis ii the last of the dukes of brittany and of his second wife margaret of foix erected in 1507 by their daughter anne whom we have encountered already at the chateau de nantes where she was born at langeais where she married her first husband at amboise where she lost him at blois where she married her second the good louis xii who divorced an impeccable spouse to make room for her and where she herself died  trans ferred to the cathedral from a demolished convent this monument the masterpiece of michel colomb author of the charming tomb of the children of charles viii and the aforesaid anne which we admired at saint gatien of tours is one of the most brilliant works of the french renaissance  it has a splendid effect and is in perfect preservation  a great table of black marble supports the reclining figures of the duke and duchess who lie there peacefully and majestically in their robes and crowns with their heads each on a cushion the pair of which are supported from behind by three charming little kneeling angels at the foot of the quiet couple are a lion and a greyhound with heraldic devices  at each of the angles of the table is a large figure in white marble of a woman elaborately dressed with a symbolic meaning and these figures with their contemporary faces and clothes which give them the air of realistic portraits are truthful and liv ing if not remarkably beautiful  round the sides of the tomb are small images of the apostles  there is a kind of masculine completeness in the work and a certain robustness of taste  in nothing were the sculptors of the renaissance more fortunate than in being in advance of us with their tombs they have left us noting to say in regard to the great final contrast  the contrast between the immobility of death and the trappings and honors that survive  they expressed in every way in which it was possible to express it the solemnity of their conviction that the marble image was a part of the personal greatness of the defunct and the protection the re demption of his memory  a modern tomb in com parison is a sceptical affair it insists too little on the honors  i say this in the face of the fact that one has only to step across the cathedral of nantes to stand in the presence of one of the purest and most touching of modern tombs  catholic brittany has erected in the opposite transept a monument to one of the most devoted of her sons general de lamoriciere the de fender of the pope the vanquished of castelfidardo this noble work from the hand of paul dubois one of the most interesting of that new generation of sculp tors who have revived in france an art of which our overdressed century had begun to despair has every merit but the absence of a certain prime feeling  it is the echo of an earlier tune  an echo with a beauti ful cadence  under a renaissance canopy of white marble elaborately worked with arabesques and che rubs in a relief so low that it gives the work a cer tain look of being softened and worn by time lies the body of the breton soldier with a crucifix clasped to his breast and a shroud thrown over his body  at each of the angles sits a figure in bronze the two best of which representing charity and military courage had given me extraordinary pleasure when they were exhibited in the clay in the salon of 1876  they are admirably cast and they have a certain greatness the one a serene robust young mother beautiful in line and attitude the other a lean and vigilant young man in a helmet that overshadows his serious eyes resting an outstretched arm an admirable military member upon the hilt of a sword  these figures con tain abundant assurance that m paul dubois has been attentive to michael angelo whom we have all heard called a splendid example but a bad model  the visorshadowed face of his warrior is more or less a reminiscence of the figure on the tomb of lorenzo de medici at florence but it is doubtless none the worse for that  the interest of the work of paul dubois is its peculiar seriousness a kind of moral good faith which is not the commonest feature of french art and which united as it is in this case with exceeding knowledge and a remarkable sense of form produces an impression of deep refinement  the whole monu ment is a proof of exquisitely careful study but i am not sure that this impression on the part of the spec tator is altogether a happy one  it explains much of its great beauty and it also explains perhaps a little of a certain weakness  that word however is scarcely in place i only mean that m dubois has made a vi sible effort which has been most fruitful  simplicity is not always strength and our complicated modern genius contains treasures of intention  this fathomless modern element is an immense charm on the part of m paul dubois  i am lost in admiration of the deep aesthetic experience the enlightenment of taste re vealed by such work  after that i only hope that giuseppe garibaldi may have a monument as fair    xvi  to go from nantes to la rochelle you travel straight southward across the historic bocage of la vendee the home of royalist bushfighting  the country which is exceedingly pretty bristles with copses orchards hedges and with trees more spread ing and sturdy than the traveller is apt to deem the feathery foliage of france  it is true that as i pro ceeded it flattened out a good deal so that for an hour there was a vast featureless plain which offered me little entertainment beyond the general impression that i was approaching the bay of biscay from which in reality i was yet far distant  as we drew near la rochelle however the prospect brightened con siderably and the railway kept its course beside a charming little canal or canalized river bordered with trees and with small neat brightcolored and yet oldfashioned cottages and villas which stood back on the further side behind small gardens hedges painted palings patches of turf  the whole effect was dutch and delightful and in being delightful though not in being dutch it prepared me for the charms of la rochelle which from the moment i entered it i perceived to be a fascinating little town a most original mixture of brightness and dulness part of its brightness comes from its being extra ordinarily clean  in which after all it is dutch a virtue not particularly noticeable at bourges le mans and angers  whenever i go southward if it be only twenty miles i begin to look out for the south pre pared as i am to find the careless grace of those lati tudes even in things of which it may be said that they may be south of something but are not southern to go from boston to new york in this state of mind is almost as soft a sensation as descending the italian side of the alps and to go from new york to philadelphia is to enter a zone of tropical luxuriance and warmth  given this absurd disposition i could not fail to flatter myself on reaching la rochelle that i was already in the midi and to perceive in everything in the language of the country the ca ractere meridional  really a great many things had a hint of it  for that matter it seems to me that to arrive in the south at a bound  to wake up there as it were  would be a very imperfect pleasure  the full pleasure is to approach by stages and gradations to observe the successive shades of difference by which it ceases to be the north  these shades are exceedingly fine but your true southlover has an eye for them all  if he perceive them at new york and philadelphia  we imagine him boldly as liberated from boston  how could he fail to perceive them at la rochelle  the streets of  this dear little city are lined with arcades  good big straddling arcades of stone such as befit a land of hot summers and which recalled to me not to go further the dusky portions of bayonne  it contains moreover a great wide place darmes which looked for all the world like the piazza of some dead italian town empty sunny grassgrown with a row of yellow houses overhanging it an unfrequented cafe with a striped awning a tall cold florid uninteresting cathedral of the eighteenth century on one side and on the other a shady walk which forms part of an old rampart  i followed this walk for some time under the stunted trees beside the grasscovered bastions it is very charming wind ing and wandering always with trees  beneath the rampart is a tidal river and on the other side for a long distance the mossy walls of the immense garden of a seminary  three hundred years ago la rochelle was the great french stronghold of protestantism but today it appears to be anursery of papists  the walk upon the rampart led me round to one of the gatesi of the town where i found some small modern fortifications and sundry redlegged soldiers and beyond the fortifications another shady walk  a mail as the french say as well as a champ de manoeuvre  on which latter expanse the poor little redlegs were doing their exercise  it was all very quiet and very picturesque rather in miniature and at once very tidy and a little out of repair  this however was but a meagre backview of la rochelle or poor sideview at best  there are other gates than the small fortified aperture just mentioned one of them an old gray arch beneath a fine clocktower i had passed through on my way from the station this picturesque tour de lhorloge separates the town proper from the port for beyond the old gray arch the place presents its bright expressive little face to the sea  i had a charming walk about the harbor and along the stone piers and seawalls that shut it in  this indeed to take things in their order was after i had had my breakfast which i took on arriv ing and after i had been to the hotel de ville  the inn had a long narrow garden behind it with some very tall trees and passing through this garden to a dim and secluded salle a manger buried in the heavy shade i had while i sat at my repast a feeling of seclusion which amounted almost to a sense of in carceration  i lost this sense however after i had paid my bill and went out to look for traces of the famous siege which is the principal title of la rochelle to renown  i had come thither partly because i thought it would be interesting to stand for a few moments in so gallant a spot and partly because i confess i had a curiosity to see what had been the startingpoint of the huguenot emigrants who founded the town of new rochelle in the state of new york a place in which i had passed certain memorable hours  it was strange to think as i strolled through the peaceful little port that these quiet waters during the wars of religion had swelled with a formidable naval power  the rochelais had fleets and admirals and their stout little protestant bottoms carried de fiance up and down  to say that i found any traces of the siege would be to misrepresent the taste for vivid whitewash by which la rochelle is distinguished today  the only trace is the dent in the marble top of the table on which in the hotel de ville jean guiton the mayor of the city brought down his dagger with an oath when in 1628 the vessels and regiments of richelieu closed about it on sea and land  this terrible functionary was the soul of the resistance he held out from february to october in the midst of pestilence and famine  the whole episode has a brilliant place among the sieges of history it has been related a hundred times and i may only glance at it and pass i limit my ambition in these light pages to speaking of those things of which i have personally received an impression and i have no such impression of the defence of la rochelle  the hotel de ville is a pretty little building in the style of the renaissance of francis i but it has left much of its interest in the hands of the restorers  it has been done up without mercy its natural place would be at rochelle the new  a sort of battlemented curtain flanked with turrets divides it from the street and contains a low door a low door in a high wall is always felicitous which admits you to an inner court where you discover the face of the building  it has statues set into it and is raised upon a very low and very deep arcade  the principal function of the deferential old portress who conducts you over the place is to call your attention to the indented table of jean guiton but she shows you other objects of interest besides the interior is absolutely new and extremely sump tuous abounding in tapestries upholstery morocco velvet satin  this is especially the case with a really beautiful grande salle where surrdunded with the most expensive upholstery the mayor holds his official receptions  so at least said my worthy portress the mayors of la rochelle appear to have changed a good deal since the days of the grim guiton but these evidences of municipal splendor are interesting for the light they throw on french manners  imagine the mayor of an english or an american town of twenty thousand inhabitants holding magisterial soirees in the townhall  the said grande salle which is un changed in form and its larger features is i believe the room in which the rochelais debated as to whether they should shut themselves up and decided in the affirmative  the table and chair of jean guiton have been restored iike everything else and are very elegant and coquettish pieces of furniture  incongruous relics of a season of starvation and blood  i believe that protestantism is somewhat shrunken today at la rochelle and has taken refuge mainly in the haute societe and in a single place of worship  there was nothing particular to remind me of its supposed austerity as after leaving the hotel de ville i walked along the empty portions and cut out of the tour de lhorloge which i have already mentioned  if i stopped and looked up at this venerable monument it was not to ascertain the hour for i foresaw that i should have more time at la rochelle than i knew what to do with but because its high gray weatherbeaten face was an obvious subject for a sketch the little port which has two basins and is ac cessible only to vessels of light tonnage had a certain gayety and as much local color as you please  fisher folk of pictuesque type were strolling about most of them bretons several of the men with handsome simple faces not at all brutal and with a splendid brownness  the goldenbrown color on cheek and beard that you see on an old venetian sail  it was a squally showery day with sudden drizzles of sun shine rows of richtoned fishingsmacks were drawn up along the quays  the harbor is effective to the eye by reason of three battered old towers which at different points overhang it and look infinitely weather washed and seasilvered  the most striking of these the tour de la lanterne is a big gray mass of the fifteenth century flanked with turrets and crowned with a gothic steeple  i found it was called by the people of the place the tour des quatre sergents though i know not what connection it has with the touching history of the four young sergeants of the garrison of la rochelle who were arrested in 1821 as conspirators against the government of the bour bons and executed amid general indignation in paris in the following year  the quaint little walk with its label of rue sur les murs to which one ascends from beside the grosse horloge leads to this curious tour de la lanterne and passes under it  this walk has the top of the old townwall toward the sea for a parapet on one side and is bordered on the other with decent but irregular little tenements of fishermen where brown old women whose caps are as white as if they were painted seem chiefly in possession  in this direction there is a very pretty stretch of shore out of the town through the fortifications which are vaubans by the way through also a diminutive public garden or straggling shrubbery which edges the water and carries its stunted verdure as far as a big etablissernent des bains  it was too late in the year to bathe and the etablissement had the bank rupt aspect which belongs to such places out of the season so i turned my back upon it and gained by a circuit in the course of which there were sundry waterside items to observe the other side of the cheery little port where there is a long breakwater and a still longer seawall on which i walked awhile to inhale the strong salt breath of the bay of biscay la rochelle serves in the months of july and august as a station de bains for a modest provincial society and putting aside the question of inns it must be charming on summer afternoons    xvii  it is an injustice to poitiers to approach her by night as i did some three hours after leaving la rochelle for what poitiers has of best as they would say at poitiers is the appearance she presents to the arriving stranger who puts his head out of the window of the train  i gazed into the gloom from such an aperture before we got into the station for i re membered the impression received on another occa sion but i saw nothing save the universal night spotted here and there with an ugly railway lamp it was only as i departed the following day that i assured myself that poitiers still makes something of the figure she ought on the summit of her consider able bill  i have a kindness for any little group of towers any cluster of roofs and chimneys that lift themselves from an eminence over which a long road ascends in zigzags such a picture creates for the mo ment a presumption that you are in italy and even leads you to believe that if you mount the winding road you will come to an old townwall an expanse of creviced brownness and pass under a gateway sur mounted by the arms of a mediaeval despot  why i should find it a pleasure in france to imagine my self in italy is more than i can say the illusion has never lasted long enough to be analyzed  from the bottom of its perch poitiers looks large and high and indeed the evening i reached it the interminiable climb of the omnibus of the hotel i had selected which i found at the station gave me the measure of its commanding position  this hotel magnifique construction ornee de statues as the guidejoanne usually so reticent takes the trouble to announce has an omnibus and i suppose has statues though i didnt perceive them but it has very little else save immemorial accumulations of dirt  it is magnificent if you will but it is not even relatively proper and a dirty inn has always seemed to me the dirtiest of human things  it has so many opportunities to betray itself  poiters covers a large space and is as crooked and straggling as you please but these advantages are not accompanied with any very salient features or any great wealth of architecture  although there are few picturesque houses however there are two or three curious old churches  notre dame la grande in the marketplace a small romanesque structure of the twelfth century has a most interesting and venerable exterior  composed like all the churches of poitiers of a light brown stone with a yellowish tinge it is covered with primitive but ingenious sculptures and is really an impressive monument  within it has lately been daubed over with the most hideous decorative painting that was ever inflicted upon passive pillars and indifferent vaults  this battered yet coherent little edifice has the touching look that resides in everything supremely old it has arrived at the age at which such things cease to feel the years the waves of time have worn its edges to a kind of patient dul ness there is something mild and smooth like the stillness the deafness of an octogenarian even in its rudeness of ornament and it has become insensible to differences of a century or two  the cathedral interested me much less than our lady the great and i have not the spirit to go into statistics about it it is not statistical to say that the cathedral stands halfway down the hill of poitiers in a quiet and grassgrown place with an approach of crooked lanes and blank gardenwalls and that its most striking dimension is the width of its facade  this width is extraordinary but it fails somehow to give nobleness to the edifice which looks within murray makes the remark like a large public hall  there are a nave and two aisles the latter about as high as the nave and there are some very fearful modern pictures which you may see much better than you usually see those specimens of the old masters that lurk in glow ing sidechapels there being no fine old glass to dif fuse a kindly gloom  the sacristan of the cathedral showed me something much better than all this bright bareness he led me a short distance out of it to the small temple de saintjean which is the most curious object at poitiers  it is an early christian chapel one of the earliest in france originally it would seem  that is in the sixth or seventh century  a bap tistery but converted into a church while the christian era was still comparatively young  the temple de saintjean is therefore a monument even more vener able than notre dame la grande and that numbness of age which i imputed to notre dame ought to reside in still larger measure in its crude and colorless little walls  i call them crude in spite of their having been baked through by the centuries only because although certain rude arches and carvings are let into them and they are surmounted at either end with a small gable they have so far as i can remember little fascination of surface  notre dame is still ex pressive still pretends to be alive but the temple has delivered its message and is completely at rest it retains a kind of atrium on the level of the street from which you descend to the original floor now un covered but buried for years under a false bottom a semicircular apse was apparently at the time of its conversion into a church thrown out from the east wall  in the middle is the cavity of the old baptismal font  the walls and vaults are covered with traces of extremely archaic frescos attributed i believe to the twelfth century  these vague gaunt staring fragments of figures are to a certain extent a reminder of some of the early christian churches in rome they even faintly recalled to me the great mosaics of ravenna  the temple de saintjean has neither the antiquity nor the completeness of those extraordinary monuments nearly the most impressive in europe but as one may say it is very well for poitiers  not far from it in a lonely corner which was ani mated for the moment by the vociferations of several old women who were selling tapers presumably for the occasion of a particular devotion is the graceful romanesque church erected in the twelfth century to saint radegonde  a lady who found means to be a saint even in the capacity of a merovingian queen it bears a general resemblance to notre dame la grande and as i remember it is corrugated in some what the same manner with porouslooking carvings but i confess that what i chiefly recollect is the row of old women sitting in front of it each with a tray of waxen tapers in her lap and upbraiding me for my neglect of the opportunity to offer such a tribute to the saint  i know not whether this privilege is oc casional or constant within the church there was no appearance of a festival and i see that the name day of saint radegonde occurs in august so that the importunate old women sit there always perhaps and deprive of its propriety the epithet i just applied to this provincial corner  in spite of the old women however i suspect that the place is lonely and in deed it is perhaps the old women that have made the desolation  the lion of poitiers in the eyes of the natives is doubtless the palais de justice in the shadow of which the statueguarded hotel just mentioned erects itself and the gem of the courthouse which has a prosy modern front with pillars and a high flight of steps is the curious salle des pas perdus or central hall out of which the different tribunals open  this is a feature of every french courthouse and seems the result of a conviction that a palace of justice  the french deal in much finer names than we  should be in some degree palatial  the great hall at poitiers has a long pedigree as its walls date back to the twelfth century and its open wooden roof as well as the remarkable trio of chimneypieces at the right end of the room as you enter to the fifteenth  the three tall fireplaces side by side with a delicate gallery running along the top of them constitute the originality of this ancient chamber and make one think of the groups that must formerly have gathered there  of all the wet bootsoles the trickling doublets the stiffened fingers the rheumatic shanks that must have been presented to such an incomparable focus of heat  today i am afraid these mighty hearts are forever cold justice it probably administered with the aid of a modern calorifere and the walls of the palace are perforated with regurgitating tubes  behind and above the gallery that surmounts the three fireplaces are high gothic windows the tracery of which masks in some sort the chimneys and in each angle of this and of the room to the right and left of the trio of chimneys is all openwork spiral staircase ascending to  i forget where perhaps to the roof of the edifice this whole side of the salle is very lordly and seems to express an unstinted hospitality to extend the friendliest of all invitations to bid the whole world come and get warm  it was the invention of john duke of berry and count of poitou about 1395  i give this information on the authority of the guide joanne from which source i gather much other curious learning for instance that it was in this building when it had surely a very different front that charles vii was proclaimed king in 1422 and that here jeanne darc was subjected in 1429 to the inquisition of certain doctors and matrons  the most charming thing at poitiers is simply the promenade de blossac  a small public garden at one end of the flat top of the hill  it has a happy look of the last century having been arranged at that period and a beautiful sweep of view over the sur rounding country and especially of the course of the little river clain which winds about a part of the base of the big mound of poitiers  the limit of this dear little garden is formed on the side that turns away from the town by the rampart erected in the fourteenth century and by its big semicircular bastions  this rampart of great length has a low parapet you look over it at the charming little vegetablegardens with which the base of the hill appears exclusively to be garnished  the whole prospect is delightful especially the details of the part just under the walls at the end of the walk  here the river makes a shining twist which a painter might have invented and the side of the hill is terraced into several ledges  a sort of tangle of small blooming patches and little pavillions with peaked roofs and green shutters  it is idle to attempt to reproduce all this in words it should be reproduced only in watercolors  the reader how ever will already have remarked that disparity in these ineffectual pages which are pervaded by the attempt to sketch without a palette or brushes  he will doubtless also be struck with the grovelling vision which on such a spot as the ramparts of poitiers peoples itself with carrots and cabbages rather than with images of the black prince and the captive king i am not sure that in looking out from the promenade de blossac you command the old battlefield it is enough that it was not far off and that the great rout of frenchmen poured into the walls of poitiers leav ing on the ground a number of the fallen equal to the little army eight thousand of the invader  i did think of the battle  i wondered rather helplessly where it had taken place and i came away as the reader will see from the preceding sentence without finding out  this indifference however was a result rather of a general dread of military topography than of a want of admiration of this particular victory which i have always supposed to be one of the most brilliant on record  indeed i should be almost ashamed and very much at a loss to say what light it was that this glorious day seemed to me to have left forever on the horizon and why the very name of the place had always caused my blood gently to tingle it is carrying the feeling of race to quite inscrutable lengths when a vague american permits himself an emotion because more than five centuries ago on french soil one rapacious frenchman got the better of another  edward was a frenchman as well as john and french were the cries that urged each of the hosts to the fight  french is the beautiful motto graven round the image of the black prince as he lies forever at rest in the choir of canterbury a la mort ne pensaije mye  nevertheless the victory of poitiers declines to lose itself in these considerations the sense of it is a part of our heritage the joy of it a part of our imagination and it filters down through centuries and migrations till it titillates a new yorker who forgets in his elation that he happens at that moment to be enjoying the hospitality of france  it was something done i know not how justly for eng land and what was done in the fourteenth century for england was done also for new york    xviii  if it was really for the sake of the black prince that i had stopped at poitiers for my prevision of notre dame la grande and of the little temple of st john was of the dimmest i ought to have stopped at angouleme for the sake of david and eve sechard of lucien de rubempre and of madame de bargeton who when she wore a toilette etudiee sported a jewish turban ornamented with an eastern brooch a scarf of gauze a necklace of cameos and a robe of painted muslin whatever that may be treating herself to these luxuries out of an income of twelve thousand francs  the persons i have mentioned have not that vagueness of identity which is the misfortune of his torical characters they are real supremely real thanks to their affiliation to the great balzac who had invented an artificial reality which was as much better than the vulgar article as mockturtle soup is than the liquid it emulates  the first time i read les illusions perdues i should have refused to believe that i was capable of passing the old capital of anjou without alighting to visit the houmeau  but we never know what we are capable of till we are tested as i reflected when i found myself looking back at angouleme from the window of the train just after we had emerged from the long tunnel that passes under the town  this tunnel perforates the hill on which like poitiers angouleme rears itself and which gives it an eleva tion still greater than that of poitiers  you may have a tolerable look at the cathedral without leaving the railwaycarriage for it stands just above the tunnel and is exposed much foreshortened to the spectator below  there is evidently a charming walk round the plateau of the town commanding those pretty views of which balzac gives an account  but the train whirled me away and these are my only impressions the truth is that i had no need just at that moment of putting myself into communication with balzac for opposite to me in the compartment were a couple of figures almost as vivid as the actors in the comedie humaine  one of these was a very genial and dirty old priest and the other was a reserved and concen trated young monk  the latter by which i mean a monk of any kind being a rare sight today in france this young man indeed was mitigatedly monastic he had a big brown frock and cowl but he had also a shirt and a pair of shoes he had instead of a hempen scourge round his waist a stout leather thong and he carried with him a very profane little valise he also read from beginning to end the figaro which the old priest who had done the same presented to him and he looked altogether as if had he not been a monk he would have made a distinguished officer of engineers  when he was not reading the figaro he was conning his breviary or answering with rapid precision and with a deferential but dis couraging dryness the frequent questions of his com panion who was of quite another type  this worthy had a bored goodnatured unbuttoned expansive look was talkative restless almost disreputably human he was surrounded by a great deal of small luggage and had scattered over the carriage his books his papers the fragments of his lunch and the contents of an extraordinary bag which he kept beside him  a kind of secular reliquary  and which appeared to contain the odds and ends of a lifetime as he took from it successively a pair of slippers an old padlock which evidently didnt belong to it an operaglass a collection of almanacs and a large seashell which he very carefully examined  i think that if he had not been afraid of the young monk who was so much more serious than he he would have held the shell to his ear like a child  indeed he was a very childish and delightful old priest and his companion evidently thought him most frivolous  but i liked him the better of the two  he was not a country cure but an eccle siastic of some rank who had seen a good deal both of the church and of the world and if i too had not been afraid of his colleague who read the figaro as seriously as if it had been an encyclical i should have entered into conversation with him  all this while i was getting on to bordeaux where i permitted myself to spend three days  i am afraid i have next to nothing to show for them and that there would be little profit in lingering on this episode which is the less to be justified as i had in former years examined bordeaux attentively enough  it con tains a very good hotel  an hotel not good enough however to keep you there for its own sake  for the rest bordeaux is a big rich handsome imposing com mercial town with long rows of fine old eighteenth century houses which overlook the yellow garonne  i have spoken of the quays of nantes as fine but those of bordeaux have a wider sweep and a still more architectural air  the appearance of such a port as this makes the anglosaxon tourist blush for the sor did waterfronts of liverpool and new york which with their larger activity have so much more reason to be stately  bordeaux gives a great impression of prosperous industries and suggests delightful ideas images of pruneboxes and bottled claret  as the focus of distribution of the best wine in the world it is in deed a sacred city  dedicated to the worship of bacchus in the most discreet form  the country all about it is covered with precious vineyards sources of fortune to their owners and of satisfaction to distant consumers and as you look over to the hills beyond the garonne you see them in the autumn sunshine fretted with the rusty richness of this or that immortal clos  but the principal picture within the town is that of the vast curving quays bordered with houses that look like the hotels of farmersgeneral of the last cen tury and of the wide tawny river crowded with ship ping and spanned by the largest of bridges  some of the types on the waterside are of the sort that arrest a sketcher  figures of stalwart brownfaced basques such as i had seen of old in great numbers at biarritz with their loose circular caps their white sandals their air of walking for a wager  never was a tougher a harder race  they are not mariners nor watermen but putting questions of temper aside they are the best possible dockporters  il sy fait un commerce terrible a douanier said to me as he looked up and down the interminable docks and such a place has indeed much to say of the wealth the capacity for production of france  the bright cheerful smokeless industry of the wonderful country which produces above all the agreeable things of life and turns even its defeats and revolutions into gold  the whole town has an air of almost depressing opulence an appear ance which culminates in the great place which sur rounds the grandtheatre  an establishment in the highest style encircled with columns arcades lamps gilded cafes  one feels it to be a monument to the virtue of the wellselected bottle  if i had not for bidden myself to linger i should venture to insist on this and at the risk of being considered fantastic trace an analogy between good claret and the best qualities of the french mind pretend that there is a taste of sound bordeaux in all the happiest manifes tations of that fine organ and that correspondingly there is a touch of french reason french complete ness in a glass of pontetcanet  the danger of such an excursion would lie mainly in its being so open to the reader to take the ground from under my feet by saying that good claret doesnt exist  to this i should have no reply whatever  i should be unable to tell him where to find it  i certainly didnt find it at bordeaux where i drank a most vulgar fluid and it is of course notorious that a large part of mankind is occupied in vainly looking for it  there was a great pretence of putting it forward at the exhibition which was going on at bordeaux at the time of my visit an exposition philomathique lodged in a collection of big temporary buildings in the allees dor1eans and regarded by the bordelais for the moment as the most brilliant feature of their city  here were pyramids of bottles mountains of bottles to say nothing of cases and cabinets of bottles  the contemplation of these glittering tiers was of course not very convincing and indeed the whole arrangement struck me as a high impertinence  good wine is not an optical pleasure it is an inward emotion and if there was a chamber of degustation on the premises i failed to discover it it was not in the search for it indeed that i spent half an hour in this bewildering bazaar  like all expositions it seemed to me to be full of ugly things and gave one a portentous idea of the quantity of rubbish that man carries with him on his course through the ages  such an amount of luggage for a journey after all so short  there were no individual objects there was nothing but dozens and hundreds all machinemade and expressionless in spite of the repeated grimace the conscious smartness of the last new thing that was stamped on all of them  the fatal facility of the french article becomes at last as irritating as the refrain of a popular song  the poor indiens galibis struck me as really more interesting  a group of stunted savages who formed one of the attractions of the place and were confined in a pen in the open air with a rabble of people pushing and squeezing hanging over the barrier to look at them they had no grimace no pretension to be new no desire to catch your eye  they looked at their visitors no more than they looked at each other and seemed ancient indifferent terribly bored    xix  there is much entertainment in the journey through the wide smiling garden of gascony i speak of it as i took it in going from bordeaux to toulouse  it is the south quite the south and had for the present narrator its full measure of the charm he is always determined to find in countries that may even by courtesy be said to appertain to the sun  it was moreover the happy and genial view of these mild latitudes which heaven knows often have a dreari ness of their own a land teeming with corn and wine and speaking everywhere that is everywhere the phyl loxera had not laid it waste of wealth and plenty the road runs constantly near the garonne touching now and then its slow brown rather sullen stream a sullenness that encloses great dangers and disasters the traces of the horrible floods of 1875 have dis appeared and the land smiles placidly enough while it waits for another immersion  toulouse at the period i speak of was up to its middle and in places above it in water and looks still as if it had been thoroughly soaked  as if it had faded and shrivelled with a long steeping  the fields and copses of course are more forgiving  the railway line follows as well the charm ing canal du midi which is as pretty as a river bar ring the straightness and here and there occupies the foreground beneath a screen of dense tall trees while the garonne takes a larger and more irregular course a little way beyond it  people who are fond of canals  and speaking from the pictorial standpoint i hold the taste to be most legitimate  will delight in this admirable specimen of the class which has a very in teresting history not to be narrated here  on the other side of the road the left all the way runs a long low line of hills or rather one continuous hill or perpetual cliff with a straight top in the shape of a ledge of rock which might pass for a ruined wall i am afraid the reader will lose patience with my habit of constantly referring to the landscape of italy as if that were the measure of the beauty of every other yet i am still more afraid that i cannot apologize for it and must leave it in its culpable nakedness  it is an idle habit but the reader will long since have dis covered that this was an idle journey and that i give my impressions as they came to me  it came to me then that in all this view there was something trans alpine with a greater smartness and freshness and much less elegance and languor  this impression was occasionally deepened by the appearance on the long eminence of which i speak of a village a church or a chateau which seemed to look down at the plain from over the ruined wall  the perpetual vines the brightfaced flatroofed houses covered with tiles the softness and sweetness of the light and air recalled the prosier portions of the lombard plain  toulouse itself has a little of this italian expression but not enough to give a color to its dark dirty crooked streets which are irregular without being eccentric and which if it were not for the superb church of saintsernin would be quite destitute of monuments  i have already alluded to the way in which the names of certain places impose themselves on the mind and i must add that of toulouse to the list of expressive appellations  it certainly evokes a vision  suggests something highly meridional  but the city it must be confessed is less pictorial than the word in spite of the place du capitole in spite of the quay of the garonne in spite of the curious cloister of the old museum  what justifies the images that are latent in the word is not the aspect but the history of the town  the hotel to which the welladvised traveller will repair stands in a corner of the place du capitole which is the heart and centre of toulouse and which bears a vague and inexpensive resemblance to piazza castello at turin  the capitol with a wide modern face occupies one side and like the palace at turin looks across at a high arcade under which the hotels the principal shops and the lounging citizens are gathered  the shops are probably better than the turinese but the people are not so good  stunted shabby rather vitiated looking they have none of the personal richness of the sturdy piedmontese and i will take this occasion to remark that in the course of a journey of several weeks in the french provinces i rarely encountered a welldressed male  can it be possible the republics are unfavorable to a certain attention to ones boots and ones beard  i risk this somewhat futile inquiry because the proportion of mens  coats and trousers seemed to be about the same in france and in my native land  it was notably lower than in england and in italy and even warranted the supposition that most good provincials have their chin shaven and their boots blacked but once a week i hasten to add lest my observation should appear to be of a sadly superficial character that the manners and conversation of these gentlemen bore whenever i had occasion to appreciate them no relation to the state of their chin and their boots  they were almost always marked by an extreme amenity  at toulouse there was the strongest temptation to speak to people simply for the entertainment of hearing them reply with that curious that fascinating accent of the languedoc which appears to abound in final con sonants and leads the toulousains to say bieng and maisong like englishmen learning french  it is as if they talked with their teeth rather than with their tongue  i find in my notebook a phrase in regard to toulouse which is perhaps a little illnatured but which i will transcribe as it stands the oddity is that the place should be both animated and dull  a big brownskinned population clattering about in a flat tortuous town which produces nothing whatever that i can discover  except the church of saint sernin and the fine old court of the hotel dassezat toulouse has no architecture the houses are for the most part of brick of a grayishred color and have no particular style  the brickwork of the place is in fact very poor  inferior to that of the north italian towns and quite wanting in the richness of tone which this homely material takes on in the damp climates of the north  and then my notebook goes on to narrate a little visit to the capitol which was soon made as the building was in course of repair and half the rooms were closed    xx  the history of toulouse is detestable saturated with blood and perfidy and the ancient custom of the floral games grafted upon all sorts of internecine traditions seems with its false pastoralism its mock chivalry its display of fine feelings to set off rather than to mitigate these horrors  the society was founded in the fourteenth century and it has held annual meetings ever since  meetings at which poems in the fine old langue doc are declaimed and a blushing laureate is chosen  this business takes place in the capitol before the chief magistrate of the town who is known as the capitoul and of all the pretty women as well  a class very numerous at toulouse it was impossible to have a finer person than that of the portress who pretended to show me the apart ments in which the floral games are held a big brown expansive woman still in the prime of life with a speaking eye an extraordinary assurance and a pair of magenta stockings which were inserted into the neatest and most polished little black sabots and which as she clattered up the stairs before me lavishly displaying them made her look like the heroine of an operabouffe  her talk was all in ns gs and ds and in mute es strongly accented as autre theatre splendide  the last being an epithet she applied to everything the capitol contained and especially to a horrible picture representing the famous clemence isaure the reputed foundress of the poetical contest presiding on one of these occasions  i won dered whether clemence isaure had been anything like this terrible toulousaine of today who would have been a capital figurehead for a floral game the lady in whose honor the picture i have just men tioned was painted is a somewhat mythical personage and she is not to be found in the biographie uni verselle  she is however a very graceful myth and if she never existed her statue does at least  a shapeless effigy transferred to the capitol from the socalled tomb of clemence in the old church of la daurade  the great hall in which the floral games are held was encumbered with scaffoldings and i was unable to admire the long series of busts of the bards who have won prizes and the portraits of all the capitouls of toulouse  as a compensation i was introduced to a big bookcase filled with the poems that have been crowned since the days of the trou badours a portentous collection and the big butchers knife with which according to the legend henry duke of montmorency who had conspired against the great cardinal with gaston of orleans and mary de  medici was in 1632 beheaded on this spot by the order of richelieu  with these objects the interest of the capitol was exhausted  the building indeed has not the grandeur of its name which is a sort of promise that the visitor will find some sensible embodiment of the old roman tradition that once flourished in this part of france  it is inferior in impressiveness to the other three famous capitols of the modern world  that of rome if i may call the present structure modern and those of washington and albany  the only roman remains at toulouse are to be found in the museum  a very interesting establish ment which i was condemned to see as imperfectly as i had seen the capitol  it was being rearranged and the gallery of paintings which is the least in teresting feature was the only part that was not upsidedown  the pictures are mainly of the mo dern french school and i remember nothing but a powerful though disagreeable specimen of henner who paints the human body and paints it so well with a brush dipped in blackness and placed among the paintings a bronze replica of the charming young david of mercie  these things have been set out in the church of an old monastery long since suppressed and the rest of the collection occupies the cloisters these are two in number  a small one which you enter first from the street and a very vast and ele gant one beyond it which with its light gothic arches and slim columns of the fourteenth century its broad walk its little garden with old tombs and statues in the centre is by far the most picturesque the most sketchable spot in toulouse  it must be doubly so when the roman busts inscriptions slabs and sarco phagi are ranged along the walls it must indeed to compare small things with great and as the judicious murray remarks bear a certain resemblance to the campo santo at pisa  but these things are absent now the cloister is a litter of confusion and its trea sures have been stowed away confusedly in sundry inaccessible rooms  the custodian attempted to con sole me by telling me that when they are exhibited again it will be on a scientific basis and with an order and regularity of which they were formerly innocent  but i was not consoled  i wanted simply the spectacle the picture and i didnt care in the least for the classification  old roman fragments ex posed to light in the open air under a southern sky in a quadrangle round a garden have an immortal charm simply in their general effect and the charm is all the greater when the soil of the very place has yielded them up    xxi  my real consolation was an hour i spent in saint sernin one of the noblest churches in southern france and easily the first among those of toulouse  this great structure a masterpiece of twelfthcentury ro manesque and dedicated to saint saturninus  the toulousains have abbreviated  is i think alone worth a journey to toulouse  what makes it so is the extraordinary seriousness of its interior no other term occurs to me as expressing so well the character of its clear gray nave  as a general thing i do not favor the fashion of attributing moral qualities to buildings i shrink from talking about tender porticos and sincere campanili but i find i cannot get on at all without imputing some sort of morality to saint sernin  as it stands today the church has been completely restored by violletleduc  the exterior is of brick and has little charm save that of a tower of four rows of arches narrowing together as they ascend the nave is of great length and height the barrelroof of stone the effect of the round arches and pillars in the triforium especially fine  there are two low aisles on either side  the choir is very deep and narrow it seems to close together and looks as if it were meant for intensely earnest rites  the transepts are most noble especially the arches of the second tier the whole church is narrow for its length and is singularly complete and homogeneous  as i say all this i feel that i quite fail to give an impression of its manly gravity its strong proportions or of the lone some look of its renovated stones as i sat there while the october twilight gathered  it is a real work of art a high conception  the crypt into which i was eventually led captive by an importunate sacristan is quite another affair though indeed i suppose it may also be spoken of as a work of art  it is a rich museum of relics and contains the head of saint thomas aquinas wrapped up in a napkin and exhibited in a glass case  the sacristan took a lamp and guided me about presenting me to one saintly remnant after an other  the impression was grotesque but sorne of the objects were contained in curious old cases of beaten silver and brass these things at least which looked as if they had been transmitted from the early church were venerable  there was however a kind of wholesale sanctity about the place which overshot the mark it pretends to be one of the holiest spots in the world  the effect is spoiled by the way the sacristans hang about and offer to take you into it for ten sous  i was accosted by two and escaped from another  and by the familiar manner in which you pop in and out  this episode rather broke the charm of saintsernin so that i took my departure and went in search of the cathedral  it was scarcely worth find ing and struck me as an odd dislocated fragment the front consists only of a portal beside which a tall brick tower of a later period has been erected  the nave was wrapped in dimness with a few scattered lamps  i could only distinguish an immense vault like a high cavern without aisles  here and there in the gloom was a kneeling figure the whole place was mysterious and lopsided  the choir was curtained off it appeared not to correspond with the nave  that is not to have the same axis  the only other ec clesiastical impression i gathered at toulouse came to me in the church of la daurade of which the front on the quay by the garonne was closed with scaffold ings so that one entered it from behind where it is completely masked by houses through a door which has at first no traceable connection with it  it is a vast high modernised heavily decorated church dimly lighted at all times i should suppose and enriched by the shades of evening at the time i looked into it i perceived that it consisted mainly of a large square beneath a dome in the centre of which a single person  a lady  was praying with the utmost absorption the manner of access to the church interposed such an obstacle to the outer profanities that i had a sense of intruding and presently withdrew carrying with me a picture of the vast still interior the gilded roof gleaming in the twilight and the solitary worshipper what was she praying for and was she not almost afraid to remain there alone  for the rest the picturesque at toulouse consists principally of the walk beside the garonne which is spanned to the faubourg of saintcyprien by a stout brick bridge  this hapless suburb the baseness of whose site is noticeable lay for days under the water at the time of the last inundations  the garonne had almost mounted to the roofs of the houses and the place continues to present a blighted frightened look  two or three persons with whom i had some conversation spoke of that time as a memory of horror i have not done with my italian comparisons i shall never have done with them  i am therefore free to say that in the way in which toulouse looks out on the garonne there was something that reminded me vaguely of the way in which pisa looks out on the arno  the redfaced houses  all of brick  along the quay have a mixture of brightness and shabbiness as well as the fashion of the open loggia in the top story  the river with another bridge or two might be the arno and the buildings on the other side of it  a hospital a suppressed convent  dip their feet into it with real southern cynicism  i have spoken of the old hotel dassezat as the best house at toulouse with the exception of the cloister of the museum it is the only bit i remember  it has fallen from the state of a noble residence of the sixteenth century to that of a warehouse and a set of offices but a certain dignity lingers in its melancholy court which is divided from the street by a gateway that is still imposing and in which a clambering vine and a red virginia creeper were suspended to the rusty walls of brick stone  the most interesting house at toulouse is far from being the most striking  at the door of no 50 rue des filatiers a featureless solid structure was found hanging one autumn evening the body of the young marcantoine calas whose illinspired suicide was to be the first act of a tragedy so horrible  the fana ticism aroused in the townsfolk by this incident the execution by torture of jean calas accused as a protestant of having hanged his son who had gone over to the church of rome the ruin of the family the claustration of the daughters the flight of the widow to switzerland her introduction to voltaire the excited zeal of that incomparable partisan and the passionate persistence with which from year to year he pursued a reversal of judgment till at last he obtained it and devoted the tribunal of toulouse to execration and the name of the victims to lasting wonder and pity  these things form part of one of the most interesting and touching episodes of the social history of the eighteenth century  the story has the fatal progression the dark rigidity of one of the tragic dramas of the greeks  jean calas advanced in life blameless bewildered protesting his innocence had been broken on the wheel and the sight of his decent dwelling which brought home to me all that had been suflered there spoiled for me for half an hour the impression of toulouse    xxii  i spent but a few hours at carcassonne but those hours had a rounded felicity and i cannot do better than transcribe from my notebook the little record made at the moment  vitiated as it may be by crudity and incoherency it has at any rate the fresh ness of a great emotion  this is the best quality that a reader may hope to extract from a narrative in which useful information and technical lore even of the most general sort are completely absent  for carcassonne is moving beyond a doubt and the traveller who in the course of a little tour in france may have felt himself urged in melancholy moments to say that on the whole the disappointments are as numerous as the satisfactions must admit that there can be nothing better than this  the country after you leave toulouse continues to be charming the more so that it merges its flatness in the distant cevennes on one side and on the other far away on your right in the richer range of the pyrenees  olives and cypresses pergolas and vines terraces on the roofs of houses soft iridescent moun tains a warm yellow light  what more could the dif ficult tourist want  he left his luggage at the station warily determined to look at the inn before committing himself to it  it was so evident even to a cursory glance that it might easily have been much better that he simply took his way to the town with the whole of a superb afternoon before him  when i say the town i mean the towns there being two at car cassonne perfectly distinct and each with excellent claims to the title  they have settled the matter be tween them however and the elder the shrine of pilgrimage to which the other is but a steppingstone or even as i may say a humble doormat takes the name of the cite  you see nothing of the cite from the station it is masked by the agglomeration of the villebasse which is relatively but only relatively new a wonderful avenue of acacias leads to it from the station  leads past rather and conducts you to a little highbacked bridge over the aude beyond which detached and erect a distinct mediaeval silhouette the cite presents itself  like a rival shop on the in vidious side of a street it has no connection with the establishment across the way although the two places are united if old carcassonne may be said to be united to anything by a vague little rustic fau bourg  perched on its solid pedestal the perfect de tachment of the cite is what first strikes you  to take leave without delay of the villebasse i may say that the splendid acacias i have mentioned flung a sum merish dusk over the place in which a few scattered remains of stout walls and big bastions looked vener able and picturesque  a little boulevard winds round the town planted with trees and garnished with more benches than i ever saw provided by a softhearted municipality  this precinct had a warm lazy dusty southern look as if the people sat outofdoors a great deal and wandered about in the stillness of summer nights  the figure of the elder town at these hours must be ghostly enough on its neighboring hill  even by day it has the air of a vignette of gustave dore a couplet of victor hugo  it is almost too perfect  as if it were an enormous model placed on a big green table at a museum  a steep paved way grassgrown like all roads where vehicles never pass stretches up to it in the sun  it has a double enceinte complete outer walls and complete inner these elaborately forti fied are the more curious and this congregation of ramparts towers bastions battlements barbicans is as fantastic and romantic as you please  the approach i mention here leads to the gate that looks toward toulouse  the porte de laude  there is a second on the other side called i believe the porte nar bonnaise a magnificent gate flanked with towers thick and tall defended by elaborate outworks and these two apertures alone admit you to the place  putting aside a small sallyport protected by a great bastion on the quarter that looks toward the pyrenees  as a votary always in the first instance of a general impression i walked all round the outer en ceinte  a process on the very face of it entertaining i took to the right of the porte de laude without entering it where the old moat has been filled in the fillingin of the moat has created a grassy level at the foot of the big gray towers which rising at frequent intervals stretch their stiff curtain of stone from point to point  the curtain drops without a fold upon the quiet grass which was dotted here and there with a humble native dozing away the golden afternoon  the natives of the elder carcassonne are all humble for the core of the cite has shrunken and decayed and there is little life among the ruins  a few tenacious laborers who work in the neighboring fields or in the villebasse and sundry octogenarians of both sexes who are dying where they have lived and contribute much to the pictorial effect  these are the principal inhabitants  the process of con verting the place from an irresponsible old town into a conscious specimen has of course been attended with eliminations the population has as a general thing been restored away  i should lose no time in saying that restoration is the great mark of the cite m violletleduc has worked his will upon it put it into perfect order revived the fortifications in every detail  i do not pretend to judge the performance carried out on a scale and in a spirit which really impose themselves on the imagination  few archi tects have had such a chance and m violletleduc must have been the envy of the whole restoring fra ternity  the image of a more crumbling carcassonne rises in the mind and there is no doubt that forty years ago the place was more affecting  on the other hand as we see it today it is a wonderful evocation and if there is a great deal of new in the old there is plenty of old in the new  the repaired crenella tions the inserted patches of the walls of the outer circle sufficiently express this commixture  my walk brought me into full view of the pyrenees which now that the sun had begun to sink and the shadows to grow long had a wonderful violet glow  the platform at the base of the walls has a greater width on this side and it made the scene more complete  two or three old crones had crawled out of the porte nar bonnaise to examine the advancing visitor and a very ancient peasant lying there with his back against a tower was tending half a dozen lean sheep  a poor man in a very old blouse crippled and with crutches lying beside him had been brought out and placed on a stool where he enjoyed the afternoon as best he might  he looked so ill and so patient that i spoke to him found that his legs were paralyzed and he was quite helpless  he had formerly been seven years in the army and had made the campaign of mexico with bazaine  born in the old cite he had come back there to end his days  it seemed strange as he sat there with those romantic walls behind him and the great picture of the pyrenees in front to think that he had been across the seas to the faraway new world had made part of a famous expedition and was now a cripple at the gate of the mediaeval city where he had played as a child  all this struck me as a great deal of history for so modest a figure  a poor little figure that could only just unclose its palm for a small silver coin  he was not the only acquaintance i made at car cassonne  i had not pursued my circuit of the walls much further when i encountered a person of quite another type of whom i asked some question which had just then presented itself and who proved to be the very genius of the spot  he was a sociable son of the villebasse a gentleman and as i afterwards learned an employe at the prefecture  a person in short much esteemed at carcassonne  i may say all this as he will never read these pages  he had been ill for a month and in the company of his little dog was taking his first airing in his own phrase he was amoureuxfou de la cite  he could lose no time in coming back to it  he talked of it indeed as a lover and giving me for half an hour the advantage of his company showed me all the points of the place  i speak here always of the outer enceinte you penetrate to the inner  which is the specialty of carcassonne and the great curiosity  only by application at the lodge of the regular custodian a remarkable func tionary who half an hour later when i had been in troduced to him by my friend the amateur marched me over the fortifications with a tremendous accompani ment of dates and technical terms  my companion pointed out to me in particular the traces of different periods in the structure of the walls  there is a por tentous amount of history embedded in them begin ning with romans and visigoths here and there are marks of old breaches hastily repaired  we passed into the town  into that part of it not included in the citadel  it is the queerest and most fragmentary little place in the world as everything save the fortifications is being suffered to crumble away in order that the spirit of m violletleduc alone may pervade it and it may subsist simply as a magnificent shell  as the leases of the wretched little houses fall in the ground is cleared of them and a mumbling old woman ap proached me in the course of my circuit inviting me to condole with her on the disappearance of so many of the hovels which in the last few hundred years since the collapse of carcassonne as a stronghold had attached themselves to the base of the walls in the space between the two circles  these habitations constructed of materials taken from the ruins nestled there snugly enough  this intermediate space had therefore become a kind of street which has crumbled in turn as the fortress has grown up again  there are other streets beside very diminutive and vague where you pick your way over heaps of rubbish and become conscious of unexpected faces looking at you out of windows as detached as the cherubic heads the most definite thing in the place was the little cafe where the waiters i think must be the ghosts of the old visigoths the most definite that is after the little chateau and the little cathedral  everything in the cite is little you can walk round the walls in twenty minutes  on the drawbridge of the chateau which with a picturesque old face flanking towers and a dry moat is today simply a bare caserne lounged half a dozen soldiers unusually small  no thing could be more odd than to see these objects en closed in a receptacle which has much of the appear ance of an enormous toy  the cite and its population vaguely reminded me of an immense noahs ark    xxiii  carcassonne dates from the roman occupation of gaul  the place commanded one of the great roads into spain and in the fourth century romans and franks ousted each other from such a point of vantage in the year 436 theodoric king of the visigoths superseded both these parties and it is during his oc cupation that the inner enceinte was raised upon the ruins of the roman fortifications  most of the visigoth towers that are still erect are seated upon roman sub structions which appear to have been formed hastily probably at the moment of the frankish invasion the authors of these solid defences though occasionally disturbed held carcassonne and the neighboring coun try in which they had established their kingdom of septimania till the year 713 when they were expelled by the moors of spain who ushered in an unillumined period of four centuries of which no traces remain these facts i derived from a source no more recondite than a pamphlet by m violletleduc  a very luminous description of the fortifications which you may buy from the accomplished custodian  the writer makes a jump to the year 1209 when carcassonne then forming part of the realm of the viscounts of beziers and infected by the albigensian heresy was besieged in the name of the pope by the terrible simon de montfort and his army of crusaders  simon was ac customed to success and the town succumbed in the course of a fortnight  thirtyone years later having passed into the hands of the king of france it was again besieged by the young raymond de trincavel the last of the viscounts of beziers and of this siege m violletleduc gives a long and minute account which the visitor who has a head for such things may follow with the brochure in hand on the fortifications themselves  the young raymond de trincavel baffled and repulsed retired at the end of twentyfour days saint louis and philip the bold in the thirteenth cen tury multiplied the defences of carcassonne which was one of the bulwarks of their kingdom on the spanish quarter and from this time forth being re garded as impregnable the place had nothing to fear it was not even attacked and when in 1355 edward the black prince marched into it the inhabitants had opened the gates to the conqueror before whom all languedoc was prostrate  i am not one of those who as i said just now have a head for such things and having extracted these few facts had made all the use of m violletleducs pamphlet of which i was cap able  i have mentioned that my obliging friend the amoureuxfou handed me over to the doorkeeper of the citadel  i should add that i was at first committed to the wife of this functionary a stout peasantwoman who took a key down from a nail conducted me to a postern door and ushered me into the presence of her husband  having just begun his rounds with a party of four persons he was not many steps in advance  i added myself perforce to this party which was not brilliantly composed except that two of its members were gendarmes in full toggery who announced in the course of our tour that they had been stationed for a year at carcassonne and had never before had the curiosity to come up to the cite  there was something brilliant certainly in that  the gardien was an extra ordinarily typical little frenchman who struck me even more forcibly than the wonders of the inner enceinte and as i am bound to assume at whatever cost to my literary vanity that there is not the slightest danger of his reading these remarks i may treat him as public property  with his diminutive stature and his per pendicular spirit his flushed face expressive protuber ant eyes high peremptory voice extreme volubility lucidity and neatness of utterance he reminded me of the gentry who figure in the revolutions of his native land  if he was not a fierce little jacobin he ought to have been for i am sure there were many men of his pattern on the committee of public safety  he knew absolutely what he was about understood the place thoroughly and constantly reminded his audience of what he himself had done in the way of excavations and reparations  he described himself as the brother of the architect of the work actually going forward that which has been done since the death of m viol letleduc i suppose he meant and this fact was more illustrative than all the others  it reminded me as one is reminded at every turn of the democratic con ditions of french life a man of the people with a wife en bonnet extremely intelligent full of special knowledge and yet remaining essentially of the people and showing his intelligence with a kind of ferocity of defiance  such a personage helps one to under stand the red radicalism of france the revolutions the barricades the sinister passion for theories  i do not of course take upon myself to say that the indi vidual i describe  who can know nothing of the liberties i am taking with him  is actually devoted to these ideals i only mean that many such devotees must have his qualities  in just the nuance that i have tried to indicate here it is a terrible pattern of man  permeated in a high degree by civilization it is yet untouched by the desire which one finds in the englishman in proportion as he rises in the world to approximate to the figure of the gentleman  on the other hand a nettete a faculty of exposition such as the english gentleman is rarely either blessed or cursed with  this brilliant this suggestive warden of carcas sonne marched us about for an hour haranguing ex plaining illustrating as he went it was a complete little lecture such as might have been delivered at the lowell institute on the manger in which a first rate place forte used to be attacked and defended our peregrinations made it very clear that carcassone was impregnable it is impossible to imagine without having seen them such refinements of immurement such ingenuities of resistance  we passed along the battlements and chemins de ronde ascended and de scended towers crawled under arches peered out of loopholes lowered ourselves into dungeons halted in all sorts of tight places while the purpose of some thing or other was described to us  it was very curious very interesting above all it was very pic torial and involved perpetual peeps into the little crooked crumbling sunny grassy empty cite  in places as you stand upon it the great towered and embattled enceinte produces an illusion it looks as if it were still equipped and defended  one vivid challenge at any rate it flings down before you it calls upon you to make up your mind on the matter of restoration  for myself i have no hesitation i prefer in every case the ruined however ruined to the reconstructed however splendid  what is left is more precious than what is added the one is history the other is fiction and i like the former the better of the two  it is so much more romantic  one is posi tive so far as it goes the other fills up the void with things more dead than the void itself inasmuch as they have never had life  after that i am free to say that the restoration of carcassonne is a splendid achievement  the little custodian dismissed us at last after having as usual inducted us into the inevi table repository of photographs  these photographs are a great nuisance all over the midi  they are exceedingly bad for the most part and the worst  those in the form of the hideous little albumpano rama  are thrust upon you at every turn  they are a kind of tax that you must pay the best way is to pay to be let off  it was not to be denied that there was a relief in separating from our accomplished guide whose manner of imparting information re minded me of the energetic process by which i have seen mineral waters bottled  all this while the after noon had grown more lovely the sunset had deepened the horizon of hills grown purple the mass of the canigou became more delicate yet more distinct  the day had so far faded that the interior of the little cathedral was wrapped in twilight into which the glowing windows projected something of their color this church has high beauty and value but i will spare the reader a presentation of details which i my self had no opportunity to master  it consists of a romanesque nave of the end of the eleventh century and a gothic choir and transepts of the beginning of the fourteenth and shut up in its citadel like a precious casket in a cabinet it seems  or seemed at that hour  to have a sort of double sanctity  after leaving it and passing out of the two circles of walls i treated myself in the most infatuated manner to another walk round the cite  it is certainly this general impression that is most striking  the impression from outside where the whole place detaches itself at once from the landscape  in the warm southern dusk it looked more than ever like a city in a fairytale  to make the thing perfect a white young moon in its first quarter came out and hung just over the dark sil houette  it was hard to come away  to incommode ones self for anything so vulgar as a railwaytrain i would gladly have spent the evening in revolving round the walls of carcassonne  but i had in a measure engaged to proceed to narborme and there was a certain magic that name which gave me strength  narbonne the richest city in roman gaul    xxiv  at narbonne i took up my abode at the house of a serrurier mecanicien and was very thankful for the accommodation  it was my misfortune to arrive at this ancient city late at night on the eve of market day and marketday at narbonne is a very serious affair  the inns on this occasion are stuffed with winedealers for the country roundabout dedicated almost exclusively to bacchus has hitherto escaped the phylloxera  this deadly enemy of the grape is encamped over the midi in a hundred places blighted vineyards and ruined proprietors being quite the order of the day  the signs of distress are more frequent as you advance into provence many of the vines being laid under water in the hope of washing the plague away  there are healthy regions still however and the vintners find plenty to do at narbonne  the traffic in wine appeared to be the sole thought of the narbonnais every one i spoke to had something to say about the harvest of gold that bloomed under its influence  cest inoui monsieur largent quil y a dans ce pays  des gens a qui la vente de leur vin rapporte jusqua 500000 francs par an  that little speech addressed to me by a gentleman at the inn gives the note of these revelations  it must be said that there was little in the appearance either of the town or of its population to suggest the possession of such treasures  narbonne is a sale petite ville in all the force of the term and my first impression on ar riving there was an extreme regret that i had not remained for the night at the lovely carcassonne  my journey from that delectable spot lasted a couple of hours and was performed in darkness  a darkness not so dense however but that i was able to make out as we passed it the great figure of beziers whose ancient roofs and towers clustered on a goodly hill top looked as fantastic as you please  i know not what appearance beziers may present by day but by night it has quite the grand air  on issuing from the station at narbonne i found that the only vehicle in waiting was a kind of bastard tramcar a thing shaped as if it had been meant to go upon rails that is equipped with small wheels placed beneath it and with a platform at either end but destined to rattle over the stones like the most vulgar of omnibuses to complete the oddity of this conveyance it was under the supervision not of a conductor but of a conductress  a fair young woman with a pouch sus pended from her girdle had command of the platform and as soon as the car was full she jolted us into the town through clouds of the thickest dust i ever have swallowed  i have had occasion to speak of the activity of women in france  of the way they are always in the ascendant and here was a signal example of their general utility  the young lady i have mentioned conveyed her whole company to the wretched little hotel de france where it is to be hoped that some of them found a lodging  for myself i was informed that the place was crowded from cellar to attic and that its inmates were sleeping three or four in a room at carcassonne i should have had a bad bed but at narbonne apparently i was to have no bed at all  i passed an hour or two of flat suspense while fate settled the question of whether i should go on to perpignan return to beziers or still discover a modest couch at narbonne  i shall not have suffered in vain however if my example serves to deter other travellers from alighting unannounced at that city on a wednes day evening  the retreat to beziers not attempted in time proved impossible and i was assured that at perpignan which i should not reach till midnight the affluence of winedealers was not less than at nar bonne  i interviewed every hostess in the town and got no satisfaction but distracted shrugs  finally at an advanced hour one of the servants of the hotel de france where i had attempted to dine came to me in triumph to proclaim that he had secured for me a charming apartment in a maison bourgeoise  i took possession of it gratefully in spite of its having an entrance like a stable and being pervaded by an odor compared with which that of a stable would have been delicious  as i have mentioned my land lord was a locksmith and he had strange machines which rumbled and whirred in the rooms below my own  nevertheless i slept and i dreamed of car cassonne  it was better to do that than to dream of the hotel de france  i was obliged to cultivate relations with the cuisine of this establishment  nothing could have been more meridional indeed both the dirty little inn and nar bonne at large seemed to me to have the infirmities of the south without its usual graces  narrow noisy shabby belittered and encumbered filled with clatter and chatter the hotel de france would have been described in perfection by alphonse daudet  for what struck me above all in it was the note of the midi as he has represented it  the sound of universal talk the landlord sat at supper with sundry friends in a kind of glass cage with a genial indifference to arriv ing guests the waiters tumbled over the loose luggage in the hall the travellers who had been turned away leaned gloomily against doorposts and the landlady surrounded by confusion unconscious of responsibility and animated only by the spirit of conversation bandied highvoiced compliments with the voyageurs de com merce  at ten oclock in the morning there was a table dhote for breakfast  a wonderful repast which overflowed into every room and pervaded the whole establishment  i sat down with a hundred hungry marketers fat brown greasy men with a good deal of the rich soil of languedoc adhering to their hands and their boots  i mention the latter articles because they almost put them on the table  it was very hot and there were swarms of flies the viands had the strongest odor there was in particular a horrible mix ture known as grasdouble a light gray glutinous nauseating mess which my companions devoured in large quantities  a man opposite to me had the dir tiest fingers i ever saw a collection of fingers which in england would have excluded him from a farmers ordinary  the conversation was mainly bucolic though a part of it i remember at the table at which i sat consisted of a discussion as to whether or no the maid servant were sage  a discussion which went on under the nose of this young lady as she carried about the dreadful grasdouble and to which she contributed the most convincing blushes  it was thoroughly meri dional  in going to narbonne i had of course counted upon roman remains but when i went forth in search of them i perceived that i had hoped too fondly  there is really nothing in the place to speak of that is on the day of my visit there was nothing but the market which was in complete possession  this intricate curious but lifeless town murray calls it yet to me it appeared overflowing with life  its streets are mere crooked dirty lanes bordered with perfectly insignifi cant houses but they were filled with the same clatter and chatter that i had found at the hotel  the market was held partly in the little square of the hotel de ville a structure which a flattering woodcut in the guidejoanne had given me a desire to behold  the reality was not impressive the old color of the front having been completely restored away  such interest as it superficially possesses it derives from a fine mediaeval tower which rises beside it with turrets at the angles  always a picturesque thing  the rest of the market was held in another place still shabbier than the first which lies beyond the canal  the canal du midi flows through the town and spanned at this point by a small suspensionbridge presented a cer tain sketchability  on the further side were the venders and chafferers  old women under awnings and big um brellas rickety tables piled high with fruit white caps and brown faces blouses sabots donkeys  beneath this picture was another  a long row of washerwomen on their knees on the edge of the canal pounding and wringing the dirty linen of narbonne  no great quantity to judge by the costume of the people  in numerable rusty men scattered all over the place were buying and selling wine straddling about in pairs in groups with their hands in their pockets and packed together at the doors of the cafes  they were mostly fat and brown and unshaven they ground their teeth as they talked they were very meridionaux  the only two lions at narbonne are the cathedral and the museum the latter of which is quartered in the hotel de ville  the cathedral closely shut in by houses and with the west front undergoing repairs is singular in two respects  it consists exclusively of a choir which is of the end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the next and of great magnifi cence  there is absolutely nothing else  this choir of extraordinary elevation forms the whole church  i sat there a good while there was no other visitor  i had taken a great dislike to poor little narbonne which struck me as sordid and overheated and this place seemed to extend to me as in the middle ages the privilege of sanctuary  it is a very solemn corner the other peculiarity of the cathedral is that exter nally it bristles with battlements having anciently formed part of the defences of the archeveche which is beside it and which connects it with the hotel de ville  this combination of the church and the for tress is very curious and during the middle ages was not without its value  the palace of the former arch bishops of narbonne the hotel de ville of today forms part of it was both an asylum and an arsenal during the hideous wars by which the languedoc was ravaged in the thirteenth century  the whole mass of buildings is jammed together in a manner that from certain points of view makes it far from apparent which feature is which  the museum occupies several chambers at the top of the hotel de ville and is not an imposing collection  it was closed but i induced the portress to let me in  a silent cadaverous person in a black coif like a beguine who sat knitting in one of the windows while i went the rounds  the number of roman fragments is small and their quality is not the finest i must add that this impression was hastily gathered  there is indeed a work of art in one of the rooms which creates a presumption in favor of the place  the portrait rather a good one of a citizen of narbonne whose name i forget who is described as having devoted all his time and his intelligence to collecting the objects by which the visitor is sur rounded  this excellent man was a connoisseur and the visitor is doubtless often an ignoramus    xxv   cette with its glistening houses white     curves with the curving beach away  to where the lighthouse beacons bright     far in the bay  that stanza of matthew arnolds which i hap pened to remember gave a certain importance to the halfhour i spent in the buffet of the station at cette while i waited for the train to montpellier  i had left narbonne in the afternoon and by the time i reached cette the darkness had descended  i therefore missed the sight of the glistening houses and had to console myself with that of the beacon in the bay as well as with a bouillon of which i partook at the buffet afore said for since the morning i had not ventured to return to the table dhote at narbonne  the hotel nevet at montpellier which i reached an hour later has an ancient renown all over the south of france  advertises itself i believe as le plus vaste du midi  it seemed to me the model of a good provincial inn a big rambling creaking establishment with brown labyrinthine corridors a queer old openair vestibule into which the diligence in the bon temps used to penetrate and an hospitality more expressive than that of the new caravansaries  it dates from the days when montpellier was still accounted a fine winter re sidence for people with weak lungs and this rather melancholy tradition together with the former celebrity of the school of medicine still existing there but from which the glory has departed helps to account for its combination of high antiquity and vast proportions the old hotels were usually more concentrated but the school of medicine passed for one of the attrac tions of montpellier  long before mentone was dis covered or colorado invented british invalids travelled down through france in the postchaise or the public coach to spend their winters in the wonderful place which boasted both a climate and a faculty  the air is mild no doubt but there are refinements of mild ness which were not then suspected and which in a more analytic age have carried the annual wave far beyond montpellier  the place is charming all the same and it served the purpose of john locke who made a long stay there between 1675 and 1679 and became acquainted with a noble fellowvisitor lord pembroke to whom he dedicated the famous essay there are places that please without your being able to say wherefore and montpellier is one of the num ber  it has some charming views from the great pro menade of the peyrou but its position is not strikingly fair  beyond this it contains a good museum and the long facades of its school but these are its only de finite treasures  its cathedral struck me as quite the weakest i had seen and i remember no other monu ment that made up for it  the place has neither the gayety of a modern nor the solemnity of an ancient town and it is agreeable as certain women are agree able who are neither beautiful nor clever  an italian would remark that it is sympathetic a german would admit that it is gemuthlich  i spent two days there mostly in the rain and even under these circum stances i carried away a kindly impression  i think the hotel nevet had something to do with it and the sentiment of relief with which in a quiet even a luxurious room that looked out on a garden i reflected that i had washed my hands of narbonne  the phyl loxera has destroyed the vines in the country that sur rounds montpellier and at that moment i was capable of rejoicing in the thought that i should not breakfast with vintners  the gem of the place is the musee fabre one of the best collections of paintings in a provincial city francois fabre a native of montpellier died there in 1837 after having spent a considerable part of his life in italy where he had collected a good many valuable pictures and some very poor ones the latter class including several from his own hand  he was the hero of a remarkable episode having succeeded no less a person than vittorio alfieri in the affections of no less a person than louise de stolberg countess of albany widow of no less a person than charles edward stuart the second pretender to the british crown  surely no woman ever was associated senti mentally with three figures more diverse  a disqualified sovereign an italian dramatist and a bad french painter  the productions of m fabre who followed in the steps of david bear the stamp of a cold me diocrity there is not much to be said even for the portrait of the genial countess her life has been written by m saintrenetaillandier who depicts her as de lightful which hangs in florence in the gallery of the uffizzi and makes a pendant to a likeness of alfieri by the same author  stendhal in his me moires dun touriste says that this work of art represents her as a cook who has pretty hands  i am delighted to have an opportunity of quoting stendhal whose two volumes of the memoires dun touriste every traveller in france should carry in his port manteau  i have had this opportunity more than once for i have met him at tours at nantes at bourges and everywhere he is suggestive  but he has the de fect that he is never pictorial that he never by any chance makes an image and that his style is per versely colorless for a man so fond of contemplation his taste is often singularly false it is the taste of the early years of the present century the period that produced clocks surmounted with sentimental sub jects  stendhal does not admire these clocks but he almost does  he admires domenichino and guer cino and prizes the bolognese school of painters be cause they spoke to the soul  he is a votary of the new classic is fond of tall squire regular buildings and thinks nantes for instance full of the air noble it was a pleasure to me to reflect that fiveandforty years ago he had alighted in that city at the very inn in which i spent a night and which looks down on the place graslin and the theatre  the hotel that was the best in 1837 appears to be the best today  on the subject of touraine stendhal is extremely refresh ing he finds the scenery meagre and much overrated and proclaims his opinion with perfect frankness  he does however scant justice to the banks of the loire his want of appreciation of the picturesque  want of the sketchers sense  causes him to miss half the charm of a landscape which is nothing if not quiet as a painter would say and of which the felicities reveal themselves only to waiting eyes  he even despises the indre the river of madame sand  the memoires dun touriste are written in the character of a commercial traveller and the author has nothing to say about chenonceaux or chambord or indeed about any of the chateaux of that part of france his system being to talk only of the large towns where he may be supposed to find a market for his goods  it was his ambition to pass for an ironmonger  but in the large towns he is usually excellent company though as discursive as sterne and strangely indifferent for a man of imagination to those superficial aspects of things which the poor pages now before the reader are mainly an attempt to render  it is his conviction that alfieri at florence bored the countess of albany ter ribly and he adds that the famous gallophobe died of jealousy of the little painter from montpellier  the countess of albany left her property to fabre and i suppose some of the pieces in the museum of his native town used to hang in the sunny saloons of that fine old palace on the arno which is still pointed out to the stranger in florence as the residence of alfieri  the institution has had other benefactors notably a certain m bruyas who has enriched it with an extra ordinary number of portraits of himself  as these however are by different hands some of them dis tinguished we may suppose that it was less the model than the artists to whom m bruyas wished to give publicity easily first are two large specimens of david teniers which are incomparable for brilliancy and a glowing perfection of execution  i have a weak ness for this singular genius who combined the delicate with the grovelling and i have rarely seen richer examples  scarcely less valuable is a gerard dow which hangs near them though it must rank lower as having kept less of its freshness  this gerard dow did me good for a master is a master whatever he may paint  it represents a woman paring carrots while a boy before her exhibits a mousetrap in which he has caught a frightened victim  the goodwife has spread a cloth on the top of a big barrel which serves her as a table and on this brown greasy napkin of which the texture is wonderfully rendered lie the raw vegetables she is preparing for domestic consumption beside the barrel is a large caldron lined with copper with a rim of brass  the way these things are painted brings tears to the eyes but they give the measure of the musee fabre where two specimens of teniers and a gerard dow are the jewels  the italian pictures are of small value but there is a work by sir joshua rey nolds said to be the only one in france  an infant samuel in prayer apparently a repetition of the pic ture in england which inspired the little plaster im age disseminated in protestant lands that we used to admire in our childhood  sir joshua somehow was an eminently protestant painter no one can forget that who in the national gallery in london has looked at the picture in which he represents several young ladies as nymphs voluminously draped hanging gar lands over a statue  a picture suffused indefinably with the anglican spirit and exasperating to a mem ber of one of the latin races  it is an odd chance therefore that has led him into that part of france where protestants have been least bien vus  this is the country of the dragonnades of louis xiv  and of the pastors of the desert  from the garden of the peyrou at montpellier you may see the hills of the cevennes to which they of the religion fled for safety and out of which they were hunted and harried  i have only to add in regard to the musee fabre that it contains the portrait of its founder  a little pursy fatfaced elderly man whose countenance con tains few indications of the power that makes distin guished victims  he is however just such a personage as the minds eye sees walking on the terrace of the peyrou of an october afternoon in the early years of the century a plump figure in a chocolatecolored coat and a culotte that exhibits a good leg  a culotte pro vided with a watchfob from which a heavy seal is suspended  this peyrou to come to it at last is a wonderful place especially to be found in a little pro vincial city  france is certainly the country of towns that aim at completeness more than in other lands they contain stately features as a matter of course  we should never have ceased to hear about the peyrou if fortune had placed it at a shrewsbury or a buffalo  it is true that the place enjoys a certain celebrity at home which it amply deserves moreover for nothing could be more impressive and monumental  it consists of an elevated platform as murray says  an im mense terrace laid out in the highest part of the town as a garden and commanding in all directions a view which in clear weather must be of the finest  i strolled there in the intervals of showers and saw only the nearer beauties  a great pompous arch of triumph in honor of louis xiv which is not properly speaking in the garden but faces it straddling across the place by which you approach it from the town an equestrian statue of that monarch set aloft in the middle of the terrace and a very exalted and complicated fountain which forms a background to the picture  this foun tain gushes from a kind of hydraulic temple or cha teau deau to which you ascend by broad flights of steps and which is fed by a splendid aqueduct stretched in the most ornamental and unexpected manner across the neighboring valley  all this work dates from the middle of the last century  the com bination of features  the triumphal arch or gate the wide fair terrace with its beautiful view the statue of the grand monarch the big architectural fountain which would not surprise one at rome but goes sur prise one at montpellier and to complete the effect the extraordinary aqueduct charmingly foreshortened  all this is worthy of a capital of a little courtcity the whole place with its repeated steps its balus trades its massive and plentiful stonework is full of the air of the last century  sent bien son dixhuitieme siecle none the less so i am afraid that as i read in my faithful murray after the revocation of the edict of nantes the block the stake the wheel had been erected here for the benefit of the desperate camisards    xxvi  it was a pleasure to feel ones self in provence again  the land where the silvergray earth is im pregnated with the light of the sky  to celebrate the event as soon as i arrived at nimes i engaged a caleche to convey me to the pont du gard  the day was yet young and it was perfectly fair it ap peared well for a longish drive to take advantage without delay of such security  after i had left the town i became more intimate with that provencal charm which i had already enjoyed from the window of the train and which glowed in the sweet sunshine and the white rocks and lurked in the smokepuffs of the little olives  the olivetrees in provence are half the landscape  they are neither so tall so stout nor so richly contorted as i have seen them beyond the alps but this mild colorless bloom seems the very texture of the country  the road from nimes for a distance of fifteen miles is superb broad enough for an army and as white and firm as a dinnertable it stretches away over undulations which suggest a kind of harmony and in the curves it makes through the wide free country where there is never a hedge or a wall and the detail is always exquisite there is something majestic almost processional  some twenty minutes before i reached the little inn that marks the termination of the drive my vehicle met with an ac cident which just missed being serious and which engaged the attention of a gentleman who followed by his groom and mounted on a strikingly handsome horse happened to ride up at the moment  this young man who with his good looks and charming manner might have stepped out of a novel of octave feuillet gave me some very intelligent advice in reference to one of my horses that had been injured and was so good as to accompany me to the inn with the re sources of which he was acquainted to see that his recommendations were carried out  the result of our interview was that he invited me to come and look at a small but ancient chateau in the neighborhood which he had the happiness  not the greatest in the world he intimated  to inhabit and at which i en gaged to present myself after i should have spent an hour at the pont du gard  for the moment when we separated i gave all my attention to that great structure  you are very near it before you see it the ravine it spans suddenly opens and exhibits the picture  the scene at this point grows extremely beautiful  the ravine is the valley of the gardon which the road from nimes has followed some time without taking account of it but which exactly at the right distance from the aqueduct deepens and ex pands and puts on those characteristics which are best suited to give it effect  the gorge becomes romantic still and solitary and with its white rocks and wild shrubbery hangs over the clear colored river in whose slow course there is here and there a deeper pool over the valley from side to side and ever so high in the air stretch the three tiers of the tremendous bridge  they are unspeakably imposing and nothing could well be more roman  the hugeness the soli dity the unexpectedness the monumental rectitude of the whole thing leave you nothing to say  at the time  and make you stand gazing  you simply feel that it is noble and perfect that it has the quality of greatness  a road branching from the highway de scends to the level of the river and passes under one of the arches  this road has a wide margin of grass and loose stones which slopes upward into the bank of the ravine  you may sit here as long as you please staring up at the light strong piers the spot is ex tremely natural though two or three stone benches have been erected on it  i remained there an hour and got a cornplete impression the place was per fectly soundless and for the time at least lonely the splendid afternoon had begun to fade and there was a fascination in the object i had come to see  it came to pass that at the same time i discovered in it a certain stupidity a vague brutality  that element is rarely absent from great roman work which is wanting in the nice adaptation of the means to the end  the means are always exaggerated the end is so much more than attained  the roman rigidity was apt to overshoot the mark and i suppose a race which could do nothing small is as defective as a race that can do nothing great  of this roman rigidity the pont du gard is an admirable example  it would be a great injustice however not to insist upon its beauty  a kind of manly beauty that of an object constructed not to please but to serve and impressive simply from the scale on which it carries out this intention  the number of arches in each tier is dif ferent they are smaller and more numerous as they ascend  the preservation of the thing is extra ordinary nothing has crumbled or collapsed every feature remains and the huge blocks of stone of a brownishyellow as if they had been baked by the provencal sun for eighteen centuries pile themselves without mortar or cement as evenly as the day they were laid together  all this to carry the water of a couple of springs to a little provincial city  the con duit on the top has retained its shape and traces of the cement with which it was lined  when the vague twilight began to gather the lonely valley seemed to fill itself with the shadow of the roman name as if the mighty empire were still as erect as the supports of the aqueduct and it was open to a solitary tourist sitting there sentimental to believe that no people has ever been or will ever be as great as that measured as we measure the greatness of an individual by the push they gave to what they undertook  the pont du gard is one of the three or four deepest impressions they have left it speaks of them in a manner with which they might have been satisfied  i feel as if it were scarcely discreet to indicate the whereabouts of the chateau of the obliging young man i had met on the way from nimes i must con tent myself with saying that it nestled in an en chanting valley  dans le fond as they say in france  and that i took my course thither on foot after leaving the pont du gard  i find it noted in my journal as an adorable little corner  the principal feature of the place is a couple of very ancient towers brownishyellow in hue and mantled in scarlet vir giniacreeper  one of these towers reputed to be of saracenic origin is isolated and is only the more effective the other is incorporated in the house which is delightfully fragmentary and irregular  it had got to be late by this time and the lonely castel looked crepuscular and mysterious  an old house keeper was sent for who showed me the rambling interior and then the young man took me into a dim old drawingroom which had no less than four chimneypieces all unlighted and gave me a refec tion of fruit and sweet wine  when i praised the wine and asked him what it was he said simply cest du vin de ma mere  throughout my little joumey i had never yet felt myself so far from paris and this was a sensation i enjoyed more than my host who was an involuntary exile consoling him self with laying out a manege which he showed me as i walked away  his civility was great and i was greatly touched by it  on my way back to the little inn where i had left my vehicle i passed the pont du gard and took another look at it  its great arches made windows for the evening sky and the rocky ravine with its dusky cedars and shining river was lonelier than before  at the inn i swallowed or tried to swallowa glass of horrible wine with my coach man after which with my reconstructed team i drove back to nimes in the moonlight  it only added a more solitary whiteness to the constant sheen of the provencal landscape    xxvii  the weather the next day was equally fair so that it seemed an imprudence not to make sure of aigues mortes  nimes itself could wait at a pinch i could attend to nimes in the rain  it was my belief that aiguesmortes was a little gem and it is natural to desire that gems should have an opportunity to sparkle this is an excursion of but a few hours and there is a little friendly familiar dawdling train that will con vey you in time for a noonday breakfast to the small dead town where the blessed saintlouis twice em barked for the crusades  you may get back to nimes for dinner the run  or rather the walk for the train doesnt run  is of about an hour  i found the little journey charming and looked out of the carriage win dow on my right at the distant cevennes covered with tones of amber and blue and all around at vineyards red with the touch of october  the grapes were gone but the plants had a color of their own within a certain distance of aiguesmortes they give place to wide saltmarshes traversed by two canals and over this expanse the train rumbles slowly upon a narrow causeway failing for some time though you know you are near the object of your curiosity to bring you to sight of anything but the horizon  sud denly it appears the towered and embattled mass lying so low that the crest of its defences seems to rise straight out of the ground and it is not till the train stops close before them that you are able to take the full measure of its walls  aiguesmortes stands on the edge of a wide etang or shallow inlet of the sea the further side of which is divided by a narrow band of coast from the gulf of lyons  next after carcassonne to which it forms an admirable pendant it is the most perfect thing of the kind in france  it has a rival in the person of avignon but the ramparts of avignon are much less effective  like carcassonne it is completely sur rounded with its old fortifications and if they are far simpler in character there is but one circle they are quite as well preserved  the moat has been filled up and the site of  the town might be figured by a billiardtable without pockets  on this absolute level covered with coarse grass aiguesmortes presents quite the appearance of the walled town that a schoolboy draws upon his slate or that we see in the background of early flemish pictures  a simple parallelogram of a contour almost absurdly bare broken at intervals by angular towers and square holes  such literally speak ing is this delightful little city which needs to be seen to tell its full story  it is extraordinarily pictorial and if it is a very small sister of carcassonne it has at least the essential features of the family  indeed it is even more like an image and less like a reality than carcassonne for by position and prospect it seems even more detached from the life of the present day  it is true that aiguesmortes does a little busi ness it sees certain bags of salt piled into barges which stand in a canal beside it and which carry their cargo into actual places  but nothing could well be more drowsy and desultory than this industry as i saw it practised with the aid of two or three brown peasants and under the eye of a solitary douanier who strolled on the little quay beneath the western wall  cest bien plaisant cest bien paisible said this worthy man with whom i had some conversa tion and pleasant and peaceful is the place indeed though the former of these epithets may suggest an element of gayety in which aiguesmortes is deficient the sand the salt the dull seaview surround it with a bright quiet melancholy  there are fifteen towers and nine gates five of which are on the southern side overlooking the water  i walked all round the place three times it doesnt take long but lingered most under the southern wall where the afternoon light slept in the dreamiest sweetest way  i sat down on an old stone and looked away to the desolate salt marshes and the still shining surface of the etang and as i did so reflected that this was a queer little outoftheworld corner to have been chosen in the great dominions of either monarch for that pompous interview which took place in 1538 between francis i and charles v  it was also not easy to perceive how louis ix when in 1248 and 1270 he started for the holy land set his army afloat in such very undeveloped channels  an hour later i purchased in the town a little pamphlet by m marius topin who undertakes to explain this latter anomaly and to show that there is water enough in the port as we may call it by courtesy to have sustained a fleet of crusaders  i was unable to trace the channel that he points out but was glad to believe that as he contends the sea has not retreated from the town since the thirteenth century it was comfortable to think that things are not so changed as that  m topin indicates that the other french ports of the mediterranean were not then dis ponsibles and that aiguesmortes was the most eligible spot for an embarkation  behind the straight walls and the quiet gates the little town has not crumbled like the cite of carcas sonne  it can hardly be said to be alive but if it is dead it has been very neatly embalmed  the hand of the restorer rests on it constantly but this artist has not as at carcassonne had miracles to accomplish the interior is very still and empty with small stony whitewashed streets tenanted by a stray dog a stray cat a stray old woman  in the middle is a little place with two or three cafes decorated by wide awnings  a little place of which the principal feature is a very bad bronze statue of saint louis by pradier  it is almost as bad as the breakfast i had at the inn that bears the name of that pious monarch  you may walk round the enceinte of aiguesmortes both outside and in but you may not as at carcassonne make a por tion of this circuit on the chemin de ronde the little projecting footway attached to the inner face of the battlements  this footway wide enough only for a single pedestrian is in the best order and near each of the gates a flight of steps leads up to it but a locked gate at the top of the steps makes access im possible or at least unlawful  aiguesmortes however has its citadel an immense tower larger than any of the others a little detached and standing at the north west angle of the town  i called upon the casernier the custodian of the walls  and in his absence i was conducted through this big tour de constance by his wife a very mild meek woman yellow with the traces of fever and ague  a scourge which as might be ex pected in a town whose name denotes dead waters enters freely at the nine gates  the tour de con stance is of extraordinary girth and solidity divided into three superposed circular chambers with very fine vaults which are lighted by embrasures of prodigious depth converging to windows little larger than loop holes  the place served for years as a prison to many of the protestants of the south whom the revocation of the edict of nantes had exposed to atrocious penalties and the annals of these dreadful chambers during the first half of the last century were written in tears and blood  some of the recorded cases of long confinement there make one marvel afresh at what man has inflicted and endured  in a country in which a policy of extermination was to be put into practice this horrible tower was an obvious resource from the battlements at the top which is surmounted by an old disused lighthouse you see the little com pact rectangular town which looks hardly bigger than a gardenpatch mapped out beneath you and follow the plain configuration of its defences  you take possession of it and you feel that you will remember it always    xxviii  after this i was free to look about me at nimes and i did so with such attention as the place appeared to require  at the risk of seeming too easily and too frequently disappointed i will say that it required rather less than i had been prepared to give  it is a town of three or four fine features rather than a town with as i may say a general figure  in general nimes is poor its only treasures are its roman re mains which are of the first order  the new french fashions prevail in many of its streets the old houses are paltry and the good houses are new while beside my hotel rose a big spickandspan church which had the oddest air of having been intended for brooklyn or cleveland  it is true that this church looked out on a square completely french  a square of a fine modern disposition flanked on one side by a classical palais de justice embellished with trees and parapets and occupied in the centre with a group of allegorical statues such as one encounters only in the cities of france the chief of these being a colossal figure by pradier representing nimes  an english an american town which should have such a monu ment such a square as this would be a place of great pretensions but like so many little villes de province in the country of which i write nimes is easily ornamental  what nobler ornament can there be than the roman baths at the foot of mont cavalier and the delightful old garden that surrounds them all that quarter of nimes has every reason to be proud of itself it has been revealed to the world at large by copious photography  a clear abundant stream gushes from the foot of a high hill covered with trees and laid out in paths and is distributed into basins which sufficiently refer themselves to the period that gave them birth  the period that has left its stamp on that pompous peyrou which we ad mired at montpellier  here are the same terraces and steps and balustrades and a system of waterworks less impressive perhaps but very ingenious and charm ing  the whole place is a mixture of old rome and of the french eighteenth century for the remains of the antique baths are in a measure incorporated in the modern fountains  in a corner of this umbrageous precinct stands a small roman ruin which is known as a temple of diana but was more apparently a nymphaeum and appears to have had a graceful con nection with the adjacent baths  i learn from murray that this little temple of the period of augustus was reduced to its present state of ruin in 1577 the moment at which the townspeople threatened with a siege by the troops of the crown partly demolished it lest it should serve as a cover to the enemy  the remains are very fragmentary but they serve to show that the place was lovely  i spent half an hour in it on a perfect sunday morning it is en closed by a high grille carefully tended and has a warden of its own and with the help of my imagina tion tried to reconstruct a little the aspect of things in the galloroman days  i do wrong perhaps to say that 1 tried from a flight so deliberate i should have shrunk  but there was a certain contagion of antiquity in the air and among the ruins of baths and temples in the very spot where the aqueduct that crosses the gardon in the wondrous manner i had seen discharged itself the picture of a splendid paganism seemed vaguely to glow  roman baths  roman baths those words alone were a scene  every thing was changed i was strolling in a jardin francais the bosky slope of the mont cavalier a very modest mountain hanging over the place is crowned with a shapeless tower which is as likely to be of mediaeval as of antique origin and yet as i leaned on the parapet of one of the fountains where a flight of curved steps a hemicycle as the french say descended into a basin full of dark cool recesses where the slabs of the roman foundations gleam through the clear green water  as in this attitude i surrendered myself to contemplation and reverie it seemed to me that i touched for a moment the ancient world  such mo ments are illuminating and the light of this one mingles in my memory with the dusky greenness of the jardin de la fontaine  the fountain proper  the source of all these dis tributed waters  is the prettiest thing in the world a reduced copy of vaucluse  it gushes up at the foot of the mont cavalier at a point where that eminence rises with a certain clifflike effect and like other springs in the same circumstances appears to issue from the rock with a sort of quivering stillness  i trudged up the mont cavalier  it is a matter of five minutes  and having committed this cockneyism en hanced it presently by another  i ascended the stupid tour magne the mysterious structure i mentioned a moment ago  the only feature of this dateless tube except the inevitable collection of photographs to which you are introduced by the doorkeeper is the view you enjoy from its summit  this view is of course remarkably fine but i am ashamed to say i have not the smallest recollection of it for while i looked into the brilliant spaces of the air i seemed still to see only what i saw in the depths of the roman baths  the image disastrously confused and vague of a vanished world  this world however has left at nimes a far more considerable memento than a few old stones covered with watermoss  the roman arena is the rival of those of verona and of arles at a respectful distance it emulates the colosseum  it is a small colosseum if i may be allowed the expression and is in a much better preservation than the great circus at rome  this is especially true of the external walls with their arches pillars cornices  i must add that one should not speak of preservation in regard to the arena at nimes without speaking also of repair after the great ruin ceased to be despoiled it began to be protected and most of its wounds have been dressed with new material  these matters concern the archaeologist and i felt here as i felt afterwards at arles that one of the profane in the presence of such a monument can only admire and hold his tongue  the great impression on the whole is an impression of wonder that so much should have sur vived  what remains at nimes after all dilapidation is estimated is astounding  i spent an hour in the arenes on that same sweet sunday morning as i came back from the roman baths and saw that the corridors the vaults the staircases the external casing are still virtually there  many of these parts are wanting in the colosseum whose sublimity of size however can afford to dispense with detail  the seats at nimes like those at verona have been largely renewed not that this mattered much as i lounged on the cool surface of one of them and admired the mighty concavity of the place and the elliptical sky line broken by uneven blocks and forming the rim of the monstrous cup  a cup that had been filled with horrors  and yet i made my reflections i said to myself that though a roman arena is one of the most impressive of the works of man it has a touch of that same stupidity which i ventured to discover in the pont du gard  it is brutal it is monotonous it is not at all exquisite  the arenes at nimes were ar ranged for a bullfight  a form of recreation that as i was informed is much dans les habitudes nimoises and very common throughout provence where still according to my information it is the usual pastime of a sunday afternoon  at arles and nimes it has a characteristic setting but in the villages the patrons of the game make a circle of carts and barrels on which the spectators perch themselves  i was sur prised at the prevalence in mild provence of the iberian vice and hardly know whether it makes the custom more respectable that at nimes and arles the thing is shabbily and imperfectly done  the bulls are rarely killed and indeed often are bulls only in the irish sense of the term  being domestic and motherly cows  such an entertainment of course does not supply to the arena that element of the exquisite which i spoke of as wanting  the exquisite at nimes is mainly represented by the famous maison carree the first impression you receive from this delicate little building as you stand before it is that you have already seen it many times  photographs engravings models medals have placed it definitely in your eye so that from the sentiment with which you regard it curiosity and surprise are almost completely and per haps deplorably absent  admiration remains how ever  admiration of a familiar and even slightly patronizing kind  the maison carree does not over whelm you you can conceive it  it is not one of the great sensations of the antique art but it is perfectly felicitous and in spite of having been put to all sorts of incongruous uses marvellously preserved  its slender columns its delicate proportions its charming com pactness seemed to bring one nearer to the century that built it than the great superpositions of arenas and bridges and give it the interest that vibrates from one age to another when the note of taste is struck if anything were needed to make this little toytemple a happy production the service would be rendered by the secondrate boulevard that conducts to it adorned with inferior cafes and tobaccoshops  here in a respectable recess surrounded by vulgar habitations and with the theatre of a classic pretension opposite stands the small square house so called because it is much longer than it is broad  i saw it first in the evening in the vague moonlight which made it look as if it were cast in bronze  stendhal says justly that it has the shape of a playingcard and he ex presses his admiration for it by the singular wish that an exact copy of it should be erected in paris he even goes so far as to say that in the year 1880 this tribute will have been rendered to its charms nothing would be more simple to his mind than to have in that city le pantheon de rome quelques temples de grece  stendhal found it amusing to write in the character of a commisvoyageur and some times it occurs to his reader that he really was one    xxix  on my way from nimes to arles i spent three hours at tarascon chiefly for the love of alphonse daudet who has written nothing more genial than les aventures prodigieuses de taitarin and the story of the siege of the bright dead little town a mythic siege by the prussians in the conies du lundi  in the introduction which for the new edition of his works he has lately supplied to tar tarin the author of this extravagant but kindly satire gives some account of the displeasure with which he has been visited by the ticklish tarascon nais  daudet relates that in his attempt to shed a humorous light upon some of the more erratic phases of the provencal character he selected tarascon at a venture not because the temperament of its natives is more vainglorious than that of their neighbors or their rebellion against the despotism of fact more marked but simply because he had to name a par ticular provencal city  tartarin is a hunter of lions and charmer of women a true produit du midi as daudet says who has the most fantastic and fabulous adventures  he is a minimized don quixote with much less dignity but with equal good faith and the story of his exploits is a little masterpiece of the light comical  the tarasconnais however declined to take the joke and opened the vials of their wrath upon the mocking child of nimes who would have been better employed they doubtless thought in show ing up the infirmities of his own family  i am bound to add that when i passed through tarascon they did not appear to be in the least out of humor  nothing could have been brighter softer more suggestive of amiable indifference than the picture it presented to my mind  it lies quietly beside the rhone looking across at beaucaire which seems very distant and in dependent and tacitly consenting to let the castle of the good king rene of anjou which projects very boldly into the river pass for its most interesting feature the other features are primarily a sort of vivid sleepi ness in the aspect of the place as if the september noon it had lingered on into october lasted longer there than elsewhere certain low arcades which make the streets look gray and exhibit empty vistas and a very curious and beautiful walk beside the rhone denominated the chaussee  a long and narrow cause way densely shaded by two rows of magnificent old trees planted in its embankment and rendered doubly effective at the moment i passed over it by a little train of collegians who had been taken out for mild exercise by a pair of young priests  lastly one may say that a striking element of tarascon as of any town that lies on the rhone is simply the rhone itself the big brown flood of uncertain temper which has never taken time to forget that it is a child of the mountain and the glacier and that such an origin carries with it great privileges  later at avignon i observed it in the exercise of these privileges chief among which was that of frightening the good people of the old papal city half out of their wits  the chateau of king rene serves today as the prison of a district and the traveller who wishes to look into it must obtain his permission at the mairie of tarascon  if he have had a certain experience of french manners his application will be accompanied with the forms of a considerable obsequiosity and in this case his request will be granted as civilly as it has been made  the castle has more of the air of a severely feudal fortress than i should suppose the period of its construction the first half of the fifteenth century would have warranted being tremendously bare and perpendicular and constructed for comfort only in the sense that it was arranged for defence  it is a square and simple mass composed of small yellow stones and perched on a pedestal of rock which easily commands the river  the building has the usual cir cular towers at the corners and a heavy cornice at the top and immense stretches of sunscorched wall relieved at wide intervals by small windows heavily crossbarred  it has above all an extreme steepness of aspect i cannot express it otherwise  the walls are as sheer and inhospitable as precipices  the castle has kept its large moat which is now a hollow filled with wild plants  to this tall fortress the good rene retired in the middle of the fifteenth century finding it apparently the most substantial thing left him in a dominion which had included naples and sicily lorraine and anjou  he had been a muchtried monarch and the sport of a various fortune fighting half his life for thrones he didnt care for and exalted only to be quickly cast down  provence was the country of his affection and the memory of his troubles did not prevent him from holding a joyous court at tarascon and at aix  he finished the castle at tarascon which had been begun earlier in the century  finished it i suppose for consistencys sake in the manner in which it had originally been designed rather than in accordance with the artistic tastes that formed the consolation of his old age  he was a painter a writer a dramatist a modern dilettante addicted to private theatricals  there is something very attractive in the image that he has imprinted on the page of history  he was both clever and kind and many reverses and much suffering had not imbittered him nor quenched his faculty of enjoyment  he was fond of his sweet provence and his sweet provence has been grateful it has woven a light tissue of legend around the memory of the good king rene  i strolled over his dusky habitation  it must have taken all his goodhumor to light it up  at the heels of the custodian who showed me the usual number of castleproperties a deep welllike court a collection of winding staircases and vaulted chambers the embra sures of whose windows and the recesses of whose doorways reveal a tremendous thickness of wall  these things constitute the general identity of old castles and when one has wandered through a good many with due discretion of step and protrusion of head one ceases very much to distinguish and remember and contents ones self with consigning them to the honorable limbo of the romantic  i must add that this reflection did not the least deter me from crossing the bridge which connects tarascon with beaucaire in order to examine the old fortress whose ruins adorn the latter city  it stands on a foundation of rock much higher than that of tarascon and looks over with a melancholy expression at its betterconditioned brother its position is magnificent and its outline very gallant i was well rewarded for my pilgrimage for if the castle of beaucaire is only a fragment the whole place with its position and its views is an ineffaceable picture  it was the stronghold of the montmorencys and its last tenant was that rash duke francois whom richelieu seizing every occasion to trample on a great noble caused to be beheaded at toulouse where we saw in the capitol the butchers knife with which the cardinal pruned the crown of france of its thorns  the castle after the death of this victim was virtually demolished its site which nature today has taken again to herself has an extraordinary charm  the mass of rock that it formerly covered rises high above the town and is as precipitous as the side of the rhone  a tall rusty iron gate admits you from a quiet corner of beaucaire to a wild tangled garden covering the side of the hill  for the whole place forms the public promenade of the townsfolk  a garden without flowers with little steep rough paths that wind under a plantation of small scrubby stonepines  above this is the grassy platform of the castle enclosed on one side only toward the river by a large fragment of wall and a very massive dungeon  there are benches placed in the lee of the wall and others on the edge of the platform where one may enjoy a view beyond the river of certain peeled and scorched undulations  a sweet desolation an everlasting peace seemed to hang in the air  a very old man a fragment like the castle itself emerged from some crumbling corner to do me the honors  a very gentle obsequious tottering toothless grateful old man  he beguiled me into an ascent of the solitary tower from which you may look down on the big sallow river and glance at diminished tarascon and the barefaced baldheaded hills behind it  it may appear that i insist too much upon the nudity of the provencal horiion  too much considering that i have spoken of the prospect from the heights of beaucaire as lovely  but it is an exquisite bareness it seems to exist for the purpose of allowing one to follow the de licate lines of the hills and touch with the eyes as it were the smallest inflections of the landscape  it makes the whole thing seem wonderfully bright and pure  beaucaire used to be the scene of a famous fair the great fair of the south of france  it has gone the way of most fairs even in france where these delight ful exhibitions hold their own much better than might be supposed  it is still held in the month of july but the bourgeoises of tarascon send to the magasin du louvre for their smart dresses and the principal glory of the scene is its long tradition  even now however it ought to be the prettiest of all fairs for it takes place in a charming wood which lies just beneath the castle beside the rhone  the booths the barracks the platforms of the mountebanks the brightcolored crowd diffused through this midsummer shade and spotted here and there with the rich provencal sun shine must be of the most pictorial effect  it is highly probable too that it offers a large collection of pretty faces for even in the few hours that i spent at tarascon i discovered symptoms of the purity of feature for which the women of the pays darles are renowned  the arlesian headdress was visible in the streets and this delightful coiffure is so associated with a charming facial oval a dark mild eye a straight greek nose and a mouth worthy of all the rest that it conveys a presumption of beauty which gives the wearer time either to escape or to please you  i have read somewhere however that tarascon is supposed to produce handsome men as arles is known to deal in handsome women  it may be that i should have found the tarasconnais very fine fellows if i had en countered enough specimens to justify an induction but there were very few males in the streets and the place presented no appearance of activity  here and there the black coif of an old woman or of a young girl was framed by a low doorway but for the rest as i have said tarascon was mostly involved in a siesta there was not a creature in the little church of saint martha which i made a point of visiting before i re turned to the station and which with its fine romanesque sideportal and its pointed and crocketed gothic spire is as curious as it need be in view of its tradition  it stands in a quiet corner where the grass grows between the small cobblestones and you pass beneath a deep archway to reach it  the tradition relates that saint martha tamed with her own hands and attached to her girdle a dreadful dragon who was known as the tarasque and is reported to have given his name to the city on whose site amid the rocks which form the base of the chateau he had his cavern  the dragon perhaps is the symbol of a ravening paganism dis pelled by the eloquence of a sweet evangelist  the bones of the interesting saint at all events were found in the eleventh century in a cave beneath the spot on which her altar now stands  i know not what had be come of the bones of the dragon    xxx  there are two shabby old inns at arles which compete closely for your custom  i mean by this that if you elect to go to the hotel du forum the hotel du nord which is placed exactly beside it at a right angle watches your arrival with illconcealed dis approval and if you take the chances of its neighbor the hotel du forum seems to glare at you invidiously from all its windows and doors  i forget which of these establishments i selected whichever it was i wished very much that it had been the other  the two stand together on the place des hommes a little public square of arles which somehow quite misses its effect  as a city indeed arles quite misses its effect in every way and if it is a charming place as i think it is i can hardly tell the reason why  the straightnosed arlesiennes account for it in some degree and the remainder may be charged to the ruins of the arena and the theatre  beyond this i remember with affection the illproportioned little place des hommes not at all monumental and given over to puddles and to shabby cafes  i recall with tenderness the tortuous and featureless streets which looked like the streets of a village and were paved with villanous little sharp stones making all exercise penitential  consecrated by association is even a tiresome walk that i took the evening i arrived with the purpose of obtaining a view of the rhone  i had been to arles before years ago and it seemed to me that i remembered finding on the banks of the stream some sort of picture  i think that on the evening of which i speak there was a watery moon which it seemed to me would light up the past as well as the present  but i found no pic ture and i scarcely found the rhone at all  i lost my way and there was not a creature in the streets to whom i could appeal  nothing could be more pro vincial than the situation of arles at ten oclock at night  at last i arrived at a kind of embankment where i could see the great mudcolored stream slip ping along in the soundless darkness  it had come on to rain i know not what had happened to the moon and the whole place was anything but gay  it was not what i had looked for what i had looked for was in the irrecoverable past  i groped my way back to the inn over the infernal cailloux feeling like a dis comfited dogberry  i remember now that this hotel was the one whichever that may be which has the fragment of a galloroman portico inserted into one of its angles  i had chosen it for the sake of this ex ceptional ornament  it was damp and dark and the floors felt gritty to the feet it was an establishment at which the dreadful grasdouble might have appeared at the table dhote as it had done at narbonne  never theless i was glad to get back to it and nevertheless too  and this is the moral of my simple anecdote  my pointless little walk i dont speak of the pave ment suffuses itself as i look back upon it with a romantic tone  and in relation to the inn i suppose i had better mention that i am well aware of the in consistency of a person who dislikes the modern cara vansary and yet grumbles when he finds a hotel of the superannuated sort  one ought to choose it would seem and make the best of either alternative  the two old taverns at arles are quite unimproved such as they must have been in the infancy of the modern world when stendhal passed that way and the lum bering diligence deposited him in the place des hommes such in every detail they are today  vieilles auberges de france one ought to enjoy their gritty floors and greasy windowpanes  let it be put on re cord therefore that i have been i wont say less com fortable but at least less happy at better inns  to be really historic i should have mentioned that before going to look for the rhone i had spent part of the evening on the opposite side of the little place and that i indulged in this recreation for two definite reasons  one of these was that i had an opportunity of conversing at a cafe with an attractive young eng lishman whom i had met in the afternoon at tarascon and more remotely in other years in london the other was that there sat enthroned behind the counter a splendid mature arlesienne whom my companion and i agreed that it was a rare privilege to contem plate  there is no rule of good manners or morals which makes it improper at a cafe to fix ones eyes upon the dame de comptoir the lady is in the nature of things a part of your consommation  we were there fore feee to admire without restriction the handsomest person i had ever seen give change for a fivefranc piece  she was a large quiet woman who would never see forty again of an intensely feminine type yet wonderfully rich and robust and full of a certain phy sical nobleness  though she was not really old she was antique and she was very grave even a little sad she had the dignity of a roman empress and she handled coppers as if they had been stamped with the head of caesar  i have seen washerwomen in the trastevere who were perhaps as handsome as she but even the headdress of the roman contadina con tributes less to the dignity of the person born to wear it than the sweet and stately arlesian cap which sits at once aloft and on the back of the head which is accompanied with a wide black bow covering a con siderable part of the crown and which finally accom modates itself indescribably well to the manner in which the tresses of the front are pushed behind the cars  this admirable dispenser of lumps of sugar has distracted me a little for i am still not sufficiently historical  before going to the cafe i had dined and before dining i had found time to go and look at the arena  then it was that i discovered that arles has no general physiognomy and except the delightful little church of saint trophimus no architecture and that the rugosities of its dirty lanes affect the feet like knifeblades  it was not then on the other hand that i saw the arena best  the second day of my stay at arles i devoted to a pilgrimage to the strange old hill town of les baux the mediaeval pompeii of which i shall give myself the pleasure of speaking  the even ing of that day however my friend and i returned in time for a late dinner i wandered among the roman remains of the place by the light of a magnificent moon and gathered an impression which has lost little of its silvery glow  the moon of the evening before had been aqueous and erratic but if on the present occasion it was guilty of any irregularity the worst it did was only to linger beyond its time in the heavens in order to let us look at things comfortably  the effect was admirable it brought back the impression of the way in rome itself on evenings like that the moonshine rests upon broken shafts and slabs of an tique pavement  as we sat in the theatre looking at the two lone columns that survive  part of the decora tion of the back of the stage  and at the fragments of ruin around them we might have been in the roman forum  the arena at arles with its great magnitude is less complete than that of nimes it has suffered even more the assaults of time and of the children of time and it has been less repaired  the seats are almost wholly wanting but the external walls minus the topmost tier of arches are massively rug gedly complete and the vaulted corridors seem as solid as the day they were built  the whole thing is superbly vast and as monumental for place of light amusement  what is called in america a variety show  as it entered only into the roman mind to make such establishments  the podium is much higher than at nimes and many of the great white slabs that faced it have been recovered and put into their places the proconsular box has been more or less recon structed and the great converging passages of approach to it are still majestically distinct so that as i sat there in the mooncharmed stillness leaning my elbows on the battered parapet of the ring it was not im possible  to listen to the murmurs and shudders the thick voice of the circus that died away fifteen hun dred years ago  the theatre has a voice as well but it lingers on the ear of time with a different music  the roman theatre at arles seemed to me one of the most charm ing and touching ruins i had ever beheld i took a particular fancy to it  it is less than a skeleton  the arena may be called a skeleton for it consists only of half a dozen bones  the traces of the row of columns which formed the scene  the permanent backscene  remain two marble pillars  i just mentioned them  are upright with a fragment of their entablature  be fore them is the vacant space which was filled by the stage with the line of the prosoenium distinct marked by a deep groove impressed upon slabs of stone which looks as if the bottom of a high screen had been in tended to fit into it  the semicircle formed by the seats  half a cup  rises opposite some of the rows are distinctly marked  the floor from the bottom of the stage in the shape of an arc of which the chord is formed by the line of the orchestra is covered by slabs of colored marble  red yellow and green  which though terribly battered and cracked today give one an idea of the elegance of the interior  every thing shows that it was on a great scale the large sweep of its enclosing walls the massive corridors that passed behind the auditorium and of which we can still perfectly take the measure  the way in which every seat commanded the stage is a lesson to the architects of our epoch as also the immense size of the place is a proof of extraordinary power of voice on the part of the roman actors  it was after we had spent half an hour in the moonshine at the arena that we came on to this more ghostly and more exquisite ruin  the principal entrance was locked but we effected an easy escalade scaled a low parapet and descended into the place behind file scenes  it was as light as day and the solitude was complete  the two slim columns as we sat on the broken benches stood there like a pair of silent actors  what i called touching just now was the thought that here the human voice the utterance of a great language had been supreme  the air was full of intonations and cadences not of the echo of smashing blows of riven armor of howling victims and roaring beasts  the spot is in short one of the sweetest legacies of the ancient world and there seems no profanation in the fact that by day it is open to the good people of arles who use it to pass by no means in great num bers from one part of the town to the other treading the old marble floor and brushing if need be the empty benches  this familiarity does not kill the place again it makes it on the contrary live a little  makes the present and the past touch each other    xxxi  the third lion of arles has nothing to do with the ancient world but only with the old one  the church of saint trophimus whose wonderful romanesque porch is the principal ornament of the principal place  a place otherwise distinguished by the presence of a slim and tapering obelisk in the middle as well as by that of the hotel de ville and the museum  the interesting church of saint trophimus swears a little as the french say with the peculiar character of arles  it is very remarkable but i would rather it were in another place  arles is delightfully pagan and saint trophimus with its apostolic sculptures is rather a false note  these sculptures are equally re markable for their primitive vigor and for the perfect preservation in which they have come down to us the deep recess of a roundarched porch of the twelfth century is covered with quaint figures which have not lost a nose or a finger  an angular byzan tinelooking christ sits in a diamondshaped frame at the summit of the arch surrounded by little angels by great apostles by winged beasts by a hundred sacred symbols and grotesque ornaments  it is a dense embroidery of sculpture black with time but as uninjured as if it had been kept under glass  one good mark for the french revolution  of the in terior of the church which has a nave of the twelfth century and a choir three hundred years more recent i chiefly remember the odd feature that the romanesque aisles are so narrow that you literally  or almost  squeeze through them  you do so with some eager ness for your natural purpose is to pass out to the cloister  this cloister as distinguished and as per fect as the porch has a great deal of charm  its four sides which are not of the same period the earliest and best are of the twelfth century have an elaborate arcade supported on delicate pairs of columns the capitals of which show an extraordinary variety of device and ornament  at the corners of the quadrangle these columns take the form of curious human figures the whole thing is a gem of lightness and preserva tion and is often cited for its beauty but  if it doesnt sound too profane  i prefer especially at arles the ruins of the roman theatre  the antique element is too precious to be mingled with anything less rare  this truth was very present to my mind during a ramble of a couple of hours that i took just before leaving the place and the glowing beauty of the morning gave the last touch of the impression  i spent half an hour at the museum then i took an other look at the roman theatre after which i walked a little out of the town to the aliscamps the old elysian fields the meagre remnant of the old pagan place of sepulture which was afterwards used by the christians but has been for ages deserted and now consists only of a melancholy avenue of cypresses lined with a succession of ancient sarcophagi empty mossy and mutilated  an ironfoundry or some hor rible establishment which is conditioned upon tall chimneys and a noise of hammering and banging has been established near at hand but the cypresses shut it out well enough and this small patch of elysium is a very romantic corner  the door of the museum stands ajar and a vigilant custodian with the usual batch of photographs on his mind peeps out at you disapprovingly while you linger opposite before the charming portal of saint trophimus which you may look at for nothing when you succumb to the silent influence of his eye and go over to visit his collection you find yourself in a desecrated church in which a variety of ancient objects disinterred in arlesian soil have been ar ranged without any pomp  the best of these i be lieve were found in the ruins of the theatre  some of the most curious of them are early christian sar cophagi exactly on the pagan model but covered with rude yet vigorously wrought images of the apostles and with illustrations of scriptural history  beauty of the highest kind either of conception or of execu tion is absent from most of the roman fragments which belong to the taste of a late period and a provincial civilization  but a gulf divides them from the bristling little imagery of the christian sarcophagi in which at the same time one detects a vague emulation of the rich examples by which their authors were surrounded  there is a certain element of style in all the pagan things there is not a hint of it in the early christian relics among which according to m joanne of the guide are to be found more fine sarcophagi than in any collection but that of st john lateran  in two or three of the roman fragments there is a noticeable distinction principally in a charming bust of a boy quite perfect with those salient eyes that one sees in certain antique busts and to which the absence of vision in the marble mask gives a look often very touching as of a baffled effort to see also in the head of a woman found in the ruins of the theatre who alas has lost her nose and whose noble simple contour barring this deficiency recalls the great manner of the venus of milo  there are various rich architectural fragments which in dicate that that edifice was a very splendid affair this little museum at arles in short is the most ro man thing i know of out of rome    xxxii  i find that i declared one evening in a little journal i was keeping at that time that i was weary of writing i was probably very sleepy but that it was essential i should make some note of my visit to les baux  i must have gone to sleep as soon as i had recorded this necessity for i search my small diary in vain for any account of that enchanting spot  i have nothing but my memory to consult  a memory which is fairly good in regard to a general impression but is terribly infirm in the matter of details and items  we knew in advance my companion and  i that les baus was a pearl of picturesqueness for had we not read as much in the handbook of murray who has the testimony of an english nobleman as to its attractions  we also knew that it lay some miles from aries on the crest of the alpilles the craggy little mountains which as i stood on the breezy plat form of beaucaire formed to my eye a charming if somewhat remote background to tarascon this as surance having been given us by the landlady of the inn at arles of whom we hired a rather lumbering conveyance  the weather was not promising but it proved a good day for the mediaeval pompeii a gray melancholy moist but rainless or almost rainless day with nothing in the sky to flout as the poet says the dejected and pulverized past  the drive itself was charming for there is an inexhaustible sweetness in the graygreen landscape of provence it is never absolutely flat and yet is never really ambitious and is full both of entertainment and re pose  it is in constant undulation and the bareness of the soil lends itself easily to outline and profile when i say the bareness i mean the absence of woods and hedges  it blooms with heath and scented shrubs and stunted olive and the white rock shining through the scattered herbage has a brightness which answers to the brightness of the sky  of course it needs the sunshine for all southern countries look a little false under the ground glass of incipient bad weather  this was the case on the day of my pil grimage to les baux  nevertheless i was as glad to keep going as i was to arrive and as i went it seemed to me that true happiness would consist in wandering through such a land on foot on september afternoons when one might stretch ones self on the warm ground in some shady hollow and listen to the hum of bees and the whistle of melancholy shepherds for in provence the shepherds whistle to their flocks i saw two or three of them in the course of this drive to les baux meandering about looking behind and calling upon the sheep in this way to follow which the sheep always did very promptly with ovine unanimity  nothing is more picturesque than to see a slow shepherd threading his way down one of the winding paths on a hillside with his flock close be hind him necessarily expanded yet keeping just at his heels bending and twisting as it goes and looking rather like the tail of a dingy comet  about four miles from arles as you drive north ward toward the alpilles of which alphonse daudet has spoken so often and as he might say so in timately stand on a hill that overlooks the road the very considerable ruins of the abbey of mont majour one of the innumerable remnants of a feudal and ecclesiastical as well as an architectural past that one encounters in the south of france remnants which it must be confessed tend to introduce a cer tain confusion and satiety into the passive mind of the tourist  montmajour however is very impressive and interesting the only trouble with it is that unless you have stopped and retumed to arles you see it in memory over the head of les baux which is a much more absorbing picture  a part of the mass of buildings the monastery dates only from the last century and the stiff architecture of that period does not lend itself very gracefully to desolation it looks too much as if it had been burnt down the year before  the monastery was demolished during the revolution and it injures a little the effect of the very much more ancient fragments that are connected with it  the whole place is on a great scale it was a rich and splendid abbey  the church a vast basilica of the eleventh century and of the noblest proportions is virtually intact i mean as regards its essentials for the details have completely vanished the huge solid shell is full of expression it looks as if it had been hollowed out by the sincerity of early faith and it opens into a cloister as impressive as itself  wherever one goes in france one meets looking backward a little the spectre of the great revolution and one meets it always in the shape of the destruction of something beautiful and precious to make us forgive it at all how much it must also have destroyed that was more hateful than itself beneath the church of montmajour is a most extra ordinary crypt almost as big as the edifice above it and making a complete subterranean temple sur rounded with a circular gallery or deambulatory which expands it intervals into five square chapels there are other things of which i have but a con fused memory a great fortified keep a queer little primitive chapel hollowed out of the rock beneath these later structures and recommended to the visitors attention as the confessional of saint tro phimus who shares with so many worthies the glory of being the first apostle of the gauls  then there is a strange small church of the dimmest antiquity standing at a distance from the other buildings  i remember that after we had let ourselves down a good many steepish places to visit crypts and con fessionals we walked across a field to this archaic cruciform edifice and went thence to a point further down the road where our carriage was awaiting us  the chapel of the holy cross as it is called is classed among the historic monuments of france and i read in a queer rambling illwritten book which i picked up at avignon and in which the author m louis de lainbel has buried a great deal of curious information on the subject of provence under a style inspiring little confidence that the delicieuse chapelle de saintecroix is a veritable bijou artistique  he speaks of a piece of lace in stone which runs from one end of the building to the other but of which i am obliged to confess that i have no recollection  i retain however a suf ficiently clear impression of the little superannuated temple with its four apses and its perceptible odor of antiquity  the odor of the eleventh century  the ruins of les baux remain quite indistinguish able even when you are directly beneath them at the foot of the charming little alpilles which mass themselves with a kind of delicate ruggedness  rock and ruin have been so welded together by the con fusions of time that as you approach it from behind  that is from the direction of arles  the place presents simply a general air of cragginess  nothing can be prettier than the crags of provence they are beautifully modelled as painters say and they have a delightful silvery color  the road winds round the foot of the hills on the top of which lea baux is planted and passes into another valley from which the approach to the town is many degrees less pre cipitous and may be comfortably made in a carriage of course the deeply inquiring traveller will alight as promptly as possible for the pleasure of climbing into this queerest of cities on foot is not the least part of the entertainment of going there  then you appreciate its extraordinary position its picturesque ness its steepness its desolation and decay  it hangs  that is what remains of it  to the slanting summit of the mountain  nothing would be more natural than for the whole place to roll down into the valley  a part of it has done so  for it is not unjust to suppose that in the process of decay the crumbled particles have sought the lower level while the remainder still clings to its magnificent perch  if i called les baux a city just above it was not that i was stretching a point in favor of the small spot which today contains but a few dozen inhabi tants  the history of the plate is as extraordinary as its situation  it was not only a city but a state not only a state but an empire and on the crest of its little mountain called itself sovereign of a territory or at least of scattered towns and counties with which its present aspect is grotesquely out of relation  the lords of les baux in a word were great feudal pro prietors and therewas a time during which the island of sardinia to say nothing of places nearer home such as arles and marseilles paid them homage  the chronicle of this old provencal house has been written in a style somewhat unctuous and flowery by m jules canonge  i purchased the little book  a modest pamphlet  at the establishment of the good sisters just beside the church in one of the highest parts of les baux  the sisters have a school for the hardy little baussenques whom i heard piping their lessons while i waited in the cold parloir for one of the ladies to come and speak to me  nothing could have been more perfect than the manner of this excellent woman when she arrived yet her small religious house seemed a very outoftheway corner of the world  it was spotlessly neat and the rooms looked as if they had lately been papered and painted in this respect at the mediaeval pompeii they were rather a discord they were at any rate the newest freshest thing at les baux  i remember going round to the church after i had left the good sisters and to a little quiet terrace which stands in front of it ornamented with a few small trees and bordered with a wall breast high over which you look down steep hillsides off into the air and all about the neighbouring country i remember saying to myself that this little terrace was one of those felicitous nooks which the tourist of taste keeps in his mind as a picture  the church was small and brown and dark with a certain rustic richness  all this however is no general description of les baux  i am unable to give any coherent account of the place for the simple reason that it is a mere con fusion of ruin  it has not been preserved in lava like pompeii and its streets and houses its ramparts and castle have become fragmentary not through the sudden destruction but through the gradual with drawal of a population  it is not an extinguished but a deserted city more deserted far than even carcassonne and aiguesmortes where i found so much entertainment in the grassgrown element  it is of very small extent and even in the days of its greatness when its lords entitled themselves counts of cephalonia and neophantis kings of arles and vienne princes of achaia and emperors of constan tinople  even at this flourishing period when as m jules canonge remarks they were able to depress the balance in which the fate of peoples and kings is weighed the plucky little city contained at the most no more than thirtysix hundred souls  yet its lords who however as i have said were able to present a long list of subject towns most of them though a few are renowned unknown to fame were seneschals and captainsgeneral of piedmont and lombardy grand admirals of the kingdom of naples and its ladies were sought in marriage by half the first princes in europe  a considerable part of the little narrative of m canonge is taken up with the great alliances of the house of baux whose fortunes ma trimonial and other he traces from the eleventh cen tury down to the sixteenth  the empty shells of a considerable number of old houses many of which must have been superb the lines of certain steep little streets the foundations of a castle and ever so many splendid views are all that remains today of these great titles  to such a list i may add a dozen very polite and sympathetic people who emerged from the interstices of the desultory little town to gaze at the two foreigners who had driven over from arles and whose horses were being baited at the modest inn  the resources of this establishment we did not venture otherwise to test in spite of the seductive fact that the sign over the door was in the provencal tongue  this little group included the baker a rather melancholy young man in high boots and a cloak with whom and his companions we had a good deal of conversation  the baussenques of today struck me as a very mild and agreeable race with a good deal of the natural amenity which on occasions like this one the traveller who is waiting for his horses to be put in or his dinner to be prepared observes in the charming people who lend themselves to con versation in the hilltowns of tuscany  the spot where our entertainers at les baux congregated was naturally the most inhabited portion of the town as i say there were at least a dozen human figures within sight  presently we wandered away from them scaled the higher places seated ourselves among the ruins of the castle and looked down from the cliff overhanging that portion of the road which i have mentioned as approaching les baux from behind  i was unable to trace the configuration of the castle as plainly as the writers who have described it in the guidebooks and i am ashamed to say that i did not even perceive the three great figures of stone the three marys as they are called the two marys of scripture with martha which constitute one of the curiosities of the place and of which m jules canonge speaks with almost hyperbolical admiration  a brisk shower lasting some ten minutes led us to take refuge in a cavity of mysterious origin where the melancholy baker presently discovered us having had the bonne pensee of coming up for us with an umbrella which certainly belonged in former ages to one of the ste phanettes or berangeres commemorated by m canonge his oven i am afraid was cold so long as our visit lasted  when the rain was over we wandered down to the little disencumbered space before the inn through a small labyrinth of obliterated things  they took the form of narrow precipitous streets bordered by empty houses with gaping windows and absent doors through which we had glimpses of sculptured chimneypieces and fragments of stately arch and vault some of the houses are still inhabited but most of them are open to the air and weather  some of them have completely collapsed others present to the street a front which enables one to judge of the physiognomy of les baux in the days of its importance  this im portance had pretty well passed away in the early part of the sixteenth century when the place ceased to be an independent principality  it became  by bequest of one of its lords bernardin des baux a great cap tain of his time  part of the appanage of the kings of france by whom it was placed under the protection of arles which had formerly occupied with regard to it a different position  i know not whether the arle sians neglected their trust but the extinction of the sturdy little stronghold is too complete not to have begun long ago  its memories are buried under its ponderous stones  as we drove away from it in the gloaming my friend and i agreed that the two or three hours we had spent there were among the happiest impressions of a pair of tourists very curious in the picturesque  we almost forgot that we were bound to regret that the shortened day left us no time to drive five miles further above a pass in the little mountains  it had beckoned to us in the morning when we came in sight of it almost irresistibly  to see the ro man arch and mausoleum of saint remy  to compass this larger excursion including the visit to les baux you must start from arles very early in the morning but i can imagine no more delightful day    xxxiii  i had been twice at avignon before and yet i was not satisfied  i probably am satisfied now neverthe less i enjoyed my third visit  i shall not soon forget the first on which a particular emotion set indelible stamp  i was travelling northward in 1870 after four months spent for the first time in italy  it was the middle of january and i had found myself unexpected ly forced to return to england for the rest of the winter  it was an insufferable disappointment i was wretched and brokenhearted  italy appeared to me at that time so much better than anything else in the world that to rise from table in the middle of the feast was a prospect of being hungry for the rest of my days  i had heard a great deal of praise of the south of france but the south of france was a poor consolation  in this state of mind i arrived at avignon which under a bright hard winter sun was tingling  fairly spinning  with the mistral  i find in my journal of the other day a reference to the acuteness of my reluctance in january 1870  france after italy ap peared in the language of the latter country poco sim patica and i thought it necessary for reasons now in conceivable to read the figaro which was filled with descriptions of the horrible troppmann the mur derer of the famille kink  troppmann kink le crime do pantin very names that figured in this episode seemed to wave me back  had i abandoned the so norous south to associate with vocables so base  it was very cold the other day at avignon for though there was no mistral it was raining as it rains in provence and the dampness had a terrible chill in it  as i sat by my fire late at night  for in genial avignon in october i had to have a fire  it came back to me that eleven years before i had at that same hour sat by a fire in that same room and writ ing to a friend to whom i was not afraid to appear extravagant had made a vow that at some happier period of the future i would avenge myself on the ci devant city of the popes by taking it in a contrary sense  i suppose that i redeemed my vow on the oc casion of my second visit better than on my third for then i was on my way to italy and that vengeance of course was complete  the only drawback was that i was in such a hurry to get to ventimiglia where the italian customhouse was to be the sign of my triumph that i scarcely took time to make it clear to myself at avignon that this was better than reading the figaro i hurried on almost too fast to enjoy the consciousness of moving southward  on this last occasion i was un fortunately destitute of that happy faith  avignon was my southernmost limit after which i was to turn round and proceed back to england  but in the interval i had been a great deal in italy and that made all the difference  i had plenty of time to think of this for the rain kept me practically housed for the first twentyfour hours  it had been raining in these regions for a month and people had begun to look askance at the rhone though as yet the volume of the river was not exorbitant  the only excursion possible while the torrent descended was a kind of horizontal dive ac companied with infinite splashing to the little musee of the town which is within a moderate walk of the hotel  i had a memory of it from my first visit it had appeared to me more pictorial than its pictures i found that recollection had flattered it a little and that it is neither better nor worse than most provincial museums  it has the usual musty chill in the air the usual grassgrown forecourt in which a few lumpish roman fragments are disposed the usual red tiles on the floor and the usual specimens of the more livid schools on the walls  i rang up the gardien who ar rived with a bunch of keys wiping his mouth he un locked doors for me opened shutters and while to my distress as if the things had been worth lingering over he shuffled about after me he announced the names of the pictures before which i stopped in a voice that reverberated through the melancholy halls and seemed to make the authorship shameful when it was obscure and grotesque when it pretended to be great  then there were intervals of silence while i stared absentmindedly at haphazard at some indis tinguishable canvas and the only sound was the down pour of the rain on the skylights  the museum of avignon derives a certain dignity from its roman frag ments  the town has no roman monuments to show in this respect beside its brilliant neighbors arles and nimes it is a blank  but a great many small objects have been found in its soil  pottery glass bronzes lamps vessels and ornaments of gold and silver  the glass is especially chaming  small vessels of the most delicate shape and substance many of them perfectly preserved  these diminutive intimate things bring one near to the old roman life they seem like pearls strung upon the slender thread that swings across the gulf of time  a little glass cup that roman lips have touched says more to us than the great vessel of an arena  there are two small silver casseroles with chi selled handles in the museum of avignon that struck me as among the most charming survivals of anti quity  i did wrong just above to speak of my attack on this establishment as the only recreation i took that first wet day for i remember a terribly moist visit to the former palace of the popes which could have taken place only in the same tempestuous hours  it is true that i scarcely know why i should have gone out to see the papal palace in the rain for i had been over it twice before and even then had not found the interest of the place so complete as it ought to be the fact nevertheless remains that this last occasion is much associated with an umbrella which was not superfluous even in some of the chambers and cor ridors of the gigantic pile  it had already seemed to me the dreariest of all historical buildings and my final visit confirmed the impression  the place is as intricate as it is vast and as desolate as it is dirty the imagination has for some reason or other to make more than the effort usual in such cases to re store and repeople it  the fact indeed is simply that the palace has been so incalculably abused and altered the alterations have been so numerous that though i have duly conned the enumerations supplied in guide books of the principal perversions i do not pretend to carry any of them in my head  the huge bare mass without ornament without grace despoiled of its battlements and defaced with sordid modern windows covering the rocher des doms and looking down over the rhone and the broken bridge of saintbenazet which stops in such a sketchable manner in mid stream and across at the lonely tower of philippe le bel and the ruined wall of villeneuve makes at a dis tance in spite of its poverty a great figure the effect of which is carried out by the tower of the church be side it crowned though the latter be in a topheavy fashion with an immense modern image of the virgin and by the thick dark foliage of the garden laid out on a still higher portion of the eminence  this garden recalls faintly and a trifle perversely the grounds of the pincian at rome  i know not whether it is the shadow of the papal name present in both places combined with a vague analogy between the churches  which approached in each case by a flight of steps seemed to defend the precinct  but each time i have seen the promenade des doms it has carried my thoughts to the wider and loftier terrace from which you look away at the tiber and saint peters  as you stand before the papal palace and espe cially as you enter it you are struck with its being a very dull monument  history enough was enacted here the great schism lasted from 1305 to 1370 dur ing which seven popes all frenchmen carried on the court of avignon on principles that have not com mended themselves to the esteem of posterity  but history has been whitewashed away and the scandals of that period have mingled with the dust of dilapi dations and repairs  the building has for many years been occupied as a barrack for regiments of the line and the main characteristics of a barrack  an extreme nudity and a very queer smell  prevail throughout its endless compartments  nothing could have been more cruelly dismal than the appearance it presented at the time of this third visit of mine  a regiment changing quarters had departed the day before and another was expected to arrive from algeria on the morrow the place had been left in the befouled and belittered condition which marks the passage of the military after they have broken carnp and it would offer but a me lancholy welcome to the regiment that was about to take possession  enormous windows had been left carelessly open all over the building and the rain and wind were beating into empty rooms and passages making draughts which purified perhaps but which scarcely cheered  for an arrival it was horrible  a handful of soldiers had remained behind  in one of the big vaulted rooms several of them were lying on their wretched beds in the dim light in the cold in the damp with the bleak bare walls before them and their overcoats spread over them pulled up to their noses  i pitied them immensely though they may have felt less wretched than they looked  i thought not of the old profligacies and crimes not of the funnelshaped torturechamber which after exciting the shudder of generations has been ascertained now i believe to have been a mediaeval bakehouse not of the tower of the glaciere and the horrors perpetrated here in the revolution but of the military burden of young france  one wonders how young france en dures it and one is forced to believe that the french conscript has in addition to his notorious goodhumor greater toughness than is commonly supposed by those who consider only the more relaxing influences of french civilization  i hope he finds occasional com pensation for such moments as i saw those damp young peasants passing on the mattresses of their hideous barrack without anything around to remind them that they were in the most civilized of countries the only traces of former splendor now visible in the papal pile are the walls and vaults of two small chapels painted in fresco so battered and effaced as to be scarcely distinguishable by simone memmi  it offers of course a peculiarly good field for restoration and i believe the government intend to take it in hand  i mention this fact without a sigh for they cannot well make it less interesting than it is at present    xxxiv  fortunately it did not rain every day though i believe it was raining everywhere else in the depart ment otherwise i should not have been able to go to villeneuve and to vaucluse  the afternoon indeed was lovely when i walked over the interminable bridge that spans the two arms of the rhone divided here by a considerable island and directed my course like a solitary horseman  on foot to the lonely tower which forms one of the outworks of villeneuveles avignon  the picturesque halfdeserted little town lies a couple of miles further up the river  the im mense round towers of its old citadel and the long stretches of ruined wall covering the slope on which it lies are the most striking features of the nearer view as you look from avignon across the rhone  i spent a couple of hours in visiting these objects and there was a kind of pictorial sweetness in the episode but i have not many details to relate  the isolated tower i just mentioned has much in common with the detached donjon of montmajour which i had looked at in going to les baux and to which i paid my respects in speaking of that excursion  also the work of philippe le bel built in 1307 it is amazingly big and stubborn and formed the opposite limit of the broken bridge whose first arches on the side of avignon alone remain to give a measure of the oc casional volume of the rhone  half an hours walk brought me to villeneuve which lies away from the river looking like a big village half depopulated and occupied for the most part by dogs and cats old women and small children these last in general re markably pretty in the manner of the children of provence  you pass through the place which seems in a singular degree vague and unconscious and come to the rounded hill on which the ruined abbey lifts its yellow walls  the benedictine abbey of saint andre at once a church a monastery and a fortress a large part of the crumbling enceinte disposes itself over the hill but for the rest all that has preserved any traceable cohesion is a considerable portion of the citadel  the defence of the place appears to have been intrusted largely to the huge round towers that flank the old gate one of which the more complete the ancient warden having first inducted me into his own dusky little apartment and presented me with a great bunch of lavender enabled me to examine in detail  i would almost have dispensed with the privi lege for i think i have already mentioned that an ac quaintance with many feudal interiors has wrought a sad confusion in my mind  the image of the outside always remains distinct i keep it apart from other images of the same sort it makes a picture sufficiently ineffaceable  but the guardrooms winding staircases loopholes prisons repeat themselves and intermingle they have a wearisome family likeness  there are always black passages and corners and walls twenty feet thick and there is always some high place to climb up to for the sake of a magnificent view the views too are apt to get muddled  these dense gatetowers of philippe le bel struck me however as peculiarly wicked and grim  their capacity is of the largest and they contain over so many devilish little dungeons lighted by the narrowest slit in the pro digious wall where it comes over one with a good deal of vividness and still more horror that wretched human beings ever lay there rotting in the dark  the dungeons of villeneuve made a particular impression on me  greater than any except those of loches which must surely be the most grewsome in europe i hasten to add that every dark hole at villeneuve is called a dungeon and i believe it is well established that in this manner in almost all old castles and towers the sensibilities of the modern tourist are un scrupulously played upon  there were plenty of black holes in the middle ages that were not dungeons but household receptacles of various kinds and many a tear dropped in pity for the groaning captive has really been addressed to the spirits of the larder and the faggotnook  for all this there are some very bad corners in the towers of villeneuve so that i was not wide of the mark when i began to think again as i had often thought before of the stoutness of the human composition in the middle ages and the tranquillity of nerve of people to whom the groaning captive and the blackness of a living tomb were familiar ideas which did not at all interfere with their happiness or their sanity  our modern nerves our irritable sym pathies our easy discomforts and fears make one think in some relations less respectfully of human nature unless indeed it be true as i have heard it main tained that in the middle ages every one did go mad  every one was mad  the theory that this was a period of general insanity is not altogether indefensible  within the old walls of its immense abbey the town of villeneuve has built itself a rough faubourg the fragments with which the soil was covered having been i suppose a quarry of material  there are no streets the small shabby houses almost hovels straggle at random over the uneven ground  the only im portant feature is a convent of cloistered nuns who have a large garden always within the walls behind their house and whose doleful establishment you look down into or down at simply from the battlements of the citadel  one or two of the nuns were passing in and out of the house they wore gray robes with a bright red cape  i thought their situation most pro vincial  i came away and wandered a little over the base of the hill outside the walls  small white stones cropped through the grass over which low olivetrees were scattered  the afternoon had a yellow bright ness  i sat down under one of the little trees on the grass  the delicate gray branches were not much above my head  and rested and looked at avignon across the rhone  it was very soft very still and pleasant though i am not sure it was all i once should have expected of that combination of elements an old city wall for a background a canopy of olives and for a couch the soil of provence  when i came back to avignon the twilight was already thick but i walked up to the rocher des doms  here i again had the benefit of that amiable moon which had already lighted up for me so many romantic scenes  she was full and she rose over the rhone and made it look in the distance like a silver serpent  i remember saying to myself at this mo ment that it would be a beautiful evening to walk round the walls of avignon  the remarkable walls which challenge comparison with those of carcassonne and aiguesmortes and which it was my duty as an observer of the picturesque to examine with some at tention  presenting themselves to that silver sheen they could not fail to be impressive  so at least i said to myself but unfortunately i did not believe what i said  it is a melancholy fact that the walls of avignon had never impressed me at all and i had never taken the trouble to make the circuit  they are continuous and complete but for some mysterious reason they fail of their effect  this is partly because they are very low in some places almost absurdly so being buried in new accumulations of soil and by the filling in of the moat up to their middle  then they have been too well tended they not only look at present very new but look as if they had never been old  the fact that their extent is very much greater makes them more of a curiosity than those of carcas sonne but this is exactly as the same time what is fatal to their pictorial unity  with their thirtyseven towers and seven gates they lose themselves too much to make a picture that will compare with the ad mirable little vignette of carcassonne  i may mention now that i am speaking of the general mass of avignon that nothing is more curious than the way in which viewed from a distance it is all reduced to nought by the vast bulk of the palace of the popes  from across the rhone or from the train as you leave the place this great gray block is all avignon it seems to occupy the whole city extensive with its shrunken population as the city is    xxxv  it was the morning after this i think a certain saturday that when i came out of the hotel de leurope which lies in a shallow concavity just within the city gate that opens on the rhone  came out to look at the sky from the little place before the inn and see how the weather promised for the obligatory excursion to vaucluse  i found the whole town in a terrible taking  i say the whole town advisedly for every inhabitant appeared to have taken up a position on the bank of the river or on the uppermost parts of the promenade of the doms where a view of its course was to be obtained  it had risen surprisingly in the night and the good people of avignon had reason to know what a rise of the rhone might signify the town in its lower portions is quite at the mercy of the swollen waters and it was mentioned to me that in 1856 the hotel de leurope in its convenient hollow was flooded up to within a few feet of the ceiling of the diningroom where the long board which had served for so many a table dhote floated dis reputably with its legs in the air  on the present occasion the mountains of the ardeche where it had been raining for a month had sent down torrents which all that fine friday night by the light of the innocentlooking moon poured themselves into the rhone and its tributary the durance  the river was enormous and continued to rise and the sight was beautiful and horrible  the water in many places was already at the base of the city walls the quay with its parapet just emerging being already covered the country seen from the plateau des doms re sembled a vast lake with protrusions of trees houses bridges gates  the people looked at it in silence as i had seen people before  on the occasion of a rise of the arno at pisa  appear to consider the prospects of an inundation  il monte il monte toujours  there was not much said but that  it was a general holiday and there was an air of wishing to profit for sociabilitys sake by any interruption of the common place the popular mind likes a change and the element of change mitigates the sense of disaster but the affair was not otherwise a holiday  suspense and anxiety were in the air and it never is pleasant to be reminded of the helplessness of man  in the presence of a loosened river with its ravaging unconquerable volume this impression is as strong as possible and as i looked at the deluge which threatened to make an island of the papal palace i perceived that the scourge of water is greater than the scourge of fire a blaze may be quenched but where could the flame be kindled that would arrest the quadrupled rhone for the population of avignon a good deal was at stake and i am almost ashamed to confess that in the midst of the public alarm i considered the situation from the point of view of the little projects of a senti mental tourist  would the prospective inundation inter fere with my visit to vaucluse or make it imprudent to linger twentyfour hours longer at avignon  i must add that the tourist was not perhaps after all so sentimental  i have spoken of the pilgrimage to the shrine of petrarch as obligatory and that was in fact the light in which it presented itself to me all the more that i had been twice at avignon without under taking it  this why i was vexed at the rhone  if vexed i was  for representing as impracticable an ex cursion which i cared nothing about  how little i cared was manifest from my inaction on former oc casions  i had a prejudice against vancluse against petrarch even against the incomparable laura  i was sure that the place was cockneyfied and threadbare and i had never been able to take an interest in the poet and the lady  i was sure that i had known many women as charming and as handsome as she about whom much less noise had been made and i was convinced that her singer was factitious and literary and that there are half a dozen stanzas in wordsworth that speak more to the soul than the whole collection of his fioriture  this was the crude state of mind in which i determined to go at any risk to vaucluse now that i think it over i seem to remember that i had hoped after all that the submersion of the roads would forbid it  since morning the clouds had gathered again and by noon they were so heavy that there was every prospect of a torrent  it appeared absurd to choose such a time as this to visit a fountain  a fountain which would be indistinguishable in the general cataract  nevertheless i took a vow that if at noon the rain should not have begun to descend upon avignon i would repair to the headspring of the sorgues  when the critical moment arrived the clouds were hanging over avignon like distended waterbags which only needed a prick to empty themselves  the prick was not given however all nature was too much occupied in following the aberration of the rhone to think of playing tricks elsewhere  accordingly i started for the station in a spirit which for a tourist who sometimes had prided himself on his unfailing supply of sentiment was shockingly perfunctory   for tasks in hours of insight willed  may be in hours of gloom fulfilled  i remembered these lines of matthew arnold written apparently in an hour of gloom and carried out the idea as i went by hoping that with the return of in sight i should be glad to have seen vaucluse  light has descended upon me since then and i declare that the excursion is in every way to be recommended the place makes a great impression quite apart from petrarch and laura  there was no rain there was only all the after noon a mild moist wind and a sky magnificently black which made a repoussoir for the paler cliffs of the fountain  the road by train crosses a flat ex pressionless country toward the range of arid hills which lie to the east of avignon and which spring says murray from the mass of the montventoux  at islesursorgues at the end of about an hour the fore ground becomes much more animated and the distance much more or perhaps i should say much less actual i descended from the train and ascended to the top of an omnibus which was to convey me into the re cesses of the hills  it had not been among my pre visions that i should be indebted to a vehicle of that kind for an opportunity to commune with the spirit of petrarch and i had to borrow what consolation i could from the fact that at least i had the omnibus to myself  i was the only passenger every one else was at avignon watching the rhone  i lost no time in perceiving that i could not have come to vaucluse at a better moment  the sorgues was almost as full as the rhone and of a color much more romantic  rush ing along its narrowed channel under an avenue of fine platanes it is confined between solid little embank ments of stone with the goodwives of the village on the brink washing their linen in its contemptuous flood it gave promise of high entertainment further on  the drive to vaucluse is of about three quarters of an hour and though the river as i say was promis ing the big pale hills as the road winds into them did not look as if their slopes of stone and shrub were a nestlingplace for superior scenery  it is a part of the merit of vaucluse indeed that it is as much as possible a surprise  the place has a right to its name for the valley appears impenetrable until you get fairly into it  one perverse twist follows another until the omnibus suddenly deposits you in front of the cabinet of petrarch  after that you have only to walk along the left bank of the river  the cabinet of petrarch is today a hideous little cafe bedizened like a sign board with extracts from the ingenious rime  the poet and his lady are of course the stock in trade of the little village which has had for several generations the privilege of attracting young couples engaged in their weddingtour and other votaries of the tender passion  the place has long been familiar on festal sundays to the swains of avignon and their attendant nymphs  the little fish of the sorgues are much esteemed and eaten on the spot they constitute for the children of the once papal city the classic sub urban dinner  vaucluse has been turned to account however not only by sentiment but by industry the banks of the stream being disfigured by a pair of hideous mills for the manufacture of paper and of wool  in an enterprising and economical age the waterpower of the sorgues was too obvious a motive and i must say that as the torrent rushed past them the wheels of the dirty little factories appeared to turn merrily enough  the footpath on the left bank of which i just spoke carries one fortunately quite out of sight of them and out of sound as well inasmuch as on the day of my visit the stream itself which was in tremendous force tended more and more as one approached the fountain to fill the valley with its own echoes  its color was magnificent and the whole spectacle more like a corner of switzerland than a nook in provence  the protrusions of the mountain shut it in and you penetrate to the bottom of the re cess which they form  the sorgues rushes and rushes it is almost like niagara after the jump of the cataract there are dreadful little booths beside the path for the sale of photographs and immortelles  i dont know what one is to do with the immortelles  where you are offered a brush dipped in tar to write your name withal on the rocks  thousands of vulgar persons of both sexes and exclusively it appeared of the french nationality had availed themselves of this implement for every square inch of accessible stone was scored over with some human appellation  it is not only we in america therefore who besmirch our scenery the practice exists in a more organized form like every thing else in france in the country of good taste you leave the little booths and stalls behind but the bescribbled crag bristling with human vanity keeps you company even when you stand face to face with the fountain  this happens when you find yourself at the foot of the enormous straight cliff out of which the river gushes  it rears itself to an extraordinary height  a huge forehead of bare stone  looking as if it were the half of a tremendous mound split open by volcanic action  the little valley seeing it there at a bend stops suddenly and receives in its arms the magical spring  i call it magical on account of the mysterious manner in which it comes into the world with the huge shoulder of the mountain rising over it as if to protect the secret  from under the mountain it silently rises without visible movement filling a small natural basin with the stillest blue water  the contrast between the stillness of this basin and the agitation of the water directly after it has overflowed constitutes half the charm of vaucluse the violence of the stream when once it has been set loose on the rocks is as fascinating and indescribable as that of other cataracts and the rocks in the bed of the sorgues have been arranged by a masterhand the setting of the phenomenon struck me as so simple and so fine  the vast sad cliff covered with the after noon light still and solid forever while the liquid ele ment rages and roars at its base  that i had no diffi culty in understanding the celebrity of vaucluse  i understood it but i will not say that i understood petrarch  he must have been very selfsupporting and madonna laura must indeed have been much to him  the aridity of the hills that shut in the valley is complete and the whole impression is best conveyed by that very expressive french epithet morne  there are the very fragmentary ruins of a castle of one of the bishops of cavaillon on a high spur of the moun tain above the river and there is another remnant of a feudal habitation on one of the more accessible ledges  having half an hour to spare before my omnibus was to leave i must beg the readers pardon for this atrociously false note call the vehicle a dili gence and for some undiscoverable reason the offence is minimized i clambered up to this latter spot and sat among the rocks in the company of a few stunted olives  the sorgues beneath me reaching the plain flung itself crookedly across the meadows like an un rolled blue ribbon  i tried to think of the amant de laure for literatures sake but i had no great success and the most i could do was to say to myself that i must try again  several months have elapsed since then and i am ashamed to confess that the trial has not yet come off  the only very definite conviction i arrived at was that vaucluse is indeed cockneyfied but that i should have been a fool all the same not to come    xxxvi  i mounted into my diligence at the door of the hotel de petrarque et de laure and we made our way back to islesursorgues in the fading light  this village where at six oclock every one appeared to have gone to bed was fairly darkened by its high dense planetrees under which the rushing river on a level with its parapets looked unnaturally almost wickedly blue  it was a glimpse which has left a picture in my mind the little closed houses the place empty and soundless in the autumn dusk but for the noise of waters and in the middle amid the blackness of the shade the gleam of the swift strange tide  at the station every one was talking of the inundation being in many places an accomplished fact and in particular of the condition of the durance at some point that i have forgotten  at avignon an hour later i found the water in some of the streets  the sky cleared in the evening the moon lighted up the submerged suburbs and the population again collected in the high places to enjoy the spectacle  it exhibited a certain sameness however and by nine oclock there was considerable animation in the place crillon where there is nothing to be seen but the front of the theatre and of several cafes  in addition indeed to a statue of this celebrated brave whose valor redeemed some of the numerous military disasters of the reign of louis xv  the next morning the lower quarters of the town were in a pitiful state the situation seemed to me odious  to express my disapproval of it i lost no time in taking the train for orange which with its other attractions had the merit of not being seated on the rhone  it was my destiny to move northward but even if i had been at liberty to follow a less un natural course i should not then have undertaken it inasmuch as the railway between avignon and mar seilles was credibly reported to be in places under water  this was the case with almost everything but the line itself on the way to orange  the day proved splendid and its brilliancy only lighted up the desola tion  farmhouses and cottages were up to their middle in the yellow liquidity haystacks looked like dull little islands windows and doors gaped open without faces and interruption and flight were represented in the scene  it was brought home to me that the popula tions rurales have many different ways of suffering and my heart glowed with a grateful sense of cockney ism  it was under the influence of this emotion that i alighted at orange to visit a collection of eminently civil monuments  the collection consists of but two objects but these objects are so fine that i will let the word pass  one of them is a triumphal arch supposedly of the period of marcus aurelius the other is a fragment magnifi cent in its ruin of a roman theatre  but for these fine roman remains and for its name orange is a perfectly featureless little town without the rhone  which as i have mentioned is several miles distant  to help it to a physiognomy  it seems one of the oddest things that this obscure french borough  obscure i mean in our modern era for the gallo roman arausio must have been judging it by its arches and theatre a place of some importance  should have given its name to the heirs apparent of the throne of hollandand been borne by a king of england who had sovereign rights over it  during the middle ages it formed part of an independent principality but in 1531 it fell by the marriage of one of its princesses who had inherited it into the family of nassau  i read in my indispensable mur ray that it was made over to france by the treaty of utrecht  the arch of triumph which stands a little way out of the town is rather a pretty than an im posing vestige of the romans  if it had greater purity of style one might say of it that it belonged to the same family of monuments as the maison carree at nimes  it has three passages  the middle much higher than the others  and a very elevated attic the vaults of the passages are richly sculptured and the whole monument is covered with friezes and military trophies  this sculpture is rather mixed much of it is broken and defaced and the rest seemed to me ugly though its workmanship is praised  the arch is at once well preserved and much injured  its general mass is there and as roman monuments go it is remarkably perfect but it has suffered in patches from the extremity of restoration  it is not on the whole of absorbing interest  it has a charm never theless which comes partly from its soft bright yellow color partly from a certain elegance of shape of ex pression and on that wellwashed sunday morning with its brilliant tone surrounded by its circle of thin poplars with the green country lying beyond it and a low blue horizon showing through its empty portals it made very sufficiently a picture that hangs itself to one of the lateral hooks of the memory  i can take down the modest composition and place it before me as i write  i see the shallow shining puddles in the hard fair french road the pale blue sky diluted by days of rain the disgarnished autumnal fields the mild sparkle of the low horizon the solitary figure in sabots with a bundle under its arm advancing along the chaussee and in the middle i see the little ochre colored monument which in spite of its antiquity looks bright and gay as everything must look in france of a fresh sunday morning  it is true that this was not exactly the appearance of the roman theatre which lies on the other side of the town a fact that did not prevent me from making my way to it in less than five minutes through a suc cession of little streets concerning which i have no observations to record  none of the roman remains in the south of france are more impressive than this stupendous fragment  an enormous mound rises above the place which was formerly occupied  i quote from murray  first by a citadel of the romans then by a castle of the princes of nassau razed by louis xiv facing this hill a mighty wall erects itself thirtysix metres high and composed of massive blocks of dark brown stone simply laid one on the other the whole naked rugged surface of which suggests a natural cliff say of the vaucluse order rather than an effort of human or even of roman labor  it is the biggest thing at orange  it is bigger than all orange put to gether  and its permanent massiveness makes light of the shrunken city  the face it presents to the town  the top of it garnished with two rows of brackets perforated with holes to receive the staves of the vela rium  bears the traces of more than one tier of orna mental arches though how these flat arches were applied or incrusted upon the wall i do not profess to explain  you pass through a diminutive postern  which seems in proportion about as high as the en trance of a rabbithutch  into the lodge of the custo dian who introduces you to the interior of the theatre here the mass of the hill affronts you which the in genious romans treated simply as the material of their auditorium  they inserted their stone seats in a semicircle in the slope of the lull and planted their colossal wall opposite to it  this wall from the inside is if possible even more imposing  it formed the back of the stage the permanent scene and its enormous face was coated with marble  it contains three doors the middle one being the highest and having above it far aloft a deep niche apparently intended for an imperial statue  a few of the benches remain on the hillside which however is mainly a confusion of fragments  there is part of a corridor built into the hill high up and on the crest are the remnants of the demolished castle  the whole place is a kind of wilderness of ruin there are scarcely any details the great feature is the overtopping wall  this wall being the back of the scene the space left be tween it and the chord of the semicircle of the audi torium which formed the proscenium is rather less than one would have supposed  in other words the stage was very shallow and appears to have been ar ranged for a number of performers standing in a line like a company of soldiers  there stands the silent skeleton however as impressive by what it leaves you to guess and wonder about as by what it tells you it has not the sweetness the softness of melancholy of the theatre at arles but it is more extraordinary and one can imagine only tremendous tragedies being enacted there    presenting thebes or pelops line  at either end of the stage coming forward is an immense wing  immense in height i mean as it reaches to the top of the scenic wall the other dimen sions are not remarkable  the division to the right as you face the stage is pointed out as the green room its portentous attitude and the open arches at the top give it the air of a well  the compartment on the left is exactly similar save that it opens into the traces of other chambers said to be those of a hippodrome adjacent to the theatre  various fragments are visible which refer themselves plausibly to such an establishment the greater axis of the hippodrome would appear to have been on a line with the triumphal arch  this is all i saw and all there was to see of orange which had a very rustic bucolic aspect and where i was not even called upon to demand break fast at the hotel  the entrance of this resort might have been that of a stable of the roman days    xxxvii  i have been trying to remember whether i fasted all the way to macon which i reached at an advanced hour of the evening and think i must have done so except for the purchase of a box of nougat at monte limart the place is famous for the manufacture of this confection which at the station is hawked at the windows of the train and for a bouillon very much later at lyons  the journey beside the rhone  past valence past tournon past vienne  would have been charming on that luminous sunday but for two disagreeable accidents  the express from marseilles which i took at orange was full to over flowing and the only refuge i could find was an inside angle in a carriage laden with germans who had command of the windows which they occupied as strongly as they have been known to occupy other strategical positions  i scarcely know however why i linger on this particular discomfort for it was but a single item in a considerable list of grievances  grievances dispersed through six weeks of constant railway travel in france  i have not touched upon them at an earlier stage of this chronicle but my re serve is not owing to any sweetness of association this form of locomotion in the country of the ameni ties is attended with a dozen discomforts almost all the conditions of the business are detestable  they force the sentimental tourist again and again to ask himself whether in consideration of such mortal an noyances the game is worth the candle  fortunately a railway journey is a good deal like a sea voyage its miseries fade from the mind as soon as you arrive that is why i completed to my great satisfaction my little tour in france  let this small effusion of illnature be my first and last tribute to the whole despotic gare the deadly salle dattente the insuffer able delays over ones luggage the porterless platform the overcrowded and illiberal train  how many a time did i permit myself the secret reflection that it is in perfidious albion that they order this matter best  how many a time did the eager british mer cenary clad in velveteen and clinging to the door of the carriage as it glides into the station revisit my invidious dreams  the paternal porter and the re sponsive hansom are among the best gifts of the eng lish genius to the world  i hasten to add faithful to my habit so insufferable to some of my friends of ever and again readjusting the balance after i have given it an honest tip that the bouillon at lyons which i spoke of above was though by no means an ideal bouillon much better than any i could have obtained at an english railway station  after i had imbibed it i sat in the train which waited a long time at lyons and by the light of one of the big lamps on the platform read all sorts of disagreeable things in certain radical newspapers which i had bought at the bookstall  i gathered from these sheets that lyons was in extreme commotion  the rhone and the saone which form a girdle for the splendid town were almost in the streets as i could easily be lieve from what i had seen of the country after leav ing orange  the rhone all the way to lyons had been in all sorts of places where it had no business to be and matters were naturally not improved by its confluence with the charming and copious stream which at macon is said once to have given such a happy opportunity to the egotism of the capital  a visitor from paris the anecdote is very old being asked on the quay of that city whether he didnt ad mire the saone replied goodnaturedly that it was very pretty but that in paris they spelled it with the ei  this moment of general alarm at lyons had been chosen by certain ingenious persons i credit them perhaps with too sure a prevision of the rise of the rivers for practising further upon the appre hensions of the public  a bombshell filled with dynamite had been thrown into a cafe and various votaries of the comparatively innocuous petit verre had been wounded i am not sure whether any one had been killed by the irruption  of course there had been arrests and incarcerations and the intransi geant and the rappel were filled with the echoes of the explosion  the tone of these organs is rarely edifying and it had never been less so than on this occasion  i wondered as i looked through them whether i was losing all my radicalism and then i wondered whether after all i had any to lose  even in so long await as that tiresome delay at lyons i failed to settle the question any more than i made up my mind as to the probable future of the militant democracy or the ultimate form of a civilization which should have blown up everything else  a few days later the waters went down it lyons but the de mocracy has not gone down  i remember vividly the remainder of that evening which i spent at macon  remember it with a chatter ing of the teeth  i know not what had got into the place the temperature for the last day of october was eccentric and incredible  these epithets may also be applied to the hotel itself  an extraordinary structure all facade which exposes an uncovered rear to the gaze of nature  there is a demonstrative voluble landlady who is of course part of the facade but everything behind her is a trap for the winds with chambers corridors staircases all exhibited to the sky as if the outer wall of the house had been lifted off  it would have been delightful for florida but it didnt do for burgundy even on the eve of november 1st so that i suffered absurdly from the rigor of a season that had not yet begun  there was something in the air i felt it the next day even on the sunny quay of the saone where in spite of a fine southerly exposure i extracted little warmth from the reflection that alphonse de lamartine had often trod den the flags  macon struck me somehow as suffer ing from a chronic numbness and there was nothing exceptionally cheerful in the remarkable extension of the river  it was no longer a river  it had become a lake and from my window in the painted face of the inn i saw that the opposite bank had been moved back as it were indefinitely  unfortunately the various objects with which it was furnished had not been moved as well the consequence of which was an extraordinary confusion in the relations of thing there were always poplars to be seen but the poplar had become an aquatic plant  such phenomena however at macon attract but little attention as the saone at certain seasons of the year is nothing if not expansive  the people are as used to it as they ap peared to be to the bronze statue of lamartine which is the principal monument of the place and which re presenting the poet in a frogged overcoat and top boots improvising in a high wind struck me as even less casual in its attitude than monumental sculpture usually succeeds in being  it is true that in its pre sent position i thought better of this work of art which is from the hand of m falquiere than when i had seen it through the factitious medium of the salon of 1876  i walked up the hill where the older part of macon lies in search of the natal house of the amant delvire the petrarch whose vaucluse was the bosom of the public  the guidejoanne quotes from les confidences a description of the birthplace of the poet whose treatment of the locality is indeed poetical it tallies strangely little with the reality either as re gards position or other features and it may be said to be not an aid but a direct obstacle to a discovery of the house  a very humble edifice in a small back street is designated by a municipal tablet set into its face as the scene of lamartines advent into the world he himself speaks of a vast and lofty structure at the angle of a place adorned with iron clamps with a porte haute et large and many other peculiarities  the house with the tablet has two meagre stories above the basement and at present at least an air of ex treme shabbiness the place moreover never can have been vast  lamartine was accused of writing history incorrectly and apparently he started wrong at first it had never become clear to him where he was born or is the tablet wrong  if the house is small the tablet is very big    xxxviii  the foregoing reflections occur in a cruder form as it were in my notebook where i find this remark appended to them dont take leave of lamartine on that contemptuous note it will be easy to think of something more sympathetic  those friends of mine mentioned a little while since who accuse me of always tipping back the balance could not desire a paragraph more characteristic but i wish to give no further evi dence of such infirmities and will therefore hurry away from the subject  hurry away in the train which very early on a crisp bright morning conveyed me by way of an excursion to the ancient city of bourgenbresse shining in early light the saone was spread like a smooth white tablecloth over a considerable part of the flat country that i traversed  there is no provision made in this image for the long transparent screens of thintwigged trees which rose at intervals out of the watery plain but as under the circumstances there seemed to be no provision for them in fact i will let my metaphor go for what it is worth  my journey was as i remember it of about an hour and a half but i passed no object of interest as the phrase is whatever  the phrase hardly applies even to bourg itself which is simply a town quelconque as m zola would say  small peaceful rustic it stands in the midst of the great dairyfeeding plains of bresse of which fat county sometime property of the house of savoy it was the modest capital  the blue masses of the jura give it a creditable horizon but the only nearer feature it can point to is its famous sepulchral church  this edifice lies at a fortunate distance from the town which though inoffensive is of too common a stamp to consort with such a treasure  all i ever knew of the church of brou i had gathered years ago from matthew arnolds beautiful poem which bears its name  i remember thinking in those years that it was impossible verses could be more touching than these and as i stood before the object of my pilgrimage in the gay french light though the place was so dull i recalled the spot where i had first read them and where i read them again and yet again wondering whether it would ever be my fortune to visit the church of brou  the spot in question was an armchair in a window which looked out on some cows in a field and whenever i glanced at the cows it came over me  i scarcely know why  that i should probably never behold the structure reared by the duchess margaret  some of our visions never come to pass but we must be just  others do  so sleep forever sleep o princely pair  i remembered that line of matthew arnolds and the stanza about the duchess margaret coming to watch the builders on her palfry white  then there came to me something in regard to the moon shining on winter nights through the cold clerestory  the tone of the place at that hour was not at all lunar it was cold and bright but with the chill of an autumn morning yet this even with the fact of the unexpected remoteness of the church from the jura added to it did not prevent me from feeling that i looked at a monument in the pro duction of which  or at least in the effect of which on the tourist mind of today  matthew arnold had been much concerned  by a pardonable license he has placed it a few miles nearer to the forests of the jura than it stands at present  it is very true that though the mountains in the sixteenth century can hardly have been in a different position the plain which separates the church from them may have been bedecked with woods  the visitor today cannot help wondering why the beautiful building with its splendid works of art is dropped down in that particular spot which looks so accidental and arbitrary  but there are reasons for most things and there were reasons why the church of brou should be at brou which is a vague little suburb of a vague little town  the responsibility rests at any rate upon the duchess margaret  margaret of austria daughter of the emperor maximilian and his wife mary of bur gundy daughter of charles the bold  this lady has a high name in history having been regent of the netherlands in behalf of her nephew the emperor charles v of whose early education she had had the care  she married in 1501 philibert the handsome duke of savoy to whom the province of bresse be longed and who died two years later  she had been betrothed is a child to charles viii of france and was kept for some time at the french court  that of her prospective fatherinlaw louis xi but she was eventually repudiated in order that her fiance might marry anne of brittany  an alliance so magnificently political that we almost condone the offence to a sensitive princess  margaret did not want for hus bands however inasmuch as before her marriage to philibert she had been united to john of castile son of ferdinand v king of aragon  an episode ter minated by the death of the spanish prince within a year  she was twentytwo years regent of the nether lands and died at fiftyone in 1530  she might have been had she chosen the wife of henry vii of eng land  she was one of the signers of the league of cambray against the venetian republic and was a most politic accomplished and judicious princess she undertook to build the church of brou as a mau soleum for her second husband and herself in fulfil ment of a vow made by margaret of bourbon mother of philibert who died before she could redeem her pledge and who bequeathed the duty to her son  he died shortly afterwards and his widow assumed the pious task  according to murray she intrusted the erection of the church to maistre loys von berghem and the sculpture to maistre conrad  the author of a superstitious but carefully prepared little notice which i bought at bourg calls the architect and sculptor at once jehan de paris author sic of the tomb of francis ii of brittany to which we gave some attention at nantes and which the writer of my pamphlet ascribes only subordinately to michel colomb the church which is not of great size is in the last and most flamboyant phase of gothic and in admirable preservation the west front before which a quaint old sundial is laid out on the ground  a circle of num bers marked in stone like those on a clock face let into the earth  is covered with delicate ornament the great feature however the nave is perfectly bare and wonderfully newlooking though the warden a stolid yet sharp old peasant in a blouse who looked more as if his line were chaffering over turnips than showing off works of art told me that it has never been touched and that its freshness is simply the quality of the stone  the great feature is the ad mirable choir in the midst of which the three monu ments have bloomed under the chisel like exotic plants in a conservatory  i saw the place to small advantage for the stained glass of the windows which are fine was under repair and much of it was masked with planks  in the centre lies philibertlebel a figure of white marble on a great slab of black in his robes and his armor with two boyangels holding a tablet at his head and two more at his feet  on either side of him is another cherub one guarding his helmet the other his stiff gauntlets  the attitudes of these charm ing children whose faces are all bent upon him in pity have the prettiest tenderness and respect  the table on which he lies is supported by elaborate columns adorned with niches containing little images and with every other imaginable elegance and be neath it he is represented in that other form so com mon in the tombs of the renaissance  a man naked and dying with none of the state and splendor of the image above  one of these figures embodies the duke the other simply the mortal and there is something very strange and striking in the effect of the latter seen dimly and with difficulty through the intervals of the rich supports of the upper slab  the monu ment of margaret herself is on the left all in white merble tormented into a multitude of exquisite pat terns the last extravagance of a gothic which had gone so far that nothing was left it but to return upon itself  unlike her husband who has only the high roof of the church above him she lies under a canopy supported and covered by a wilderness of embroidery  flowers devices initials arabesques statuettes watched over by cherubs she is also in her robes and ermine with a greyhound sleeping at her feet her husband at his has a waking lion and the artist has not it is to be presumed represented her as more beautiful than she was  she looks indeed like the regent of a turbulent realm  beneath her couch is stretched another figure  a less brilliant margaret wrapped in her shroud with her long hair over her shoulders  round the tomb is the battered iron railing placed there originally with the myste rious motto of the duchess worked into the top  fortune infortune fort une  the other two monuments are protected by barriers of the same pattern  that of margaret of bourbon philiberts mother stands on the right of the choir and i suppose its greatest dis tinction is that it should have been erected to a motherinlaw  it is but little less florid and sump tuous than the others it has however no second re cumbent figure  on the other hand the statuettes that surround the base of the tomb are of even more exquisite workmanship they represent weeping wo men in long mantles and hoods which latter hang forward over the small face of the figure giving the artist a chance to carve the features within this hollow of drapery  an extraordinary play of skill  there is a high white marble shrine of the virgin as extra ordinary as all the rest a series of compartments re presenting the various scenes of her life with the assumption in the middle and there is a magnifi cent series of stalls which are simply the intricate embroidery of the tombs translated into polished oak all these things are splendid ingenious elaborate precious it is goldsmiths work on a monumental scale and the general effect is none the less beautiful and solemn because it is so rich  but the monuments of the church of brou are not the noblest that one may see the great tombs of verona are finer and various other early italian work  these things are not insincere as ruskin would say but they are pre tentious and they are not positively naifs  i should mention that the walls of the choir are embroidered in places with margarets tantalizing device which  partly perhaps because it is tantalizing  is so very decorative as they say in london  i know not whether she was acquainted with this epithet but she had anticipated one of the fashions most characteristic of our age  one asks ones self how all this decoration this luxury of fair and chiselled marble survived the french revolution  an hour of liberty in the choir of brou would have been a carnival for the image breakers  the wellfed bressois are surely a good natured people  i call them wellfed both on general and on particular grounds  their province has the most savory aroma and i found an opportunity to test its reputation  i walked back into the town from the church there was really nothing to be seen by the way and as the hour of the midday breakfast had struck directed my steps to the inn  the table dhote was going on and a gracious bustling talkative landlady welcomed me  i had an excellent repast  the best repast possible  which consisted simply of boiled eggs and bread and butter  it was the quality of these simple ingredients that made the occasion memorable  the eggs were so good that i am ashamed to say how many of them i consumed  la plus belle fille du monde as the french proverb says ne peut donner que ce quelle a and it might seem that an egg which has succeeded in being fresh has done all that can reasonably be expected of it but there was a bloom of punctuality so to speak about these eggs of bourg as if it had been the in tention of the very hens themselves that they should be promptly served  nous sommes en bresse et le beurre nest pas mauvais the landlady said with a sort of dry coquetry as she placed this article before me  it was the poetry of butter and i ate a pound or two of it after which i came away with a strange mixture of impressions of late gothic sculpture and thick tartines  i came away through the town where on a little green promenade facing the hotel is a bronze statue of bichat the physiologist who was a bressois  i mention it not on account of its merit though as statues go i dont remember that it is bad but because i learned from it  my ignorance doubtless did me little honor  that bichat had died at thirty years of age and this revelation was almost agitating  to have done so much in so short a life was to be truly great  this reflection which looks deplorably trite as i write it here had the effect of eloquence as i uttered it for my own benefit on the bare little mall at bourg    xxxix  on my return to macon i found myself fairly face to face with the fact that my little tour was near its end  dijon had been marked by fate as its farthest limit and dijon was close at hand  after that i was to drop the tourist and reenter paris as much as pos sible like a parisian  out of paris the parisian never loiters and therefore it would be impossible for me to stop between dijon and the capital  but i might be a tourist a few hours longer by stopping somewhere between macon and dijon  the question was where i should spend these hours  where better i asked myself for reasons not now entirely clear to me than at beaune  on my way to this town i passed the stretch of the cote dor which covered with a mel low autumn haze with the sunshine shimmering through looked indeed like a golden slope  one regards with a kind of awe the region in which the famous crus of burgundy yougeot chambertin nuits beaune are i was going to say manufactured  adieu paniers vendanges sont faites  the vintage was over the shrunken russet fibres alone clung to their ugly stick  the horizon on the left of the road had a charm however there is something picturesque in the big comfortable shoulders of the cote  that delicate critic m emile montegut in a charming record of travel through this region published some years ago praises shakspeare for having talked in lear of waterish burgundy  vinous burgundy would surely be more to the point  i stopped at beaune in pursuit of the picturesque but i might almost have seen the little i discovered without stop ping  it is a drowsy little burgundian town very old and ripe with crooked streets vistas always ob lique and steep mosscovered roofs  the principal lion is the hopitalsaintesprit or the hoteldieu simply as they call it there founded in 1443 by nicholas rollin chancellor of burgundy  it is ad ministered by the sisterhood of the holy ghost and is one of the most venerable and stately of hospitals the face it presents to the street is simple but strik ing  a plain windowless wall surmounted by a vast slate roof of almost mountainous steepness  astride this roof sits a tall slatecovered spire from which as i arrived the prettiest chimes i ever heard worse luck to them as i will presently explain were ring ing  over the door is a high quaint canopy without supports with its vault painted blue and covered with gilded stars  this and indeed the whole build ing have lately been restored and its antiquity is quite of the spickandspan order  but it is very delightful  the treasure of the place is a precious picture  a last judgment attributed equally to john van eyck and roger van der weyden  given to the hospital in the fifteenth century by nicholas rollin aforesaid  i learned however to my dismay from a sympa thizing but inexorable concierge that what remained to me of the time i had to spend at beaune between trains  i had rashly wasted half an hour of it in breakfasting at the station  was the one hour of the day that of the dinner of the nuns the picture is in their refectory during which the treasure could not be shown  the purpose of the musical chimes to which i had so artlessly listened was to usher in this fruitless interval  the regulation was absolute and my disappointment relative as i have been happy to reflect since i looked up the picture  crowe and cavalcaselle assign it without hesitation to roger van der weyden and give a weak little drawing of it in their flemish painters  i learn from them also  what i was ignorant of  that nicholas ronin chan cellor of burgundy and founder of the establishment at beaune was the original of the worthy kneeling before the virgin in the magnificent john van eyck of the salon carre  all i could see was the court of the hospital and two or three rooms  the court with its tall roofs its pointed gables and spires its wooden galleries its ancient well with an elaborate superstruc ture of wrought iron is one of those places into which a sketcher ought to be let loose  it looked flemish or english rather than french and a splendid tidiness pervaded it  the porter took me into two rooms on the groundfloor into which the sketcher should also be allowed to penetrate for they made irresistible pictures  one of them of great proportions painted in elaborate subjects like a ballroom of the seven teenth century was filled with the beds of patients all draped in curtains of dark red cloth the tradi tional uniform of these eleemosynary couches  among them the sisters moved about in their robes of white flannel with big white linen hoods  the other room was a strange immense apartment lately restored with much splendor  it was of great length and height had a painted and gilded barrelroof and one end of it  the one i was introduced to  appeared to serve as a chapel as two whiterobed sisters were on their knees before an altar  this was divided by red curtains from the larger part but the porter lifted one of the curtains and showed me that the rest of it a long imposing vista served as a ward lined with little reddraped beds  cest lheure de la lecture remarked my guide and a group of conva lescents  all the patients i saw were women  were gathered in the centre around a nun the points of whose white hood nodded a little above them and whose gentle voice came to us faintly with a little echo down the high perspective  i know not what the good sister was reading  a dull book i am afraid  but there was so much color and such a fine rich air of tradition about the whole place that it seemed to me i would have risked listening to her  i turned away however with that sense of defeat which is always irritating to the appreciative tourist and pot tered about beaune rather vaguely for the rest of my hour looked at the statue of gaspard monge the mathematician in the little place there is no place in france too little to contain an effigy to a glorious son at the fine old porch  completely despoiled at the revolution  of the principal church and even at the meagre treasures of a courageous but melancholy little museum which has been arranged  part of it being the gift of a local collector  in a small hotel de ville i carried away from beaune the impression of some thing mildly autumnal  something rusty yet kindly like the taste of a sweet russet pear    xl  it was very well that my little tour was to termi nate at dijon for i found rather to my chagrin that there was not a great deal from the pictorial point of view to be done with dijon  it was no great matter for i held my proposition to have been by this time abundantly demonstrated  the proposition with which i started that if paris is france france is by no means paris  if dijon was a good deal of a disap pointment i felt therefore that i could afford it  it was time for me to reflect also that for my disap pointments as a general thing i had only myself to thank  they had too often been the consequence of arbitrary preconceptions produced by influences of which i had lost the trace  at any rate i will say plumply that the ancient capital of burgundy is want ing in character it is not up to the mark  it is old and narrow and crooked and it has been left pretty well to itself but it is not high and overhanging it is not to the eye what the burgundian capital should be  it has some tortuous vistas some mossy roofs some bulging fronts some grayfaced hotels which look as if in former centuries  in the last for instance during the time of that delightful president de brosses whose letters from italy throw an interesting sidelight on dijon  they had witnessed a considerable amount of good living  but there is nothing else  i speak as a man who for some reason which he doesnt remem ber now did not pay a visit to the celebrated puits de moise an ancient cistern embellished with a sculp tured figure of the hebrew lawgiver  the ancient palace of the dukes of burgundy long since converted into an hotel de ville presents to a wide clean court paved with washedlooking stones and to a small semicircular place opposite which looks as if it had tried to be symmetrical and had failed a facade and two wings characterized by the stiffness but not by the grand air of the early part of the eighteenth century  it contains however a large and rich museum  a museum really worthy of a capi tal  the gem of this exhibition is the great banquet inghall of the old palace one of the few features of the place that has not been essentially altered  of great height roofed with the old beams and cornices it contains filling one end a colossal gothic chimney piece with a fireplace large enough to roast not an ox but a herd of oxen  in the middle of this striking hall the walls of which are covered with objects more or less precious have been placed the tombs of philippe lehardi and jeansanspeur  these monuments very splendid in their general effect have a limited interest the limitation comes from the fact that we see them today in a transplanted and mutilated condition placed originally in a church which has disappeared from the face of the earth demolished and dispersed at the revolution they have been reconstructed and restored out of fragments recovered and pieced to gether  the piecing his been beautifully done it is covered with gilt and with brilliant paint the whole result is most artistic  but the spell of the old mor tuary figures is broken and it will never work again meanwhile the monuments are immensely decorative  i think the thing that pleased me best at dijon was the little old parc a charming public garden about a mile from the town to which i walked by a long straight autumnal avenue  it is a jardin fran cais of the last century  a dear old place with little bluegreen perspectives and alleys and rondpoints in which everything balances  i went there late in the afternoon without meeting a creature though i had hoped i should meet the president de brosses  at the end of it was a little river that looked like a canal and on the further bank was an oldfashioned villa close to the water with a little french garden of its own  on the hither side was a bench on which i seated myself lingering a good while for this was just the sort of place i like  it was the furthermost point of my little tour  i thought that over as i sat there on the eve of taking the express to paris and as the light faded in the parc the vision of some of the things i had seen became more distinct
