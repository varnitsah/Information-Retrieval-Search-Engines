drawing by charles copeland     introductory note   mrs stowe had early and very practical acquaintance with the art of housekeeping it strikes one at first as a little incongruous that an author who devoted her great powers to stirring the conscience of a nation should from time to time and at one period especially give her mind to the ordering of family life but a moments consideration will show that the same woman was earnestly at the bottom of each effort in a letter to the late lord denman written in 1853 mrs stowe speaking of uncle toms cabin said i wrote what i did because as a woman as a mother i was oppressed and heartbroken with the sorrows and injustice which i saw and because as a christian i felt the dishonor to christianity not under the stress of passionate emotion yet largely from a sense of real responsibility as a woman a mother and a christian she occupied herself with those concerns of everyday life which so distinctly appeal to a womans mind how to order a household how to administer that little kingdom over which a woman rules and above all how to make family life stable pure and conservative of the highest happiness these were the questions which she asked herself constantly and which she tried to solve not only incidentally in her fiction but directly in her essays and in that field of one tenth fiction and nine tenths didacticism which constitutes most of the present volume  a scholars adventures in the country and trials of a housekeeper appeared in the miscellany to which she gave the name of the mayflower and reflect humorously the cincinnati experiences which again are playfully recounted in letters published in her sons life the former contributed in 1850 to the national era was drawn pretty closely from the experiments of professor stowe it is noticeable that in this paper and in our second girl which was contributed to the atlantic monthly for january 1868 the author poses as the masculine member of the household as if this assumption gave her some advantage in the point of view at any rate she adopted the same r√¥le when she came more deliberately to survey a wide field in a series of articles  the house and home papers were contributed first to the atlantic monthly and afterward published in book form as the production of one christopher crowfield though there was not the slightest attempt otherwise at disguising the authorship the immediate occasion of the papers was no doubt the removal of the stowes from andover and their establishment in hartford an event which took place shortly before the papers began to appear in the atlantic the years which followed during the first hartford residence saw also a marriage in the family and new problems of daily life constantly presenting themselves so that a similar series appeared in the same magazine purporting to be from the same householder entitled the chimney corner this series indeed entered rather more seriously into questions of social morality and deepened in feeling as it proceeded the eleventh section is a warm appreciation of the woman who figured so largely in mrs stowes early life and the last two papers rose as the reader will see to the height of national memories mrs fields has preserved for us in her days with mrs stowe a striking record of the mingling of the great and the near in this writers mind the period of which she writes is that in which the chimney corner series was drawing to a close  in the autumn of 1864 she wrote i feel i need to write in these days to keep me from thinking of things that make me dizzy and blind and fill my eyes with tears so that i cannot see the paper i mean such things as are being done where our heroes are dying as shaw died it is not wise that all our literature should run in a rut cut through our hearts and red with our blood i feel the need of a little gentle household merriment and talk of common things to indulge which i have devised the following  notwithstanding her view of the need and her skillfully devised plans to meet it she soon sent another epistle showing how impossible it was to stem the current of her thought    november 29 1864    my dear friend    i have sent my new years article the result of one of those   peculiar experiences which sometimes occur to us writers i had   planned an article gay sprightly wholly domestic but as i   began and sketched the pleasant home and quiet fireside an   irresistible impulse wrote for me what followedan offering of   sympathy to the suffering and agonized whose homes have forever   been darkened many causes united at once to force on me this   vision from which generally i shrink but which sometimes will   not be deniedwill make itself felt    just before i went to new york two of my earliest and   most intimate friends lost their oldest sons captains and   majorssplendid fellows physically and morally beautiful   brave religious uniting the courage of soldiers to the   faith of martyrsand when i went to brooklyn it seemed as   if i were hearing some such thing almost every day and   henry in his profession as minister has so many letters   full of imploring anguish the cry of hearts breaking that ask   help of him     household papers and stories  house and home papers  i  the ravages of a carpet   my dear its so cheap  these words were spoken by my wife as she sat gracefully on a roll of brussels carpet which was spread out in flowery lengths on the floor of messrs ketchem  co  its so cheap  milton says that the love of fame is the last infirmity of noble minds i think he had not rightly considered the subject i believe that last infirmity is the love of getting things cheap understand me now i dont mean the love of getting cheap things by which one understands showy trashy illmade spurious articles bearing certain apparent resemblances to better things all really sensible people are quite superior to that sort of cheapness but those fortunate accidents which put within the power of a man things really good and valuable for half or a third of their value what mortal virtue and resolution can withstand my friend brown has a genuine murillo the joy of his heart and the light of his eyes but he never fails to tell you as its crowning merit how he bought it in south america for just nothinghow it hung smoky and deserted in the back of a countingroom and was thrown in as a makeweight to bind a bargain and upon being cleaned turned out a genuine murillo and then he takes out his cigar and calls your attention to the points in it he adjusts the curtain to let the sunlight fall just in the right spot he takes you to this and the other point of view and all this time you must confess that in your mind as well as his the consideration that he got all this beauty for ten dollars adds lustre to the painting brown has paintings there for which he paid his thousands and being well advised they are worth the thousands he paid but this ewe lamb that he got for nothing always gives him a secret exaltation in his own eyes he seems to have credited to himself personally merit to the amount of what he should have paid for the picture then there is mrs croesus at the party yesterday evening expatiating to my wife on the surprising cheapness of her pointlace set got for just nothing at all my dear and a circle of admiring listeners echoes the sound did you ever hear anything like it i never heard of such a thing in my life and away sails mrs croesus as if she had a collar composed of all the cardinal virtues in fact she is buoyed up with a secret sense of merit so that her satin slippers scarcely touch the carpet even i myself am fond of showing a first edition of paradise lost for which i gave a shilling in a london bookstall and stating that i would not take a hundred dollars for it even i must confess there are points on which i am mortal  but all this while my wife sits on her roll of carpet looking into my face for approbation and marianne and jenny are pouring into my ear a running fire of how sweet how lovely just like that one of mrs tweedleums  and she gave two dollars and seventyfive cents a yard for hers and this is  my wife here put her hand to her mouth and pronounced the incredible sum in a whisper with a species of sacred awe common as i have observed to females in such interesting crises in fact mr ketchem standing smiling and amiable by remarked to me that really he hoped mrs crowfield would not name generally what she gave for the article for positively it was so far below the usual rate of prices that he might give offense to other customers but this was the very last of the pattern and they were anxious to close off the old stock and we had always traded with them and he had a great respect for my wifes father who had always traded with their firm and so when there were any little bargains to be thrown in any ones way why he naturally of courseand here mr ketchem bowed gracefully over the yardstick to my wife and i consented  yes i consented but whenever i think of myself at that moment i always am reminded in a small way of adam taking the apple and my wife seated on that roll of carpet has more than once suggested to my mind the classic image of pandora opening her unlucky box in fact from the moment i had blandly assented to mr ketchems remarks and said to my wife with a gentle air of dignity well my dear since it suits you i think you had better take it there came a load on my prophetic soul which not all the fluttering and chattering of my delighted girls and the more placid complacency of my wife could entirely dissipate i presaged i know not what of coming woe and all i presaged came to pass  in order to know just what came to pass i must give you a view of the house and home into which this carpet was introduced  my wife and i were somewhat advanced housekeepers and our dwelling was first furnished by her father in the oldfashioned jogtrot days when furniture was made with a view to its lasting from generation to generation everything was strong and comfortableheavy mahogany guiltless of the modern device of veneering and hewed out with a square solidity which had not an idea of change it was so to speak a sort of granite foundation of the household structure then we commenced housekeeping with the full idea that our house was a thing to be lived in and that furniture was made to be used that most sensible of women mrs crowfield agreed fully with me that in our house there was to be nothing too good for ourselvesno room shut up in holiday attire to be enjoyed by strangers for three or four days in the year while we lived in holes and corners no best parlor from which we were to be excluded no silver plate to be kept in the safe in the bank and brought home only in case of a grand festival while our daily meals were served with dingy britannia strike a broad plain average i said to my wife have everything abundant serviceable and give all our friends exactly what we have ourselves no better and no worse and my wife smiled approval on my sentiment  smile she did more than smile my wife resembles one of those convex mirrors i have sometimes seen every idea i threw out plain and simple she reflected back upon me in a thousand little glitters and twinkles of her own she made my crude conceptions come back to me in such perfectly dazzling performances that i hardly recognized them my mind warms up when i think what a home that woman made of our house from the very first day she moved into it the great large airy parlor with its ample bowwindow when she had arranged it seemed a perfect trap to catch sunbeams there was none of that discouraging trimness and newness that often repel a mans bachelor friends after the first call and make them feel oh well one cannot go in at crowfields now unless one is dressed one might put them out the first thing our parlor said to any one was that we were not people to be put out that we were widespread easygoing and jolly folk even if tom brown brought in ponto and his shootingbag there was nothing in that parlor to strike terror into man and dog for it was written on the face of things that everybody there was to do just as he or she pleased there were my books and my writingtable spread out with all its miscellaneous confusion of papers on one side of the fireplace and there were my wifes great ample sofa and worktable on the other there i wrote my articles for the north american and there she turned and ripped and altered her dresses and there lay crochet and knitting and embroidery side by side with a weekly basket of family mending and in neighborly contiguity with the last book of the season which my wife turned over as she took her afterdinner lounge on the sofa and in the bowwindow were canaries always singing and a great stand of plants always fresh and blooming and ivy which grew and clambered and twined about the pictures best of all there was in our parlor that household altar the blazing wood fire whose wholesome hearty crackle is the truest household inspiration i quite agree with one celebrated american author who holds that an open fireplace is an altar of patriotism would our revolutionary fathers have gone barefooted and bleeding over snows to defend airtight stoves and cookingranges i trow not it was the memory of the great open kitchenfire with its back log and fore stick of cordwood its roaring hilarious voice of invitation its dancing tongues of flame that called to them through the snows of that dreadful winter to keep up their courage that made their hearts warm and bright with a thousand reflected memories our neighbors said that it was delightful to sit by our firebut then for their part they could not afford it wood was so ruinously dear and all that most of these people could not for the simple reason that they felt compelled in order to maintain the family dignity to keep up a parlor with great pomp and circumstance of upholstery where they sat only on dress occasions and of course the wood fire was out of the question  when children began to make their appearance in our establishment my wife like a wellconducted housekeeper had the best of nursery arrangementsa room all warmed lighted and ventilated and abounding in every proper resource of amusement to the rising race but it was astonishing to see how notwithstanding this the centripetal attraction drew every pair of little pattering feet to our parlor  my dear why dont you take your blocks upstairs  i want to be where oo are said with a piteous under lip was generally a most convincing answer  then the small people could not be disabused of the idea that certain chief treasures of their own would be safer under papas writingtable or mammas sofa than in the safest closet of their domains my writingtable was dockyard for arthurs new ship and stable for little toms pepperandsaltcolored pony and carriagehouse for charleys new wagon while whole armies of paper dolls kept house in the recess behind mammas sofa  and then in due time came the tribe of pets who followed the little ones and rejoiced in the blaze of the firelight the boys had a splendid newfoundland which knowing our weakness we warned them with awful gravity was never to be a parlor dog but somehow what with little beggings and pleadings on the part of arthur and tom and the piteous melancholy with which rover would look through the windowpanes when shut out from the blazing warmth into the dark cold veranda it at last came to pass that rover gained a regular corner at the hearth a regular status in every family convocation and then came a little blackandtan english terrier for the girls and then a fleecy poodle who established himself on the corner of my wifes sofa and for each of these some little voice pleaded and some little heart would be so near broken at any slight that my wife and i resigned ourselves to live in a menagerie the more so as we were obliged to confess a lurking weakness towards these fourfooted children ourselves  so we grew and flourished togetherchildren dogs birds flowers and all and although my wife often in paroxysms of housewifeliness to which the best of women are subject would declare that we never were fit to be seen yet i comforted her with the reflection that there were few people whose friends seemed to consider them better worth seeing judging by the stream of visitors and loungers which was always setting towards our parlor people seemed to find it good to be there they said it was somehow homelike and pleasant and that there was a kind of charm about it that made it easy to talk and easy to live and as my girls and boys grew up there seemed always to be some merry doing or other going on there arty and tom brought home their college friends who straightway took root there and seemed to fancy themselves a part of us we had no receptionrooms apart where the girls were to receive young gentlemen all the courting and flirting that were to be done had for their arena the ample variety of surface presented by our parlor which with sofas and screens and lounges and recesses and writing and work tables disposed here and there and the genuine laisser aller of the whole m√®nage seemed on the whole to have offered ample advantages enough for at the time i write of two daughters were already established in marriage while my youngest was busy as yet in performing that little domestic ballet of the cat with the mouse in the case of a most submissive youth of the neighborhood  all this time our parlor furniture though of that granitic formation i have indicated began to show marks of that decay to which things sublunary are liable i cannot say that i dislike this look in a room take a fine ample hospitable apartment where all things freely and generously used softly and indefinably grow old together there is a sort of mellow tone and keeping which pleases my eye what if the seams of the great inviting armchair where so many friends have sat and lounged do grow white what in fact if some easy couch has an undeniable hole worn in its friendly cover i regard with tenderness even these mortal weaknesses of these servants and witnesses of our good times and social fellowship no vulgar touch wore them they may be called rather the marks and indentations which the glittering in and out of the tide of social happiness has worn in the rocks of our strand i would no more disturb the gradual toningdown and aging of a wellused set of furniture by smart improvements than i would have a modern dauber paint in emendations in a fine old picture  so we men reason but women do not always think as we do there is a virulent demon of housekeeping not wholly cast out in the best of them and which often breaks out in unguarded moments in fact miss marianne being on the lookout for furniture wherewith to begin a new establishment and jenny who had accompanied her in her peregrinations had more than once thrown out little disparaging remarks on the timeworn appearance of our establishment suggesting comparison with those of more modern furnished rooms  it is positively scandalous the way our furniture looks i one day heard one of them declaring to her mother and this old rag of a carpet  my feelings were hurt not the less so that i knew that the large cloth which covered the middle of the floor and which the women call a bocking had been bought and nailed down there after a solemn family council as the best means of concealing the too evident darns which years of good cheer had made needful in our stanch old household friend the threeply carpet made in those days when to be a threeply was a pledge of continuance and service  well it was a joyous and bustling day when after one of those domestic whirlwinds which the women are fond of denominating housecleaning the new brussels carpet was at length brought in and nailed down and its beauty praised from mouth to mouth our old friends called in and admired and all seemed to be well except that i had that light and delicate presage of changes to come which indefinitely brooded over me  the first premonitory symptom was the look of apprehensive suspicion with which the female senate regarded the genial sunbeams that had always glorified our bowwindow  this house ought to have inside blinds said marianne with all the confident decision of youth this carpet will be ruined if that sun is allowed to come in like that  and that dirty little canary must really be hung in the kitchen said jenny he always did make such a litter scattering his seed chippings about and he never takes his bath without flirting out some water and mamma it appears to me it will never do to have the plants here plants are always either leaking through the pots upon the carpet or scattering bits of blossoms and dead leaves or some accident upsets or breaks a pot it was no matter you know when we had the old carpet but this we really want to have kept nice  mamma stood her ground for the plantsdarlings of her heart for many a yearbut temporized and showed that disposition towards compromise which is most inviting to aggression  i confess i trembled for of all radicals on earth none are to be compared to females that have once in hand a course of domestic innovation and reform the sacred fire the divine furor burns in their bosoms they become perfect pythonesses and every chair they sit on assumes the magic properties of the tripod hence the dismay that lodges in the bosoms of us males at the fateful spring and autumn seasons denominated housecleaning who can say whither the awful gods the prophetic fates may drive our fair household divinities what sins of ours may be brought to light what indulgences and compliances which uninspired woman has granted in her ordinary mortal hours may be torn from us he who has been allowed to keep a pair of pet slippers in a concealed corner and by the fireside indulged with a chair which he might ad libitum fill with all sorts of pamphlets and miscellaneous literature suddenly finds himself reformed out of knowledge his pamphlets tucked away into pigeonholes and corners and his slippers put in their place in the hall with perhaps a brisk insinuation about the shocking dust and disorder that men will tolerate  the fact was that the very first night after the advent of the new carpet i had a prophetic dream among our treasures of art was a little etching by an english artist friend the subject of which was the gambols of the household fairies in a baronial library after the household were in bed the little people are represented in every attitude of frolic enjoyment some escalade the great armchair and look down from its top as from a domestic mont blanc some climb about the bellows some scale the shaft of the shovel while some forming in magic ring dance festively on the yet glowing hearth tiny troops promenade the writingtable one perches himself quaintly on the top of the inkstand and holds colloquy with another who sits crosslegged on a paper weight while a companion looks down on them from the top of the sandbox it was an ingenious little device and gave me the idea which i often expressed to my wife that much of the peculiar feeling of security composure and enjoyment which seems to be the atmosphere of some rooms and houses came from the unsuspected presence of these little people the household fairies so that the belief in their existence became a solemn article of faith with me  accordingly that evening after the installation of the carpet when my wife and daughters had gone to bed as i sat with my slippered feet before the last coals of the fire i fell asleep in my chair and lo my own parlor presented to my eye a scene of busy life the little people in green were tripping to and fro but in great confusion evidently something was wrong among them for they were fussing and chattering with each other as if preparatory to a general movement in the region of the bowwindow i observed a tribe of them standing with tiny valises and carpetbags in their hands as though about to depart on a journey on my writingtable another set stood around my inkstand and penrack who pointing to those on the floor seemed to debate some question among themselves while others of them appeared to be collecting and packing away in tiny trunks certain fairy treasures preparatory to a general departure when i looked at the social hearth at my wifes sofa and workbasket i saw similar appearances of dissatisfaction and confusion it was evident that the household fairies were discussing the question of a general and simultaneous removal i groaned in spirit and stretching out my hand began a conciliatory address when whisk went the whole scene from before my eyes and i awaked to behold the form of my wife asking me if i were ill or had had the nightmare that i groaned so i told her my dream and we laughed at it together  we must give way to the girls a little she said it is natural you know that they should wish us to appear a little as other people do the fact is our parlor is somewhat dilapidated think how many years we have lived in it without an article of new furniture  i hate new furniture i remarked in the bitterness of my soul i hate anything new  my wife answered me discreetly according to approved principles of diplomacy i was right she sympathized with me at the same time it was not necessary she remarked that we should keep a hole in our sofacover and armchairthere would certainly be no harm in sending them to the upholsterers to be newcovered she didnt much mind for her part moving her plants to the south back room and the bird would do well enough in the kitchen i had often complained of him for singing vociferously when i was reading aloud  so our sofa went to the upholsterers but the upholsterer was struck with such horror at its clumsy antiquated unfashionable appearance that he felt bound to make representations to my wife and daughters positively it would be better for them to get a new one of a tempting pattern which he showed them than to try to do anything with that with a stitch or so here and there it might do for a basement diningroom but for a parlor he gave it as his disinterested opinionhe must say if the case were his own he should get etc etc in short we had a new sofa and new chairs and the plants and the birds were banished and some darkgreen blinds were put up to exclude the sun from the parlor and the blessed luminary was allowed there only at rare intervals when my wife and daughters were out shopping and i acted out my uncivilized male instincts by pulling up every shade and vivifying the apartment as in days of old  but this was not the worst of it the new furniture and new carpet formed an opposition party in the room i believe in my heart that for every little household fairy that went out with the dear old things there came in a tribe of discontented brownies with the new ones these little wretches were always twitching at the gowns of my wife and daughters jogging their elbows and suggesting odious comparisons between the smart new articles and what remained of the old ones they disparaged my writingtable in the corner they disparaged the oldfashioned lounge in the other corner which had been the maternal throne for years they disparaged the worktable the workbasket with constant suggestions of how such things as these would look in certain wellkept parlors where newfashioned furniture of the same sort as ours existed  we dont have any parlor said jenny one day our parlor has always been a sort of log cabinlibrary study nursery greenhouse all combined we never have had things like other people  yes and this open fire makes such a dust and this carpet is one that shows every speck of dust it keeps one always on the watch  i wonder why papa never had a study to himself im sure i should think he would like it better than sitting here among us all now theres the great south room off the diningroom if he would only move his things there and have his open fire we could then close up the fireplace and put lounges in the recesses and mamma could have her things in the nurseryand then we should have a parlor fit to be seen  i overheard all this though i pretended not tothe little busy chits supposing me entirely buried in the recesses of a german book over which i was poring  there are certain crises in a mans life when the female element in his household asserts itself in dominant forms that seem to threaten to overwhelm him the fair creatures who in most matters have depended on his judgment evidently look upon him at these seasons as only a forlorn incapable male creature to be cajoled and flattered and persuaded out of his native blindness and absurdity into the fairyland of their wishes  of course mamma said the busy voices men cant understand such things what can men know of housekeeping and how things ought to look papa never goes into company he dont know and dont care how the world is doing and dont see that nobody now is living as we do  aha my little mistresses are you there i thought and i mentally resolved on opposing a great force of what our politicians call backbone to this pretty domestic conspiracy  when you get my writingtable out of this corner my pretty dears id thank you to let me know it  thus spake i in my blindness fool that i was jupiter might as soon keep awake when juno came in best bib and tucker and with the cestus of venus to get him to sleep poor slender might as well hope to get the better of pretty mistress anne page as one of us clumsyfooted men might endeavor to escape from the tangled labyrinth of female wiles  in short in less than a year it was all done without any quarrel any noise any violencedone i scarce knew when or how but with the utmost deference to my wishes the most amiable hopes that i would not put myself out the most sincere protestations that if i liked it better as it was my goddesses would give up and acquiesce in fact i seemed to do it of myself constrained thereto by what the emperor napoleon has so happily called the logic of eventsthat old wellknown logic by which the man who has once said a must say b and he who has said b must say the whole alphabet in a year we had a parlor with two lounges in decorous recesses a fashionable sofa and six chairs and a lookingglass and a grate always shut up and a hole in the floor which kept the parlor warm and great heavy curtains that kept out all the light that was not already excluded by the green shades  it was as proper and orderly a parlor as those of our most fashionable neighbors and when our friends called we took them stumbling into its darkened solitude and opened a faint crack in one of the windowshades and came down in our best clothes and talked with them there our old friends rebelled at this and asked what they had done to be treated so and complained so bitterly that gradually we let them into the secret that there was a great south room which i had taken for my study where we all sat where the old carpet was down where the sun shone in at the great window where my wifes plants flourished and the canarybird sang and my wife had her sofa in the corner and the old brass andirons glistened and the wood fire crackledin short a room to which all the household fairies had emigrated  when they once had found that out it was difficult to get any of them to sit in our parlor i had purposely christened the new room my study that i might stand on my rights as master of ceremonies there though i opened wide arms of welcome to any who chose to come so then it would often come to pass that when we were sitting round the fire in my study of an evening the girls would say  come what do we always stay here for why dont we ever sit in the parlor  and then there would be manifested among guests and family friends a general unwillingness to move  oh hang it girls would arthur say the parlor is well enough all right let it stay as it is and let a fellow stay where he can do as he pleases and feels at home and to this view of the matter would respond divers of the nice young bachelors who were arthurs and toms sworn friends  in fact nobody wanted to stay in our parlor now it was a cold correct accomplished fact the household fairies had left itand when the fairies leave a room nobody ever feels at home in it no pictures curtains no wealth of mirrors no elegance of lounges can in the least make up for their absence they are a capricious little set there are rooms where they will not stay and rooms where they will but no one can ever have a good time without them     ii  homekeeping versus housekeeping   i am a frankhearted man as perhaps you have by this time perceived and you will not therefore be surprised to know that i read my last article on the carpet to my wife and the girls before i sent it to the atlantic and we had a hearty laugh over it together my wife and the girls in fact felt that they could afford to laugh for they had carried their point their reproach among women was taken away they had become like other folks like other folks they had a parlor an undeniable best parlor shut up and darkened with all proper carpets curtains lounges and marbletopped tables too good for human natures daily food and being sustained by this consciousness they cheerfully went on receiving their friends in the study and having good times in the old freeandeasy way for did not everybody know that this room was not their best and if the furniture was oldfashioned and a little the worse for antiquity was it not certain that they had better which they could use if they would  and supposing we wanted to give a party said jenny how nicely our parlor would light up not that we ever do give parties but if we shouldand for a weddingreception you know  i felt the force of the necessity it was evident that the four or five hundred extra which we had expended was no more than such solemn possibilities required  now papa thinks we have been foolish said marianne and he has his own way of making a good story of it but after all i desire to know if people are never to get a new carpet must we keep the old one till it actually wears to tatters  this is a specimen of the reductio ad absurdum which our fair antagonists of the other sex are fond of employing they strip what we say of all delicate shadings and illusory phrases and reduce it to some bare question of fact with which they make a homethrust at us  yes thats it are people never to get a new carpet echoed jenny  my dears i replied it is a fact that to introduce anything new into an apartment hallowed by many home associations where all things have grown old together requires as much care and adroitness as for an architect to restore an arch or niche in a fine old ruin the fault of our carpet was that it was in another style from everything in our room and made everything in it look dilapidated its colors material and air belonged to another manner of life and were a constant plea for alterations and you see it actually drove out and expelled the whole furniture of the room and i am not sure yet that it may not entail on us the necessity of refurnishing the whole house  my dear said my wife in a tone of remonstrance but jane and marianne laughed and colored  confess now said i looking at them have you not had secret designs on the hall and stair carpet  now papa how could you know it i only said to marianne that to have brussels in the parlor and that old meanlooking ingrain carpet in the hall did not seem exactly the thing and in fact you know mamma messrs ketchem  co showed us such a lovely pattern designed to harmonize with our parlor carpet  i know it girls said my wife but you know i said at once that such an expense was not to be thought of  now girls said i let me tell you a story i heard once of a very sensible old new england minister who lived as our country ministers generally do rather near to the bone but still quite contentedly it was in the days when kneebreeches and long stockings were worn and this good man was offered a present of a very nice pair of black silk hose he declined saying he could not afford to wear them  not afford it said the friend why i give them to you  exactly but it will cost me not less than two hundred dollars to take them and i cannot do it  how is that  why in the first place i shall no sooner put them on than my wife will say my dear you must have a new pair of kneebreeches and i shall get them then my wife will say my dear how shabby your coat is you must have a new one and i shall get a new coat then she will say now my dear that hat will never do and then i shall have a new hat and then i shall say my dear it will never do for me to be so fine and you to wear your old gown and so my wife will get a new gown and then the new gown will require a new shawl and a new bonnet all of which we shall not feel the need of if i dont take this pair of silk stockings for as long as we dont see them our old things seem very well suited to each other  the girls laughed at this story and i then added in my most determined manner  but i must warn you girls that i have compromised to the utmost extent of my power and that i intend to plant myself on the old stair carpet in determined resistance i have no mind to be forbidden the use of the front stairs or condemned to get up into my bedroom by a private ladder as i should be immediately if there were a new carpet down  why papa  would it not be so can the sun shine in the parlor now for fear of fading the carpet can we keep a fire there for fear of making dust or use the lounges and sofas for fear of wearing them out if you got a new entry and stair carpet as i said i should have to be at the expense of another staircase to get up to our bedroom  oh no papa said jane innocently there are very pretty druggets now for covering stair carpets so that they can be used without hurting them  put one over the old carpet then said i and our acquaintance will never know but it is a new one  all the female senate laughed at this proposal and said it sounded just like a man  well said i standing up resolutely for my sex a mans ideas on womans matters may be worth some attention i flatter myself that an intelligent educated man doesnt think upon and observe with interest any particular subject for years of his life without gaining some ideas respecting it that are good for something at all events i have written another article for the atlantic which i will read to you  well wait one minute papa till we get our work said the girls who to say the truth always exhibit a flattering interest in anything their papa writes and who have the good taste never to interrupt his readings with any conversations in an undertone on crossstitch and flosssilks as the manner of some is hence the little feminine bustle of arranging all these matters beforehand jane or jenny as i call her in my goodnatured moods put on a fresh clear stick of hickory of that species denominated shagbark which is full of most charming slivers burning with such a clear flame and emitting such a delicious perfume in burning that i would not change it with the millionaire who kept up his fire with cinnamon  you must know my dear mr atlantic and you my confidential friends of the reading public that there is a certain magic or spiritualism which i have the knack of in regard to these mine articles in virtue of which my wife and daughters never hear or see the little personalities respecting them which form parts of my papers by a peculiar arrangement which i have made with the elves of the inkstand and the familiar spirits of the quill a sort of glamour falls on their eyes and ears when i am reading or when they read the parts personal to themselves otherwise their sense of feminine propriety would be shocked at the free way in which they and their most internal affairs are confidentially spoken of between me and you o loving readers  thus in an undertone i tell you that my little jenny as she is zealously and systematically arranging the fire and trimly whisking every untidy particle of ashes from the hearth shows in every movement of her little hands in the cock of her head in the knowing observing glance of her eye and in all her energetic movements that her small person is endued and made up of the very expressed essence of housewifelinessshe is the very attar not of roses but of housekeeping caretaking and thrift and neatness are a nature to her she is as dainty and delicate in her person as a white cat as everlastingly busy as a bee and all the most needful faculties of time weight measure and proportion ought to be fully developed in her skull if there is any truth in phrenology besides all this she has a sort of hardgrained little vein of common sense against which my fanciful conceptions and poetical notions are apt to hit with just a little sharp grating if they are not well put in fact this kind of woman needs carefully to be idealized in the process of education or she will stiffen and dry as she grows old into a veritable household pharisee a sort of domestic tyrant she needs to be trained in artistic values and artistic weights and measures to study all the arts and sciences of the beautiful and then she is charming most useful most needful these little women they have the centripetal force which keeps all the domestic planets from gyrating and frisking in unseemly orbits and properly trained they fill a house with the beauty of order the harmony and consistency of proportion the melody of things moving in time and tune without violating the graceful appearance of ease which art requires  so i had an eye to jennys education in my article which i unfolded and read and which was entitled   homekeeping versus housekeeping  there are many women who know how to keep a house but there are but few that know how to keep a home to keep a house may seem a complicated affair but it is a thing that may be learned it lies in the region of the material in the region of weight measure color and the positive forces of life to keep a home lies not merely in the sphere of all these but it takes in the intellectual the social the spiritual the immortal                                       here the hickory stick broke in two and the two brands fell controversially out and apart on the hearth scattering the ashes and coals and calling for jenny and the hearthbrush your wood fire has this foible that it needs something to be done to it every five minutes but after all these little interruptions of our brightfaced genius are like the piquant sallies of a clever friendthey do not strike us as unreasonable  when jenny had laid down her brush she said  seems to me papa you are beginning to soar into metaphysics  everything in creation is metaphysical in its abstract terms said i with a look calculated to reduce her to a respectful condition everything has a subjective and an objective mode of presentation  there papa goes with subjective and objective said marianne for my part i never can remember which is which  i remember said jenny its what our old nurse used to call internal and outternali always remember by that  come my dears said my wife let your father read so i went on as follows                                       i remember in my bachelor days going with my boon companion bill carberry to look at the house to which he was in a few weeks to introduce his bride bill was a gallant freehearted openhanded fellow the life of our whole set and we felt that natural aversion to losing him that bachelor friends would how could we tell under what strange aspects he might look forth upon us when once he had passed into that undiscovered country of matrimony but bill laughed to scorn our apprehensions  ill tell you what chris he said as he sprang cheerily up the steps and unlocked the door of his future dwelling do you know what i chose this house for because its a sociallooking house look there now he said as he ushered me into a pair of parlorslook at those long south windows the sun lies there nearly all day long see what a capital corner there is for a loungingchair fancy us chris with our books or our paper spread out loose and easy and sophie gliding in and out like a sunbeam im getting poetical you see then did you ever see a better wider airier diningroom what capital suppers and things well have there the nicest timeseverything free and easy you knowjust what ive always wanted a house for i tell you chris you and tom innis shall have latchkeys just like mine and there is a capital chamber there at the head of the stairs so that you can be free to come and go and here nows the libraryfancy this full of books and engravings from the ceiling to the floor here you shall come just as you please and ask no questionsall the same as if it were your own you know  and sophie what will she say to all this  why you know sophie is a prime friend to both of you and a capital girl to keep things going oh sophiell make a house of this you may depend  a day or two after bill dragged me stumbling over boxes and through straw and wrappings to show me the glories of the parlor furniture with which he seemed pleased as a child with a new toy  look here he said see these chairs garnetcolored satin with a pattern on each well the sofas just like them and the curtains to match and the carpets made for the floor with centrepieces and borders i never saw anything more magnificent in my life sophies governor furnishes the house and everything is to be a no 1 and all that you see messrs curtain  collamore are coming to make the rooms up and her mother is busy as a bee getting us in order  why bill said i you are going to be lodged like a prince i hope youll be able to keep it up but law business comes in rather slowly at first old fellow  well you know it isnt the way i should furnish if my capital was the one to cash the bills but then you see sophies people do it and let thema girl doesnt want to come down out of the style she has always lived in  i said nothing but had an oppressive presentiment that social freedom would expire in that house crushed under a weight of upholstery  but there came in due time the wedding and the weddingreception and we all went to see bill in his new house splendidly lighted up and complete from top to toe and everybody said what a lucky fellow he was but that was about the end of it so far as our visiting was concerned the running in and dropping in and keeping latchkeys and making informal calls that had been forespoken seemed about as likely as if bill had lodged in the tuileries  sophie who had always been one of your snapping sparkling busy sort of girls began at once to develop her womanhood and show her principles and was as different from her former self as your careworn mousing old cat is from your rollicking frisky kitten not but that sophie was a good girl she had a capital heart a good true womanly one and was loving and obliging but still she was one of the desperately painstaking conscientious sort of women whose very blood as they grow older is devoured with anxiety and she came of a race of women in whom housekeeping was more than an art or a scienceit was so to speak a religion sophies mother aunts and grandmothers for nameless generations back were known and celebrated housekeepers they might have been genuine descendants of the inhabitants of that hollandic town of broeck celebrated by washington irving where the cows tails are kept tied up with unsullied blue ribbons and the ends of the firewood are painted white he relates how a celebrated preacher visiting this town found it impossible to draw these housewives from their earthly views and employments until he took to preaching on the neatness of the celestial city the unsullied crystal of its walls and the polish of its golden pavement when the faces of all the housewives were set zionward at once  now this solemn and earnest view of housekeeping is onerous enough when a poor girl first enters on the care of a moderately furnished house where the articles are not too expensive to be reasonably renewed as time and use wear them but it is infinitely worse when a cataract of splendid furniture is heaped upon her carewhen splendid crystals cut into her conscience and mirrors reflect her duties and moth and rust stand ever ready to devour and sully in every room and passageway  sophie was solemnly warned and instructed by all the mothers and auntsshe was warned of moths warned of cockroaches warned of flies warned of dust all the articles of furniture had their covers made of cold holland linen in which they looked like bodies laid outeven the curtain tassels had each its little shroudand bundles of receipts and of rites and ceremonies necessary for the preservation and purification and care of all these articles were stuffed into the poor girls head before guiltless of cares as the feathers that floated above it  poor bill found very soon that his house and furniture were to be kept at such an ideal point of perfection that he needed another house to live infor poor fellow he found the difference between having a house and a home it was only a year or two after that my wife and i started our m√©nage on very different principles and bill would often drop in upon us wistfully lingering in the cosy armchair between my writingtable and my wifes sofa and saying with a sigh how confoundedly pleasant things looked thereso pleasant to have a bright open fire and geraniums and roses and birds and all that sort of thing and to dare to stretch out ones legs and move without thinking what one was going to hit sophie is a good girl he would say and wants to have everything right but you see they wont let her theyve loaded her with so many things that have to be kept in lavender that the poor girl is actually getting thin and losing her health and then you see theres aunt zeruah she mounts guard at our house and keeps up such strict police regulations that a fellow cant do a thing the parlors are splendid but so lonesome and dismalnot a ray of sunshine in fact not a ray of light except when a visitor is calling and then they open a crack theyre afraid of flies and yet dear knows they keep every lookingglass and pictureframe muffled to its throat from march to december id like for curiosity to see what a fly would do in our parlors  well said i cant you have some little family sittingroom where you can make yourselves cosy  not a bit of it sophie and aunt zeruah have fixed their throne up in our bedroom and there they sit all day long except at callinghours and then sophie dresses herself and comes down aunt zeruah insists upon it that the way is to put the whole house in order and shut all the blinds and sit in your bedroom and then she says nothing gets out of place and she tells poor sophie the most hocuspocus stories about her grandmothers and aunts who always kept everything in their houses so that they could go and lay their hands on it in the darkest night ill bet they could in our house from end to end it is kept looking as if we had shut it up and gone to europenot a book not a paper not a glove or any trace of a human being in sight the piano shut tight the bookcases shut and locked the engravings locked up all the drawers and closets locked why if i want to take a fellow into the library in the first place it smells like a vault and i have to unbarricade windows and unlock and rummage for half an hour before i can get at anything and i know aunt zeruah is standing tiptoe at the door ready to whip everything back and lock up again a fellow cant be social or take any comfort in showing his books and pictures that way then theres our great light diningroom with its sunny south windowsaunt zeruah got us out of that early in april because she said the flies would speck the frescoes and get into the chinacloset and we have been eating in a little dingy den with a window looking out on a back alley ever since and aunt zeruah says that now the diningroom is always in perfect order and that it is such a care off sophies mind that i ought to be willing to eat down cellar to the end of the chapter now you see chris my position is a delicate one because sophies folks all agree that if there is anything in creation that is ignorant and dreadful and mustnt be allowed his way anywhere its a man why youd think to hear aunt zeruah talk that we were all like bulls in a chinashop ready to toss and tear and rend if we are not kept down cellar and chained and she worries sophie and sophies mother comes in and worries and if i try to get anything done differently sophie cries and says she dont know what to do and so i give it up now if i want to ask a few of our set in sociably to dinner i cant have them where we eat down cellaroh that would never do aunt zeruah and sophies mother and the whole family would think the family honor was forever ruined and undone we mustnt ask them unless we open the diningroom and have out all the best china and get the silver home from the bank and if we do that aunt zeruah doesnt sleep for a week beforehand getting ready for it and for a week after getting things put away and then she tells me that in sophies delicate state it really is abominable for me to increase her cares and so i invite fellows to dine with me at delmonicos and then sophie cries and sophies mother says it doesnt look respectable for a family man to be dining at public places but hang it a fellow wants a home somewhere  my wife soothed the chafed spirit and spake comfortably unto him and told him that he knew there was the old loungingchair always ready for him at our fireside and you know she said our things are all so plain that we are never tempted to mount any guard over them our carpets are nothing and therefore we let the sun fade them and live on the sunshine and the flowers  thats it said bill bitterly carpets fadingthats aunt zeruahs monomania these women think that the great object of houses is to keep out sunshine what a fool i was when i gloated over the prospect of our sunny south windows why man there are three distinct sets of fortifications against the sunshine in those windows first outside blinds then solid folding inside shutters and lastly heavy thick lined damask curtains which loop quite down to the floor whats the use of my pictures i desire to know they are hung in that room and its a regular campaign to get light enough to see what they are  but at all events you can light them up with gas in the evening  in the evening why do you know my wife never wants to sit there in the evening she says she has so much sewing to do that she and aunt zeruah must sit up in the bedroom because it wouldnt do to bring work into the parlor didnt you know that dont you know there mustnt be such a thing as a bit of real work ever seen in a parlor what if some threads should drop on the carpet aunt zeruah would have to open all the fortifications next day and search jerusalem with candles to find them no in the evening the gas is lighted at halfcock you know and if i turn it up and bring in my newspapers and spread about me and pull down some books to read i can feel the nervousness through the chamber floor aunt zeruah looks in at eight and at a quarter past and at half past and at nine and at ten to see if i am done so that she may fold up the papers and put a book on them and lock up the books in their cases nobody ever comes in to spend an evening they used to try it when we were first married but i believe the uninhabited appearance of our parlors discouraged them everybody has stopped coming now and aunt zeruah says it is such a comfort for now the rooms are always in order how poor mrs crowfield lives with her house such a thoroughfare she is sure she cant see sophie never would have strength for it but then to be sure some folks aint as particular as others sophie was brought up in a family of very particular housekeepers  my wife smiled with that calm easy amused smile that has brightened up her sofa for so many years  bill added bitterly  of course i couldnt say that i wished the whole set and system of housekeeping women at thewhatshisnamebecause sophie would have cried for a week and been utterly forlorn and disconsolate i know its not the poor girls fault i try sometimes to reason with her but you cant reason with the whole of your wifes family to the third and fourth generation backwards but im sure its hurting her healthwearing her out why you know sophie used to be the life of our set and now she really seems eaten up with care from morning to night there are so many things in the house that something dreadful is happening to all the while and the servants we get are so clumsy why when i sit with sophie and aunt zeruah its nothing but a constant string of complaints about the girls in the kitchen we keep changing our servants all the time and they break and destroy so that now we are turned out of the use of all our things we not only eat in the basement but all our pretty tablethings are put away and we have all the cracked plates and cracked tumblers and cracked teacups and old buckhandled knives that can be raised out of chaos i could use these things and be merry if i didnt know we had better ones and i cant help wondering whether there isnt some way that our table could be set to look like a gentlemans table but aunt zeruah says that it would cost thousands and what difference does it make as long as nobody sees it but us you see there is no medium in her mind between china and crystal and cracked earthenware well im wondering how all these laws of the medes and persians are going to work when the children come along im in hopes the children will soften off the old folks and make the house more habitable  well children did come a good many of them in time there was tom a broadshouldered chubbycheeked active hilarious son of mischief born in the very image of his father and there was charlie and jim and louisa and sophie the second and frankand a better brighter more joygiving household as far as temperament and nature were concerned never existed  but their whole childhood was a long battlechildren versus furniture and furniture always carried the day the first step of the housekeeping powers was to choose the least agreeable and least available room in the house for the childrens nursery and to fit it up with all the old cracked rickety furniture a neighboring auctionshop could afford and then to keep them in it now everybody knows that to bring up children to be upright true generous and religious needs so much discipline so much restraint and correction and so many rules and regulations that it is all that the parents can carry out and all the children can bear there is only a certain amount of the vital force for parents or children to use in this business of education and one must choose what it shall be used for the aunt zeruah faction chose to use it for keeping the house and furniture and the childrens education proceeded accordingly the rules of right and wrong of which they heard most frequently were all of this sort naughty children were those who went up the front stairs or sat on the best sofa or fingered any of the books in the library or got out one of the best teacups or drank out of the cutglass goblets  why did they ever want to do it if there ever is a forbidden fruit in an eden will not our young adams and eves risk soul and body to find out how it tastes little tom the oldest boy had the courage and enterprise and perseverance of a captain parry or dr kane and he used them all in voyages of discovery to forbidden grounds he stole aunt zeruahs keys unlocked her cupboards and closets saw handled and tasted everything for himself and gloried in his sins  dont you know tom said the nurse to him once if you are so noisy and rude youll disturb your dear mamma shes sick and she may die if youre not careful  will she die says tom gravely  why she may  then said tom turning on his heelthen ill go up the front stairs  as soon as ever the little rebel was old enough he was sent away to boardingschool and then there was never found a time when it was convenient to have him come home again he could not come in the spring for then they were housecleaning nor in the autumn because then they were housecleaning and so he spent his vacations at school unless by good luck a companion who was so fortunate as to have a home invited him there his associations associates habits principles were as little known to his mother as if she had sent him to china aunt zeruah used to congratulate herself on the rest there was at home now he was gone and say she was only living in hopes of the time when charlie and jim would be big enough to send away too and meanwhile charlie and jim turned out of the charmed circle which should hold growing boys to the fathers and mothers side detesting the dingy lonely playroom used to run the city streets and hang round the railroad depots or docks parents may depend upon it that if they do not make an attractive resort for their boys satan will there are places enough kept warm and light and bright and merry where boys can go whose mothers parlors are too fine for them to sit in there are enough to be found to clap them on the back and tell them stories that their mothers must not hear and laugh when they compass with their little piping voices the dreadful litanies of sin and shame in middle life our poor sophie who as a girl was so gay and frolicsome so full of spirits had dried and sharpened into a hardvisaged angular womancareful and troubled about many things and forgetful that one thing is needful one of the boys had run away to sea i believe he has never been heard of as to tom the eldest he ran a career wild and hard enough for a time first at school and then in college and there came a time when he came home in the full might of six feet two and almost broke his mothers heart with his assertions of his home rights and privileges mothers who throw away the key of their childrens hearts and childhood sometimes have a sad retribution as the children never were considered when they were little and helpless so they do not consider when they are strong and powerful tom spread wide desolation among the household gods lounging on the sofas spitting tobacco juice on the carpets scattering books and engravings hither and thither and throwing all the family traditions into wild disorder as he would never have done had not all his childish remembrances of them been embittered by the association of restraint and privation he actually seemed to hate any appearance of luxury or taste or orderhe was a perfect philistine  as for my friend bill from being the pleasantest and most genial of fellows he became a morose misanthropic man dr franklin has a significant proverbsilks and satins put out the kitchen fire silks and satinsmeaning by them the luxuries of housekeepingoften put out not only the parlor fire but that more sacred flame the fire of domestic love it is the greatest possible misery to a man and to his children to be homeless and many a man has a splendid house but no home  papa said jenny you ought to write and tell what are your ideas of keeping a home  girls you have only to think how your mother has brought you up                                       nevertheless i think being so fortunate a husband i might reduce my wifes system to an analysis and my next paper shall be what is a home and how to keep it     iii  what is a home   it is among the sibylline secrets which lie mysteriously between you and me o reader that these papers besides their public aspect have a private one proper to the bosom of mine own particular family they are not merely an ex post facto protest in regard to that carpet and parlor of celebrated memory but they are forthlooking towards other homes that may yet arise near us for among my other confidences you may recollect i stated to you that our marianne was busy in those interesting cares and details which relate to the preparing and ordering of another dwelling  now when any such matter is going on in a family i have observed that every feminine instinct is in a state of fluttering vitalityevery woman old or young is alive with womanliness to the tips of her fingers and it becomes us of the other sex however consciously respected to walk softly and put forth our sentiments discreetly and with due reverence for the mysterious powers that reign in the feminine breast  i had been too well advised to offer one word of direct counsel on a subject where there were such charming voices so able to convict me of absurdity at every turn i had merely so arranged my affairs as to put into the hands of my bankers subject to my wifes order the very modest marriage portion which i could place at my girls disposal and marianne and jenny unused to the handling of money were incessant in their discussions with ever patient mamma as to what was to be done with it i say marianne and jenny for though the case undoubtedly is mariannes yet like everything else in our domestic proceedings it seems to fall somehow or other into jennys hands through the intensity and liveliness of her domesticity of nature little jenny is so bright and wide awake and with so many active plans and fancies touching anything in the housekeeping world that though the youngest sister and second party in this affair a stranger hearkening to the daily discussions might listen a halfhour at a time without finding out that it was not jennys future establishment that was in question marianne is a soft thoughtful quiet girl not given to many words and though when you come fairly at it you will find that like most quiet girls she has a will five times as inflexible as one who talks more yet in all family counsels it is jenny and mamma that do the discussion and her own little wellconsidered yes or no that finally settles each case  i must add to this family tableau the portrait of the excellent bob stephens who figured as future proprietor and householder in these consultations so far as the question of financial possibilities is concerned it is important to remark that bob belongs to the class of young edmunds celebrated by the poet    wisdom and worth were all he had  he is in fact an excellenthearted and clever fellow with a world of agreeable talents a good tenor in a parlor duet a good actor at a charade a lively offhand conversationist well up in all the current literature of the day and what is more in my eyes a wellread lawyer just admitted to the bar and with as fair business prospects as usually fall to the lot of young aspirants in that profession  of course he and my girl are duly and truly in love in all the proper moods and tenses but as to this work they have in hand of being householders managing fuel rent provision taxes gas and water rates they seem to my older eyes about as sagacious as a pair of this years robins nevertheless as the robins of each year do somehow learn to build nests as well as their ancestors there is reason to hope as much for each new pair of human creatures but it is one of the fatalities of our illjointed life that houses are usually furnished for future homes by young people in just this state of blissful ignorance of what they are really wanted for or what is likely to be done with the things in them  now to people of large incomes with ready wealth for the rectification of mistakes it doesnt much matter how the m√©nage is arranged at first they will if they have good sense soon rid themselves of the little infelicities and absurdities of their first arrangements and bring their establishment to meet their more instructed tastes  but to that greater class who have only a modest investment for this first start in domestic life mistakes are far more serious i have known people go on for years groaning under the weight of domestic possessions they did not want and pining in vain for others which they did simply from the fact that all their first purchases were made in this time of blissful ignorance  i had been a quiet auditor to many animated discussions among the young people as to what they wanted and were to get in which the subject of prudence and economy was discussed with quotations of advice thereon given in serious good faith by various friends and relations who lived easily on incomes four or five times larger than our own who can show the ways of elegant economy more perfectly than people thus at ease in their possessions from what serene heights do they instruct the inexperienced beginners ten thousand a year gives one leisure for reflection and elegant leisure enables one to view household economies dispassionately hence the unction with which these gifted daughters of upper air delight to exhort young neophytes  depend upon it my dear aunt sophia easygo had said its always the best economy to get the best things they cost more in the beginning but see how they last these velvet carpets on my floor have been in constant wear for ten years and look how they wear i never have an ingrain carpet in my housenot even on the chambers velvet and brussels cost more to begin with but then they last then i cannot recommend the fashion that is creeping in of having plate instead of solid silver plate wears off and has to be renewed which comes to about the same thing in the end as if you bought all solid at first if i were beginning as marianne is i should just set aside a thousand dollars for my silver and be content with a few plain articles she should buy all her furniture at messrs david  sauls people call them dear but their work will prove cheapest in the end and there is an air and style about their things that can be told anywhere of course you wont go to any extravagant lengthssimplicity is a grace of itself  the waters of the family council were troubled when jenny flaming with enthusiasm brought home the report of this conversation when my wife proceeded with her welltrained business knowledge to compare the prices of the simplest elegancies recommended by aunt easygo with the sum total to be drawn on faces lengthened perceptibly  how are people to go to housekeeping said jenny if everything costs so much  my wife quietly remarked that we had had great comfort in our own homehad entertained unnumbered friends and had only ingrain carpets on our chambers and a threeply on our parlor and she doubted if any guest had ever thought of itif the rooms had been a shade less pleasant and as to durability aunt easygo had renewed her carpets oftener than we such as ours were they had worn longer than hers  but mamma you know everything has gone on since your day everybody must at least approach a certain style nowadays one cant furnish so far behind other people  my wife answered in her quiet way setting forth her doctrine of a plain average to go through the whole establishment placing parlors chambers kitchen pantries and the unseen depths of linenclosets in harmonious relations of just proportion and showed by calm estimates how far the sum given could go towards this result there the limits were inexorable there is nothing so damping to the ardor of youthful economies as the hard positive logic of figures it is so delightful to think in some airy way that the things we like best are the cheapest and that a sort of rigorous duty compels us to get them at any sacrifice there is no remedy for this illusion but to show by the multiplication and addition tables what things are and are not possible my wifes figures met aunt easygos assertions and there was a lull among the high contracting parties for a season nevertheless i could see jenny was secretly uneasy i began to hear of journeys made to far places here and there where expensive articles of luxury were selling at reduced prices now a gilded mirror was discussed and now a velvet carpet which chance had brought down temptingly near the sphere of financial possibility i thought of our parlor and prayed the good fairies to avert the advent of illassorted articles  pray keep common sense uppermost in the girls heads if you can said i to mrs crowfield and dont let the poor little puss spend her money for what she wont care a button about by and by  i shall try she said but you know marianne is inexperienced and jenny is so ardent and active and so confident too then they both i think have the impression that we are a little behind the age to say the truth my dear i think your papers afford a good opportunity of dropping a thought now and then in their minds jenny was asking last night when you were going to write your next paper the girl has a bright active mind and thinks of what she hears  so flattered by the best of flatterers i sat down to write on my theme and that evening at firelight time i read to my little senate as follows   what is a home and how to keep it  i have shown that a dwelling rented or owned by a man in which his own wife keeps house is not always or of course a home what is it then that makes a home all men and women have the indefinite knowledge of what they want and long for when that word is spoken home sighs the disconsolate bachelor tired of boardinghouse fare and buttonless shirts home says the wanderer in foreign lands and thinks of mothers love of wife and sister and child nay the word has in it a higher meaning hallowed by religion and when the christian would express the highest of his hopes for a better life he speaks of his home beyond the grave the word home has in it the elements of love rest permanency and liberty but besides these it has in it the idea of an education by which all that is purest within us is developed into nobler forms fit for a higher life the little child by the homefireside was taken on the masters knee when he would explain to his disciples the mysteries of the kingdom  of so great dignity and worth is this holy and sacred thing that the power to create a home ought to be ranked above all creative faculties the sculptor who brings out the breathing statue from cold marble the painter who warms the canvas into a deathless glow of beauty the architect who built cathedrals and hung the worldlike dome of st peters in midair is not to be compared in sanctity and worthiness to the humblest artist who out of the poor materials afforded by this shifting changing selfish world creates the secure eden of a home  a true home should be called the noblest work of art possible to human creatures inasmuch as it is the very image chosen to represent the last and highest rest of the soul the consummation of mans blessedness  not without reason does the oldest christian church require of those entering on marriage the most solemn review of all the past life the confession and repentance of every sin of thought word and deed and the reception of the holy sacrament for thus the man and woman who approach the august duty of creating a home are reminded of the sanctity and beauty of what they undertake  in this art of homemaking i have set down in my mind certain first principles like the axioms of euclid and the first is  no home is possible without love  all business marriages and marriages of convenience all mere culinary marriages and marriages of mere animal passion make the creation of a true home impossible in the outset love is the jeweled foundation of this new jerusalem descending from god out of heaven and takes as many bright forms as the amethyst topaz and sapphire of that mysterious vision in this range of creative art all things are possible to him that loveth but without love nothing is possible  we hear of most convenient marriages in foreign lands which may better be described as commercial partnerships the money on each side is counted there is enough between the parties to carry on the firm each having the appropriate sum allotted to each no love is pretended but there is great politeness all is so legally and thoroughly arranged that there seems to be nothing left for future quarrels to fasten on monsieur and madame have each their apartments their carriages their servants their income their friends their pursuitsunderstand the solemn vows of marriage to mean simply that they are to treat each other with urbanity in those few situations where the path of life must necessarily bring them together  we are sorry that such an idea of marriage should be gaining foothold in america it has its root in an ignoble view of lifean utter and pagan darkness as to all that man and woman are called to do in that highest relation where they act as one it is a mean and low contrivance on both sides by which all the grand work of homebuilding all the noble pains and heroic toils of home educationthat education where the parents learn more than they teachshall be let us use the expressive yankee idiom shirked  it is a curious fact that in those countries where this system of marriages is the general rule there is no word corresponding to our english word home in many polite languages of europe it would be impossible neatly to translate the sentiment with which we began this essay that a mans house is not always his home  let any one try to render the song sweet home into french and one finds how anglosaxon is the very genius of the word the structure of life in all its relations in countries where marriages are matter of arrangement and not of love excludes the idea of home  how does life run in such countries the girl is recalled from her convent or boardingschool and told that her father has found a husband for her no objection on her part is contemplated or provided for none generally occurs for the child is only too happy to obtain the fine clothes and the liberty which she has been taught come only with marriage be the man handsome or homely interesting or stupid still he brings these  how intolerable such a marriage we say with the close intimacies of anglosaxon life in our minds they are not intolerable because they are provided for by arrangements which make it possible for each to go his or her several way seeing very little of the other the son or daughter which in due time makes its appearance in this m√©nage is sent out to nurse in infancy sent to boardingschool in youth and in maturity portioned and married to repeat the same process for another generation meanwhile father and mother keep a quiet establishment and pursue their several pleasures such is the system  houses built for this kind of life become mere sets of receptionrooms such as are the greater proportion of apartments to let in paris where a hearty english or american family with their children about them could scarcely find room to establish themselves individual character it is true does something to modify this programme there are charming homes in france and italy where warm and noble natures thrown together perhaps by accident or mated by wise paternal choice infuse warmth into the coldness of the system under which they live there are in all states of society some of such domesticity of nature that they will create a home around themselves under any circumstances however barren besides so kindly is human nature that love uninvited before marriage often becomes a guest after and with love always comes a home  my next axiom is  there can be no true home without liberty  the very idea of home is of a retreat where we shall be free to act out personal and individual tastes and peculiarities as we cannot do before the wide world we are to have our meals at what hour we will served in what style suits us our hours of going and coming are to be as we please our favorite haunts are to be here or there our pictures and books so disposed as seems to us good and our whole arrangements the expression so far as our means can compass it of our own personal ideas of what is pleasant and desirable in life this element of liberty if we think of it is the chief charm of home here i can do as i please is the thought with which the tempesttossed earthpilgrim blesses himself or herself turning inward from the crowded ways of the world this thought blesses the man of business as he turns from his days care and crosses the sacred threshold it is as restful to him as the slippers and gown and easychair by the fireside everybody understands him here everybody is well content that he should take his ease in his own way such is the case in the ideal home that such is not always the case in the real home comes often from the mistakes in the housefurnishing much housefurnishing is too fine for liberty  in america there is no such thing as rank and station which impose a sort of prescriptive style on people of certain income the consequence is that all sorts of furniture and belongings which in the old world have a recognized relation to certain possibilities of income and which require certain other accessories to make them in good keeping are thrown in the way of all sorts of people  young people who cannot expect by any reasonable possibility to keep more than two or three servants if they happen to have the means in the outset furnish a house with just such articles as in england would suit an establishment of sixteen we have seen houses in england having two or three housemaids and tables served by a butler and two waiters where the furniture carpets china crystal and silver were in one and the same style with some establishments in america where the family was hard pressed to keep three irish servants  this want of servants is the one thing that must modify everything in american life it is and will long continue to be a leading feature in the life of a country so rich in openings for man and woman that domestic service can be only the steppingstone to something higher nevertheless we americans are great travelers we are sensitive appreciative fond of novelty apt to receive and incorporate into our own life what seems fair and graceful in that of other people our womens wardrobes are made elaborate with the thousand elegancies of french toiletour houses filled with a thousand knickknacks of which our plain ancestors never dreamed cleopatra did not set sail on the nile in more state and beauty than that in which our young american bride is often ushered into her new homeher wardrobe all gossamer lace and quaint frill and crimp and embroidery her house a museum of elegant and costly gewgaws and amid the whole collection of elegancies and fragilities she perhaps the frailest  then comes the tug of war the young wife becomes a mother and while she is retired to her chamber blundering biddy rusts the elegant knives or takes off the ivory handles by soaking in hot water the silver is washed in greasy soapsuds and refreshed now and then with a thump which cocks the nose of the teapot awry or makes the handle assume an air of drunken defiance the fragile china is chipped here and there around its edges with those minute gaps so vexatious to a womans soul the handles fly hither and thither in the wild confusion of biddys washingday hurry when cook wants her to help hang out the clothes meanwhile bridget sweeps the parlor with a hard broom and shakes out showers of ashes from the grate forgetting to cover the damask lounges and they directly look as rusty and timeworn as if they had come from an auctionstore and all together unite in making such havoc of the delicate ruffles and laces of the bridal outfit and baby layette that when the poor young wife comes out of her chamber after her nurse has left her and weakened and embarrassed with the demands of the newcomer begins to look once more into the affairs of her little world she is ready to sink with vexation and discouragement poor little princess her clothes are made as princesses wear them her babys clothes like a young dukes her house furnished like a lords and only bridget and biddy and polly to do the work of cook scullerymaid butler footman laundress nurserymaid housemaid and ladys maid such is the array that in the old country would be deemed necessary to take care of an establishment got up like hers everything in it is too finenot too fine to be pretty not in bad taste in itself but too fine for the situation too fine for comfort or liberty  what ensues in a house so furnished too often ceaseless fretting of the nerves in the wifes despairing conscientious efforts to keep things as they should be there is no freedom in a house where things are too expensive and choice to be freely handled and easily replaced life becomes a series of petty embarrassments and restrictions something is always going wrong and the man finds his fireside oppressivethe various articles of his parlor and table seem like so many tempertraps and springguns menacing explosion and disaster  there may be indeed the most perfect homefeeling the utmost cosiness and restfulness in apartments crusted with gilding carpeted with velvet and upholstered with satin i have seen such where the homelike look and air of free use was as genuine as in a western log cabin but this was in a range of princely income that made all these things as easy to be obtained or replaced as the most ordinary of our domestic furniture but so long as articles must be shrouded from use or used with fear and trembling because their cost is above the general level of our means we had better be without them even though the most lucky of accidents may put their possession in our power  but it is not merely by the effort to maintain too much elegance that the sense of home liberty is banished from a house it is sometimes expelled in another way with all painstaking and conscientious strictness by the worthiest and best of human beings the blessed followers of saint martha have we not known them the deaf worthy creatures up before daylight causing most scrupulous lustrations of every pane of glass and inch of paint in our parlors in consequence whereof every shutter and blind must be kept closed for days to come lest the flies should speck the freshly washed windows and wainscoting dear shade of aunt mehitabel forgive our boldness have we not been driven for days in our youth to read our newspaper in the front veranda in the kitchen out in the barnanywhere in fact where sunshine could be foundbecause there was not a room in the house that was not cleaned shut up and darkened have we not shivered with cold all the glowering gloomy month of may because the august front parlor having undergone the spring cleaning the andirons were snugly tied up in the tissuepaper and an elegant frill of the same material was trembling before the mouth of the once glowing fireplace even so dear soul full of lovingkindness and hospitality as thou wast yet ever making our house seem like a tomb and with what patience wouldst thou sit sewing by a crack in the shutters an inch wide rejoicing in thy immaculate paint and clear glass but was there ever a thing of thy spotless and unsullied belongings which a boy might use how i trembled to touch thy scoured tins that hung in appalling brightness with what awe i asked for a basket to pick strawberries and where in the house could i find a place to eat a piece of gingerbread how like a ruffian a tartar a pirate i always felt when i entered thy domains and how from day to day i wondered at the immeasurable depths of depravity which were always leading me to upset something or break or tear or derange something in thy exquisitely kept premises somehow the impression was burned with overpowering force into my mind that houses and furniture scrubbed floors white curtains bright tins and brasses were the great awful permanent facts of existence and that men and women and particularly children were the meddlesome intruders upon this divine order every trace of whose intermeddling must be scrubbed out and obliterated in the quickest way possible it seemed evident to me that houses would be far more perfect if nobody lived in them at all but that as men had really and absurdly taken to living in them they must live as little as possible my only idea of a house was a place full of traps and pitfalls for boys a deadly temptation to sins which beset one every moment and when i read about a sailors free life on the ocean i felt an untold longing to go forth and be free in like manner  but a truce to these fancies and back again to our essay  if liberty in a house is a comfort to a husband it is a necessity to children when we say liberty we do not mean license we do not mean that master johnny be allowed to handle elegant volumes with breadandbutter fingers or that little miss be suffered to drum on the piano or practice linedrawing with a pin on varnished furniture still it is essential that the family parlors be not too fine for the family to sit intoo fine for the ordinary accidents haps and mishaps of reasonably welltrained children the elegance of the parlor where papa and mamma sit and receive their friends should wear an inviting not a hostile and bristling aspect to little people its beauty and its order gradually form in the little mind a love of beauty and order and the insensible carefulness of regard  nothing is worse for a child than to shut him up in a room which he understands is his because he is disorderlywhere he is expected of course to maintain and keep disorder we have sometimes pitied the poor little victims who show their faces longingly at the doors of elegant parlors and are forthwith collared by the domestic police and consigned to some attic apartment called a playroom where chaos continually reigns it is a mistake to suppose because children derange a wellfurnished apartment that they like confusion order and beauty are always pleasant to them as to grown people and disorder and defacement are painful but they know neither how to create the one nor to prevent the othertheir little lives are a series of experiments often making disorder by aiming at some new form of order yet for all this i am not one of those who feel that in a family everything should bend to the sway of these little people they are the worst of tyrants in such houses still where children are though the fact must not appear to them nothing must be done without a wise thought of them  here as in all high art the old motto is in force ars est celare artem children who are taught too plainly by every anxious look and word of their parents by every family arrangement by the impressment of every chance guest into the service that their parents consider their education as the one important matter in creation are apt to grow up fantastical artificial and hopelessly selfconscious the stars cannot stop in their courses even for our personal improvement and the sooner children learn this the better the great art is to organize a home which shall move on with a strong wide generous movement where the little people shall act themselves out as freely and impulsively as can consist with the comfort of the whole and where the anxious watching and planning for them shall be kept as secret from them as possible  it is well that one of the sunniest and airiest rooms in the house be the childrens nursery it is good philosophy too to furnish it attractively even if the sum expended lower the standard of parlor luxuries it is well that the childrens chamber which is to act constantly on their impressible natures for years should command a better prospect a sunnier aspect than one which serves for a days occupancy of the transient guest it is well that journeys should be made or put off in view of the interests of the children that guests should be invited with a view to their improvement that some intimacies should be chosen and some rejected on their account but it is not well that all this should from infancy be daily talked out before the child and he grow up in egotism from moving in a sphere where everything from first to last is calculated and arranged with reference to himself a little appearance of wholesome neglect combined with real care and never ceasing watchfulness has often seemed to do wonders in this work of setting human beings on their own feet for the life journey  education is the highest object of home but education in the widest senseeducation of the parents no less than of the children in a true home the man and the woman receive through their cares their watchings their hospitality their charity the last and highest finish that earth can put upon them from that they must pass upward for earth can teach them no more  the home education is incomplete unless it include the idea of hospitality and charity hospitality is a biblical and apostolic virtue and not so often recommended in holy writ without reason hospitality is much neglected in america for the very reasons touched upon above we have received our ideas of propriety and elegance of living from old countries where labor is cheap where domestic service is a wellunderstood permanent occupation adopted cheerfully for life and where of course there is such a subdivision of labor as insures great thoroughness in all its branches we are ashamed or afraid to conform honestly and hardily to a state of things purely american we have not yet accomplished what our friend the doctor calls our weaning and learned that dinners with circuitous courses and divers other continental and english refinements well enough in their way cannot be accomplished in families with two or three untrained servants without an expense of care and anxiety which makes them heartwithering to the delicate wife and too severe a trial to occur often america is the land of subdivided fortunes of a general average of wealth and comfort and there ought to be therefore an understanding in the social basis far more simple than in the old world  many families of small fortunes know thisthey are quietly living sobut they have not the steadiness to share their daily average living with a friend a traveler or guest just as the arab shares his tent and the indian his bowl of succotash they cannot have company they say why because it is such a fuss to get out the best things and then to put them back again but why get out the best things why not give your friend what he would like a thousand times bettera bit of your average home life a seat at any time at your board a seat at your fire if he sees that there is a handle off your teacup and that there is a crack across one of your plates he only thinks with a sigh of relief well mine arent the only things that meet with accidents and he feels nearer to you ever after he will let you come to his table and see the cracks in his teacups and you will condole with each other on the transient nature of earthly possessions if it become apparent in these entirely undressed rehearsals that your children are sometimes disorderly and that your cook sometimes overdoes the meat and that your second girl sometimes is awkward in waiting or has forgotten a table propriety your friend only feels ah well other people have trials as well as i and he thinks if you come to see him he shall feel easy with you  having company is an expense that may always be felt but easy daily hospitality the plate always on your table for a friend is an expense that appears on no accounts book and a pleasure that is daily and constant  under this head of hospitality let us suppose a case a traveler comes from england he comes in good faith and good feeling to see how americans live he merely wants to penetrate into the interior of domestic life to see what there is genuinely and peculiarly american about it now here is smilax who is living in a small neat way on his salary from the daily press he remembers hospitalities received from our traveler in england and wants to return them he remembers too with dismay a wellkept establishment the wellserved table the punctilious orderly servants smilax keeps two a cook and chambermaid who divide the functions of his establishment between them what shall he do let him say in a fair manly way my dear fellow im delighted to see you i live in a small way but ill do my best for you and mrs smilax will be delighted come and dine with us so and so and well bring in one or two friends so the man comes and mrs smilax serves up such a dinner as lies within the limits of her knowledge and the capacities of her servants all plain good of its kind unpretending without an attempt to do anything english or frenchto do anything more than if she were furnishing a gala dinner for her father or returned brother show him your house freely just as it is talk to him freely of it just as he in england showed you his larger house and talked to you of his finer things if the man is a true man he will thank you for such unpretending sincere welcome if he is a man of straw then he is not worth wasting mrs smilaxs health and spirits for in unavailing efforts to get up a foreign dinnerparty  a man who has any heart in him values a genuine little bit of home more than anything else you can give him he can get french cooking at a restaurant he can buy expensive wines at firstclass hotels if he wants them but the traveler though ever so rich and ever so wellserved at home is after all nothing but a man as you are and he is craving something that doesnt seem like an hotelsome bit of real genuine heart life perhaps he would like better than anything to show you the last photograph of his wife or to read to you the great roundhand letter of his tenyearold which he has got today he is ready to cry when he thinks of it in this mood he goes to see you hoping for something like home and you first receive him in a parlor opened only on state occasions and that has been circumstantially and exactly furnished as the upholsterer assures you as every other parlor of the kind in the city is furnished you treat him to a dinner got up for the occasion with hired waitersa dinner which it has taken mrs smilax a week to prepare for and will take her a week to recover fromfor which the baby has been snubbed and turned off to his loud indignation and your young fouryearold sent to his aunts your traveler eats your dinner and finds it inferior as a work of art to other dinnersa poor imitation he goes away and criticises you hear of it and resolve never to invite a foreigner again but if you had given him a little of your heart a little home warmth and feelingif you had shown him your baby and let him romp with your fouryearold and eat a genuine dinner with youwould he have been false to that not so likely he wanted something real and humanyou gave him a bad dress rehearsal and dress rehearsals always provoke criticism  besides hospitality there is in a true home a mission of charity it is a just law which regulates the possession of great or beautiful works of art in the old world that they shall in some sense be considered the property of all who can appreciate fine grounds have hours when the public may be admitted pictures and statues may be shown to visitors and this is a noble charity in the same manner the fortunate individuals who have achieved the greatest of all human works of art should employ it as a sacred charity how many morally wearied wandering disabled are healed and comforted by the warmth of a true home when a mother has sent her son to the temptations of a distant city what news is so glad to her heart as that he has found some quiet family where he visits often and is made to feel at home how many young men have good women saved from temptation and shipwreck by drawing them often to the sheltered corner by the fireside the poor artist the wandering genius who has lost his way in this world and stumbles like a child among hard realities the many men and women who while they have houses have no homes see from afar in their distant bleak life journey the light of a true home fire and if made welcome there warm their stiffened limbs and go forth stronger to their pilgrimage let those who have accomplished this beautiful and perfect work of divine art be liberal of its influence let them not seek to bolt the doors and draw the curtains for they know not and will never know till the future life of the good they may do by the ministration of this great charity of home  we have heard much lately of the restricted sphere of woman we have been told how many spirits among women are of a wider stronger more heroic mould than befits the mere routine of housekeeping it may be true that there are many women far too great too wise too high for mere housekeeping but where is the woman in any way too great or too high or too wise to spend herself in creating a home what can any woman make diviner higher better from such homes go forth all heroisms all inspirations all great deeds such mothers and such homes have made the heroes and martyrs faithful unto death who have given their precious lives to us during these three years of our agony  homes are the work of art peculiar to the genius of woman man helps in this work but woman leads the hive is always in confusion without the queen bee but what a woman must she be who does this work perfectly she comprehends all she balances and arranges all all different tastes and temperaments find in her their rest and she can unite at one hearthstone the most discordant elements in her is order yet an order ever veiled and concealed by indulgence none are checked reproved abridged of privileges by her love of system for she knows that order was made for the family and not the family for order quietly she takes on herself what all others refuse or overlook what the unwary disarrange she silently rectifies everybody in her sphere breathes easy feels free and the driest twig begins in her sunshine to put out buds and blossoms so quiet are her operations and movements that none sees that it is she who holds all things in harmony only alas when she is gone how many things suddenly appear disordered inharmonious neglected all these threads have been smilingly held in her weak hand alas if that is no longer there  can any woman be such a housekeeper without inspiration no in the words of the old church service her soul must ever have affiance in god the new jerusalem of a perfect home cometh down from god out of heaven but to make such a home is ambition high and worthy enough for any woman be she what she may  one thing more right on the threshold of all perfection lies the cross to be taken up no one can go over or around that cross in science or in art without labor and selfdenial neither raphael nor michel angelo nor newton was made perfect nor can man or woman create a true home who is not willing in the outset to embrace life heroically to encounter labor and sacrifice only to such shall this divinest power be given to create on earth that which is the nearest image of heaven     iv  the economy of the beautiful   talking to you in this way once a month o my confidential reader there seems to be danger as in all intervals of friendship that we shall not readily be able to take up our strain of conversation just where we left off suffer me therefore to remind you that the month past left us seated at the fireside just as we had finished reading of what a home was and how to make one  the fire had burned low and great solid hickory coals were winking dreamily at us from out their fluffy coats of white ashesjust as if some household sprite there were opening now one eye and then the other and looking in a sleepy comfortable way at us  the close of my piece about the good house mother had seemed to tell on my little audience marianne had nestled close to her mother and laid her head on her knee and though jenny sat up straight as a pin yet her ever busy knitting was dropped in her lap and i saw the glint of a tear in her quick sparkling eyeyes actually a little bright bead fell upon her work whereupon she started up actively and declared that the fire wanted just one more stick to make a blaze before bedtime and then there was such a raking among the coals such an adjusting of the andirons such vigorous arrangement of the wood and such a brisk whisking of the hearthbrush that it was evident jenny had something on her mind when all was done she sat down again and looked straight into the blaze which went dancing and crackling up casting glances and flecks of light on our pictures and books and making all the old familiar furniture seem full of life and motion  i think thats a good piece she said decisively i think those are things that should be thought about  now jenny was the youngest of our flock and therefore in a certain way regarded by my wife and me as perennially the baby and these little oldfashioned decisive ways of announcing her opinions seemed so much a part of her nature so peculiarly jennyish as i used to say that my wife and i only exchanged amused glances over her head when they occurred  in a general way jenny standing in the full orb of her feminine instincts like diana in the moon rather looked down on all masculine views of womens matters as tolerabiles ineptioe but towards her papa she had gracious turns of being patronizing to the last degree and one of these turns was evidently at its floodtide as she proceeded to say  i think papa is rightthat keeping house and having a home and all that is a very serious thing and that people go into it with very little thought about it i really think those things papa has been saying there ought to be thought about  papa said marianne i wish you would tell me exactly how you would spend that money you gave me for housefurnishing i should like just your views  precisely said jenny with eagerness because it is just as papa saysa sensible man who has thought and had experience cant help having some ideas even about womens affairs that are worth attending to i think so decidedly  i acknowledged the compliment for my sex and myself with my best bow  but then papa said marianne i cant help feeling sorry that one cant live in such a way as to have beautiful things around one im sorry they must cost so much and take so much care for i am made so that i really want them i do so like to see pretty things i do like rich carpets and elegant carved furniture and fine china and cutglass and silver i cant bear mean commonlooking rooms i should so like to have my house look beautiful  your house ought not to look mean and commonyour house ought to look beautiful i replied it would be a sin and a shame to have it otherwise no house ought to be fitted up for a future home without a strong and a leading reference to beauty in all its arrangements if i were a greek i should say that the first household libation should be made to beauty but being an oldfashioned christian i would say that he who prepares a home with no eye to beauty neglects the example of the great father who has filled our earth home with such elaborate ornament  but then papa theres the money said jenny shaking her little head wisely you men dont think of that you want us girls for instance to be patterns of economy but we must always be wearing fresh nice things you abhor soiled gloves and worn shoes and yet how is all this to be done without money and its just so in housekeeping you sit in your armchairs and conjure up visions of all sorts of impossible things to be done but when mamma there takes out that little accountbook and figures away on the cost of things where do the visions go  you are mistaken my little dear and you talk just like a womanthis was my only way of revenging myself that is to say you jump to conclusions without sufficient knowledge i maintain that in housefurnishing as well as womanfurnishing theres nothing so economical as beauty  theres one of papas paradoxes said jenny  yes said i that is my thesis which i shall nail up over the mantelpiece there as luther nailed his to the church door it is time to rake up the fire now but tomorrow night i will give you a paper on the economy of the beautiful                                       come now we are to have papas paradox said jenny as soon as the teathings had been carried out  entre nous i must tell you that insensibly we had fallen into the habit of taking our tea by my study fire tea you know is a mere nothing in itself its only merit being its social and poetic associations its warmth and fragrance and the more socially and informally it can be dispensed the more in keeping with its airy and cheerful nature  our circle was enlightened this evening by the cheery visage of bob stephens seated as of right close to mariannes workbasket  you see bob said jenny papa has undertaken to prove that the most beautiful things are always the cheapest  im glad to hear that said bob for theres a carved antique bookcase and studytable that i have my eye on and if this can in any way be made to appear  oh it wont be made to appear said jenny settling herself at her knitting only in some transcendental poetic sense such as papa can always make out papa is more than half a poet and his truths turn out to be figures of rhetoric when one comes to apply them to matters of fact  now miss jenny please remember my subject and thesis i repliedthat in housefurnishing there is nothing so economical as beauty and i will make it good against all comers not by figures of rhetoric but by figures of arithmetic i am going to be very matteroffact and commonplace in my details and keep ever in view the addition table i will instance a case which has occurred under my own observation   the economy of the beautiful  two of the houses lately built on the new land in boston were bought by two friends philip and john philip had plenty of money and paid the cash down for his house without feeling the slightest vacancy in his pocket john who was an active rising young man just entering on a flourishing business had expended all his moderate savings for years in the purchase of his dwelling and still had a mortgage remaining which he hoped to clear off by his future successes philip begins the work of furnishing as people do with whom money is abundant and who have simply to go from shop to shop and order all that suits their fancy and is considered the thing in good society john begins to furnish with very little money he has a wife and two little ones and he wisely deems that to insure to them a wellbuilt house in an open airy situation with conveniences for warming bathing and healthy living is a wise beginning in life but it leaves him little or nothing beyond  behold then philip and his wife well pleased going the rounds of shops and stores in fitting up their new dwelling and let us follow step by step to begin with the wallpaper imagine a front and back parlor with foldingdoors with two south windows on the front and two looking on a back court after the general manner of city houses we will suppose they require about thirty rolls of wallpaper philip buys the heaviest french velvet with gildings and traceries at four dollars a roll this by the time it has been put on with gold mouldings according to the most established taste of the best paperhangers will bring the wallpaper of the two rooms to a figure something like two hundred dollars now they proceed to the carpet stores and there are thrown at their feet by obsequious clerks velvets and axminsters with flowery convolutions and medallion centres as if the flower gardens of the tropics were whirling in waltzes with graceful lines of arabesqueroses callas lilies knotted wreathed twined with blue and crimson and golden ribbons dazzling marvels of color and tracery there is no restraint in pricefour or six dollars a yard it is all the same to themand soon a magic flower garden blooms on the floors at a cost of five hundred dollars a pair of elegant rugs at fifty dollars apiece complete the inventory and bring our rooms to the mark of eight hundred dollars for papering and carpeting alone now come the great mantelmirrors for four hundred more and our rooms progress then comes the upholsterer and measures our four windows that he may skillfully barricade them from air and sunshine the fortifications against heaven thus prepared cost in the shape of damask cord tassels shades laces and cornices about two hundred dollars per window to be sure they make the rooms close and sombre as the grave but they are of the most splendid stuffs and if the sun would only reflect he would see himself how foolish it was for him to try to force himself into a window guarded by his betters if there is anything cheap and plebeian it is sunshine and fresh air behold us then with our two rooms papered carpeted and curtained for two thousand dollars and now are to be put in them sofas lounges √©tag√®res centretables screens chairs of every pattern and device for which it is but moderate to allow a thousand more we have now two parlors furnished at an outlay of three thousand dollars without a single picture a single article of statuary a single object of art of any kind and without any light to see them by if they were there we must say for our boston upholsterers and furnituremakers that such good taste generally reigns in their establishments that rooms furnished at haphazard from them cannot fail of a certain air of good taste so far as the individual things are concerned but the different articles we have supposed having been ordered without reference to one another or the rooms have when brought together no unity of effect and the general result is scattering and confused if asked how philips parlors look your reply is oh the usual way of such parlorseverything that such people usually getmedallion carpets carved furniture great mirrors bronze mantel ornaments and so on the only impression a stranger receives while waiting in the dim twilight of these rooms is that their owner is rich and able to get good handsome things such as all other rich people get  now our friend john as often happens in america is moving in the same social circle with philip visiting the same peoplehis house is the twin of the one philip has been furnishingand how shall he with a few hundred dollars make his rooms even presentable beside those which philip has fitted up elegantly at three thousand  now for the economy of beauty our friend must make his prayer to the gracesfor if they cannot save him nobody can one thing john has to begin with that rare gift to man a wife with the magic cestus of venusnot around her waist but if such a thing could be in her fingerends all that she touches falls at once into harmony and proportion her eye for color and form is intuitive let her arrange a garret with nothing but boxes barrels and castoff furniture in it and ten to one she makes it seem the most attractive place in the house it is a veritable gift of good fa√´rie this tact of beautifying and arranging that some women have and on the present occasion it has a real material value that can be estimated in dollars and cents come with us and you can see the pair taking their survey of the yet unfurnished parlors as busy and happy as a couple of bluebirds picking up the first sticks and straws for their nest  there are two sunny windows to begin with says the good fairy with an appreciative glance that insures flowers all winter  yes says john i never would look at a house without a good sunny exposure sunshine is the best ornament of a house and worth an extra thousand a year  now for our wallpaper says she have you looked at wallpapers john  yes we shall get very pretty ones for thirtyseven cents a roll all you want of a paper you know is to make a groundtint to throw out your pictures and other matters and to reflect a pleasant tone of light  well john you know uncle james says that a stone color is the best but i cant bear those cold blue grays  nor i says john if we must have gray let it at least be a gray suffused with gold or rose color such as you see at evening in the clouds  so i think responds she but better i should like a paper with a tone of buffsomething that produces warm yellowish reflections and will almost make you think the sun is shining in cold gray weather and then there is nothing that lights up so cheerfully in the evening in short john i think the color of a zafferano rose will be just about the shade we want  well i can find that in good american paper as i said before at from thirtyseven to forty cents a roll then our bordering theres an important question for that must determine the carpet the chairs and everything else now what shall be the groundtint of our rooms  there are only two to choose between says the ladygreen and maroon which is the best for the picture  i think says john looking above the mantelpiece as if he saw a picture therei think a border of maroon velvet with maroon furniture is the best for the picture  i think so too said she and then we will have that lovely maroon and crimson carpet that i saw at lowes it is an ingrain to be sure but has a brussels pattern a mossy mixed figure of different shades of crimson it has a good warm strong color and when i come to cover the lounges and our two old armchairs with maroon rep it will make such a pretty effect  yes said john and then you know our picture is so bright it will light up the whole everything depends on the picture  now as to the picture it has a story which must be told john having been all his life a worshiper and adorer of beauty and beautiful things had never passed to or from his business without stopping at the printshop windows and seeing a little of what was there  on one of these occasions he was smitten to the heart with the beauty of an autumn landscape where the red maples and sumachs the purple and crimson oaks all stood swathed and harmonized together in the hazy indian summer atmosphere there was a great yellow chestnut tree on a distant hill which stood out so naturally that john instinctively felt his fingers tingling for a basket and his heels alive with a desire to bound over on to the rustling hillside and pick up the glossy brown nuts everything was there of autumn even to the goldenrod and purple asters and scarlet creepers in the foreground  john went in and inquired it was by an unknown french artist without name or patrons who had just come to our shores to study our scenery and this was the first picture he had exposed for sale john had just been paid a quarters salary he bethought him of boardbill and washerwoman sighed and faintly offered fifty dollars  to his surprise he was taken up at once and the picture became his john thought himself dreaming he examined his treasure over and over and felt sure that it was the work of no amateur beginner but of a trained hand and a true artist soul so he found his way to the studio of the stranger and apologized for having got such a gem for so much less than its worth it was all i could give though he said and one who paid four times as much could not value it more and so john took one and another of his friends with longer purses than his own to the studio of the modest stranger and now his pieces command their full worth in the market and he works with orders far ahead of his ability to execute giving to the canvas the trails of american scenery as appreciated and felt by the subtile delicacy of the french mindour rural summer views our autumn glories and the dreamy misty delicacy of our snowy winter landscapes whoso would know the truth of the same let him inquire for the modest studio of morvillier at maiden scarce a bowshot from our boston  this picture had always been the ruling star of johns house his main dependence for brightening up his bachelor apartments and when he came to the task of furbishing those same rooms for a fair occupant the picture was still his mine of gold for a picture painted by a real artist who studies nature minutely and conscientiously has something of the charm of the good mother herselfsomething of her faculty of putting on different aspects under different lights john and his wife had studied their picture at all hours of the day they had seen how it looked when the morning sun came aslant the scarlet maples and made a golden shimmer over the blue mountains how it looked toned down in the cool shadows of afternoon and how it warmed up in the sunset and died off mysteriously into the twilight and now when larger parlors were to be furnished the picture was still the tower of strength the rallyingpoint of their hopes  do you know john said the wife hesitating i am really in doubt whether we shall not have to get at least a few new chairs and a sofa for our parlors they are putting in such splendid things at the other door that i am positively ashamed of ours the fact is they look almost disreputablelike a heap of rubbish  well said john laughing i dont suppose all together sent to an auctionroom would bring us fifty dollars and yet such as they are they answer the place of better things for us and the fact is mary the hard impassable barrier in the case is that there really is no money to get any more  ah well then if there isnt we must see what we can do with these and summon all the good fairies to our aid said mary theres your little cabinetmaker john will look over the things and furbish them up theres that broken arm of the chair must be mended and everything revarnished then i have found such a lovely rep of just the richest shade of maroon inclining to crimson and when we come to cover the lounges and armchairs and sofas and ottomans all alike you know they will be quite another thing  trust you for that mary by the bye ive found a nice little woman who has worked on upholstery who will come in by the day and be the hands that shall execute the decrees of your taste  yes i am sure we shall get on capitally do you know that im almost glad we cant get new things its a sort of enterprise to see what we can do with old ones  now you see mary said john seating himself on a limecask which the plasterers had left and taking out his memorandumbookyou see ive calculated this thing all over ive found a way by which i can make our rooms beautiful and attractive without a cent expended on new furniture  well lets hear  well my way is short and simple we must put things into our rooms that people will look at so that they will forget to look at the furniture and never once trouble their heads about it people never look at furniture so long as there is anything else to look at just as napoleon when away on one of his expeditions being told that the french populace were getting disaffected wrote back gild the dome des invalides and so they gilded it and the people looking at that forgot everything else  but im not clear yet said mary what is coming of this rhetoric  well then mary ill tell you a suit of new carved blackwalnut furniture severe in taste and perfect in style such as i should choose at david  sauls could not be got under three hundred dollars and i havent the three hundred to give what then shall we do we must fall back on our resources we must look over our treasures we have our proof cast of the great glorious head of the venus di milo we have those six beautiful photographs of rome that brown brought to us we have the great german lithograph of the san sisto mother and child and we have the two angel heads from the same we have that lovely golden twilight sketch of heades we have some sea photographs of bradfords we have an original penandink sketch by billings and then as before we have our picture what has been the use of our watching at the gates and waiting at the doors of beauty all our lives if she hasnt thrown us out a crust now and then so that we might have it for time of need now you see mary we must make the toilet of our rooms just as a pretty woman makes hers when money runs low and she sorts and freshens her ribbons and matches them to her hair and eyes and with a bow here and a bit of fringe there and a button somewhere else dazzles us into thinking that she has an infinity of beautiful attire our rooms are new and pretty of themselves to begin with the tint of the paper and the rich coloring of the border corresponding with the furniture and carpets will make them seem prettier and now for arrangement take this front room i propose to fill those two recesses each side of the fireplace with my books in their plain pine cases just breasthigh from the floor they are stained a good dark color and nobody need stick a pin in them to find out that they are not rosewood the top of these shelves on either side to be covered with the same stuff as the furniture finished with a crimson fringe on top of the shelves on one side of the fireplace i shall set our noble venus di milo and i shall buy at ciccis the lovely clytie and put it the other side then i shall get of williams  everett two of their chromo lithographs which give you all the style and charm of the best english watercolor school i will have the lovely bay of amalfi over my venus because she came from those suns and skies of southern italy and i will hang lake como over my clytie then in the middle over the fireplace shall be our picture over each door shall hang one of the lithographed angel heads of the san sisto to watch our going out and coming in and the glorious mother and child shall hang opposite the venus di milo to show how greek and christian unite in giving the noblest type to womanhood and then when we have all our sketches and lithographs framed and hung here and there and your flowers blooming as they always do and your ivies wandering and rambling as they used to and hanging in the most graceful ways and places and all those little shells and ferns and vases which you are always conjuring with tastefully arranged ill venture to say that our rooms will be not only pleasant but beautiful and that people will oftener say how beautiful when they enter than if we spent three times the money on new furniture  in the course of a year after this conversation one and another of my acquaintances were often heard speaking of john mortons house such beautiful roomsso charmingly furnishedyou must go and see them what does make them so much pleasanter than those rooms in the other house which have everything in them that money can buy so said the folk for nine people out of ten only feel the effect of a room and never analyze the causes from which it flows they know that certain rooms seem dull and heavy and confused but they dont know why that certain others seem cheerful airy and beautiful but they know not why the first exclamation on entering johns parlors was so often how beautiful that it became rather a byword in the family estimated by their mere money value the articles in the rooms were of very trifling worth but as they stood arranged and combined they had all the effect of a lovely picture although the statuary was only plaster and the photographs and lithographs such as were all within the compass of limited means yet every one of them was a good thing of its own kind or a good reminder of some of the greatest works of art a good plaster cast is a daguerreotype so to speak of a great statue though it may be bought for five or six dollars while its original is not to be had for any namable sum a chromo lithograph of the best sort gives all the style and manner and effect of turner or stanfield or any of the best of modern artists though you buy it for five or ten dollars and though the original would command a thousand guineas the lithographs from raphaels immortal picture give you the results of a whole age of artistic culture in a form within the compass of very humble means there is now selling for five dollars at williams  everetts a photograph of cheneys crayon drawing of the san sisto madonna and child which has the very spirit of the glorious original such a picture hung against the wall of a childs room would train its eye from infancy and yet how many will freely spend five dollars in embroidery on its dress that say they cannot afford works of art  there was one advantage which john and his wife found in the way in which they furnished their house that i have hinted at before it gave freedom to their children though their rooms were beautiful it was not with the tantalizing beauty of expensive and frail knickknacks pictures hung against the wall and statuary safely lodged on brackets speak constantly to the childish eye but are out of the reach of childish fingers and are not upset by childish romps they are not like china and crystal liable to be used and abused by servants they do not wear out they are not spoiled by dust nor consumed by moths the beauty once there is always there though the mother be ill and in her chamber she has no fears that she shall find it all wrecked and shattered and this style of beauty inexpensive as it is compared with luxurious furniture is a means of cultivation no child is ever stimulated to draw or to read by an axminster carpet or a carved centretable but a room surrounded with photographs and pictures and fine casts suggests a thousand inquiries stimulates the little eye and hand the child is found with its pencil drawing or he asks for a book on venice or wants to hear the history of the roman forum  but i have made my article too long i will write another on the moral and intellectual effects of housefurnishing  i have proved my point miss jenny have i not in housefurnishing nothing is more economical than beauty  yes papa said jenny i give it up     v  raking up the fire   we have a custom at our house which we call raking up the fire that is to say the last half hour before bedtime we draw in shoulder to shoulder around the last brands and embers of our hearth which we prick up and brighten and dispose for a few farewell flickers and glimmers this is a grand time for discussion then we talk over parties if the young people have been out of an eveninga book if we have been reading one we discuss and analyze charactersgive our views on all subjects √¶sthetic theological and scientific in a way most wonderful to hear and in fact we sometimes get so engaged in our discussions that every spark of the fire burns out and we begin to feel ourselves shivering around the shoulders before we can remember that it is bedtime  so after the reading of my last article we had a rakingup talkto wit jenny marianne and i with bob stephens my wife still busy at her workbasket sat at the table a little behind us jenny of course opened the ball in her usual incisive manner  but now papa after all you say in your piece there i cannot help feeling that if i had the taste and the money too it would be better than the taste alone with no money i like the nice arrangements and the books and the drawings but i think all these would appear better still with really elegant furniture  who doubts that said i give me a large tub of gold coin to dip into and the furnishing and beautifying of a house is a simple affair the same taste that could make beauty out of cents and dimes could make it more abundantly out of dollars and eagles but i have been speaking for those who have not and cannot get riches and who wish to have agreeable houses and i begin in the outset by saying that beauty is a thing to be respected reverenced and devoutly cared for and then i say that beauty is cheapnay to put it so that the shrewdest yankee will understand itbeauty is the cheapest thing you can have because in many ways it is a substitute for expense a few vases of flowers in a room a few blooming wellkept plants a few prints framed in fanciful frames of cheap domestic fabric a statuette a bracket an engraving a pencilsketchabove all a few choice booksall these arranged by a woman who has the gift in her fingerends often produce such an illusion on the minds eye that one goes away without once having noticed that the cushion of the armchair was worn out and that some veneering had fallen off the centretable  i have a friend a schoolmistress who lives in a poor little cottage enough which let alone of the graces might seem mean and sordid but a few flowerseeds and a little weeding in the spring make it all summer an object which everybody stops to look at her √¶sthetic soul was at first greatly tried with the waterbarrel which stood under the eaves spouta most necessary evil since only thus could her scanty supply of soft water for domestic purposes be secured one of the graces however suggested to her a happy thought she planted a row of morningglories round the bottom of her barrel and drove a row of tacks around the top and strung her waterbutt with twine like a great harpsichord a few weeks covered the twine with blossoming plants which every morning were a mass of manycolored airy blooms waving in graceful sprays and looking at themselves in the water the waterbarrel in fact became a celebrated stroke of ornamental gardening which the neighbors came to look at  well but said jenny everybody hasnt mammas faculty with flowers flowers will grow for some people and for some they wont nobody can see what mamma does so very much but her plants always look fresh and thriving and healthyher things blossom just when she wants them and do anything else she wishes them to and there are other people that fume and fuss and try and their things wont do anything at all theres aunt easygo has plant after plant brought from the greenhouse and hangingbaskets and all sorts of things but her plants grow yellow and drop their leaves and her hangingbaskets get dusty and povertystricken while mammas go on flourishing as heart could desire  i can tell you what your mother puts into her plants said ijust what she has put into her children and all her other homethingsher heart she loves them she lives in them she has in herself a plantlife and a plantsympathy she feels for them as if she herself were a plant she anticipates their wantsalways remembers them without an effort and so the care flows to them daily and hourly she hardly knows when she does the things that make them grow but she gives them a minute a hundred times a day she moves this nearer the glassdraws that backdetects some thief of a worm on onedigs at the root of another to see why it droopswashes these leaves and sprinkles thosewaters and refrains from watering all with the habitual care of love your mother herself doesnt know why her plants grow it takes a philosopher and a writer for the atlantic to tell her what the cause is  here i saw my wife laughing over her workbasket as she answered  girls one of these days i will write an article for the atlantic that your papa need not have all the say to himself however i believe he has hit the nail on the head this time  of course he has said marianne but mamma i am afraid to begin to depend much on plants for the beauty of my rooms for fear i should not have your giftand of all forlorn and hopeless things in a room illkept plants are the most so  i would not recommend said i a young housekeeper just beginning to rest much for her home ornament on plantkeeping unless she has an experience of her own love and talent in this line which makes her sure of success for plants will not thrive if they are forgotten or overlooked and only tended in occasional intervals and as marianne says neglected plants are the most forlorn of all things  but papa said marianne anxiously there in those patent parlors of johns that you wrote of flowers acted a great part  the charm of those parlors of johns may be chemically analyzed i said in the first place there is sunshine a thing that always affects the human nerves of happiness why else is it that people are always so glad to see the sun after a long storm why are bright days matters of such congratulation sunshine fills a house with a thousand beautiful and fanciful effects of light and shadewith soft luminous reflected radiances that give picturesque effects to the pictures books statuettes of an interior john happily had no money to buy brocatelle curtains and besides this he loved sunshine too much to buy them if he could he had been enough with artists to know that heavy damask curtains darken precisely that part of the window where the light proper for pictures and statuary should come in namely the upper part the fashionable system of curtains lights only the legs of the chairs and the carpets and leaves all the upper portion of the room in shadow johns windows have shades which can at pleasure be drawn down from the top or up from the bottom so that the best light to be had may always be arranged for his little interior  well papa said marianne in your chemical analysis of johns rooms what is the next thing to the sunshine  the next said i is harmony of color the wallpaper the furniture the carpets are of tints that harmonize with one another this is a grace in rooms always and one often neglected the french have an expressive phrase with reference to articles which are out of accordthey say that they swear at each other i have been in rooms where i seemed to hear the wallpaper swearing at the carpet and the carpet swearing back at the wallpaper and each article of furniture swearing at the rest these appointments may all of them be of the most expensive kind but with such disharmony no arrangement can ever produce anything but a vulgar and disagreeable effect on the other hand i have been in rooms where all the material was cheap and the furniture poor but where from some instinctive knowledge of the reciprocal effect of colors everything was harmonious and produced a sense of elegance  i recollect once traveling on a western canal through a long stretch of wilderness and stopping to spend the night at an obscure settlement of a dozen houses we were directed to lodgings in a common frame house at a little distance where it seemed the only hotel was kept when we entered the parlor we were struck with utter amazement at its prettiness which affected us before we began to ask ourselves how it came to be pretty it was in fact only one of the miracles of harmonious color working with very simple materials some woman had been busy there who had both eyes and fingers the sofa the common wooden rockingchairs and some ottomans probably made of old soapboxes were all covered with american nankeen of a soft yellowishbrown with a bordering of blue print the windowshades the tablecover and the pianocloth all repeated the same colors in the same cheap material a simple straw matting was laid over the floor and with a few books a vase of flowers and one or two prints the room had a homelike and even elegant air that struck us all the more forcibly from its contrast with the usual tawdry slovenly style of such parlors  the means used for getting up this effect were the most inexpensive possiblesimply the following out in cheap material a law of uniformity and harmony which always will produce beauty in the same manner i have seen a room furnished whose effect was really gorgeous in color where the only materials used were turkeyred cotton and a simple ingrain carpet of corresponding color  now you girls have been busy lately in schemes for buying a velvet carpet for the new parlor that is to be and the only points that have seemed to weigh in the council were that it was velvet that it was cheaper than velvets usually are and that it was a genteel pattern  now papa said jenny what ears you have we thought you were reading all the time  i see what you are going to say said marianne you think that we have not once mentioned the consideration which should determine the carpet whether it will harmonize with our other things but you see papa we dont really know what our other things are to be  yes said jenny and aunt easygo said it was an unusually good chance to get a velvet carpet  yet good as the chance is it costs just twice as much as an ingrain  yes papa it does  and you are not sure that the effect of it after you get it down will be as good as a wellchosen ingrain one  thats true said marianne reflectively  but then papa said jenny aunt easygo said she never heard of such a bargain only think two dollars a yard for a velvet  and why is it two dollars a yard is the man a personal friend that he wishes to make you a present of a dollar on the yard or is there some reason why it is undesirable said i  well you know papa he said those large patterns were not so salable  to tell the truth said marianne i never did like the pattern exactly as to uniformity of tint it might match with anything for theres every color of the rainbow in it  you see papa its a gorgeous flowerpattern said jenny  well marianne how many yards of this wonderfully cheap carpet do you want  we want sixty yards for both rooms said jenny always primed with statistics  that will be a hundred and twenty dollars i said  yes said jenny and we went over the figures together and thought we could make it out by economizing in other things aunt easygo said that the carpet was half the battlethat it gave the air to everything else  well marianne if you want a mans advice in the case mine is at your service  that is just what i want papa  well then my dear choose your wallpapers and borderings and when they are up choose an ingrain carpet to harmonize with them and adapt your furniture to the same idea the sixty dollars that you save on your carpet spend on engravings chromo lithographs or photographs of some good works of art to adorn your walls  papa ill do it said marianne  my little dear said i your papa may seem to be a sleepy old bookworm yet he has his eyes open do you think i dont know why my girls have the credit of being the bestdressed girls on the street  oh papa cried out both girls in a breath  fact that said bob with energy pulling at his mustache everybody talks about your dress and wonders how you make it out  well said i i presume you do not go into a shop and buy a yard of ribbon because it is selling at half price and put it on without considering complexion eyes hair and shade of the dress do you  of course we dont chimed in the duo with energy  of course you dont havent i seen you mincing downstairs with all your colors harmonized even to your gloves and gaiters now a room must be dressed as carefully as a lady  well im convinced said jenny that papa knows how to make rooms prettier than aunt easygo but then she said this was cheap because it would outlast two common carpets  but as you pay double price said i i dont see that besides i would rather in the course of twenty years have two nice fresh ingrain carpets of just the color and pattern that suited my rooms than labor along with one illchosen velvet that harmonized with nothing  i give it up said jenny i give it up  now understand me said i i am not traducing velvet or brussels or axminster i admit that more beautiful effects can be found in those goods than in the humbler fabrics of the carpet rooms nothing would delight me more than to put an unlimited credit to mariannes account and let her work out the problems of harmonious color in velvet and damask all i have to say is that certain unities of color certain general arrangements will secure very nearly as good general effects in either material a library with a neat mossy green carpet on the floor harmonizing with wallpaper and furniture looks generally as well whether the mossy green is made in brussels or in ingrain in the carpet stores these two materials stand side by side in the very same pattern and one is often as good for the purpose as the other a lady of my acquaintance some years since employed an artist to decorate her parlors the walls being frescoed and tinted to suit his ideal he immediately issued his decree that her splendid velvet carpets must be sent to auction and others bought of certain colors harmonizing with the walls unable to find exactly the color and pattern he wanted he at last had the carpets woven in a neighboring factory where as yet they had only the art of weaving ingrains thus was the material sacrificed at once to the harmony  i remarked in passing that this was before bigelows mechanical genius had unlocked for america the higher secrets of carpetweaving and made it possible to have ones desires accomplished in brussels or velvet in those days english carpetweavers did not send to america for their looms as they now do  but now to return to my analysis of johns rooms  another thing which goes a great way towards giving them their agreeable air is the books in them some people are fond of treating books as others do children one room in the house is selected and every book driven into it and kept there yet nothing makes a room so homelike so companionable and gives it such an air of refinement as the presence of books they change the aspect of a parlor from that of a mere receptionroom where visitors perch for a transient call and give it the air of a room where one feels like taking off ones things to stay it gives the appearance of permanence and repose and quiet fellowship and next to pictures on the walls the manycolored bindings and gildings of books are the most agreeable adornment of a room  then marianne said bob we have something to start with at all events there are my english classics and english poets and my uniform editions of scott and thackeray and macaulay and prescott and irving and longfellow and lowell and hawthorne and holmes and a host more we really have something pretty there  you are a lucky girl i said to have so much secured a girl brought up in a house full of books always able to turn to this or that author and look for any passage or poem when she thinks of it doesnt know what a blank a house without books might be  well said marianne mamma and i were counting over my treasures the other day do you know i have one really fine old engraving that bob says is quite a genuine thing and then there is that pencilsketch that poor sch√∂ne made for me the month before he diedit is truly artistic  and i have a couple of capital things of landseers said bob  theres no danger that your rooms will not be pretty said i now you are fairly on the right track  but papa said marianne i am troubled about one thing my love of beauty runs into everything i want pretty things for my table and yet as you say servants are so careless one cannot use such things freely without great waste  for my part said my wife i believe in best china to be kept carefully on an upper shelf and taken down for highdays and holidays it may be a superstition but i believe in it it must never be taken out except when the mistress herself can see that it is safely cared for my mother always washed her china herself and it was a very pretty social ceremony after tea was over while she sat among us washing her pretty cups and wiping them on a fine damask towel  with all my heart said i have your best china and venerate itit is one of the loveliest of domestic superstitions only do not make it a bar to hospitality and shrink from having a friend to tea with you unless you feel equal to getting up to the high shelf where you keep it getting it down washing and putting it up again  but in serving a table i say as i said of a house beauty is a necessity and beauty is cheap because you cannot afford beauty in one form it does not follow that you cannot have it in another because one cannot afford to keep up a perennial supply of delicate china and crystal subject to the accidents of raw untrained servants it does not follow that the everyday table need present a sordid assortment of articles chosen simply for cheapness while the whole capacity of the purse is given to the set forever locked away for state occasions  a tableservice all of simple white of graceful forms even though not of china if arranged with care with snowy wellkept tablelinen clear glasses and bright american plate in place of solid silver may be made to look inviting add a glass of flowers every day and your table may look pretty and it is far more important that it should look pretty for the family every day than for company once in two weeks  i tell my girls said my wife as the result of my experience you may have your pretty china and your lovely fanciful articles for the table only so long as you can take all the care of them yourselves as soon as you get tired of doing this and put them into the hands of the trustiest servants some good wellmeaning creature is sure to break her heart and your own and your very pet darling china pitcher all in one and the same minute and then her frantic despair leaves you not even the relief of scolding  i have become perfectly sure said i that there are spiteful little brownies intent on seducing good women to sin who mount guard over the special idols of the china closet if you hear a crash and a loud irish wail from the inner depths you never think of its being a yellow pieplate or that dreadful onehandled tureen that you have been wishing were broken these five years no indeedit is sure to be the lovely painted china bowl wreathed with morningglories and sweetpeas or the engraved glass goblet with quaint old english initials china sacrificed must be a great means of saintship to women pope i think puts it as the crowning grace of his perfect woman that she is    mistress of herself though china fall  i ought to be a saint by this time then said mamma for in the course of my days i have lost so many idols by breakage and peculiar accidents that seemed by a special fatality to befall my prettiest and most irreplaceable things that in fact it has come to be a superstitious feeling now with which i regard anything particularly pretty of a breakable nature  well said marianne unless one has a great deal of money it seems to me that the investment in these pretty fragilities is rather a poor one  yet said i the principle of beauty is never so captivating as when it presides over the hour of daily meals i would have the room where they are served one of the pleasantest and sunniest in the house i would have its coloring cheerful and there should be companionable pictures and engravings on the walls of all things i dislike a room that seems to be kept like a restaurant merely to eat in i like to see in a diningroom something that betokens a pleasant sittingroom at other hours i like there some books a comfortable sofa or lounge and all that should make it cosy and inviting the custom in some families of adopting for the daily meals one of the two parlors which a city house furnishes has often seemed to me a particularly happy one you take your meals then in an agreeable place surrounded by the little pleasant arrangements of your daily sittingroom and after the meal if the lady of the house does the honors of her own pretty china herself the office may be a pleasant and social one  but in regard to your tableservice i have my advice at hand invest in pretty tablelinen in delicate napkins have your vase of flowers and be guided by the eye of taste in the choice and arrangement of even the everyday table articles and have no ugly things when you can have pretty ones by taking a little thought if you are sore tempted with lovely china and crystal too fragile to last too expensive to be renewed turn away to a printshop and comfort yourself by hanging around the walls of your diningroom beauty that will not break or fade that will meet your eye from year to year though plates tumblers and teasets successively vanish there is my advice for you marianne  at the same time let me say in parenthesis that my wife whose weakness is china informed me that night when we were by ourselves that she was ordering secretly a teaset as a bridal gift for marianne every cup of which was to be exquisitely painted with the wild flowers of america from designs of her owna thing by the by that can now be very nicely executed in our country as one may find by looking in at our friend briggss on school street it will last her all her life she said and always be such a pleasure to look at and a pretty teatable is such a pretty sight so spoke mrs crowfield unweaned from china by a thousand falls she spoke even with tears in her eyes verily these women are harps of a thousand strings  but to return to my subject  finally and lastly i said in my analysis and explication of the agreeableness of those same parlors comes the growing gracetheir homeliness by homeliness i mean not ugliness as the word is apt to be used but the air that is given to a room by being really at home in it not the most skillful arrangement can impart this charm  it is said that a king of france once remarked my son you must seem to love your people  father how shall i seem to love them  my son you must love them  so to make rooms seem homelike you must be at home in them human light and warmth are so wanting in some rooms it is so evident that they are never used that you can never be at ease there in vain the housemaid is taught to wheel the sofa and turn chair toward chair in vain it is attempted to imitate a negligent arrangement of the centretable  books that have really been read and laid down chairs that have really been moved here and there in the animation of social contact have a sort of human vitality in them and a room in which people really live and enjoy is as different from a shutup apartment as a live woman from a wax image  even rooms furnished without taste often become charming from this one grace that they seem to let you into the home life and home current you seem to understand in a moment that you are taken into the family and are moving in its inner circles and not revolving at a distance in some outer court of the gentiles  how many people do we call on from year to year and know no more of their feelings habits tastes family ideas and ways than if they lived in kamtschatka and why because the room which they call a front parlor is made expressly so that you never shall know they sit in a back roomwork talk read perhaps after the servant has let you in and opened a crack of the shutters and while you sit waiting for them to change their dress and come in you speculate as to what they may be doing from some distant region the laugh of a child the song of a canarybird reaches you and then a door claps hastily to do they love plants do they write letters sew embroider crochet do they ever romp and frolic what books do they read do they sketch or paint of all these possibilities the mute and muffled room says nothing a sofa and six chairs two ottomans fresh from the upholsterers a brussels carpet a centretable with four gilt books of beauty on it a mantelclock from paris and two bronze vasesall those tell you only in frigid tones this is the best roomonly that and nothing moreand soon she trips in in her best clothes and apologizes for keeping you waiting asks how your mother is and you remark that it is a pleasant day and thus the acquaintance progresses from year to year one hour in the back room where the plants and canarybird and children are might have made you fast friends for life but little as it is you care no more for them than for the gilt clock on the mantel  and now girls said i pulling a paper out of my pocket you must know that your father is getting to be famous by means of these house and home papers here is a letter i have just received    most excellent mr crowfieldyour thoughts have lighted into   our family circle and echoed from our fireside we all feel the   force of them and are delighted with the felicity of your   treatment of the topic you have chosen you have taken hold of a   subject that lies deep in our hearts in a genial temperate and   convincing spirit all must acknowledge the power of your   sentiments upon their imaginations if they could only trust to   them in actual life there is the rub    omitting further upon these points there is a special feature of   your articles upon which we wish to address you you seem as yet   we do not know of course what you may hereafter do to speak   only of homes whose conduct depends upon the help of servants now   your principles apply as some of us well conceive to nearly all   classes of society yet most people to take an impressive hint   must have their portraits drawn out more exactly we therefore   hope that you will give a reasonable share of your attention to us   who do not employ servants so that you may ease us of some of our   burdens which in spite of common sense we dare not throw off   for instance we have companya friend from afar perhaps   wealthy or a minister or some other man of note what do we do   sit down and receive our visitor with all good will and the   freedom of a home no we the lady of the house flutter about to   clear up things apologizing about this that and the other   condition of unpreparedness and having settled the visitor in   the parlor set about marshaling the elements of a grand dinner or   supper such as no person but a gourmand wants to sit down to   when at home and comfortable and in getting up this meal   clearing away and washing the dishes we use up a good half of the   time which our guest spends with us we have spread ourselves and   shown him what we could do but what a paltry heartsickening   achievement now good mr crowfield thou friend of the robbed   and despairing wilt thou not descend into our purgatorial circle   and tell the world what thou hast seen there of doleful   remembrance tell us how we who must do and desire to do our own   work can show forth in our homes a homely yet genial hospitality   and entertain our guests without making a fuss and hurlyburly and   seeming to be anxious for their sake about many things and   spending too much time getting meals as if eating were the chief   social pleasure wont you do this mr crowfield    yours beseechingly    r h a  thats a good letter said jenny  to be sure it is said i  and shall you answer it papa  in the very next atlantic you may be sure i shall the class that do their own work are the strongest the most numerous and taking one thing with another quite as well cultivated a class as any other they are the anomaly of our countrythe distinctive feature of the new society that we are building up here and if we are to accomplish our national destiny that class must increase rather than diminish i shall certainly do my best to answer the very sensible and pregnant questions of that letter  here marianne shivered and drew up a shawl and jenny gaped my wife folded up the garment in which she had set the last stitch and the clock struck twelve  bob gave a low whistle who knew it was so late  we have talked the fire fairly out said jenny     vi  the lady who does her own work   my dear chris said my wife isnt it time to be writing the next house and home paper  i was lying back in my studychair with my heels luxuriously propped on an ottoman reading for the twohundredth time hawthornes mosses from an old manse or his twicetold tales i forget whichi only know that these books constitute my cloudland where i love to sail away in dreamy quietude forgetting the war the price of coal and flour the rates of exchange and the rise and fall of gold what do all these things matter as seen from those enchanted gardens in padua where the weird rappaccini tends his enchanted plants and his gorgeous daughter fills us with the light and magic of her presence and saddens us with the shadowy allegoric mystery of her preternatural destiny but my wife represents the positive forces of time place and number in our family and having also a chronological head she knows the day of the month and therefore gently reminded me that by inevitable dates the time drew near for preparing mywhich is it now may or june number  well my dear you are right i said as by an exertion i came headuppermost and laid down the fascinating volume let me see what was i to write about  why you remember you were to answer that letter from the lady who does her own work  enough said i seizing the pen with alacrity you have hit the exact phrase  the lady who does her own work                                       america is the only country where such a title is possiblethe only country where there is a class of women who may be described as ladies who do their own work by a lady we mean a woman of education cultivation and refinement of liberal tastes and ideas who without any very material additions or changes would be recognized as a lady in any circle of the old world or the new  what i have said is that the existence of such a class is a fact peculiar to american society a clear plain result of the new principles involved in the doctrine of universal equality  when the colonists first came to this country of however mixed ingredients their ranks might have been composed and however imbued with the spirit of feudal and aristocratic ideas the discipline of the wilderness soon brought them to a democratic level the gentleman felled the wood for his logcabin side by side with the ploughman and thews and sinews rose in the market a man was deemed honorable in proportion as he lifted his hand upon the high trees of the forest so in the interior domestic circle mistress and maid living in a logcabin together became companions and sometimes the maid as the more accomplished and stronger took precedence of the mistress it became natural and unavoidable that children should begin to work as early as they were capable of it the result was a generation of intelligent people brought up to labor from necessity but turning on the problem of labor the acuteness of a disciplined brain the mistress outdone in sinews and muscles by her maid kept her superiority by skill and contrivance if she could not lift a pail of water she could invent methods which made lifting the pail unnecessary if she could not take a hundred steps without weariness she could make twenty answer the purpose of a hundred  slavery it is true was to some extent introduced into new england but it never suited the genius of the people never struck deep root or spread so as to choke the good seed of selfhelpfulness many were opposed to it from conscientious principlemany from farsighted thrift and from a love of thoroughness and welldoing which despised the rude unskilled work of barbarians people having once felt the thorough neatness and beauty of execution which came of free educated and thoughtful labor could not tolerate the clumsiness of slavery thus it came to pass that for many years the rural population of new england as a general rule did their own work both out doors and in if there were a black man or black woman or bound girl they were emphatically only the helps following humbly the steps of master and mistress and used by them as instruments of lightening certain portions of their toil the master and mistress with their children were the head workers  great merriment has been excited in the old country because years ago the first english travelers found that the class of persons by them denominated servants were in america denominated help or helpers but the term was the very best exponent of the state of society there were few servants in the european sense of the word there was a society of educated workers where all were practically equal and where if there was a deficiency in one family and an excess in another a helper not a servant was hired mrs brown who has six sons and no daughters enters into agreement with mrs jones who has six daughters and no sons she borrows a daughter and pays her good wages to help in her domestic toil and sends a son to help the labors of mr jones these two young people go into the families in which they are to be employed in all respects as equals and companions and so the work of the community is equalized hence arose and for many years continued a state of society more nearly solving than any other ever did the problem of combining the highest culture of the mind with the highest culture of the muscles and the physical faculties  then were to be seen families of daughters handsome strong females rising each day to their indoor work with cheerful alertnessone to sweep the room another to make the fire while a third prepared the breakfast for the father and brothers who were going out to manly labor and they chatted meanwhile of books studies embroidery discussed the last new poem or some historical topic started by graver reading or perhaps a rural ball that was to come off the next week they spun with the book tied to the distaff they wove they did all manner of fine needlework they made lace painted flowers and in short in the boundless consciousness of activity invention and perfect health set themselves to any work they had ever read or thought of a bride in those days was married with sheets and tablecloths of her own weaving with counterpanes and toiletcovers wrought in divers embroidery by her own and her sisters hands the amount of fancy work done in our days by girls who have nothing else to do will not equal what was done by these who performed besides among them the whole work of the family  for many years these habits of life characterized the majority of our rural towns they still exist among a class respectable in numbers and position though perhaps not as happy in perfect selfsatisfaction and a conviction of the dignity and desirableness of its lot as in former days human nature is above all thingslazy every one confesses in the abstract that exertion which brings out all the powers of body and mind is the best thing for us all but practically most people do all they can to get rid of it and as a general rule nobody does much more than circumstances drive him to do even i would not write this article were not the publicationday hard on my heels i should read hawthorne and emerson and holmes and dream in my armchair and project in the clouds those lovely unwritten stories that curl and veer and change like mistwreaths in the sun so also however dignified however invigorating however really desirable are habits of life involving daily physical toil there is a constant evil demon at every ones elbow seducing him to evade it or to bear its weight with sullen discontented murmurs  i will venture to say that there are at least to speak very moderately a hundred houses where these humble lines will be read and discussed where there are no servants except the ladies of the household i will venture to say also that these households many of them are not inferior in the air of cultivation and refined elegance to many which are conducted by the ministration of domestics i will venture to assert furthermore that these same ladies who live thus find quite as much time for reading letterwriting drawing embroidery and fancy work as the women of families otherwise arranged i am quite certain that they would be found on an average to be in the enjoyment of better health and more of that sense of capability and vitality which gives one confidence in ones ability to look into life and meet it with cheerful courage than three quarters of the women who keep servants and that on the whole their domestic establishment is regulated more exactly to their mind their food prepared and served more to their taste and yet with all this i will not venture to assert that they are satisfied with this way of living and that they would not change it forthwith if they could they have a secret feeling all the while that they are being abused that they are working harder than they ought to and that women who live in their houses like boarders who have only to speak and it is done are the truly enviable ones one after another of their associates as opportunity offers and means increase deserts the ranks and commits her domestic affairs to the hands of hired servants selfrespect takes the alarm is it altogether genteel to live as we do to be sure we are accustomed to it we have it all systematized and arranged the work of our own hands suits us better than any we can hire in fact when we do hire we are discontented and uncomfortable for who will do for us what we will do for ourselves but when we have company theres the rub to get out all our best things and put them backto cook the meals and wash the dishes ingloriouslyand to make all appear as if we didnt do it and had servants like other people  there after all is the rub a want of hardy selfrespect an unwillingness to face with dignity the actual facts and necessities of our situation in lifethis after all is the worst and most dangerous feature of the case it is the same sort of pride which makes smilax think he must hire a waiter in white gloves and get up a circuitous dinner party on english principles to entertain a friend from england because the friend in england lives in such and such a style he must make believe for a day that he lives so too when in fact it is a whirlwind in his domestic establishment equal to a removal or a fire and threatens the total extinction of mrs smilax now there are two principles of hospitality that people are very apt to overlook one is that their guests like to be made at home and treated with confidence and another is that people are always interested in the details of a way of life that is new to them the englishman comes to america as weary of his old easy familycoach life as you can be of yours he wants to see something new under the sunsomething american and forthwith we all bestir ourselves to give him something as near as we can fancy exactly like what he is already tired of so city people come to the country not to sit in the best parlor and to see the nearest imitation of city life but to lie on the haymow to swing in the barn to form intimacy with the pigs chickens and ducks and to eat baked potatoes exactly on the critical moment when they are done from the oven of the cookingstoveand we remark en passant that nobody has ever truly eaten a baked potato unless he has seized it at that precise and fortunate moment  i fancy you now my friends whom i have in my eye you are three happy women together you are all so well that you know not how it feels to be sick you are used to early rising and would not lie in bed if you could long years of practice have made you familiar with the shortest neatest most expeditious method of doing every household office so that really for the greater part of the time in your house there seems to a lookeron to be nothing to do you rise in the morning and dispatch your husband father and brothers to the farm or woodlot you go sociably about chatting with each other while you skim the milk make the butter turn the cheeses the forenoon is long its ten to one that all the socalled morning work is over and you have leisure for an hours sewing or reading before it is time to start the dinner preparations by two oclock your housework is done and you have the long afternoon for books needlework or drawingfor perhaps there is among you one with a gift at her pencil perhaps one of you reads aloud while the others sew and you manage in that way to keep up with a great deal of reading i see on your bookshelves prescott macaulay irving besides the lighter fry of poems and novels and if i mistake not the friendly covers of the atlantic when you have company you invite mrs smith or brown or jones to tea you have no troublethey come early with their knitting or sewing your particular crony sits with you by your polished stove while you watch the baking of those light biscuits and tea rusks for which you are so famous and mrs somebodyelse chats with your sister who is spreading the table with your best china in the best room when tea is over there is plenty of volunteering to help you wash your pretty india teacups and get them back into the cupboard there is no special fatigue or exertion in all this though you have taken down the best things and put them back because you have done all without anxiety or effort among those who would do precisely the same if you were their visitors  but now comes down pretty mrs simmons and her pretty daughter to spend a week with you and forthwith you are troubled your youngest fanny visited them in new york last fall and tells you of their cook and chambermaid and the servant in white gloves that waits on the table you say in your soul what shall we do they never can be contented to live as we do how shall we manage and now you long for servants  this is the very time that you should know that mrs simmons is tired to death of her fine establishment and weighed down with the task of keeping the peace among her servants she is a quiet soul dearly loving her ease and hating strife and yet last week she had five quarrels to settle between her invaluable cook and the other members of her staff because invaluable cook on the strength of knowing how to get up state dinners and to manage all sorts of mysteries which her mistress knows nothing about asserts the usual right of spoiled favorites to insult all her neighbors with impunity and rule with a rod of iron over the whole house anything that is not in the least like her own home and ways of living will be a blessed relief and change to mrs simmons your clean quiet house your delicate cookery your cheerful morning tasks if you will let her follow you about and sit and talk with you while you are at your work will all seem a pleasant contrast to her own life of course if it came to the case of offering to change lots in life she would not do it but very likely she thinks she would and sighs over and pities herself and thinks sentimentally how fortunate you are how snugly and securely you live and wishes she were as untrammeled and independent as you and she is more than half right for with her helpless habits her utter ignorance of the simplest facts concerning the reciprocal relations of milk eggs butter saleratus soda and yeast she is completely the victim and slave of the person she pretends to rule  only imagine some of the frequent scenes and rehearsals in her family after many trials she at last engages a seamstress who promises to prove a perfect treasureneat dapper nimble skillful and spirited the very soul of mrs simmons rejoices in heaven illusive bliss the newcomer proves to be no favorite with madam cook and the domestic fates evolve the catastrophe as follows first low murmur of distant thunder in the kitchen then a day or two of sulky silence in which the atmosphere seems heavy with an approaching storm at last comes the climax the parlor door flies open during breakfast enter seamstress in tears followed by mrs cook with a face swollen and red with wrath who tersely introduces the subjectmatter of the drama in a voice trembling with rage  would you be plased maam to suit yerself with another cook me week will be up next tuesday and i want to be going  why bridget whats the matter  matter enough maam i niver could live with them cork girls in a house nor i wont them as likes the cork girls is welcome for all me but its not for the likes of me to live with them and she been in the kitchen aupsettin of me gravies with her flatirons and things  here bursts in the seamstress with a whirlwind of denial and the altercation wages fast and furious and poor little delicate mrs simmons stands like a kitten in a thunderstorm in the midst of a regular irish row  cook of course is sure of her victory she knows that a great dinner is to come off wednesday and that her mistress has not the smallest idea how to manage it and that therefore whatever happens she must be conciliated  swelling with secret indignation at the tyrant poor mrs simmons dismisses her seamstress with longing looks she suited her mistress exactly but she didnt suit cook  now if mrs simmons had been brought up in early life with the experience that you have she would be mistress in her own house she would quietly say to madam cook if my family arrangements do not suit you you can leave i can see to the dinner myself and she could do it her welltrained muscles would not break down under a little extra work her skill adroitness and perfect familiarity with everything that is to be done would enable her at once to make cooks of any bright girls of good capacity who might still be in her establishment and above all she would feel herself mistress in her own house this is what would come of an experience in doing her own work as you do she who can at once put her own trained hand to the machine in any spot where a hand is needed never comes to be the slave of a coarse vulgar irishwoman  so also in forming a judgment of what is to be expected of servants in a given time and what ought to be expected of a given amount of provisions poor mrs simmons is absolutely at sea if even for one six months in her life she had been a practical cook and had really had the charge of the larder she would not now be haunted as she constantly is by an indefinite apprehension of an immense wastefulness perhaps of the disappearance of provisions through secret channels of relationship and favoritism she certainly could not be made to believe in the absolute necessity of so many pounds of sugar quarts of milk and dozens of eggs not to mention spices and wine as are daily required for the accomplishment of madam cooks purposes but though now she does suspect and apprehend she cannot speak with certainty she cannot say i have made these things i know exactly what they require i have done this and that myself and know it can be done and done well in a certain time it is said that women who have been accustomed to doing their own work become hard mistresses they are certainly more sure of the ground they stand onthey are less open to impositionthey can speak and act in their own houses more as those having authority and therefore are less afraid to exact what is justly their due and less willing to endure impertinence and unfaithfulness their general error lies in expecting that any servant ever will do as well for them as they will do for themselves and that an untrained undisciplined human being ever can do housework or any other work with the neatness and perfection that a person of trained intelligence can it has been remarked in our armies that the men of cultivation though bred in delicate and refined spheres can bear up under the hardships of camplife better and longer than rough laborers the reason is that an educated mind knows how to use and save its body to work it and spare it as an uneducated mind cannot and so the collegebred youth brings himself safely through fatigues which kill the unreflective laborer cultivated intelligent women who are brought up to do the work of their own families are laborsaving institutions they make the head save the wear of the muscles by forethought contrivance system and arrangement they lessen the amount to be done and do it with less expense of time and strength than others the old new england motto get your work done up in the forenoon applied to an amount of work which would keep a common irish servant toiling from daylight to sunset  a lady living in one of our obscure new england towns where there were no servants to be hired at last by sending to a distant city succeeded in procuring a raw irish maid of all work a creature of immense bone and muscle but of heavy unawakened brain in one fortnight she established such a reign of chaos and old night in the kitchen and through the house that her mistress a delicate woman incumbered with the care of young children began seriously to think that she made more work each day than she performed and dismissed her what was now to be done fortunately the daughter of a neighboring farmer was going to be married in six months and wanted a little ready money for her trousseau the lady was informed that miss soandso would come to her not as a servant but as hired help she was fain to accept any help with gladness forthwith came into the family circle a tall welldressed young person grave unobtrusive selfrespecting yet not in the least presuming who sat at the family table and observed all its decorums with the modest selfpossession of a lady the newcomer took a survey of the labors of a family of ten members including four or five young children and looking seemed at once to throw them into system matured her plans arranged her hours of washing ironing baking cleaning rose early moved deftly and in a single day the slatternly and littered kitchen assumed that neat orderly appearance that so often strikes one in new england farmhouses the work seemed to be all gone everything was nicely washed brightened put in place and stayed in place the floors when cleaned remained clean the work was always done and not doing and every afternoon the young lady sat neatly dressed in her own apartment either writing letters to her betrothed or sewing on her bridal outfit such is the result of employing those who have been brought up to do their own work that tall finelooking girl for aught we know may yet be mistress of a fine house on fifth avenue and if she is she will we fear prove rather an exacting mistress to irish biddy and bridget but she will never be threatened by her cook and chambermaid after the first one or two have tried the experiment                                       having written thus far on my article i laid it aside till evening when as usual i was saluted by the inquiry has papa been writing anything today and then followed loud petitions to hear it and so i read as far reader as you have  well papa said jenny what are you meaning to make out there do you really think it would be best for us all to try to go back to that old style of living you describe after all you have shown only the dark side of an establishment with servants and the bright side of the other way of living mamma does not have such trouble with her servants matters have always gone smoothly in our family and if we are not such wonderful girls as those you describe yet we may make pretty good housekeepers on the modern system after all  you dont know all the troubles your mamma has had in your day said my wife i have often in the course of my family history seen the day when i have heartily wished for the strength and ability to manage my household matters as my grandmother of notable memory managed hers but i fear that those remarkable women of the olden times are like the ancient painted glassthe art of making them is lost my mother was less than her mother and i am less than my mother  and marianne and i come out entirely at the little end of the horn said jenny laughing yet i wash the breakfast cups and dust the parlors and have always fancied myself a notable housekeeper  it is just as i told you i said human nature is always the same nobody ever is or does more than circumstances force him to be and do those remarkable women of old were made by circumstances there were comparatively speaking no servants to be had and so children were trained to habits of industry and mechanical adroitness from the cradle and every household process was reduced to the very minimum of labor every step required in a process was counted every movement calculated and she who took ten steps when one would do lost her reputation for faculty certainly such an early drill was of use in developing the health and the bodily powers as well as in giving precision to the practical mental faculties all household economies were arranged with equal niceness in those thoughtful minds a trained housekeeper knew just how many sticks of hickory of a certain size were required to heat her oven and how many of each different kind of wood she knew by a sort of intuition just what kind of food would yield the most palatable nutriment with the least outlay of accessories in cooking she knew to a minute the time when each article must go into and be withdrawn from her oven and if she could only lie in her chamber and direct she could guide an intelligent child through the processes with mathematical certainty it is impossible however that anything but early training and long experience can produce these results and it is earnestly to be wished that the grandmothers of new england had only written down their experiences for our children they would have been a mine of maxims and traditions better than any other traditions of the elders which we know of  one thing i know said marianne and that is i wish i had been brought up so and knew all that i should and had all the strength and adroitness that those women had i should not dread to begin housekeeping as i now do i should feel myself independent i should feel that i knew how to direct my servants and what it was reasonable and proper to expect of them and then as you say i shouldnt be dependent on all their whims and caprices of temper i dread those household storms of all things  silently pondering these anxieties of the young expectant housekeeper i resumed my pen and concluded my paper as follows                                       in this country our democratic institutions have removed the superincumbent pressure which in the old world confines the servants to a regular orbit they come here feeling that this is somehow a land of liberty and with very dim and confused notions of what liberty is they are for the most part the raw untrained irish peasantry and the wonder is that with all the unreasoning heats and prejudices of the celtic blood all the necessary ignorance and rawness there should be the measure of comfort and success there is in our domestic arrangements but so long as things are so there will be constant changes and interruptions in every domestic establishment and constantly recurring interregnums when the mistress must put her own hand to the work whether the hand be a trained or an untrained one as matters now are the young housekeeper takes life at the hardest she has very little strengthno experience to teach her how to save her strength she knows nothing experimentally of the simplest processes necessary to keep her family comfortably fed and clothed and she has a way of looking at all these things which makes them particularly hard and distasteful to her she does not escape being obliged to do housework at intervals but she does it in a weak blundering confused way that makes it twice as hard and disagreeable as it need be  now what i have to say is that if every young woman learned to do housework and cultivated her practical faculties in early life she would in the first place be much more likely to keep her servants and in the second place if she lost them temporarily would avoid all that wear and tear of the nervous system which comes from constant illsuccess in those departments on which family health and temper mainly depend this is one of the peculiarities of our american life which require a peculiar training why not face it sensibly  the second thing i have to say is that our land is now full of motorpathic institutions to which women are sent at great expense to have hired operators stretch and exercise their inactive muscles they lie for hours to have their feet twigged their arms flexed and all the different muscles of the body worked for them because they are so flaccid and torpid that the powers of life do not go on would it not be quite as cheerful and less expensive a process if young girls from early life developed the muscles in sweeping dusting ironing rubbing furniture and all the multiplied domestic processes which our grandmothers knew of a woman who did all these and diversified the intervals with spinning on the great and little wheel never came to need the gymnastics of dio lewis or of the swedish motorpathist which really are a necessity now does it not seem poor economy to pay servants for letting our muscles grow feeble and then to pay operators to exercise them for us i will venture to say that our grandmothers in a week went over every movement that any gymnast has invented and went over them to some productive purpose too  lastly my paper will not have been in vain if those ladies who have learned and practice the invaluable accomplishment of doing their own work will know their own happiness and dignity and properly value their great acquisition even though it may have been forced upon them by circumstances     vii  what can be got in america   while i was preparing my article for the atlantic our friend bob stephens burst in upon us in some considerable heat with a newspaper in his hand  well girls your time is come now you women have been preaching heroism and sacrifice to usso splendid to go forth and suffer and die for our countryand now comes the test of feminine patriotism  why whats the matter now said jenny running eagerly to look over his shoulder at the paper  no more foreign goods said he waving it aloftno more gold shipped to europe for silks laces jewels kid gloves and what not here it isgreat movement headed by senators and generals wives mrs general butler mrs john p hale mrs henry wilson and so on a long string of them to buy no more imported articles during the war  but i dont see how it can be done said jenny  why said i do you suppose that nothing to wear is made in america  but dear mr crowfield said miss featherstone a nice girl who was just then one of our family circle there is not positively much that is really fit to use or wear made in americais there now just think how is marianne to furnish her house here without french papers and english carpetsthose american papers are so very ordinary and as to american carpets everybody knows their colors dont hold and then as to dress a lady must have gloves you knowand everybody knows no such things are made in america as gloves  i think i said that i have heard of certain fair ladies wishing that they were men that they might show with what alacrity they would sacrifice everything on the altar of their country life and limb would be nothing they would glory in wounds and bruises they would enjoy losing a right arm they wouldnt mind limping about on a lame leg the rest of their lives if they were john or peter if only they might serve their dear country  yes said bob thats female patriotism girls are always ready to jump off from precipices or throw themselves into abysses but as to wearing an unfashionable hat or thread gloves that they cant donot even for their dear country no matter whether theres any money left to pay for the war or not the dear souls must have twenty yards of silk in a dressits the fashion you know  now isnt he too bad said marianne as if wed ever been asked to make these sacrifices and refused i think i have seen women ready to give up dress and fashion and everything else for a good cause  for that matter said i the history of all wars has shown women ready to sacrifice what is most intimately feminine in times of peril to their country the women of carthage not only gave up their jewels in the siege of their city but in the last extremity cut off their hair for bowstrings the women of hungary and poland in their countrys need sold their jewels and plate and wore ornaments of iron and lead in the time of our own revolution our women dressed in plain homespun and drank herbteaand certainly nothing is more feminine than a cup of tea and in this very struggle the women of the southern states have cut up their carpets for blankets have borne the most humiliating retrenchments and privations of all kinds without a murmur so let us exonerate the female sex of want of patriotism at any rate  certainly said my wife and if our northern women have not retrenched and made sacrifices it has been because it has not been impressed on them that there is any particular call for it everything has seemed to be so prosperous and plentiful in the northern states money has been so abundant and easy to come by that it has really been difficult to realize that a dreadful and destructive war was raging only occasionally after a great battle when the lists of the killed and wounded have been sent through the country have we felt that we were making a sacrifice the women who have spent such sums for laces and jewels and silks have not had it set clearly before them why they should not do so the money has been placed freely in their hands and the temptation before their eyes  yes said jenny i am quite sure that there are hundreds who have been buying foreign goods who would not do it if they could see any connection between their not doing it and the salvation of the country but when i go to buy a pair of gloves i naturally want the best pair i can find the pair that will last the longest and look the best and these always happen to be french gloves  then said miss featherstone i never could clearly see why people should confine their patronage and encouragement to works of their own country im sure the poor manufacturers of england have shown the very noblest spirit with relation to our cause and so have the silk weavers and artisans of franceat least so i have heard why should we not give them a fair share of encouragement particularly when they make things that we are not in circumstances to make have not the means to make  those are certainly sensible questions i replied and ought to meet a fair answer and i should say that were our country in a fair ordinary state of prosperity there would be no reason why our wealth should not flow out for the encouragement of welldirected industry in any part of the world from this point of view we might look on the whole world as our country and cheerfully assist in developing its wealth and resources but our country is now in the situation of a private family whose means are absorbed by an expensive sickness involving the life of its head just now it is all we can do to keep the family together all our means are swallowed up by our own domestic wants we have nothing to give for the encouragement of other families we must exist ourselves we must get through this crisis and hold our own and that we may do it all the family expenses must be kept within ourselves as far as possible if we drain off all the gold of the country to send to europe to encourage her worthy artisans we produce high prices and distress among equally worthy ones at home and we lessen the amount of our resources for maintaining the great struggle for national existence the same amount of money which we pay for foreign luxuries if passed into the hands of our own manufacturers and producers becomes available for the increasing expenses of the war  but papa said jenny i understood that a great part of our governmental income was derived from the duties on foreign goods and so i inferred that the more foreign goods were imported the better it would be  well suppose said i that for every hundred thousand dollars we send out of the country we pay the government ten thousand that is about what our gain as a nation would be we send our gold abroad in a great stream and give our government a little driblet  well but said miss featherstone what can be got in america hardly anything i believe except common calicoes  begging your pardon my dear lady said i there is where you and multitudes of others are greatly mistaken your partiality for foreign things has kept you ignorant of what you have at home now i am not blaming the love of foreign things it is not peculiar to us americans all nations have it it is a part of the poetry of our nature to love what comes from afar and reminds us of lands distant and different from our own the english belles seek after french laces the french beauty enumerates english laces among her rarities and the french dandy piques himself upon an english tailor we americans are great travelers and few people travel i fancy with more real enjoyment than we our domestic establishments as compared with those of the old world are less cumbrous and stately and so our money is commonly in hand as pocketmoney to be spent freely and gayly in our tours abroad  we have such bright and pleasant times in every country that we conceive a kindliness for its belongings to send to paris for our dresses and our shoes and our gloves may not be a mere bit of foppery but a reminder of the bright pleasant hours we have spent in that city of boulevards and fountains hence it comes in a way not very blamable that many people have been so engrossed with what can be got from abroad that they have neglected to inquire what can be found at home they have supposed of course that to get a decent watch they must send to geneva or to london that to get thoroughly good carpets they must have the english manufacture that a really tasteful wallpaper could be found only in paris and that flannels and broadcloths could come only from france great britain or germany  well isnt it so said miss featherstone i certainly have always thought so i never heard of american watches im sure  then said i im sure you cant have read an article that you should have read on the waltham watches written by our friend george w curtis in the atlantic for january of last year i must refer you to that to learn that we make in america watches superior to those of switzerland or england bringing into the service machinery and modes of workmanship unequaled for delicacy and precision as i said before you must get the article and read it and if some sunny day you could make a trip to waltham and see the establishment it would greatly assist your comprehension  then as to mens clothing said bob i know to my entire satisfaction that many of the most popular cloths for mens wear are actually american fabrics baptized with french and english names to make them sell  which shows said i the use of a general community movement to employ american goods it will change the fashion the demand will create the supply when the leaders of fashion are inquiring for american instead of french and english fabrics they will be surprised to find what nice american articles there are the work of our own hands will no more be forced to skulk into the market under french and english names and we shall see what is really true that an american gentleman need not look beyond his own country for a wardrobe befitting him i am positive that we need not seek broadcloth or other woolen goods from foreign landsthat better hats are made in america than in europe and better boots and shoes and i should be glad to send an american gentleman to the worlds fair dressed from top to toe in american manufactures with an american watch in his pocket and see if he would suffer in comparison with the gentlemen of any other country  then as to housefurnishing began my wife american carpets are getting to be every way equal to the english  yes said i and what is more the brussels carpets of england are woven on looms invented by an american and bought of him our countryman bigelow went to england to study carpetweaving in the english looms supposing that all arts were generously open for the instruction of learners he was denied the opportunity of studying the machinery and watching the processes by a shortsighted jealousy he immediately sat down with a yard of carpeting and patiently unraveling it thread by thread combined and calculated till he invented the machinery on which the best carpets of the old and the new world are woven no pains which such ingenuity and energy can render effective are spared to make our fabrics equal those of the british market and we need only to be disabused of the old prejudice and to keep up with the movement of our own country and find out our own resources the fact is every year improves our fabrics our mechanics our manufacturers are working with an energy a zeal and a skill that carry things forward faster than anybody dreams of and nobody can predicate the character of american articles in any department now by their character even five years ago  well as to wallpapers said miss featherstone there you must confess the french are and must be unequaled  i do not confess any such thing said i hardily i grant you that in that department of paperhangings which exhibits floral decoration the french designs and execution are and must be for some time to come far ahead of all the world their drawing of flowers vines and foliage has the accuracy of botanical studies and the grace of finished works of art and we cannot as yet pretend in america to do anything equal to it but for satin finish and for a variety of exquisite tints of plain colors american papers equal any in the world our gilt papers even surpass in the heaviness and polish of the gilding those of foreign countries and we have also gorgeous velvets all i have to say is let people who are furnishing houses inquire for articles of american manufacture and they will be surprised at what they will see we need go no farther than our cambridge glassworks to see that the most dainty devices of cutglass crystal ground and engraved glass of every color and pattern may be had of american workmanship every way equal to the best european make and for half the price and american painting on china is so well executed both in boston and new york that deficiencies in the finest french or english sets can be made up in a style not distinguishable from the original as one may easily see by calling on our worthy next neighbor briggs who holds the opposite corner to our atlantic monthly no porcelain it is true is yet made in america these decorative arts being exercised on articles imported from europe our tables must therefore perforce be largely indebted to foreign lands for years to come exclusive of this item however i believe it would require very little selfdenial to paper carpet and furnish a house entirely from the manufactures of america i cannot help saying one word here in favor of the cabinetmakers of boston there is so much severity of taste such a style and manner about the bestmade boston furniture as raises it really quite into the region of the fine arts our artisans have studied foreign models with judicious eyes and so transferred to our country the spirit of what is best worth imitating that one has no need to import furniture from europe  well said miss featherstone there is one point you cannot make outgloves certainly the french have the monopoly of that article  i am not going to ruin my cause by asserting too much said i i havent been with nicely dressed women so many years not to speak with proper respect of alexanders gloves and i confess honestly that to forego them must be a fair square sacrifice to patriotism but then on the other hand it is nevertheless true that gloves have long been made in america and surreptitiously brought into market as french i have lately heard that very nice kid gloves are made at watertown and in philadelphia i have only heard of them and not seen a loud demand might bring forth an unexpected supply from these and other sources if the women of america were bent on having gloves made in their own country how long would it be before apparatus and factories would spring into being look at the hoopskirt factories women wanted hoopskirtswould have them or dieand forthwith factories arose and hoopskirts became as the dust of the earth for abundance  yes said miss featherstone and to say the truth the american hoopskirts are the only ones fit to wear when we were living on the champs √âlys√©es i remember we searched high and low for something like them and finally had to send home to america for some  well said i that shows what i said let there be only a hearty call for an article and it will come these spirits of the vasty deep are not so very far off after all as we may imagine and womens unions and leagues will lead to inquiries and demands which will as infallibly bring supplies as a vacuum will create a draught of air  but at least there are no ribbons made in america said miss featherstone  pardon my lady there is a ribbon factory now in operation in boston and ribbons of every color are made in new york there is also in the vicinity of boston a factory which makes roman scarfs this shows that the faculty of weaving ribbons is not wanting to us americans and a zealous patronage would increase the supply  then as for a thousand and one little feminine needs i believe our manufacturers can supply them the portsmouth steam company makes white spoolcotton equal to any in england and colored spoolcotton of every shade and variety such as is not made either in england or france pins are well made in america so are hooks and eyes and a variety of buttons straw bonnets of american manufacture are also extensively in market and quite as pretty ones as the doublepriced ones which are imported  as to silks and satins i am not going to pretend that they are to be found here it is true there are silk manufactories like that of the cheneys in connecticut where very pretty foulard dresssilks are made together with sewingsilk enough to supply a large demand enough has been done to show that silks might be made in america but at present as compared with europe we claim neither silks nor thread laces among our manufactures  but what then these are not necessaries of life ladies can be very tastefully dressed in other fabrics besides silks there are many pretty american dressgoods which the leaders of fashion might make fashionable and certainly no leader of fashion could wish to dress for a nobler object than to aid her country in deadly peril  it is not a lifepledge not a total abstinence that is askedonly a temporary expedient to meet a stringent crisis we only ask a preference for american goods where they can be found surely women whose exertions in sanitary fairs have created an era in the history of the world will not shrink from so small a sacrifice for so obvious a good  here is something in which every individual woman can help every woman who goes into a shop and asks for american goods renders an appreciable aid to our cause she expresses her opinion and her patriotism and her voice forms a part of that demand which shall arouse and develop the resources of her country we shall learn to know our own country we shall learn to respect our own powers and every branch of useful labor will spring and flourish under our welldirected efforts we shall come out of our great contest not bedraggled ragged and povertystricken but developed instructed and rich then will we gladly join with other nations in the free interchange of manufactures and gratify our eye and taste with what is foreign while we can in turn send abroad our own productions in equal ratio  upon my word said miss featherstone i should think it was the fourth of july but i yield the point i am convinced and henceforth you will see me among the most stringent of the leaguers  right said i  and fair lady reader let me hope you will say the same you can do something for your countryit lies right in your hand go to the shops determined on supplying your family and yourself with american goods insist on having them raise the question of origin over every article shown to you in the revolutionary times some of the leading matrons of new england gave parties where the ladies were dressed in homespun and drank sage tea fashion makes all things beautiful and you my charming and accomplished friend can create beauty by creating fashion what makes the beauty of half the cashmere shawls not anything in the shawls themselves for they often look coarse and dingy and barbarous it is the association with style and fashion fair lady give style and fashion to the products of your own countryresolve that the money in your hand shall go to your brave brothers to your coamericans now straining every nerve to uphold the nation and cause it to stand high in the earth what are you without your country as americans you can hope for no rank but the rank of your native land no badge of nobility but her beautiful stars it rests with this conflict to decide whether those stars shall be badges of nobility to you and your children in all lands women of america your country expects every woman to do her duty     viii  economy   the fact is said jenny as she twirled a little hat on her hand which she had been making over with nobody knows what of bows and pompons and other matters for which the women have curious namesthe fact is american women and girls must learn to economize it isnt merely restricting ones self to american goods it is general economy that is required now heres this hatcosts me only three dollars all told and sophie page bought an english one this morning at madam meyers for which she gave fifteen and i really dont think hers has more of an air than mine i made this over you see with things i had in the house bought nothing but the ribbon and paid for altering and pressing and there you see what a stylish hat i have  lovely admirable said miss featherstone upon my word jenny you ought to marry a poor parson you would be quite thrown away upon a rich man  let me see said i i want to admire intelligently that isnt the hat you were wearing yesterday  oh no papa this is just done the one i wore yesterday was my waterfallhat with the green feather this you see is an oriole  a what  an oriole papa how can you expect to learn about these things  and that plain little black one with the stiff crop of scarlet feathers sticking straight up  thats my jockey papa with a plume en militaire  and did the waterfall and the jockey cost anything  they were very very cheap papa all things considered miss featherstone will remember that the waterfall was a great bargain and i had the feather from last year and as to the jockey that was made out of my last years white one dyed over you know papa i always take care of my things and they last from year to year  i do assure you mr crowfield said miss featherstone i never saw such little economists as your daughters it is perfectly wonderful what they contrive to dress on how they manage to do it im sure i cant see i never could im convinced  yes said jenny ive bought but just one new hat i only wish you could sit in church where we do and see those miss fielders marianne and i have counted six new hats apiece of those girlsnew you know just out of the milliners shop and last sunday they came out in such lovely puffed tulle bonnets werent they lovely marianne and next sunday i dont doubt therell be something else  yes said miss featherstonetheir father they say has made a million dollars lately on government contracts  for my part said jenny i think such extravagance at such a time as this is shameful  do you know said i that im quite sure the misses fielder think they are practicing rigorous economy  papa now there you are with your paradoxes how can you say so  i shouldnt be afraid to bet a pair of gloves now said i that miss fielder thinks herself half ready for translation because she has bought only six new hats and a tulle bonnet so far in the season if it were not for her dear bleeding country she would have had thirtysix like the misses sibthorpe if we were admitted to the secret councils of the fielders doubtless we should perceive what temptations they daily resist how perfectly rubbishy and dreadful they suffer themselves to be because they feel it important now in this crisis to practice economy how they abuse the sibthorpes who have a new hat every time they drive out and never think of wearing one more than two or three times how virtuous and selfdenying they feel when they think of the puffed tulle for which they only gave eighteen dollars when madame caradori showed them those lovely ones like the misses sibthorpes for fortyfive and how they go home descanting on virgin simplicity and resolving that they will not allow themselves to be swept into the vortex of extravagance whatever other people may do  do you know said miss featherstone i believe your papa is right i was calling on the oldest miss fielder the other day and she told me that she positively felt ashamed to go looking as she did but that she really did feel the necessity of economy perhaps we might afford to spend more than some others she said but its so much better to give the money to the sanitary commission  furthermore said i i am going to put forth another paradox and say that very likely there are some people looking on my girls and commenting on them for extravagance in having three hats even though made over and contrived from last years stock  they cant know anything about it then said jenny decisively for certainly nobody can be decent and invest less in millinery than marianne and i do  when i was a young lady said my wife a welldressed girl got her a new bonnet in the spring and another in the fall that was the extent of her purchases in this line a secondbest bonnet left of last year did duty to relieve and preserve the best one my father was accounted welltodo but i had no more and wanted no more i also bought myself every spring two pair of gloves a dark and a light pair and wore them through the summer and another two through the winter one or two pair of white kids carefully cleaned carried me through all my parties hats had not been heard of and the great necessity which requires two or three new ones every spring and fall had not arisen yet i was reckoned a wellappearing girl who dressed liberally now a young lady who has a waterfallhat an oriolehat and a jockey must still be troubled with anxious cares for her spring and fall and summer and winter bonnetsall the variety will not take the place of them gloves are bought by the dozen and as to dresses there seems to be no limit to the quantity of material and trimming that may be expended upon them when i was a young lady seventyfive dollars a year was considered by careful parents a liberal allowance for a daughters wardrobe i had a hundred and was reckoned rich and i sometimes used a part to make up the deficiencies in the allowance of sarah evans my particular friend whose father gave her only fifty we all thought that a very scant allowance yet she generally made a very pretty and genteel appearance with the help of occasional presents from friends  how could a girl dress for fifty dollars said marianne  she could get a white muslin and a white cambric which with different sortings of ribbons served her for all dress occasions a silk in those days took only ten yards in the making and one dark silk was considered a reasonable allowance to a ladys wardrobe once made it stood for somethingalways worn carefully it lasted for years one or two calico morningdresses and a merino for winter wear completed the list then as to collars capes cuffs etc we all did our own embroidering and very pretty things we wore too girls looked as prettily then as they do now when four or five hundred dollars a year is insufficient to clothe them  but mamma you know our allowance isnt anything like thatit is quite a slender one though not so small as yours was said marianne dont you think the customs of society make a difference do you think as things are we could go back and dress for the sum you did  you cannot said my wife without a greater sacrifice of feeling than i wish to impose on you still though i dont see how to help it i cannot but think that the requirements of fashion are becoming needlessly extravagant particularly in regard to the dress of women it seems to me it is making the support of families so burdensome that young men are discouraged from marriage a young man in a moderately good business might cheerfully undertake the world with a wife who could make herself pretty and attractive for seventyfive dollars a year when he might sigh in vain for one who positively could not get through and be decent on four hundred women too are getting to be so attached to the trappings and accessories of life that they cannot think of marriage without an amount of fortune which few young men possess  you are talking in very low numbers about the dress of women said miss featherstone i do assure you that it is the easiest thing in the world for a girl to make away with a thousand dollars a year and not have so much to show for it either as marianne and jenny  to be sure said i only establish certain formulas of expectation and it is the easiest thing in the world for instance in your mothers day girls talked of a pair of glovesnow they talk of a pack then it was a bonnet summer and winternow it is a bonnet spring summer autumn and winter and hats like monthly rosesa new blossom every few weeks  and then said my wife every device of the toilet is immediately taken up and varied and improved on so as to impose an almost monthly necessity for novelty the jackets of may are outshone by the jackets of june the buttons of june are antiquated in july the trimmings of july are pass√©es by september sidecombs backcombs puffs rats and all sorts of such matters are in a distracted race of improvement every article of feminine toilet is on the move towards perfection it seems to me that an infinity of money must be spent in these trifles by those who make the least pretension to keep in the fashion  well papa said jenny after all its just the way things always have been since the world began you know the bible says can a maid forget her ornaments its clear she cant you see its a law of nature and you remember all that long chapter in the bible that we had read in church last sunday about the curls and veils and tinkling ornaments and crimpingpins and all that of those wicked daughters of zion in old times women always have been too much given to dress and they always will be  the thing is said marianne how can any woman i for example know what is too much or too little in mammas day it seems a girl could keep her place in society by hard economy and spend only fifty dollars a year on her dress mamma found a hundred dollars ample i have more than that and find myself quite straitened to keep myself looking well i dont want to live for dress to give all my time and thoughts to it i dont wish to be extravagant and yet i wish to be ladylikeit annoys and makes me unhappy not to be fresh and neat and nice shabbiness and seediness are my aversion i dont see where the fault is can one individual resist the whole current of society it certainly is not strictly necessary for us girls to have half the things we do we might i suppose live without many of them and as mamma says look just as well because girls did so before these things were invented now i confess i flatter myself generally that i am a pattern of good management and economy because i get so much less than other girls i associate with i wish you could see miss thornes fall dresses that she showed me last year when she was visiting here she had six gowns and no one of them could have cost less than seventy or eighty dollars and some of them must have been even more expensive and yet i dont doubt that this fall she will feel that she must have just as many more she runs through and wears out these expensive things with all their velvet and thread lace just as i wear my commonest ones and at the end of the season they are really gonespotted stained frayed the lace all pulled to piecesnothing left to save or make over i feel as if jenny and i were patterns of economy when i see such things i really dont know what economy is what is it  there is the same difficulty in my housekeeping said my wife i think i am an economist i mean to be one all our expenses are on a modest scale and yet i can see much that really is not strictly necessary but if i compare myself with some of my neighbors i feel as if i were hardly respectable there is no subject on which all the world are censuring one another so much as this hardly any one but thinks her neighbors extravagant in some one or more particulars and takes for granted that she herself is an economist  ill venture to say said i that there isnt a woman of my acquaintance that does not think she is an economist  papa is turned against us women like all the rest of them said jenny i wonder if it isnt just so with the men  yes said marianne its the fashion to talk as if all the extravagance of the country was perpetrated by women for my part i think young men are just as extravagant look at the sums they spend for cigars and meerschaumsan expense which hasnt even the pretense of usefulness in any way its a purely selfish nonsensical indulgence when a girl spends money in making herself look pretty she contributes something to the agreeableness of society but a mans cigars and pipes are neither ornamental nor useful  then look at their dress said jenny they are to the full as fussy and particular about it as girls they have as many fine invisible points of fashion and their fashions change quite as often and they have just as many knickknacks with their studs and their sleeve buttons and waistcoat buttons their scarfs and scarf pins their watch chains and seals and seal rings and nobody knows what then they often waste and throw away more than women because they are not good judges of material nor saving in what they buy and have no knowledge of how things should be cared for altered or mended if their cap is a little too tight they cut the lining with a penknife or slit holes in a new shirtcollar because it does not exactly fit to their mind for my part i think men are naturally twice as wasteful as women a pretty thing to be sure to have all the waste of the country laid to us  you are right child said i women are by nature as compared with men the caretaking and saving part of creationthe authors and conservators of economy as a general rule man earns and woman saves and applies the wastefulness of woman is commonly the fault of man  i dont see into that said bob stevens  in this way economy is the science of proportion whether a particular purchase is extravagant depends mainly on the income it is taken from suppose a woman has a hundred and fifty a year for her dress and gives fifty dollars for a bonnet she gives a third of her incomeit is a horrible extravagance while for the woman whose income is ten thousand it may be no extravagance at all the poor clergymans wife when she gives five dollars for a bonnet may be giving as much in proportion to her income as the woman who gives fifty now the difficulty with the greater part of women is that the men who make the money and hold it give them no kind of standard by which to measure their expenses most women and girls are in this matter entirely at sea without chart or compass they dont know in the least what they have to spend husbands and fathers often pride themselves about not saying a word on business matters to their wives and daughters they dont wish them to understand them or to inquire into them or to make remarks or suggestions concerning them i want you to have everything that is suitable and proper says jones to his wife but dont be extravagant  but my dear says mrs jones what is suitable and proper depends very much on our means if you could allow me any specific sum for dress and housekeeping i could tell better  nonsense susan i cant do thatits too much trouble get what you need and avoid foolish extravagances thats all i ask  by and by mrs joness bills are sent in in an evil hour when jones has heavy notes to meet and then comes a domestic storm  i shall just be ruined madam if thats the way you are going on i cant afford to dress you and the girls in the style you have set up look at this milliners bill  i assure you says mrs jones we havent got any more than the stebbinses nor so much  dont you know that the stebbinses are worth five times as much as ever i was  no mrs jones did not know it how should she when her husband makes it a rule never to speak of his business to her and she has not the remotest idea of his income  thus multitudes of good conscientious women and girls are extravagant from pure ignorance the male provider allows bills to be run up in his name and they have no earthly means of judging whether they are spending too much or too little except the semiannual hurricane which attends the coming in of these bills  the first essential in the practice of economy is a knowledge of ones income and the man who refuses to accord to his wife and children this information has never any right to accuse them of extravagance because he himself deprives them of that standard of comparison which is an indispensable requisite in economy as early as possible in the education of children they should pass from that state of irresponsible waiting to be provided for by parents and be trusted with the spending of some fixed allowance that they may learn prices and values and have some notion of what money is actually worth and what it will bring the simple fact of the possession of a fixed and definite income often suddenly transforms a giddy extravagant girl into a caretaking prudent little woman her allowance is her own she begins to plan upon itto add subtract multiply divide and do numberless sums in her little head she no longer buys everything she fancies she deliberates weighs compares and now there is room for selfdenial and generosity to come in she can do without this article she can furbish up some older possession to do duty a little longer and give this money to some friend poorer than she and ten to one the girl whose bills last year were four or five hundred finds herself bringing through this year creditably on a hundred and fifty to be sure she goes without numerous things which she used to have from the standpoint of a fixed income she sees that these are impossible and no more wants them than the green cheese of the moon she learns to make her own taste and skill take the place of expensive purchases she refits her hats and bonnets retrims her dresses and in a thousand busy earnest happy little ways sets herself to make the most of her small income  so the woman who has her definite allowance for housekeeping finds at once a hundred questions set at rest before it was not clear to her why she should not go and do likewise in relation to every purchase made by her next neighbor now there is a clear logic of proportion certain things are evidently not to be thought of though next neighbors do have them and we must resign ourselves to find some other way of living  my dear said my wife i think there is a peculiar temptation in a life organized as ours is in america there are here no settled classes with similar ratios of income mixed together in the same society going to the same parties and blended in daily neighborly intercourse are families of the most opposite extremes in point of fortune in england there is a very well understood expression that people should not dress or live above their station in america none will admit that they have any particular station or that they can live above it the principle of democratic equality unites in society people of the most diverse positions and means  here for instance is a family like dr seldens an old and highly respected one with an income of only two or three thousand yet they are people universally sought for in society and mingle in all the intercourse of life with merchant millionaires whose incomes are from ten to thirty thousand their sons and daughters go to the same schools the same parties and are thus constantly meeting upon terms of social equality  now it seems to me that our danger does not lie in the great and evident expenses of our richer friends we do not expect to have pineries graperies equipages horses diamondswe say openly and of course that we do not still our expenses are constantly increased by the proximity of these things unless we understand ourselves better than most people do we dont of course expect to get a fifteenhundreddollar cashmere like mrs soandso but we begin to look at hundreddollar shawls and nibble about the hook we dont expect sets of diamonds but a diamond ring a pair of solitaire diamond earrings begin to be speculated about among the young people as among possibilities we dont expect to carpet our house with axminster and hang our windows with damask but at least we must have brussels and brocatelleit would not do not to and so we go on getting hundreds of things that we dont need that have no real value except that they soothe our selflove and for these inferior articles we pay a higher proportion of our income than our rich neighbor does for his better ones nothing is uglier than lowpriced cashmere shawls and yet a young man just entering business will spend an eighth of a years income to put one on his wife and when he has put it there it only serves as a constant source of disquiet for now that the door is opened and cashmere shawls are possible she is consumed with envy at the superior ones constantly sported around her so also with pointlace velvet dresses and hundreds of things of that sort which belong to a certain rate of income and are absurd below it  and yet mamma i heard aunt easygo say that velvet pointlace and cashmere were the cheapest finery that could be bought because they lasted a lifetime  aunt easygo speaks from an income of ten thousand a year they may be cheap for her rate of living but for us for example by no magic of numbers can it be made to appear that it is cheaper to have the greatest bargain in the world in cashmere lace and diamonds than not to have them at all i never had a diamond never wore a piece of pointlace never had a velvet dress and have been perfectly happy and just as much respected as if i had who ever thought of objecting to me for not having them nobody that i ever heard  certainly not mamma said marianne  the thing i have always said to you girls is that you were not to expect to live like richer people not to begin to try not to think or inquire about certain rates of expenditure or take the first step in certain directions we have moved on all our life after a very antiquated and oldfashioned mode we have had our little oldfashioned house our little oldfashioned ways  except the parlor carpet and what came of it my dear said i mischievously  yes except the parlor carpet said my wife with a conscious twinkle and the things that came of it there was a concession there but one cant be wise always  we talked mamma into that said jenny  but one thing is certain said my wifethat though i have had an antiquated plain house and plain furniture and plain dress and not the beginning of a thing such as many of my neighbors have possessed i have spent more money than many of them for real comforts while i had young children i kept more and better servants than many women who wore cashmere and diamonds i thought it better to pay extra wages to a really good trusty woman who lived with me from year to year and relieved me of some of my heaviest family cares than to have ever so much lace locked away in my drawers we always were able to go into the country to spend our summers and to keep a good family horse and carriage for daily drivingby which means we afforded as a family very poor patronage to the medical profession then we built our house and while we left out a great many expensive commonplaces that other people think they must have we put in a profusion of bathing accommodations such as very few people think of having there never was a time when we did not feel able to afford to do what was necessary to preserve or to restore health and for this i always drew on the surplus fund laid up by my very unfashionable housekeeping and dressing  your mother has had said i what is the great want in america perfect independence of mind to go her own way without regard to the way others go i think there is for some reason more false shame among americans about economy than among europeans i cannot afford it is more seldom heard among us a young man beginning life whose income may be from five to eight hundred a year thinks it elegant and gallant to affect a careless air about money especially among ladiesto hand it out freely and put back his change without counting itto wear a watch chain and studs and shirtfronts like those of some young millionaire none but the most expensive tailors shoemakers and hatters will do for him and then he grumbles at the dearness of living and declares that he cannot get along on his salary the same is true of young girls and of married men and women toothe whole of them are ashamed of economy the cares that wear out life and health in many households are of a nature that cannot be cast on god or met by any promise from the bible it is not care for food convenient or for comfortable raiment but care to keep up false appearances and to stretch a narrow income over the space that can be covered only by a wider one  the poor widow in her narrow lodgings with her monthly rent staring her hourly in the face and her bread and meat and candles and meal all to be paid for on delivery or not obtained at all may find comfort in the good old book reading of that other widow whose wasting measure of oil and last failing handful of meal were of such account before her father in heaven that a prophet was sent to recruit them and when customers do not pay or wages are cut down she can enter into her chamber and when she hath shut her door present to her father in heaven his sure promise that with the fowls of the air she shall be fed and with the lilies of the field she shall be clothed but what promises are there for her who is racking her brains on the ways and means to provide as sumptuous an entertainment of oysters and champagne at her next party as her richer neighbor or to compass that great bargain which shall give her a pointlace set almost as handsome as that of mrs croesus who has ten times her income  but papa said marianne with a twinge of that exacting sensitiveness by which the child is characterized i think i am an economist thanks to you and mamma so far as knowing just what my income is and keeping within it but that does not satisfy me and it seems that isnt all of economy the question that haunts me is might i not make my little all do more and better than i do  there said i you have hit the broader and deeper signification of economy which is in fact the science of comparative values in its highest sense economy is a just judgment of the comparative value of thingsmoney only the means of enabling one to express that value this is the reason why the whole matter is so full of difficultywhy every one criticises his neighbor in this regard human beings are so various the necessities of each are so different they are made comfortable or uncomfortable by such opposite means that the spending of other peoples incomes must of necessity often look unwise from our standpoint for this reason multitudes of people who cannot be accused of exceeding their incomes often seem to others to be spending them foolishly and extravagantly  but is there no standard of value said marianne  there are certain things upon which there is a pretty general agreement verbally at least among mankind for instance it is generally agreed that health is an indispensable goodthat money is well spent that secures it and worse than ill spent that ruins it  with this standard in mind how much money is wasted even by people who do not exceed their income here a man builds a house and pays in the first place ten thousand more than he need for a location in a fashionable part of the city though the air will be closer and the chances of health less he spends three or four thousand more on a stone front on marble mantels imported from italy on plateglass windows plated hinges and a thousand nice points of finish and has perhaps but one bathroom for a whole household and that so connected with his own apartment that nobody but himself and his wife can use it  another man buys a lot in an open airy situation which fashion has not made expensive and builds without a stone front marble mantels or plateglass windows but has a perfect system of ventilation through his house and bathingrooms in every story so that the children and guests may all without inconvenience enjoy the luxury of abundant water  the first spends for fashion and show the second for health and comfort  here is a man that will buy his wife a diamond bracelet and a lace shawl and take her yearly to washington to show off her beauty in ball dresses who yet will not let her pay wages which will command any but the poorest and most inefficient domestic service the woman is worn out her life made a desert by exhaustion consequent on a futile attempt to keep up a showy establishment with only half the hands needed for the purpose another family will give brilliant parties have a gay season every year at the first hotels at newport and not be able to afford the wife a fire in her chamber in midwinter or the servants enough food to keep them from constantly deserting the damp mouldy dingy cellarkitchen the cold windy desolate attic devoid of any comfort where the domestics are doomed to pass their whole time are witnesses to what such families consider economy economy in the view of some is undisguised slipshod slovenliness in the home circle for the sake of fine clothes to be shown abroad it is undisguised hard selfishness to servants and dependants counting their every approach to comfort a needless wastegrudging the roman catholic cook her cup of tea at dinner on friday when she must not eat meatand murmuring that a cracked secondhand lookingglass must be got for the servants room what business have they to want to know how they look  some families will employ the cheapest physician without regard to his ability to kill or cure some will treat diseases in their incipiency with quack medicines bought cheap hoping thereby to fend off the doctors bill some women seem to be pursued by an evil demon of economy which like an ignis fatuus in a bog delights constantly to tumble them over into the mire of expense they are dismayed at the quantity of sugar in the recipe for preserves leave out a quarter and the whole ferments and is spoiled they cannot by any means be induced at any one time to buy enough silk to make a dress and the dress finally after many convulsions and alterations must be thrown by altogether as too scanty they get poor needles poor thread poor sugar poor raisins poor tea poor coal one wonders in looking at their blackened smouldering grates in a freezing day what the fire is there at all forit certainly warms nobody the only thing they seem likely to be lavish in is funeral expenses which come in the wake of leaky shoes and imperfect clothing these funeral expenses at last swallow all since nobody can dispute an undertakers bill one pities these joyless beings economy instead of a rational act of the judgment is a morbid monomania eating the pleasure out of life and haunting them to the grave  some peoples ideas of economy seem to run simply in the line of eating their flour is of an extra brand their meat the first cut the delicacies of every season in their dearest stages come home to their table with an apologetic smileit was scandalously dear my love but i thought we must just treat ourselves and yet these people cannot afford to buy books and pictures they regard as an unthoughtof extravagance trudging home with fifty dollars worth of delicacies on his arm smith meets jones who is exulting with a bag of crackers under one arm and a choice little bit of an oil painting under the other which he thinks a bargain at fifty dollars i cant afford to buy pictures smith says to his spouse and i dont know how jones and his wife manage jones and his wife will live on bread and milk for a month and she will turn her best gown the third time but they will have their picture and they are happy joness picture remains and smiths fifty dollars worth of oysters and canned fruit tomorrow will be gone forever of all modes of spending money the swallowing of expensive dainties brings the least return there is one step lower than thisthe consuming of luxuries that are injurious to the health if all the money spent on tobacco and liquors could be spent in books and pictures i predict that nobodys health would be a whit less sound and houses would be vastly more attractive there is enough money spent in smoking drinking and overeating to give every family in the community a good library to hang everybodys parlor walls with lovely pictures to set up in every house a conservatory which should bloom all winter with choice flowers to furnish every dwelling with ample bathing and warming accommodations even down to the dwellings of the poor and in the millennium i believe this is the way things are to be  in these times of peril and suffering if the inquiry arises how shall there be retrenchment i answer first and foremost retrench things needless doubtful and positively hurtful as rum tobacco and all the meerschaums of divers colors that do accompany the same second retrench all eating not necessary to health and comfort a french family would live in luxury on the leavings that are constantly coming from the tables of those who call themselves in middling circumstances there are superstitions of the table that ought to be broken through why must you always have cake in your closet why need you feel undone to entertain a guest with no cake on your teatable do without it a year and ask yourselves if you or your children or any one else have suffered materially in consequence  why is it imperative that you should have two or three courses at every meal try the experiment of having but one and that a very good one and see if any great amount of suffering ensues why must social intercourse so largely consist in eating in paris there is a very pretty custom each family has one evening in the week when it stays at home and receives friends tea with a little bread and butter and cake served in the most informal way is the only refreshment the rooms are full busy brighteverything as easy and joyous as if a monstrous supper with piles of jelly and mountains of cake were waiting to give the company a nightmare at the close  said a lady pointing to a gentleman and his wife in a social circle of this kind i ought to know them welli have seen them every week for twenty years it is certainly pleasant and confirmative of social enjoyment for friends to eat together but a little enjoyed in this way answers the purpose as well as a great deal and better too  well papa said marianne in the matter of dress nowhow much ought one to spend just to look as others do  i will tell you what i saw the other night girls in the parlor of one of our hotels two middleaged quaker ladies came gliding in with calm cheerful faces and lustrous dovecolored silks by their conversation i found that they belonged to that class of women among the friends who devote themselves to traveling on missions of benevolence they had just completed a tour of all the hospitals for wounded soldiers in the country where they had been carrying comforts arranging advising and soothing by their cheerful gentle presence they were now engaged on another mission to the lost and erring of their own sex night after night guarded by a policeman they had ventured after midnight into the dancehouses where girls are being led to ruin and with gentle words of tender motherly counsel sought to win them from their fatal waystelling them where they might go the next day to find friends who would open to them an asylum and aid them to seek a better life  as i looked upon these women dressed with such modest purity i began secretly to think that the apostle was not wrong when he spoke of women adorning themselves with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit for the habitual gentleness of their expression the calmness and purity of the lines in their faces the delicacy and simplicity of their apparel seemed of themselves a rare and peculiar beauty i could not help thinking that fashionable bonnets flowing lace sleeves and dresses elaborately trimmed could not have improved even their outward appearance doubtless their simple wardrobe needed but a small trunk in traveling from place to place and hindered but little their prayers and ministrations  now it is true all women are not called to such a life as this but might not all women take a leaf at least from their book i submit the inquiry humbly it seems to me that there are many who go monthly to the sacrament and receive it with sincere devotion and who give thanks each time sincerely that they are thus made members incorporate in the mystical body of christ who have never thought of this membership as meaning that they should share christs sacrifices for lost souls or abridge themselves of one ornament or encounter one inconvenience for the sake of those wandering sheep for whom he died certainly there is a higher economy which we need to learnthat which makes all things subservient to the spiritual and immortal and that not merely to the good of our own souls and those of our family but of all who are knit with us in the great bonds of human brotherhood  there have been from time to time among wellmeaning christian people retrenchment societies on high moral grounds which have failed for want of knowledge how to manage the complicated question of necessaries and luxuries these words have a signification in the case of different people as varied as the varieties of human habit and constitution it is a department impossible to be bound by external rules but none the less should every highminded christian soul in this matter have a law unto itself it may safely be laid down as a general rule that no income however large or however small should be unblessed by the divine touch of selfsacrifice something for the poor the sorrowing the hungry the tempted and the weak should be taken from what is our own at the expense of some personal sacrifice or we suffer more morally than the brother from whom we withdraw it even the lord of all when dwelling among men out of that slender private purse which he accepted for his little family of chosen ones had ever something reserved to give to the poor it is easy to say it is but a drop in the bucket i cannot remove the great mass of misery in the world what little i could save or give does nothing it does this if no moreit prevents one soul and that soul your own from drying and hardening into utter selfishness and insensibility it enables you to say i have done something taken one atom from the great heap of sins and miseries and placed it on the side of good  the sisters of charity and the friends each with their different costume of plainness and selfdenial and other noblehearted women of no particular outward order but kindred in spirit have shown to womanhood on the battlefield and in the hospital a more excellent waya beauty and nobility before which all the common graces and ornaments of the sex fade appear like dim candles by the pure eternal stars     ix  servants   in the course of my papers various domestic revolutions have occurred our marianne has gone from us with a new name to a new life and a modest little establishment not many squares off claims about as much of my wifes and jennys busy thoughts as those of the proper mistress  marianne as i always foresaw is a careful and somewhat anxious housekeeper her tastes are fastidious she is made for exactitude the smallest departures from the straight line appear to her shocking deviations she had always lived in a house where everything had been formed to quiet and order under the everpresent care and touch of her mother nor had she ever participated in those cares more than to do a little dusting of the parlor ornaments or wash the best china or make spongecake or chocolatecaramels certain conditions of life had always appeared so to be matters of course that she had never conceived of a house without them it never occurred to her that such bread and biscuit as she saw at the home table would not always and of course appear at every tablethat the silver would not always be as bright the glass as clear the salt as fine and smooth the plates and dishes as nicely arranged as she had always seen them apparently without the thought or care of any one for my wife is one of those housekeepers whose touch is so fine that no one feels it she is never heard scolding or reprovingnever entertains her company with her recipes for cookery or the faults of her servants she is so unconcerned about receiving her own personal share of credit for the good appearance of her establishment that even the children of the house have not supposed that there is any particular will of hers in the matter it all seems the natural consequence of having very good servants  one phenomenon they had never seriously reflected onthat under all the changes of the domestic cabinet which are so apt to occur in american households the same coffee the same bread and biscuit the same nicely prepared dishes and neatly laid table always gladdened their eyes and from this they inferred only that good servants were more abundant than most people had supposed they were somewhat surprised when these marvels were wrought by professedly green hands but were given to suppose that these green hands must have had some remarkable quickness or aptitude for acquiring that sparkling jelly wellflavored icecreams clear soups and delicate biscuits could be made by a raw irish girl fresh from her native erin seemed to them a proof of the genius of the race and my wife who never felt it important to attain to the reputation of a cook quietly let it pass  for some time therefore after the inauguration of the new household there was trouble in the camp sour bread had appeared on the table bitter acrid coffee had shocked and astonished the palate lint had been observed on tumblers and the spoons had sometimes dingy streaks on the brightness of their first bridal polish beds were detected made shockingly awry and marianne came burning with indignation to her mother  such a little family as we have and two strong girls said sheeverything ought to be perfect there is really nothing to do think of a whole batch of bread absolutely sour and when i gave that away then this morning another exactly like it and when i talked to cook about it she said she had lived in this and that family and her bread had always been praised as equal to the bakers  i dont doubt she is right said i many families never have anything but sour bread from one end of the year to the other eating it unperceiving and with good cheer and they buy also sour bread of the baker with like approbationlightness being in their estimation the only virtue necessary in the article  could you not correct her fault suggested my wife  i have done all i can i told her we could not have such bread that it was dreadful bob says it would give him the dyspepsia in a week and then she went and made exactly the same it seems to me mere willfulness  but said i suppose instead of such general directions you should analyze her proceedings and find out just where she makes her mistake is the root of the trouble in the yeast or in the time she begins it letting it rise too longthe time you know should vary so much with the temperature of the weather  as to that said marianne i know nothing i never noticed it never was my business to make bread it always seemed quite a simple process mixing yeast and flour and kneading it and our bread at home was always good  it seems then my dear that you have come to your profession without even having studied it  my wife smiled and said  you know marianne i proposed to you to be our family breadmaker for one month of the year before you married  yes mamma i remember but i was like other girls i thought there was no need of it i never liked to do such things perhaps i had better have done it  you certainly had said i for the first business of a housekeeper in america is that of a teacher she can have a good table only by having practical knowledge and tact in imparting it if she understands her business practically and experimentally her eye detects at once the weak spot it requires only a little tact some patience some clearness in giving directions and all comes right i venture to say that your mother would have exactly such bread as always appears on our table and have it by the hands of your cook because she could detect and explain to her exactly her error  do you know said my wife what yeast she uses  i believe said marianne its a kind she makes herself i think i heard her say so i know she makes a great fuss about it and rather values herself upon it she is evidently accustomed to being praised for her bread and feels mortified and angry and i dont know how to manage her  well said i if you carry your watch to a watchmaker and undertake to show him how to regulate the machinery he laughs and goes on his own way but if a brothermachinist makes suggestions he listens respectfully so when a woman who knows nothing of womans work undertakes to instruct one who knows more than she does she makes no impression but a woman who has been trained experimentally and shows she understands the matter thoroughly is listened to with respect  i think said my wife that your bridget is worth teaching she is honest wellprincipled and tidy she has good recommendations from excellent families whose ideas of good bread it appears differ from ours and with a little goodnature tact and patience she will come into your ways  but the coffee mammayou would not imagine it to be from the same bag with your own so dark and so bitter what do you suppose she has done to it  simply this said my wife she has let the berries stay a few moments too long over the firethey are burnt instead of being roasted and there are people who think it essential to good coffee that it should look black and have a strong bitter flavor a very little change in the preparing will alter this  now said i marianne if you want my advice ill give it to you gratis make your own bread for one month simple as the process seems i think it will take as long as that to give you a thorough knowledge of all the possibilities in the case but after that you will never need to make any moreyou will be able to command good bread by the aid of all sorts of servants you will in other words be a thoroughly prepared teacher  i did not think said marianne that so simple a thing required so much attention  it is simple said my wife and yet requires a delicate care and watchfulness there are fifty ways to spoil good bread there are a hundred little things to be considered and allowed for that require accurate observation and experience the same process that will raise good bread in cold weather will make sour bread in the heat of summer different qualities of flour require variations in treatment as also different sorts and conditions of yeast and when all is done the baking presents another series of possibilities which require exact attention  so it appears said marianne gayly that i must begin to study my profession at the eleventh hour  better late than never said i but there is this advantage on your side a welltrained mind accustomed to reflect analyze and generalize has an advantage over uncultured minds even of double experience poor as your cook is she now knows more of her business than you do after a very brief period of attention and experiment you will not only know more than she does but you will convince her that you do which is quite as much to the purpose  in the same manner said my wife you will have to give lessons to your other girl on the washing of silver and the making of beds good servants do not often come to us they must be made by patience and training and if a girl has a good disposition and a reasonable degree of handiness and the housekeeper understands her profession she may make a good servant out of an indifferent one some of my best girls have been those who came to me directly from the ship with no preparation but docility and some natural quickness the hardest cases to be managed are not of those who have been taught nothing but of those who have been taught wronglywho come to you selfopinionated with ways which are distasteful to you and contrary to the genius of your housekeeping such require that their mistress shall understand at least so much of the actual conduct of affairs as to prove to the servant that there are better ways than those in which she has hitherto been trained  dont you think mamma said marianne that there has been a sort of reaction against womans work in our day so much has been said of the higher sphere of woman and so much has been done to find some better work for her that insensibly i think almost everybody begins to feel that it is rather degrading for a woman in good society to be much tied down to family affairs  especially said my wife since in these womans rights conventions there is so much indignation expressed at those who would confine her ideas to the kitchen and nursery  there is reason in all things said i womans rights conventions are a protest against many former absurd unreasonable ideasthe mere physical and culinary idea of womanhood as connected only with puddings and shirtbuttons the unjust and unequal burdens which the laws of harsher ages had cast upon the sex many of the women connected with these movements are as superior in everything properly womanly as they are in exceptional talent and culture there is no manner of doubt that the sphere of woman is properly to be enlarged and that republican governments in particular are to be saved from corruption and failure only by allowing to woman this enlarged sphere every woman has rights as a human being first which belong to no sex and ought to be as freely conceded to her as if she were a manand first and foremost the great right of doing anything which god and nature evidently have fitted her to excel in if she be made a natural orator like miss dickinson or an astronomer like mrs somerville or a singer like grisi let not the technical rules of womanhood be thrown in the way of her free use of her powers nor can there be any reason shown why a womans vote in the state should not be received with as much respect as in the family a state is but an association of families and laws relate to the rights and immunities which touch womans most private and immediate wants and dearest hopes and there is no reason why sister wife and mother should be more powerless in the state than in the home nor does it make a woman unwomanly to express an opinion by dropping a slip of paper into a box more than to express that same opinion by conversation in fact there is no doubt that in all matters relating to the interests of education temperance and religion the state would be a material gainer by receiving the votes of women  but having said all this i must admit per contra not only a great deal of crude disagreeable talk in these conventions but a too great tendency of the age to make the education of women antidomestic it seems as if the world never could advance except like ships under a head wind tacking and going too far now in this direction and now in the opposite our commonschool system now rejects sewing from the education of girls which very properly used to occupy many hours daily in school a generation ago the daughters of laborers and artisans are put through algebra geometry trigonometry and the higher mathematics to the entire neglect of that learning which belongs distinctively to woman a girl cannot keep pace with her class if she gives any time to domestic matters and accordingly she is excused from them all during the whole term of her education the boy of a family at an early age is put to a trade or the labors of a farm the father becomes impatient of his support and requires of him to care for himself hence an interrupted educationlearning coming by snatches in the winter months or in the intervals of work as the result the females in our country towns are commonly in mental culture vastly in advance of the males of the same household but with this comes a physical delicacy the result of an exclusive use of the brain and a neglect of the muscular system with great inefficiency in practical domestic duties the race of strong hardy cheerful girls that used to grow up in country places and made the bright neat new england kitchens of old timesthe girls that could wash iron brew bake harness a horse and drive him no less than braid straw embroider draw paint and read innumerable booksthis race of women pride of olden time is daily lessening and in their stead come the fragile easily fatigued languid girls of a modern age drilled in booklearning ignorant of common things the great danger of all this and of the evils that come from it is that society by and by will turn as blindly against female intellectual culture as it now advocates it and having worked disproportionately one way will work disproportionately in the opposite direction  the fact is said my wife that domestic service is the great problem of life here in america the happiness of families their thrift wellbeing and comfort are more affected by this than by any one thing else our girls as they have been brought up cannot perform the labor of their own families as in those simpler oldfashioned days you tell of and what is worse they have no practical skill with which to instruct servants and servants come to us as a class raw and untrained so what is to be done in the present state of prices the board of a domestic costs double her wages and the waste she makes is a more serious matter still suppose you give us an article upon this subject in your house and home papers you could not have a better one                                       so i sat down and wrote thus on   servants and service  many of the domestic evils in america originate in the fact that while society here is professedly based on new principles which ought to make social life in every respect different from the life of the old world yet these principles have never been so thought out and applied as to give consistency and harmony to our daily relations america starts with a political organization based on a declaration of the primitive freedom and equality of all men every human being according to this principle stands on the same natural level with every other and has the same chance to rise according to the degree of power or capacity given by the creator all our civil institutions are designed to preserve this equality as far as possible from generation to generation there is no entailed property there are no hereditary titles no monopolies no privileged classesall are to be as free to rise and fall as the waves of the sea  the condition of domestic service however still retains about it something of the influences from feudal times and from the near presence of slavery in neighboring states all english literature all the literature of the world describes domestic service in the old feudal spirit and with the old feudal language which regarded the master as belonging to a privileged class and the servant to an inferior one there is not a play not a poem not a novel not a history that does not present this view the masters rights like the rights of kings were supposed to rest in his being born in a superior rank the good servant was one who from childhood had learned to order himself lowly and reverently to all his betters when new england brought to these shores the theory of democracy she brought in the persons of the first pilgrims the habits of thought and of action formed in aristocratic communities winthrops journal and all the old records of the earlier colonists show households where masters and mistresses stood on the right divine of the privileged classes howsoever they might have risen up against authorities themselves  the first consequence of this state of things was a universal rejection of domestic service in all classes of americanborn society for a generation or two there was indeed a sort of interchange of family strengthsons and daughters engaging in the service of neighboring families in default of a sufficient working force of their own but always on conditions of strict equality the assistant was to share the table the family sittingroom and every honor and attention that might be claimed by son or daughter when families increased in refinement and education so as to make these conditions of close intimacy with more uncultured neighbors disagreeable they had to choose between such intimacies and the performance of their own domestic toil no wages could induce a son or daughter of new england to take the condition of a servant on terms which they thought applicable to that of a slave the slightest hint of a separate table was resented as an insult not to enter the front door and not to sit in the front parlor on state occasions was bitterly commented on as a personal indignity  the welltaught selfrespecting daughters of farmers the class most valuable in domestic service gradually retired from it they preferred any other employment however laborious beyond all doubt the labors of a wellregulated family are more healthy more cheerful more interesting because less monotonous than the mechanical toils of a factory yet the girls of new england with one consent preferred the factory and left the whole business of domestic service to a foreign population and they did it mainly because they would not take positions in families as an inferior laboring class by the side of others of their own age who assumed as their prerogative to live without labor  i cant let you have one of my daughters said an energetic matron to her neighbor from the city who was seeking for a servant in her summer vacation if you hadnt daughters of your own maybe i would but my girls aint going to work so that your girls may live in idleness  it was vain to offer money we dont need your money maam we can support ourselves in other ways my girls can braid straw and bind shoes but they aint going to be slaves to anybody  in the irish and german servants who took the place of americans in families there was to begin with the tradition of education in favor of a higher class but even the foreign population became more or less infected with the spirit of democracy they came to this country with vague notions of freedom and equality and in ignorant and uncultivated people such ideas are often more unreasonable for being vague they did not indeed claim a seat at the table and in the parlor but they repudiated many of those habits of respect and courtesy which belonged to their former condition and asserted their own will and way in the round unvarnished phrase which they supposed to be their right as republican citizens life became a sort of domestic wrangle and struggle between the employers who secretly confessed their weakness but endeavored openly to assume the air and bearing of authority and the employed who knew their power and insisted on their privileges from this cause domestic service in america has had less of mutual kindliness than in old countries its terms have been so ill understood and defined that both parties have assumed the defensive and a common topic of conversation in american female society has often been the general servile war which in one form or another was going on in their different familiesa war as interminable as would be a struggle between aristocracy and common people undefined by any bill of rights or constitution and therefore opening fields for endless disputes in england the class who go to service are a class and service is a profession the distance between them and their employers is so marked and defined and all the customs and requirements of the position are so perfectly understood that the master or mistress has no fear of being compromised by condescension and no need of the external voice or air of authority the higher up in the social scale one goes the more courteous seems to become the intercourse of master and servant the more perfect and real the power the more is it veiled in outward expressioncommands are phrased as requests and gentleness of voice and manner covers an authority which no one would think of offending without trembling  but in america all is undefined in the first place there is no class who mean to make domestic service a profession to live and die in it is universally an expedient a steppingstone to something higher your best servants always have something else in view as soon as they have laid by a little money some form of independence which shall give them a home of their own is constantly in mind families look forward to the buying of landed homesteads and the scattered brothers and sisters work awhile in domestic service to gain the common fund for the purpose your seamstress intends to become a dressmaker and take in work at her own house your cook is pondering a marriage with the baker which shall transfer her toils from your cookingstove to her own young women are eagerly rushing into every other employment till female trades and callings are all overstocked we are continually harrowed with tales of the sufferings of distressed needlewomen of the exactions and extortions practiced on the frail sex in the many branches of labor and trade at which they try their hands and yet women will encounter all these chances of ruin and starvation rather than make up their minds to permanent domestic service now what is the matter with domestic service one would think on the face of it that a calling which gives a settled home a comfortable room rentfree with fire and lights good board and lodging and steady wellpaid wages would certainly offer more attractions than the making of shirts for tenpence with all the risks of providing ones own sustenance and shelter  i think it is mainly from the want of a definite idea of the true position of a servant under our democratic institutions that domestic service is so shunned and avoided in america that it is the very last thing which an intelligent young woman will look to for a living it is more the want of personal respect toward those in that position than the labors incident to it which repels our people from it many would be willing to perform these labors but they are not willing to place themselves in a situation where their selfrespect is hourly wounded by the implication of a degree of inferiority which does not follow any kind of labor or service in this country but that of the family  there exists in the minds of employers an unsuspected spirit of superiority which is stimulated into an active form by the resistance which democracy inspires in the working class many families think of servants only as a necessary evil their wages as exactions and all that is allowed them as so much taken from the family and they seek in every way to get from them as much and to give them as little as possible their rooms are the neglected illfurnished incommodious onesand the kitchen is the most cheerless and comfortless place in the house other families more goodnatured and liberal provide their domestics with more suitable accommodations and are more indulgent but there is still a latent spirit of something like contempt for the position that they treat their servants with so much consideration seems to them a merit entitling them to the most prostrate gratitude and they are constantly disappointed and shocked at that want of sense of inferiority on the part of these people which leads them to appropriate pleasant rooms good furniture and good living as mere matters of common justice  it seems to be a constant surprise to some employers that servants should insist on having the same human wants as themselves ladies who yawn in their elegantly furnished parlors among books and pictures if they have not company parties or opera to diversify the evening seem astonished and half indignant that cook and chambermaid are more disposed to go out for an evening gossip than to sit on hard chairs in the kitchen where they have been toiling all day the pretty chambermaids anxieties about her dress the time she spends at her small and not very clear mirror are sneeringly noticed by those whose toiletcares take up serious hours and the question has never apparently occurred to them why a servingmaid should not want to look pretty as well as her mistress she is a woman as well as they with all a womans wants and weaknesses and her dress is as much to her as theirs to them  a vast deal of trouble among servants arises from impertinent interferences and petty tyrannical exactions on the part of employers now the authority of the master and mistress of a house in regard to their domestics extends simply to the things they have contracted to do and the hours during which they have contracted to serve otherwise than this they have no more right to interfere with them in the disposal of their time than with any mechanic whom they employ they have indeed a right to regulate the hours of their own household and servants can choose between conformity to these hours and the loss of their situation but within reasonable limits their right to come and go at their own discretion in their own time should be unquestioned  if employers are troubled by the fondness of their servants for dancing evening company and late hours the proper mode of proceeding is to make these matters a subject of distinct contract in hiring the more strictly and perfectly the business matters of the first engagement of domestics are conducted the more likelihood there is of mutual quiet and satisfaction in the relation it is quite competent to every housekeeper to say what practices are or are not consistent with the rules of her family and what will be inconsistent with the service for which she agrees to pay it is much better to regulate such affairs by cool contract in the outset than by warm altercations and protracted domestic battles  as to the terms of social intercourse it seems somehow to be settled in the minds of many employers that their servants owe them and their family more respect than they and the family owe to the servants but do they what is the relation of servant to employer in a democratic country precisely that of a person who for money performs any kind of service for you the carpenter comes into your house to put up a set of shelvesthe cook comes into your kitchen to cook your dinner you never think that the carpenter owes you any more respect than you owe to him because he is in your house doing your behests he is your fellowcitizen you treat him with respect you expect to be treated with respect by him you have a claim on him that he shall do your work according to your directionsno more now i apprehend that there is a very common notion as to the position and rights of servants which is quite different from this is it not a common feeling that a servant is one who may be treated with a degree of freedom by every member of the family which he or she may not return do not people feel at liberty to question servants about their private affairs to comment on their dress and appearance in a manner which they would feel to be an impertinence if reciprocated do they not feel at liberty to express dissatisfaction with their performances in rude and unceremonious terms to reprove them in the presence of company while yet they require that the dissatisfaction of servants shall be expressed only in terms of respect a woman would not feel herself at liberty to talk to her milliner or her dressmaker in language as devoid of consideration as she will employ towards her cook or chambermaid yet both are rendering her a service which she pays for in money and one is no more made her inferior thereby than the other both have an equal right to be treated with courtesy the master and mistress of a house have a right to require respectful treatment from all whom their roof shelters but they have no more right to exact it of servants than of every guest and every child and they themselves owe it as much to servants as to guests  in order that servants may be treated with respect and courtesy it is not necessary as in simpler patriarchal days that they sit at the family table your carpenter or plumber does not feel hurt that you do not ask him to dine with you nor your milliner and mantuamaker that you do not exchange ceremonious calls and invite them to your parties it is well understood that your relations with them are of a mere business character they never take it as an assumption of superiority on your part that you do not admit them to relations of private intimacy there may be the most perfect respect and esteem and even friendship between them and you notwithstanding so it may be in the case of servants it is easy to make any person understand that there are quite other reasons than the assumption of personal superiority for not wishing to admit servants to the family privacy it was not in fact to sit in the parlor or at the table in themselves considered that was the thing aimed at by new england girlsthese were valued only as signs that they were deemed worthy of respect and consideration and where freely conceded were often in point of fact declined  let servants feel in their treatment by their employers and in the atmosphere of the family that their position is held to be a respectable one let them feel in the mistress of the family the charm of unvarying consideration and good manners let their work rooms be made convenient and comfortable and their private apartments bear some reasonable comparison in point of agreeableness to those of other members of the family and domestic service will be more frequently sought by a superior and selfrespecting class there are families in which such a state of things prevails and such families amid the many causes which unite to make the tenure of service uncertain have generally been able to keep good permanent servants  there is an extreme into which kindly disposed people often run with regard to servants which may be mentioned here they make pets of them they give extravagant wages and indiscreet indulgences and through indolence and easiness of temper tolerate neglect of duty many of the complaints of the ingratitude of servants come from those who have spoiled them in this way while many of the longest and most harmonious domestic unions have sprung from a simple quiet course of christian justice and benevolence a recognition of servants as fellowbeings and fellowchristians and a doing to them as we would in like circumstances that they should do to us  the mistresses of american families whether they like it or not have the duties of missionaries imposed upon them by that class from which our supply of domestic servants is drawn they may as well accept the position cheerfully and as one raw untrained hand after another passes through their family and is instructed by them in the mysteries of good housekeeping comfort themselves with the reflection that they are doing something to form good wives and mothers for the republic  the complaints made of irish girls are numerous and loud the failings of green erin alas are but too open and manifest yet in arrest of judgment let us move this consideration let us imagine our own daughters between the ages of sixteen and twentyfour untaught and inexperienced in domestic affairs as they commonly are shipped to a foreign shore to seek service in families it may be questioned whether as a whole they would do much better the girls that fill our families and do our housework are often of the age of our own daughters standing for themselves without mothers to guide them in a foreign country not only bravely supporting themselves but sending home in every ship remittances to impoverished friends left behind if our daughters did as much for us should we not be proud of their energy and heroism  when we go into the houses of our country we find a majority of wellkept wellordered and even elegant establishments where the only hands employed are those of the daughters of erin true american women have been their instructors and many a weary hour of care have they had in the discharge of this office but the result on the whole is beautiful and good and the end of it doubtless will be peace  in speaking of the office of the american mistress as being a missionary one we are far from recommending any controversial interference with the religious faith of our servants it is far better to incite them to be good christians in their own way than to run the risk of shaking their faith in all religion by pointing out to them the errors of that in which they have been educated the general purity of life and propriety of demeanor of so many thousands of undefended young girls cast yearly upon our shores with no home but their church and no shield but their religion are a sufficient proof that this religion exerts an influence over them not to be lightly trifled with but there is a real unity even in opposite christian forms and the roman catholic servant and the protestant mistress if alike possessed by the spirit of christ and striving to conform to the golden rule cannot help being one in heart though one go to mass and the other to meeting  finally the bitter baptism through which we are passing the life blood dearer than our own which is drenching distant fields should remind us of the preciousness of distinctive american ideas they who would seek in their foolish pride to establish the pomp of liveried servants in america are doing that which is simply absurd a servant can never in our country be the mere appendage to another man to be marked like a sheep with the color of his owner he must be a fellowcitizen with an established position of his own free to make contracts free to come and go and having in his sphere titles to consideration and respect just as definite as those of any trade or profession whatever  moreover we cannot in this country maintain to any great extent large retinues of servants even with ample fortunes they are forbidden by the general character of society here which makes them cumbrous and difficult to manage every mistress of a family knows that her cares increase with every additional servant two keep the peace with each other and their employer three begin a possible discord which possibility increases with four and becomes certain with five or six trained housekeepers such as regulate the complicated establishments of the old world form a class that are not and from the nature of the case never will be found in any great numbers in this country all such women as a general thing are keeping and prefer to keep houses of their own  a moderate style of housekeeping small compact and simple domestic establishments must necessarily be the general order of life in america so many openings of profit are to be found in this country that domestic service necessarily wants the permanence which forms so agreeable a feature of it in the old world this being the case it should be an object in america to exclude from the labors of the family all that can with greater advantage be executed out of it by combined labor  formerly in new england soap and candles were to be made in each separate family now comparatively few take this toil upon them we buy soap of the soapmaker and candles of the candlefactor this principle might be extended much further in france no family makes its own bread and better bread cannot be eaten than what can be bought at the appropriate shops no family does its own washing the familys linen is all sent to women who making this their sole profession get it up with a care and nicety which can seldom be equaled in any family  how would it simplify the burdens of the american housekeeper to have washing and ironing day expunged from her calendar how much more neatly and compactly could the whole domestic system be arranged if all the money that each separate family spends on the outfit and accommodations for washing and ironing on fuel soap starch and the other et ceteras were united in a fund to create a laundry for every dozen families one or two good women could do in firstrate style what now is very indifferently done by the disturbance and disarrangement of all other domestic processes in these families whoever sets neighborhood laundries on foot will do much to solve the american housekeepers hardest problem  finally american women must not try with three servants to carry on life in the style which in the old world requires sixteen they must thoroughly understand and be prepared to teach every branch of housekeeping they must study to make domestic service desirable by treating their servants in a way to lead them to respect themselves and to feel themselves respected and there will gradually be evolved from the present confusion a solution of the domestic problem which shall be adapted to the life of a new and growing world     x  cookery   my wife and i were sitting at the open bowwindow of my study watching the tuft of brightred leaves on our favorite maple which warned us that summer was over i was solacing myself like all the world in our days with reading the sch√∂nberg cotta family when my wife made her voice heard through the enchanted distance and dispersed the pretty vision of german cottage life  chris  well my dear  do you know the day of the month  now my wife knows this is a thing that i never do know that i cant know and in fact that there is no need i should trouble myself about since she always knows and what is more always tells me in fact the question when asked by her meant more than met the ear it was a delicate way of admonishing me that another paper for the atlantic ought to be in train and so i answered not to the external form but to the internal intention  well you see my dear i havent made up my mind what my next paper shall be about  suppose then you let me give you a subject  sovereign lady speak on your slave hears  well then take cookery it may seem a vulgar subject but i think more of health and happiness depends on that than on any other one thing you may make houses enchantingly beautiful hang them with pictures have them clean and airy and convenient but if the stomach is fed with sour bread and burnt coffee it will raise such rebellions that the eyes will see no beauty anywhere now in the little tour that you and i have been taking this summer i have been thinking of the great abundance of splendid material we have in america compared with the poor cooking how often in our stoppings we have sat down to tables loaded with material originally of the very best kind which had been so spoiled in the treatment that there was really nothing to eat green biscuits with acrid spots of alkali sour yeastbread meat slowly simmered in fat till it seemed like grease itself and slowly congealing in cold grease and above all that unpardonable enormity strong butter how often i have longed to show people what might have been done with the raw material out of which all these monstrosities were concocted  my dear said i you are driving me upon delicate ground would you have your husband appear in public with that most opprobrious badge of the domestic furies a dishcloth pinned to his coattail it is coming to exactly the point i have always predicted mrs crowfield you must write yourself i always told you that you could write far better than i if you would only try only sit down and write as you sometimes talk to me and i might hang up my pen by the side of uncle neds fiddle and bow  oh nonsense said my wife i never could write i know what ought to be said and i could say it to any one but my ideas freeze in the pen cramp in my fingers and make my brain seem like heavy bread i was born for extemporary speaking besides i think the best things on all subjects in this world of ours are said not by the practical workers but by the careful observers  mrs crowfield that remark is as good as if i had made it myself said i it is true that i have been all my life a speculator and observer in all domestic matters having them so confidentially under my eye in our own household and so if i write on a pure womans matter it must be understood that i am only your pen and mouthpieceonly giving tangible form to wisdom which i have derived from you  so down i sat and scribbled while my sovereign lady quietly stitched by my side and here i tell my reader that i write on such a subject under protestdeclaring again my conviction that if my wife only believed in herself as firmly as i do she would write so that nobody would ever want to listen to me again   cookery  we in america have the raw material of provision in greater abundance than any other nation there is no country where an ample wellfurnished table is more easily spread and for that reason perhaps none where the bounties of providence are more generally neglected i do not mean to say that the traveler through the length and breadth of our land could not on the whole find an average of comfortable subsistence yet considering that our resources are greater than those of any other civilized people our results are comparatively poorer  it is said that a list of the summer vegetables which are exhibited on new york hotel tables being shown to a french artiste he declared that to serve such a dinner properly would take till midnight i recollect how i was once struck with our national plenteousness on returning from a continental tour and going directly from the ship to a new york hotel in the bounteous season of autumn for months i had been habituated to my neat little bits of chop or poultry garnished with the inevitable cauliflower or potato which seemed to be the sole possibility after the reign of green peas was over now i sat down all at once to a carnival of vegetablesripe juicy tomatoes raw or cooked cucumbers in brittle slices rich yellow sweet potatoes broad limabeans and beans of other and various names tempting ears of indian corn steaming in enormous piles and great smoking tureens of the savory succotash an indian gift to the table for which civilization need not blush sliced eggplant in delicate fritters and marrow squashes of creamy pulp and sweetness a rich variety embarrassing to the appetite and perplexing to the choice verily the thought has often impressed itself on my mind that the vegetarian doctrine preached in america left a man quite as much as he had capacity to eat or enjoy and that in the midst of such tantalizing abundance he really lost the apology which elsewhere bears him out in preying upon his less gifted and accomplished animal neighbors  but with all this the american table taken as a whole is inferior to that of england or france it presents a fine abundance of material carelessly and poorly treated the management of food is nowhere in the world perhaps more slovenly and wasteful everything betokens that want of care that waits on abundance there are great capabilities and poor execution a tourist through england can seldom fail at the quietest country inn of finding himself served with the essentials of english table comforthis muttonchop done to a turn his steaming little private apparatus for concocting his own tea his choice pot of marmalade or slice of cold ham and his delicate rolls and creamy butter all served with care and neatness in france one never asks in vain for delicious caf√©aulait good bread and butter a nice omelet or some savory little portion of meat with a french name but to a tourist taking like chance in american country fare what is the prospect what is the coffee what the tea and the meat and above all the butter  in lecturing on cookery as on housebuilding i divide the subject into not four but five grand elements first bread second butter third meat fourth vegetables and fifth teaby which i mean generically all sorts of warm comfortable drinks served out in teacups whether they be called tea coffee chocolate broma or what not  i affirm that if these five departments are all perfect the great ends of domestic cookery are answered so far as the comfort and wellbeing of life are concerned i am aware that there exists another department which is often regarded by culinary amateurs and young aspirants as the higher branch and very collegiate course of practical cookery to wit confectionery by which i mean to designate all pleasing and complicated compounds of sweets and spices devised not for health and nourishment and strongly suspected of interfering with bothmere tolerated gratifications of the palate which we eat not with the expectation of being benefited but only with the hope of not being injured by them in this large department rank all sorts of cakes pies preserves ices etc i shall have a word or two to say under this head before i have done i only remark now that in my tours about the country i have often had a virulent illwill excited towards these works of culinary supererogation because i thought their excellence was attained by treading under foot and disregarding the five grand essentials i have sat at many a table garnished with three or four kinds of wellmade cake compounded with citron and spices and all imaginable good things where the meat was tough and greasy the bread some hot preparation of flour lard saleratus and acid and the butter unutterably detestable at such tables i have thought that if the mistress of the feast had given the care time and labor to preparing the simple items of bread butter and meat that she evidently had given to the preparation of these extras the lot of a traveler might be much more comfortable evidently she never had thought of these common articles as constituting a good table so long as she had puff pastry rich black cake clear jelly and preserves she seemed to consider that such unimportant matters as bread butter and meat could take care of themselves it is the same inattention to common things as that which leads people to build houses with stone fronts and windowcaps and expensive frontdoor trimmings without bathingrooms or fireplaces or ventilators  those who go into the country looking for summer board in farmhouses know perfectly well that a table where the butter is always fresh the tea and coffee of the best kinds and well made and the meats properly kept dressed and served is the one table of a hundred the fabulous enchanted island it seems impossible to get the idea into the minds of people that what is called common food carefully prepared becomes in virtue of that very care and attention a delicacy superseding the necessity of artificially compounded dainties  to begin then with the very foundation of a good tablebread what ought it to be it should be light sweet and tender  this matter of lightness is the distinctive line between savage and civilized bread the savage mixes simple flour and water into balls of paste which he throws into boiling water and which come out solid glutinous masses of which his common saying is man eat dis he no diewhich a facetious traveler who was obliged to subsist on it interpreted to mean dis no kill you nothing will in short it requires the stomach of a wild animal or of a savage to digest this primitive form of bread and of course more or less attention in all civilized modes of bread making is given to producing lightness by lightness is meant simply that the particles are to be separated from each other by little holes or aircells and all the different methods of making light bread are neither more nor less than the formation in bread of these aircells  so far as we know there are four practicable methods of aerating bread namely by fermentation by effervescence of an acid and an alkali by aerated egg or egg which has been filled with air by the process of beating and lastly by pressure of some gaseous substance into the paste by a process much resembling the impregnation of water in a soda fountain all these have one and the same objectto give us the cooked particles of our flour separated by such permanent aircells as will enable the stomach more readily to digest them  a very common mode of aerating bread in america is by the effervescence of an acid and an alkali in the flour the carbonic acid gas thus formed produces minute aircells in the bread or as the cook says makes it light when this process is performed with exact attention to chemical laws so that the acid and alkali completely neutralize each other leaving no overplus of either the result is often very palatable the difficulty is that this is a happy conjunction of circumstances which seldom occurs the acid most commonly employed is that of sour milk and as milk has many degrees of sourness the rule of a certain quantity of alkali to the pint must necessarily produce very different results at different times as an actual fact where this mode of making bread prevails as we lament to say it does to a great extent in this country one finds five cases of failure to one of success it is a woful thing that the daughters of new england have abandoned the old respectable mode of yeast brewing and bread raising for this specious substitute so easily made and so seldom well made the green clammy acrid substance called biscuit which many of our worthy republicans are obliged to eat in these days is wholly unworthy of the men and women of the republic good patriots ought not to be put off in that waythey deserve better fare  as an occasional variety as a household convenience for obtaining bread or biscuit at a moments notice the process of effervescence may be retained but we earnestly entreat american housekeepers in scriptural language to stand in the way and ask for the old paths and return to the good yeastbread of their sainted grandmothers  if acid and alkali must be used by all means let them be mixed in due proportions no cook should be left to guess and judge for herself about this matter there is an article called prestons infallible yeast powder which is made by chemical rule and produces very perfect results the use of this obviates the worst dangers in making bread by effervescence  of all processes of aeration in breadmaking the oldest and most timehonored is by fermentation that this was known in the days of our saviour is evident from the forcible simile in which he compares the silent permeating force of truth in human society to the very familiar household process of raising bread by a little yeast  there is however one species of yeast much used in some parts of the country against which i have to enter my protest it is called saltrisings or milkrisings and is made by mixing flour milk and a little salt together and leaving them to ferment the bread thus produced is often very attractive when new and made with great care it is white and delicate with fine even aircells it has however when kept some characteristics which remind us of the terms in which our old english bible describes the effect of keeping the manna of the ancient israelites which we are informed in words more explicit than agreeable stank and bred worms if saltrising bread does not fulfill the whole of this unpleasant description it certainly does emphatically a part of it the smell which it has in baking and when more than a day old suggests the inquiry whether it is the saccharine or the putrid fermentation with which it is raised whoever breaks a piece of it after a day or two will often see minute filaments or clammy strings drawing out from the fragments which with the unmistakable smell will cause him to pause before consummating a nearer acquaintance  the fermentation of flour by means of brewers or distillers yeast produces if rightly managed results far more palatable and wholesome the only requisites for success in it are first good materials and second great care in a few small things there are certain lowpriced or damaged kinds of flour which can never by any kind of domestic chemistry be made into good bread and to those persons whose stomachs forbid them to eat gummy glutinous paste under the name of bread there is no economy in buying these poor brands even at half the price of good flour  but good flour and good yeast being supposed with a temperature favorable to the development of fermentation the whole success of the process depends on the thorough diffusion of the proper proportion of yeast through the whole mass and on stopping the subsequent fermentation at the precise and fortunate point the true housewife makes her bread the sovereign of her kitchenits behests must be attended to in all critical points and moments no matter what else be postponed she who attends to her bread when she has done this and arranged that and performed the other very often finds that the forces of nature will not wait for her the snowy mass perfectly mixed kneaded with care and strength rises in its beautiful perfection till the moment comes for fixing the aircells by baking a few minutes now and the acetous fermentation will begin and the whole result be spoiled many breadmakers pass in utter carelessness over this sacred and mysterious boundary their oven has cake in it or they are skimming jelly or attending to some other of the socalled higher branches of cookery while the bread is quickly passing into the acetous stage at last when they are ready to attend to it they find that it has been going its own wayit is so sour that the pungent smell is plainly perceptible now the saleratusbottle is handed down and a quantity of the dissolved alkali mixed with the pastean expedient sometimes making itself too manifest by greenish streaks or small acrid spots in the bread as the result we have a beautiful article spoiledbread without sweetness if not absolutely sour  in the view of many lightness is the only property required in this article the delicate refined sweetness which exists in carefully kneaded bread baked just before it passes to the extreme point of fermentation is something of which they have no conception and thus they will even regard this process of spoiling the paste by the acetous fermentation and then rectifying that acid by effervescence with an alkali as something positively meritorious how else can they value and relish bakers loaves such as some are drugged with ammonia and other disagreeable things light indeed so light that they seem to have neither weight nor substance but with no more sweetness or taste than so much white cotton  some persons prepare bread for the oven by simply mixing it in the mass without kneading pouring it into pans and suffering it to rise there the aircells in bread thus prepared are coarse and uneven the bread is as inferior in delicacy and nicety to that which is well kneaded as a raw irish servant to a perfectly educated and refined lady the process of kneading seems to impart an evenness to the minute aircells a fineness of texture and a tenderness and pliability to the whole substance that can be gained in no other way  the divine principle of beauty has its reign over bread as well as over all other things it has its laws of √¶sthetics and that bread which is so prepared that it can be formed into separate and wellproportioned loaves each one carefully worked and moulded will develop the most beautiful results after being moulded the loaves should stand a little while just long enough to allow the fermentation going on in them to expand each little aircell to the point at which it stood before it was worked down and then they should be immediately put into the oven  many a good thing however is spoiled in the oven we cannot but regret for the sake of bread that our old steady brick ovens have been almost universally superseded by those of ranges and cookingstoves which are infinite in their caprices and forbid all general rules one thing however may be borne in mind as a principlethat the excellence of bread in all its varieties plain or sweetened depends on the perfection of its aircells whether produced by yeast egg or effervescence that one of the objects of baking is to fix these aircells and that the quicker this can be done through the whole mass the better will the result be when cake or bread is made heavy by baking too quickly it is because the immediate formation of the top crust hinders the exhaling of the moisture in the centre and prevents the aircells from cooking the weight also of the crust pressing down on the doughy aircells below destroys them producing that horror of good cooks a heavy streak the problem in baking then is the quick application of heat rather below than above the loaf and its steady continuance till all the aircells are thoroughly dried into permanent consistency every housewife must watch her own oven to know how this can be best accomplished  breadmaking can be cultivated to any extent as a fine art and the various kinds of biscuit tearusks twists rolls into which bread may be made are much better worth a housekeepers ambition than the getting up of rich and expensive cake or confections there are also varieties of material which are rich in good effects unbolted flour altogether more wholesome than the fine wheat and when properly prepared more palatable ryeflour and cornmeal each affording a thousand attractive possibilitieseach and all of these come under the general laws of breadstuffs and are worth a careful attention  a peculiarity of our american table particularly in the southern and western states is the constant exhibition of various preparations of hot bread in many families of the south and west bread in loaves to be eaten cold is an article quite unknown the effect of this kind of diet upon the health has formed a frequent subject of remark among travelers but only those know the full mischiefs of it who have been compelled to sojourn for a length of time in families where it is maintained the unknown horrors of dyspepsia from bad bread are a topic over which we willingly draw a veil                                       next to bread comes butteron which we have to say that when we remember what butter is in civilized europe and compare it with what it is in america we wonder at the forbearance and lenity of travelers in their strictures on our national commissariat  butter in england france and italy is simply solidified cream with all the sweetness of the cream in its taste freshly churned each day and unadulterated by salt at the present moment when salt is five cents a pound and butter fifty we americans are paying i should judge from the taste for about one pound of salt to every ten of butter and those of us who have eaten the butter of france and england do this with rueful recollections  there is it is true an article of butter made in the american style with salt which in its own kind and way has a merit not inferior to that of england and france many prefer it and it certainly takes a rank equally respectable with the other it is yellow hard and worked so perfectly free from every particle of buttermilk that it might make the voyage of the world without spoiling it is salted but salted with care and delicacy so that it may be a question whether even a fastidious englishman might not prefer its golden solidity to the white creamy freshness of his own now i am not for universal imitation of foreign customs and where i find this butter made perfectly i call it our american style and am not ashamed of it i only regret that this article is the exception and not the rule on our tables when i reflect on the possibilities which beset the delicate stomach in this line i do not wonder that my venerated friend dr mussey used to close his counsels to invalids with the direction and dont eat grease on your bread  america must i think have the credit of manufacturing and putting into market more bad butter than all that is made in all the rest of the world together the varieties of bad tastes and smells which prevail in it are quite a study this has a cheesy taste that a mouldythis is flavored with cabbage and that again with turnip and another has the strong sharp savor of rancid animal fat these varieties i presume come from the practice of churning only at long intervals and keeping the cream meanwhile in unventilated cellars or dairies the air of which is loaded with the effluvia of vegetable substances no domestic articles are so sympathetic as those of the milk tribe they readily take on the smell and taste of any neighboring substance and hence the infinite variety of flavors on which one mournfully muses who has late in autumn to taste twenty firkins of butter in hopes of finding one which will simply not be intolerable on his winter table  a matter for despair as regards bad butter is that at the tables where it is used it stands sentinel at the door to bar your way to every other kind of food you turn from your dreadful halfslice of bread which fills your mouth with bitterness to your beefsteak which proves virulent with the same poison you think to take refuge in vegetable diet and find the butter in the stringbeans and polluting the innocence of early peas it is in the corn in the succotash in the squash the beets swim in it the onions have it poured over them hungry and miserable you think to solace yourself at the dessert but the pastry is cursed the cake is acrid with the same plague you are ready to howl with despair and your misery is great upon you especially if this is a table where you have taken board for three months with your delicate wife and four small children your case is dreadfuland it is hopeless because long usage and habit have rendered your host perfectly incapable of discovering what is the matter dont like the butter sir i assure you i paid an extra price for it and its the very best in the market i looked over as many as a hundred tubs and picked out this one you are dumb but not less despairing  yet the process of making good butter is a very simple one to keep the cream in a perfectly pure cool atmosphere to churn while it is yet sweet to work out the buttermilk thoroughly and to add salt with such discretion as not to ruin the fine delicate flavor of the fresh creamall this is quite simple so simple that one wonders at thousands and millions of pounds of butter yearly manufactured which are merely a hobgoblinbewitchment of cream into foul and loathsome poisons                                       the third head of my discourse is that of meat of which america furnishes in the gross material enough to spread our tables royally were it well cared for and served  the faults in the meat generally furnished to us are first that it is too new a beefsteak which three or four days of keeping might render practicable is served up to us palpitating with freshness with all the toughness of animal muscle yet warm in the western country the traveler on approaching an hotel is often saluted by the last shrieks of the chickens which half an hour afterward are presented to him √† la spreadeagle for his dinner the example of the father of the faithful most wholesome to be followed in so many respects is imitated only in the celerity with which the young calf tender and good was transformed into an edible dish for hospitable purposes but what might be good housekeeping in a nomadic emir in days when refrigerators were yet in the future ought not to be so closely imitated as it often is in our own land  in the next place there is a woful lack of nicety in the butchers work of cutting and preparing meat who that remembers the neatly trimmed muttonchop of an english inn or the artistic little circle of lambchop fried in breadcrumbs coiled around a tempting centre of spinach which can always be found in france can recognize any family resemblance to these dapper civilized preparations in those coarse roughly hacked strips of bone gristle and meat which are commonly called muttonchop in america there seems to be a large dish of something resembling meat in which each fragment has about two or three edible morsels the rest being composed of dry and burnt skin fat and ragged bone  is it not time that civilization should learn to demand somewhat more care and nicety in the modes of preparing what is to be cooked and eaten might not some of the refinement and trimness which characterize the preparations of the european market be with advantage introduced into our own the housekeeper who wishes to garnish her table with some of those nice things is stopped in the outset by the butcher except in our large cities where some foreign travel may have created the demand it seems impossible to get much in this line that is properly prepared  i am aware that if this is urged on the score of √¶sthetics the ready reply will be oh we cant give time here in america to go into niceties and french whimwhams but the french mode of doing almost all practical things is based on that true philosophy and utilitarian good sense which characterize that seemingly thoughtless people nowhere is economy a more careful study and their market is artistically arranged to this end the rule is so to cut their meats that no portion designed to be cooked in a certain manner shall have wasteful appendages which that mode of cooking will spoil the french soup kettle stands ever ready to receive the bones the thin fibrous flaps the sinewy and gristly portions which are so often included in our roasts or broilings which fill our plates with unsightly d√©bris and finally make an amount of blank waste for which we pay our butcher the same price that we pay for what we have eaten  the dead waste of our clumsy coarse way of cutting meats is immense for example at the beginning of the present season the part of a lamb denominated leg and loin or hindquarter sold for thirty cents a pound now this includes besides the thick fleshy portions a quantity of bone sinew and thin fibrous substance constituting full one third of the whole weight if we put it into the oven entire in the usual manner we have the thin parts overdone and the skinny and fibrous parts utterly dried up by the application of the amount of heat necessary to cook the thick portion supposing the joint to weigh six pounds at thirty cents and that one third of the weight is so treated as to become perfectly useless we throw away sixty cents of a piece of beef at twentyfive cents a pound fifty cents worth is often lost in bone fat and burnt skin  the fact is this way of selling and cooking meat in large gross portions is of english origin and belongs to a country where all the customs of society spring from a class who have no particular occasion for economy the practice of minute and delicate division comes from a nation which acknowledges the need of economy and has made it a study a quarter of lamb in this mode of division would be sold in three nicely prepared portions the thick part would be sold by itself for a neat compact little roast the ribbones would be artistically separated and all the edible matters scraped away would form those delicate dishes of lambchop which fried in breadcrumbs to a golden brown are so ornamental and so palatable a sidedish the trimmings which remain after this division would be destined to the soup kettle or stew pan in a french market is a little portion for every purse and the farfamed and delicately flavored soups and stews which have arisen out of french economy are a study worth a housekeepers attention not one atom of food is wasted in the french modes of preparation even tough animal cartilages and sinews instead of appearing burnt and blackened in company with the roast meat to which they happen to be related are treated according to their own laws and come out either in savory soups or those fine clear meatjellies which form a garnish no less agreeable to the eye than palatable to the taste  whether this careful economical practical style of meat cooking can ever to any great extent be introduced into our kitchens now is a question our butchers are against it our servants are wedded to the old wholesale wasteful ways which seem to them easier because they are accustomed to them a cook who will keep and properly tend a soup kettle which shall receive and utilize all that the coarse preparations of the butcher would require her to trim away who understands the art of making the most of all these remains is a treasure scarcely to be hoped for if such things are to be done it must be primarily through the educated brain of cultivated women who do not scorn to turn their culture and refinement upon domestic problems  when meats have been properly dividedso that each portion can receive its own appropriate style of treatmentnext comes the consideration of the modes of cooking these may be divided into two great general classes those where it is desired to keep the juices within the meat as in baking broiling and frying and those whose object is to extract the juice and dissolve the fibre as in the making of soups and stews in the first class of operations the process must be as rapid as may consist with the thorough cooking of all the particles in this branch of cookery doing quickly is doing well the fire must be brisk the attention alert the introduction of cookingstoves offers to careless domestics facilities for gradually drying up meats and despoiling them of all flavor and nutrimentfacilities which appear to be very generally laid hold of they have almost banished the genuine oldfashioned roast meat from our tables and left in its stead dried meats with their most precious and nutritive juices evaporated how few cooks unassisted are competent to the simple process of broiling a beefsteak or muttonchop how very generally one has to choose between these meats gradually dried away or burned on the outside and raw within yet in england these articles never come on table done amiss their perfect cooking is as absolute a certainty as the rising of the sun  no one of these rapid processes of cooking however is so generally abused as frying the fryingpan has awful sins to answer for what untold horrors of dyspepsia have arisen from its smoky depths like the ghosts from witches caldrons the fizzle of frying meat is as a warning knell on many an ear saying touch not taste not if you would not burn and writhe  yet those who have traveled abroad remember that some of the lightest most palatable and most digestible preparations of meat have come from this dangerous source but we fancy quite other rites and ceremonies inaugurated the process and quite other hands performed its offices than those known to our kitchens probably the delicate c√¥telettes of france are not flopped down into halfmelted grease there gradually to warm and soak and fizzle while biddy goes in and out on her other ministrations till finally when thoroughly saturated and dinnerhour impends she bethinks herself and crowds the fire below to a roaring heat and finishes the process by a smart burn involving the kitchen and surrounding precincts in volumes of stygian gloom  from such preparations has arisen the very current medical opinion that fried meats are indigestible they are indigestible if they are greasy but french cooks have taught us that a thing has no more need to be greasy because emerging from grease than venus had to be salt because she rose from the sea  there are two ways of frying employed by the french cook one is to immerse the article to be cooked in boiling fat with an emphasis on the present participleand the philosophical principle is so immediately to crisp every pore at the first moment or two of immersion as effectually to seal the interior against the intrusion of greasy particles it can then remain as long as may be necessary thoroughly to cook it without imbibing any more of the boiling fluid than if it were enclosed in an eggshell the other method is to rub a perfectly smooth iron surface with just enough of some oily substance to prevent the meat from adhering and cook it with a quick heat as cakes are baked on a griddle in both these cases there must be the most rapid application of heat that can be made without burning and by the adroitness shown in working out this problem the skill of the cook is tested any one whose cook attains this important secret will find fried things quite as digestible and often more palatable than any other  in the second department of meat cookery to wit the slow and gradual application of heat for the softening and dissolution of its fibre and the extraction of its juices common cooks are equally untrained where is the socalled cook who understands how to prepare soups and stews these are precisely the articles in which a french kitchen excels the soup kettle made with a double bottom to prevent burning is a permanent everpresent institution and the coarsest and most impracticable meats distilled through that alembic come out again in soups jellies or savory stews the toughest cartilage even the bones being first cracked are here made to give forth their hidden virtues and to rise in delicate and appetizing forms one great law governs all these preparations the application of heat must be gradual steady long protracted never reaching the point of active boiling hours of quiet simmering dissolve all dissoluble parts soften the sternest fibre and unlock every minute cell in which nature has stored away her treasures of nourishment this careful and protracted application of heat and the skillful use of flavors constitute the two main points in all those nice preparations of meat for which the french have so many namesprocesses by which a delicacy can be imparted to the coarsest and cheapest food superior to that of the finest articles under less philosophic treatment  french soups and stews are a study and they would not be an unprofitable one to any person who wishes to live with comfort and even elegance on small means  john bull looks down from the sublime of ten thousand a year on french kickshaws as he calls them give me my meat cooked so i may know what it is an ox roasted whole is dear to johns soul and his kitchen arrangements are titanic what magnificent rounds and sirloins of beef revolving on selfregulating spits with a rich click of satisfaction before grates piled with roaring fires let us do justice to the royal cheer nowhere are the charms of pure unadulterated animal food set forth in more imposing style for john is rich and what does he care for odds and ends and parings has he not all the beasts of the forest and the cattle on a thousand hills what does he want of economy but his brother jean has not ten thousand pounds a yearnothing like it but he makes up for the slenderness of his purse by boundless fertility of invention and delicacy of practice john began sneering at jeans soups and ragouts but all johns modern sons and daughters send to jean for their cooks and the sirloins of england rise up and do obeisance to this joseph with a white apron who comes to rule in their kitchens  there is no animal fibre that will not yield itself up to longcontinued steady heat but the difficulty with almost any of the common servants who call themselves cooks is that they have not the smallest notion of the philosophy of the application of heat such a one will complacently tell you concerning certain meats that the harder you boil them the harder they growan obvious fact which under her mode of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil has frequently come under her personal observation if you tell her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat just below the boilingpoint she will probably answer yes maam and go on her own way or she will let it stand till it burns to the bottom of the kettlea most common termination of the experiment the only way to make sure of the matter is either to import a french kettle or to fit into an ordinary kettle a false bottom such as any tinman may make that shall leave a space of an inch or two between the meat and the fire this kettle may be maintained as a constant habitu√© of the range and into it the cook may be instructed to throw all the fibrous trimmings of meat all the gristle tendons and bones having previously broken up these last with a mallet  such a kettle will furnish the basis for clear rich soups or other palatable dishes clear soup consists of the dissolved juices of the meat and gelatine of the bones cleared from the fat and fibrous portions by straining when cold the grease which rises to the top of the fluid may thus be easily removed in a stew on the contrary you boil down this soup till it permeates the fibre which long exposure to heat has softened all that remains after the proper preparation of the fibre and juices is the flavoring and it is in this particularly that french soups excel those of america and england and all the world  english and american soups are often heavy and hot with spices there are appreciable tastes in them they burn your mouth with cayenne or clove or allspice you can tell at once what is in them oftentimes to your sorrow but a french soup has a flavor which one recognises at once as delicious yet not to be characterized as due to any single condiment it is the just blending of many things the same remark applies to all their stews ragouts and other delicate preparations no cook will ever study these flavors but perhaps many cooks mistresses may and thus be able to impart delicacy and comfort to economy  as to those things called hashes commonly manufactured by unwatched untaught cooks out of the remains of yesterdays repast let us not dwell too closely on their memorycompounds of meat gristle skin fat and burnt fibre with a handful of pepper and salt flung at them dredged with lumpy flour watered from the spout of the teakettle and left to simmer at the cooks convenience while she is otherwise occupied such are the best performances a housekeeper can hope for from an untrained cook  but the cunningly devised minces the artful preparations choicely flavored which may be made of yesterdays repastby these is the true domestic artist known no cook untaught by an educated brain ever makes these and yet economy is a great gainer by them                                       as regards the department of vegetables their number and variety in america are so great that a table might almost be furnished by these alone generally speaking their cooking is a more simple art and therefore more likely to be found satisfactorily performed than that of meats if only they are not drenched with rancid butter their own native excellence makes itself known in most of the ordinary modes of preparation  there is however one exception  our stanch old friend the potato is to other vegetables what bread is on the table like bread it is held as a sort of sine qua non like that it may be made invariably palatable by a little care in a few plain particulars through neglect of which it often becomes intolerable the soggy waxy indigestible viand that often appears in the potatodish is a downright sacrifice of the better nature of this vegetable  the potato nutritive and harmless as it appears belongs to a family suspected of very dangerous traits it is a family connection of the deadly nightshade and other illreputed gentry and sometimes shows strange proclivities to evilnow breaking out uproariously as in the noted potato rot and now more covertly in various evil affections for this reason scientific directors bid us beware of the water in which potatoes are boiledinto which it appears the evil principle is drawn off and they caution us not to shred them into stews without previously suffering the slices to lie for an hour or so in salt and water these cautions are worth attention  the most usual modes of preparing the potato for the table are by roasting or boiling these processes are so simple that it is commonly supposed every cook understands them without special directions and yet there is scarcely an uninstructed cook who can boil or roast a potato  a good roasted potato is a delicacy worth a dozen compositions of the cookbook yet when we ask for it what burnt shriveled abortions are presented to us biddy rushes to her potatobasket and pours out two dozen of different sizes some having in them three times the amount of matter of others these being washed she tumbles them into her oven at a leisure interval and there lets them lie till it is time to serve breakfast whenever that may be as a result if the largest are cooked the smallest are presented in cinders and the intermediate sizes are withered and watery nothing is so utterly ruined by a few moments of overdoing that which at the right moment was plump with mealy richness a quarter of an hour later shrivels and becomes wateryand it is in this state that roast potatoes are most frequently served  in the same manner we have seen boiled potatoes from an untaught cook coming upon the table like lumps of yellow waxand the same article the day after under the directions of a skillful mistress appearing in snowy balls of powdery lightness in the one case they were thrown in their skins into water and suffered to soak or boil as the case might be at the cooks leisure and after they were boiled to stand in the water till she was ready to peel them in the other case the potatoes being first peeled were boiled as quickly as possible in salted water which the moment they were done was drained off and then they were gently shaken for a minute or two over the fire to dry them still more thoroughly we have never yet seen the potato so depraved and given over to evil that could not be reclaimed by this mode of treatment  as to fried potatoes who that remembers the crisp golden slices of the french restaurant thin as wafers and light as snowflakes does not speak respectfully of them what cousinship with these have those coarse greasy masses of sliced potato wholly soggy and partly burnt to which we are treated under the name of fried potatoes √† la america in our cities the restaurants are introducing the french article to great acceptance and to the vindication of the fair fame of this queen of vegetables                                       finally i arrive at the last great head of my subject to wit teameaning thereby as before observed what our hibernian friend did in the inquiry will yr honor take tay tay or coffee tay  i am not about to enter into the merits of the great tea and coffee controversy or say whether these substances are or are not wholesome i treat of them as actual existences and speak only of the modes of making the most of them  the french coffee is reputed the best in the world and a thousand voices have asked what is it about the french coffee in the first place then the french coffee is coffee and not chicory or rye or beans or peas in the second place it is freshly roasted whenever maderoasted with great care and evenness in a little revolving cylinder which makes part of the furniture of every kitchen and which keeps in the aroma of the berry it is never overdone so as to destroy the coffee flavor which is in nine cases out of ten the fault of the coffee we meet with then it is ground and placed in a coffeepot with a filter through which it percolates in clear dropsthe coffeepot standing on a heated stove to maintain the temperature the nose of the coffeepot is stopped up to prevent the escape of the aroma during this process the extract thus obtained is a perfectly clear dark fluid know as caf√© noir or black coffee it is black only because of its strength being in fact almost the very essential oil of coffee a tablespoonful of this in boiled milk would make what is ordinarily called a strong cup of coffee the boiled milk is prepared with no less care it must be fresh and new not merely warmed or even brought to the boiling point but slowly simmered till it attains a thick creamy richness the coffee mixed with this and sweetened with that sparkling beetroot sugar which ornaments a french table is the celebrated caf√©aulait the name of which has gone round the world  as we look to france for the best coffee so we must look to england for the perfection of tea the teakettle is as much an english institution as aristocracy or the prayer book and when one wants to know exactly how tea should be made one has only to ask how a fine old english housekeeper makes it  the first article of her faith is that the water must not merely be hot not merely have boiled a few moments since but be actually boiling at the moment it touches the tea hence though servants in england are vastly better trained than with us this delicate mystery is seldom left to their hands tea making belongs to the drawingroom and highborn ladies preside at the bubbling and loudhissing urn and see that all due rites and solemnities are properly performedthat the cups are hot and that the infused tea waits the exact time before the libations commence oh ye dear old english teatables resorts of the kindesthearted hospitality in the world we still cherish your memory even though you do not say pleasant things of us there one of these days you will think better of us of late the introduction of english breakfast tea has raised a new sect among the tea drinkers reversing some of the old canons breakfast tea must be boiled unlike the delicate article of olden time which required only a momentary infusion to develop its richness this requires a longer and severer treatment to bring out its strengththus confusing all the established usages and throwing the work into the hands of the cook in the kitchen  the faults of tea as too commonly found at our hotels and boardinghouses are that it is made in every way the reverse of what it should be the water is hot perhaps but not boiling the tea has a general flat stale smoky taste devoid of life or spirit and it is served usually with thin milk instead of cream cream is as essential to the richness of tea as of coffee we could wish that the english fashion might generally prevail of giving the traveler his own kettle of boiling water and his own teachest and letting him make tea for himself at all events he would then be sure of one merit in his teait would be hot a very simple and obvious virtue but one very seldom obtained  chocolate is a french and spanish article and one seldom served on american tables we in america however make an article every way equal to any which can be imported from paris and he who buys bakers best vanillachocolate may rest assured that no foreign land can furnish anything better a very rich and delicious beverage may be made by dissolving this in milk slowly boiled down after the french fashion                                       i have now gone over all the ground i laid out as comprising the great first principles of cookery and i would here modestly offer the opinion that a table where all these principles are carefully observed would need few dainties the struggle after socalled delicacies comes from the poorness of common things perfect bread and butter would soon drive cake out of the field it has done so in many families nevertheless i have a word to say under the head of confectionery meaning by this the whole range of ornamental cookeryor pastry ices jellies preserves etc the art of making all these very perfectly is far better understood in america than the art of common cooking  there are more women who know how to make good cake than good breadmore who can furnish you with a good icecream than a wellcooked muttonchop a fair charlotterusse is easier to come by than a perfect cup of coffee and you shall find a sparkling jelly to your dessert where you sighed in vain for so simple a luxury as a wellcooked potato  our fair countrywomen might rest upon their laurels in these higher fields and turn their great energy and ingenuity to the study of essentials to do common things perfectly is far better worth our endeavor than to do uncommon things respectably we americans in many things as yet have been a little inclined to begin making our shirt at the ruffle but nevertheless when we set about it we can make the shirt as nicely as anybodyit needs only that we turn our attention to it resolved that ruffle or no ruffle the shirt we will have  i have also a few words to say as to the prevalent ideas in respect to french cookery having heard much of it with no very distinct idea what it is our people have somehow fallen into the notion that its forte lies in high spicingand so when our cooks put a great abundance of clove mace nutmeg and cinnamon into their preparations they fancy that they are growing up to be french cooks but the fact is that the americans and english are far more given to spicing than the french spices in our made dishes are abundant and their taste is strongly pronounced in living a year in france i forgot the taste of nutmeg clove and allspice which had met me in so many dishes in america  the thing may be briefly defined the english and americans deal in spices the french in flavorsflavors many and subtile imitating often in their delicacy those subtile blendings which nature produces in highflavored fruits the recipes of our cookerybooks are most of them of english origin coming down from the times of our phlegmatic ancestors when the solid burly beefy growth of the foggy island required the heat of fiery condiments and could digest heavy sweets witness the national recipe for plumpudding which may be rendered take a pound of every indigestible substance you can think of boil into a cannonball and serve in flaming brandy so of the christmas mincepie and many other national dishes but in america owing to our brighter skies and more fervid climate we have developed an acute nervous delicacy of temperament far more akin to that of france than of england  half of the recipes in our cookbooks are mere murder to such constitutions and stomachs as we grow here we require to ponder these things and think how we in our climate and under our circumstances ought to live and in doing so we may without accusation of foreign foppery take some leaves from many foreign books                                       but christopher has prosed long enough i must now read this to my wife and see what she says     xi  our house   our gallant bob stephens into whose lifeboat our marianne has been received has lately taken the mania of housebuilding into his head bob is somewhat fastidious difficult to please fond of domesticities and individualities and such a man never can fit himself into a house built by another and accordingly housebuilding has always been his favorite mental recreation during all his courtship as much time was taken up in planning a future house as if he had money to build one and all mariannes patterns and the backs of half their letters were scrawled with groundplans and elevations but latterly this chronic disposition has been quickened into an acute form by the fallingin of some few thousands to their domestic treasuryleft as the sole residuum of a painstaking old aunt who took it into her head to make a will in bobs favor leaving among other good things a nice little bit of land in a rural district half an hours railroad ride from boston  so now groundplans thicken and my wife is being consulted morning noon and night and i never come into the room without finding their heads close together over a paper and hearing bob expatiate on his favorite idea of a library he appears to have got so far as this that the ceiling is to be of carved oak with ribs running to a boss overhead and finished medi√¶vally with ultramarine blue and gildingand then away he goes sketching gothic patterns of bookshelves which require only experienced carvers and the wherewithal to pay them to be the divinest things in the world  marianne is exercised about chinaclosets and pantries and about a bedroom on the groundfloorfor like all other women of our days she expects not to have strength enough to run upstairs oftener than once or twice a week and my wife who is a native genius in this line and has planned in her time dozens of houses for acquaintances wherein they are at this moment living happily goes over every day with her pencil and ruler the work of rearranging the plans according as the ideas of the young couple veer and vary  one day bob is importuned to give two feet off from his library for a closet in the bedroom but resists like a trojan the next morning being mollified by private domestic supplications bob yields and my wife rubs out the lines of yesterday two feet come off the library and a closet is constructed but now the parlor proves too narrowthe parlor wall must be moved two feet into the hall bob declares this will spoil the symmetry of the latter and if there is anything he wants it is a wide generous ample hall to step into when you open the front door  well then says marianne lets put two feet more into the width of the house  cant on account of the expense you see says bob you see every additional foot of outside wall necessitates so many more bricks so much more flooring so much more roofing etc  and my wife with thoughtful brow looks over the plans and considers how two feet more are to be got into the parlor without moving any of the walls  i say says bob bending over her shoulder here take your two feet in the parlor and put two more feet on to the other side of the hall stairs and he dashes heavily with his pencil  oh bob exclaims marianne there are the kitchen pantries you ruin themand no place for the cellar stairs  hang the pantries and cellar stairs says bob mother must find a place for them somewhere else i say the house must be roomy and cheerful and pantries and those things may take care of themselves they can be put somewhere well enough no fear but you will find a place for them somewhere what do you women always want such a great enormous kitchen for  it is not any larger than is necessary said my wife thoughtfully nothing is gained by taking off from it  what if you should put it all down into a basement suggests bob and so get it all out of sight together  never if it can be helped said my wife basement kitchens are necessary evils only to be tolerated in cities where land is too dear to afford any other  so goes the discussion till the trio agree to sleep over it the next morning an inspiration visits my wifes pillow she is up and seizes plans and paper and before six oclock has enlarged the parlor very cleverly by throwing out a bowwindow so waxes and wanes the prospective house innocently battered down and rebuilt with indiarubber and blacklead doors are cut out tonight and walled up tomorrow windows knocked out here and put in there as some observer suggests possibilities of too much or too little draught now all seems finished when lo a discovery there is no fireplace nor stoveflue in my ladys bedroom and can be none without moving the bathingroom pencil and indiarubber are busy again and for a while the whole house seems to threaten to fall to pieces with the confusion of the moving the bathroom wanders like a ghost now invading a closet now threatening the tranquillity of the parlor till at last it is laid by some unheardof calculations of my wifes and sinks to rest in a place so much better that everybody wonders it never was thought of before  papa said jenny it appears to me people dont exactly know what they want when they build why dont you write a paper on housebuilding  i have thought of it said i with the air of a man called to settle some great reform it must be entirely because christopher has not written that our young people and mamma are tangling themselves daily in webs which are untangled the next day  you see said jenny they have only just so much money and they want everything they can think of under the sun theres bob been studying architectural antiquities and nobody knows what and sketching all sorts of curlywhorlies and marianne has her notions about a parlor and boudoir and china closets and bedroom closets and bob wants a baronial hall and mamma stands out for linen closets and bathingrooms and all that and so among them all it will just end in getting them head over ears in debt  the thing struck me as not improbable  i dont know jenny whether my writing an article is going to prevent all this but as my time in the atlantic is coming round i may as well write on what i am obliged to think of and so i will give a paper on the subject to enliven our next evenings session  so that evening when bob and marianne had dropped in as usual and while the customary work of drawing and rubbing out was going on at mrs crowfields sofa i produced my paper and read as follows   our house  there is a place called our house which everybody knows of the sailor talks of it in his dreams at sea the wounded soldier turning in his uneasy hospitalbed brightens at the word it is like the dropping of cool water in the desert like the touch of cool fingers on a burning brow our house he says feebly and the light comes back into his dim eyes for all homely charities all fond thoughts all purities all that man loves on earth or hopes for in heaven rise with the word  our house may be in any style of architecture low or high it may be the brown old farmhouse with its tall wellsweep or the onestory gambrelroofed cottage or the large square white house with green blinds under the windswung elms of a century or it may be the logcabin of the wilderness with its one roomstill there is a spell in the memory of it beyond all conjurations its stone and brick and mortar are like no other its very clapboards and shingles are dear to us powerful to bring back the memories of early days and all that is sacred in home love                                       papa is getting quite sentimental whispered jenny loud enough for me to hear i shook my head at her impressively and went on undaunted                                       there is no one fact of our human existence that has a stronger influence upon us than the house we dwell in especially that in which our earlier and more impressible years are spent the building and arrangement of a house influence the health the comfort the morals the religion there have been houses built so devoid of all consideration for the occupants so rambling and haphazard in the disposal of rooms so sunless and cheerless and wholly without snugness or privacy as to make it seem impossible to live a joyous generous rational religious family life in them  there are we shame to say in our cities things called houses built and rented by people who walk erect and have the general air and manner of civilized and christianized men which are so inhuman in their building that they can only be called snares and traps for soulsplaces where children cannot well escape growing up filthy and impure places where to form a home is impossible and to live a decent christian life would require miraculous strength  a celebrated british philanthropist who had devoted much study to the dwellings of the poor gave it as his opinion that the temperance societies were a hopeless undertaking in london unless these dwellings underwent a transformation they were so squalid so dark so comfortless so constantly pressing upon the senses foulness pain and inconvenience that it was only by being drugged with gin and opium that their miserable inhabitants could find heart to drag on life from day to day he had himself tried the experiment of reforming a drunkard by taking him from one of these loathsome dens and enabling him to rent a tenement in a block of model lodginghouses which had been built under his supervision the young man had been a designer of figures for prints he was of a delicate frame and a nervous susceptible temperament shut in one miserable room with his wife and little children without the possibility of pure air with only filthy fetid water to drink with the noise of other miserable families resounding through the thin partitions what possibility was there of doing anything except by the help of stimulants which for a brief hour lifted him above the perception of these miseries changed at once to a neat flat where for the same rent as his former den he had three good rooms with water for drinking houseservice and bathing freely supplied and the blessed sunshine and air coming in through windows well arranged for ventilation he became in a few weeks a new man in the charms of the little spot which he could call home its quiet its order his former talent came back to him and he found strength in pure air and pure water and those purer thoughts of which they are the emblems to abandon burning and stupefying stimulants  the influence of dwellinghouses for good or for eviltheir influence on the brain the nerves and through these on the heart and lifeis one of those things that cannot be enough pondered by those who build houses to sell or rent  something more generous ought to inspire a man than merely the percentage which he can get for his money he who would build houses should think a little on the subject he should reflect what houses are for what they may be made to do for human beings the great majority of houses in cities are not built by the indwellers themselves they are built for them by those who invest their money in this way with little other thought than the percentage which the investment will return  for persons of ample fortune there are indeed palatial residences with all that wealth can do to render life delightful but in that class of houses which must be the lot of the large majority those which must be chosen by young men in the beginning of life when means are comparatively restricted there is yet wide room for thought and the judicious application of money  in looking over houses to be rented by persons of moderate means one cannot help longing to buildone sees so many ways in which the same sum which built an inconvenient and unpleasant house might have been made to build a delightful one                                       thats so said bob with emphasis dont you remember marianne how many dismal commonplace shabby houses we trailed through  yes said marianne you remember those houses with such little squeezed rooms and that flourishing staircase with the coloredglass chinacloset window and no butlers sink  yes said bob and those astonishing abominable stone abortions that adorned the doorsteps people do lay out a deal of money to make houses look ugly it must be confessed  one would willingly said marianne dispense with frightful stone ornaments in front and with heavy mouldings inside which are of no possible use or beauty and with showy plaster cornices and centrepieces in the parlor ceilings and even with marble mantels for the luxury of hot and cold water in each chamber and a couple of comfortable bathrooms then the disposition of windows and doors is so wholly without regard to convenience how often we find rooms meant for bedrooms where really there is no good place for either bed or dressingtable  here my wife looked up having just finished redrawing the plans to the latest alteration  one of the greatest reforms that could be in these reforming days she observed would be to have women architects the mischief with houses built to rent is that they are all mere male contrivances no woman would ever plan chambers where there is no earthly place to set a bed except against a window or door or waste the room in entries that might be made into closets i dont see for my part apropos to the modern movement for opening new professions to the female sex why there should not be welleducated female architects the planning and arrangement of houses and the layingout of grounds are a fair subject of womanly knowledge and taste it is the teaching of nature what would anybody think of a bluebirds nest that had been built entirely by mr blue without the help of his wife  my dear said i you must positively send a paper on this subject to the next womans rights convention  i am of sojourner truths opinion said my wifethat the best way to prove the propriety of ones doing anything is to go and do it a woman who should have energy to grow through the preparatory studies and set to work in this field would i am sure soon find employment  if she did as well as you would do my dear said i there are plenty of young women in our boston high schools who are going through higher fields of mathematics than are required by the architect and the schools for design show the flexibility and fertility of the female pencil the thing appears to me altogether more feasible than many other openings which have been suggested to woman  well said jenny isnt papa ever to go on with his paper                                       i continued                                       what ought our house to be could any other question be asked admitting in its details of such varied answersanswers various as the means the character and situation of different individuals but there are great wants pertaining to every human being into which all lesser ones run there are things in a house that every one high or low rich or poor ought according to his means to seek i think i shall class them according to the elemental division of the old philosophers fire air earth and water these form the groundwork of this needbethe sinequanons of a house                                       fire air earth and water i dont understand said jenny  wait a little till you do then said i i will try to make my meaning plain                                       the first object of a house is shelter from the elements this object is effected by a tent or wigwam which keeps off rain and wind the first disadvantage of this shelter is that the vital air which you take into your lungs and on the purity of which depends the purity of blood and brain and nerves is vitiated in the wigwam or tent you are constantly taking in poison more or less active with every inspiration napoleon had his army sleep without tents he stated that from experience he found it more healthy and wonderful have been the instances of delicate persons gaining constantly in rigor from being obliged in the midst of hardships to sleep constantly in the open air now the first problem in housebuilding is to combine the advantage of shelter with the fresh elasticity of outdoor air i am not going to give here a treatise on ventilation but merely to say in general terms that the first object of a house builder or contriver should be to make a healthy house and the first requisite of a healthy house is a pure sweet elastic air  i am in favor therefore of those plans of housebuilding which have wide central spaces whether halls or courts into which all the rooms open and which necessarily preserve a body of fresh air for the use of them all in hot climates this is the object of the central court which cuts into the body of the house with its fountain and flowers and its galleries into which the various apartments open when people are restricted for space and cannot afford to give up wide central portions of the house for the mere purposes of passage this central hall can be made a pleasant sittingroom with tables chairs bookcases and sofas comfortably disposed this ample central room above and below is in many respects the most agreeable lounging room of the house while the parlors below and the chambers above opening upon it form agreeable withdrawing rooms for purposes of greater privacy  it is customary with many persons to sleep with bedroom windows opena very imperfect and often dangerous mode of procuring that supply of fresh air which a sleepingroom requires in a house constructed in the manner indicated windows might be freely left open in these central halls producing there a constant movement of air and the doors of the bedrooms placed ajar when a very slight opening in the windows would create a free circulation through the apartments  in the planning of a house thought should be had as to the general disposition of the windows and the quarters from which favoring breezes may be expected should be carefully considered windows should be so arranged that draughts of air can be thrown quite through and across the house how often have we seen pale mothers and drooping babes fanning and panting during some of our hot days on the sunny side of a house while the breeze that should have cooled them beat in vain against a dead wall one longs sometimes to knock holes through partitions and let in the air of heaven  no other gift of god so precious so inspiring is treated with such utter irreverence and contempt in the calculations of us mortals as this same air of heaven a sermon on oxygen if one had a preacher who understood the subject might do more to repress sin than the most orthodox discourse to show when and how and why sin came a minister gets up in a crowded lectureroom where the mephitic air almost makes the candles burn blue and bewails the deadness of the churchthe church the while drugged by the poisoned air growing sleepier and sleepier though they feel dreadfully wicked for being so  little jim who fresh from his afternoons ramble in the fields last evening said his prayers dutifully and lay down to sleep in a most christian frame this morning sits up in bed with his hair bristling with crossness strikes at his nurse and declares he wont say his prayersthat he dont want to be good the simple difference is that the child having slept in a close box of a room his brain all night fed by poison is in a mild state of moral insanity delicate women remark that it takes them till eleven or twelve oclock to get up their strength in the morning query do they sleep with closed windows and doors and with heavy bedcurtains  the houses built by our ancestors were better ventilated in certain respects than modern ones with all their improvements the great central chimney with its open fireplaces in the different rooms created a constant current which carried off foul and vitiated air in these days how common is it to provide rooms with only a flue for a stove this flue is kept shut in summer and in winter opened only to admit a close stove which burns away the vital portion of the air quite as fast as the occupants breathe it away the sealing up of fireplaces and introduction of airtight stoves may doubtless be a saving of fuel it saves too more than thatin thousands and thousands of cases it has saved people from all further human wants and put an end forever to any needs short of the six feet of narrow earth which are mans only inalienable property in other words since the invention of airtight stoves thousands have died of slow poison it is a terrible thing to reflect upon that our northern winters last from november to may six long months in which many families confine themselves to one room of which every windowcrack has been carefully calked to make it airtight where an airtight stove keeps the atmosphere at a temperature between eighty and ninety and the inmates sitting there with all their winter clothes on become enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned air for which there is no escape but the occasional opening of a door  it is no wonder that the first result of all this is such a delicacy of skin and lungs that about half the inmates are obliged to give up going into the open air during the six cold months because they invariably catch cold if they do so it is no wonder that the cold caught about the first of december has by the first of march become a fixed consumption and that the opening of the spring which ought to bring life and health in so many cases brings death  we hear of the lean condition in which the poor bears emerge from their six months wintering during which they subsist on the fat which they have acquired the previous summer even so in our long winters multitudes of delicate people subsist on the daily waning strength which they acquired in the season when windows and doors were open and fresh air was a constant luxury no wonder we hear of spring fever and spring biliousness and have thousands of nostrums for clearing the blood in the spring all these things are the pantings and palpitations of a system run down under slow poison unable to get a step farther better far better the old houses of the olden time with their great roaring fires and their bedrooms where the snow came in and the wintry winds whistled then to be sure you froze your back while you burned your face your water froze nightly in your pitcher your breath congealed in icewreaths on the blankets and you could write your name on the pretty snowwreath that had sifted in through the windowcracks but you woke full of life and vigoryou looked out into the whirling snowstorms without a shiver and thought nothing of plunging through drifts as high as your head on your daily way to school you jingled in sleighs you snowballed you lived in snow like a snowbird and your blood coursed and tingled in full tide of good merry real life through your veinsnone of the slowcreeping black blood which clogs the brain and lies like a weight on the vital wheels  mercy upon us papa said jenny i hope we need not go back to such houses  no my dear i replied i only said that such houses were better than those which are all winter closed by double windows and burntout airtight stoves                                       the perfect house is one in which there is a constant escape of every foul and vitiated particle of air through one opening while a constant supply of fresh outdoor air is admitted by another in winter this outdoor air must pass through some process by which it is brought up to a temperate warmth  take a single room and suppose on one side a current of outdoor air which has been warmed by passing through the air chamber of a modern furnace its temperature need not be above sixtyfiveit answers breathing purposes better at that on the other side of the room let there be an open wood or coal fire one cannot conceive the purposes of warmth and ventilation more perfectly combined  suppose a house with a great central hall into which a current of fresh temperately warmed air is continually pouring each chamber opening upon this hall has a chimney up whose flue the rarefied air is constantly passing drawing up with it all the foul and poisonous gases that house is well ventilated and in a way that need bring no dangerous draughts upon the most delicate invalid for the better securing of privacy in sleepingrooms we have seen two doors employed one of which is made with slats like a windowblind so that air is freely transmitted without exposing the interior  when we speak of fresh air we insist on the full rigor of the term it must not be the air of a cellar heavily laden with the poisonous nitrogen of turnips and cabbages but good fresh outdoor air from a coldair pipe so placed as not to get the lower stratum near the ground where heavy damps and exhalations collect but high up in just the clearest and most elastic region  the conclusion of the whole matter is that as all of mans and womans peace and comfort all their love all their amiability all their religion have got to come to them while they live in this world through the medium of the brainand as black uncleansed blood acts on the brain as a poison and as no other than black uncleansed blood can be got by the lungs out of impure airthe first object of the man who builds a house is to secure a pure and healthy atmosphere therein  therefore in allotting expenses set this down as a mustbe our house must have fresh aireverywhere at all times winter and summer whether we have stone facings or no whether our parlor has cornices or marble mantles or no whether our doors are machinemade or handmade all our fixtures shall be of the plainest and simplest but we will have fresh air we will open our door with a latch and string if we cannot afford lock and knob and fresh air too but in our house we will live cleanly and christianly we will no more breathe the foul air rejected from a neighbors lungs than we will use a neighbors toothbrush and hairbrush such is the first essential of our housethe first great element of human health and happinessair                                       i say marianne said bob have we got fireplaces in our chambers  mamma took care of that said marianne  you may be quite sure said i if your mother has had a hand in planning your house that the ventilation is cared for  it must be confessed that bobs principal idea in a house had been a gothic library and his mind had labored more on the possibility of adapting some favorite bits from the baronial antiquities to modern needs than on anything so terrestrial as air therefore he awoke as from a dream and taking two or three monstrous inhalations he seized the plans and began looking over them with new energy meanwhile i went on with my prelection  the second great vital element for which provision must be made in our house is fire by which i do not mean merely artificial fire but fire in all its extent and branchesthe heavenly fire which god sends us daily on the bright wings of sunbeams as well as the mimic fires by which we warm our dwellings cook our food and light our nightly darkness  to begin then with heavenly fire or sunshine if gods gift of vital air is neglected and undervalued his gift of sunshine appears to be hated there are many houses where not a cent has been expended on ventilation but where hundreds of dollars have been freely lavished to keep out the sunshine the chamber truly is tight as a box it has no fireplace not even a ventilator opening into the stoveflue but oh joy and gladness it has outside blinds and inside foldingshutters so that in the brightest of days we may create there a darkness that may be felt to observe the generality of new england houses a spectator might imagine they were planned for the torrid zone where the great object is to keep out a furnace draught of burning air  but let us look over the months of our calendar in which of them do we not need fires on our hearths we will venture to say that from october to june all families whether they actually have it or not would be the more comfortable for a morning and evening fire for eight months in the year the weather varies on the scale of cool cold colder and freezing and for all the four other months what is the number of days that really require the torridzone system of shutting up houses we all know that extreme heat is the exception and not the rule  yet let anybody travel as i did last year through the valley of the connecticut and observe the houses all clean and white and neat and welltodo with their turfy yards and their breezy great elms but all shut up from basement to attic as if the inmates had all sold out and gone to china not a windowblind open above or below is the house inhabited noyesthere is a faint stream of blue smoke from the kitchen chimney and half a windowblind open in some distant back part of the house they are living there in the dim shadows bleaching like potatosprouts in the cellar                                       i can tell you why they do it papa said jenny its the flies and flies are certainly worthy to be one of the plagues of egypt i cant myself blame people that shut up their rooms and darken their houses in flytimedo you mamma  not in extreme cases though i think there is but a short season when this is necessary yet the habit of shutting up lasts the year round and gives to new england villages that dead silent cold uninhabited look which is so peculiar  the one fact that a traveler would gather in passing through our villages would be this said i that the people live in their houses and in the dark barely do you see doors and windows open people sitting at them chairs in the yard and signs that the inhabitants are living outofdoors  well said jenny i have told you why for i have been at uncle peters in summer and aunt does her springcleaning in may and then she shuts all the blinds and drops all the curtains and the house stays clean till october thats the whole of it if she had all her windows open there would be paint and windows to be cleaned every week and who is to do it for my part i cant much blame her  well said i i have my doubts about the sovereign efficacy of living in the dark even if the great object of existence were to be rid of flies i remember during this same journey stopping for a day or two at a country boardinghouse which was dark as egypt from cellar to garret the long dim gloomy diningroom was first closed by outside blinds and then by impenetrable paper curtains notwithstanding which it swarmed and buzzed like a beehive you found where the cake plate was by the buzz which your hand made if you chanced to reach in that direction it was disagreeable because in the darkness flies could not always be distinguished from huckleberries and i couldnt help wishing that since we must have the flies we might at last have the light and air to console us under them people darken their rooms and shut up every avenue of outdoor enjoyment and sit and think of nothing but flies in fact flies are all they have left no wonder they become morbid on the subject  well now papa talks just like a man doesnt he said jenny he hasnt the responsibility of keeping things clean i wonder what he would do if he were a housekeeper  do i will tell you i would do the best i could i would shut my eyes on flyspecks and open them on the beauties of nature i would let the cheerful sun in all day long in all but the few summer days when coolness is the one thing needful those days may be soon numbered every year i would make a calculation in the spring how much it would cost to hire a woman to keep my windows and paint clean and i would do with one less gown and have her and when i had spent all i could afford on cleaning windows and paint i would harden my heart and turn off my eyes and enjoy my sunshine and my fresh air my breezes and all that can be seen through the picture windows of an open airy house and snap my fingers at the flies there you have it  papas hobby is sunshine said marianne  why shouldnt it be was god mistaken when he made the sun did he make him for us to hold a lifes battle with is that vital power which reddens the cheek of the peach and pours sweetness through the fruits and flowers of no use to us look at plants that grow without sunwan pale longvisaged holding feeble imploring hands of supplication towards the light can human beings afford to throw away a vitalizing force so pungent so exhilarating you remember the experiment of a prison where one row of cells had daily sunshine and the others none with the same regimen the same cleanliness the same care the inmates of the sunless cells were visited with sickness and death in double measure our whole population in new england are groaning and suffering under afflictions the result of a depressed vitalityneuralgia with a new ache for every day of the year rheumatism consumption general debility for all these a thousand nostrums are daily advertised and money enough is spent on them to equip an army while we are fighting against wasting and throwing away with both hands that blessed influence which comes nearest to pure vitality of anything god has given  who is it that the bible describes as a sun arising with healing in his wings surely that sunshine which is the chosen type and image of his love must be healing through all the recesses of our daily life drying damp and mould defending from moth and rust sweetening ill smells clearing from the nerves the vapors of melancholy making life cheery if i did not know him i should certainly adore and worship the sun the most blessed and beautiful image of him among things visible in the land of egypt in the day of gods wrath there was darkness but in the land of goshen there was light i am a goshenite and mean to walk in the light and forswear the works of darkness but to proceed with our reading                                       our house shall be set on a southeast line so that there shall not be a sunless room in it and windows shall be so arranged that it can be traversed and transpierced through and through with those bright shafts of light which come straight from god  our house shall not be blockaded with a dank dripping mass of shrubbery set plumb against the windows keeping out light and air there shall be room all round it for breezes to sweep and sunshine to sweeten and dry and vivify and i would warn all good souls who begin life by setting out two little evergreentrees within a foot of each of their frontwindows that these trees will grow and increase till their frontrooms will be brooded over by a sombre stifling shadow fit only for ravens to croak in  one would think by the way some people hasten to convert a very narrow frontyard into a dismal jungle that the only danger of our new england climate was sunstroke ah in those drizzling months which form at least one half of our life here what sullen censorious uncomfortable unhealthy thoughts are bred of living in dark chilly rooms behind such dripping thickets our neighbors faults assume a deeper hue life seems a dismal thing our very religion grows mouldy  my idea of a house is that as far as is consistent with shelter and reasonable privacy it should give you on first entering an open breezy outdoor freshness of sensation every window should be a picturesun and trees and clouds and green grass should seem never to be far from us our house may shade but not darken us our house shall have bowwindows many sunny and airynot for the purpose of being cleaned and shut up but to be open and enjoyed there shall be long verandas above and below where invalids may walk dryshod and enjoy openair recreation in wettest weather in short i will try to have our house combine as far as possible the sunny joyous fresh life of a gypsy in the fields and woods with the quiet and neatness and comfort and shelter of a roof rooms floors and carpets  after heavenly fire i have a word to say of earthly artificial fires furnaces whether of hot water steam or hot air are all healthy and admirable provisions for warming our houses during the eight or nine months of our year that we must have artificial heat if only as i have said fireplaces keep up a current of ventilation  the kitchenrange with its waterback i humbly salute it is a great throbbing heart and sends its warm tides of cleansing comforting fluid all through the house one could wish that this friendly dragon could be in some way moderated in his appetite for coalhe does consume without mercy it must be confessedbut then great is the work he has to do at any hour of day or night in the most distant part of your house you have but to turn a stopcock and your red dragon sends you hot water for your need your washingday becomes a mere playday your pantry has its everready supply and then by a little judicious care in arranging apartments and economizing heat a range may make two or three chambers comfortable in winter weather a range with a waterback is among the mustbes in our house  then as to the evening lighti know nothing as yet better than gas where it can be had i would certainly not have a house without it the great objection to it is the danger of its escape through imperfect fixtures but it must not do this a fluid that kills a tree or a plant with one breath must certainly be a dangerous ingredient in the atmosphere and if admitted into houses must be introduced with every safeguard  there are families living in the country who make their own gas by a very simple process this is worth an inquiry from those who build there are also contrivances now advertised with good testimonials of domestic machines for generating gas said to be perfectly safe simple to be managed and producing a light superior to that of the city gas works this also is worth an inquiry when our house is to be in the country  and now i come to the next great vital element for which our house must providewater water water everywhereit must be plentiful it must be easy to get at it must be pure our ancestors had some excellent ideas in home living and housebuilding their houses were generally speaking very sensibly contrivedroomy airy and comfortable but in their water arrangements they had little mercy on womankind the well was out in the yard and in winter one must flounder through snow and bring up the icebound bucket before one could fill the teakettle for breakfast for a sovereign princess of the republic this was hardly respectful or respectable wells have come somewhat nearer in modern times but the idea of a constant supply of fresh water by the simple turning of a stopcock has not yet visited the great body of our houses were we free to build our house just as we wish it there should be a bathroom to every two or three inmates and the hot and cold water should circulate to every chamber  among our mustbes we would lay by a generous sum for plumbing let us have our bathrooms and our arrangements for cleanliness and health in kitchen and pantry and afterwards let the quality of our lumber and the style of our finishing be according to the sum we have left the power to command a warm bath in a house at any hour of day or night is better in bringing up a family of children than any amount of ready medicine in three quarters of childish ailments the warm bath is an almost immediate remedy bad colds incipient fevers rheumatisms convulsions neuralgias innumerable are washed off in their first beginnings and run down the lead pipes into oblivion have then o friend all the water in your house that you can afford and enlarge your ideas of the worth of it that you may afford a great deal a bathingroom is nothing to you that requires an hour of lifting and firemaking to prepare it for use the apparatus is too cumbrousyou do not turn to it but when your chamber opens upon a neat quiet little nook and you have only to turn your stopcocks and all is ready your remedy is at hand you use it constantly you are waked in the night by a scream and find little tom sitting up wild with burning fever in three minutes he is in the bath quieted and comfortable you get him back cooled and tranquil to his little crib and in the morning he wakes as if nothing had happened  why should not so invaluable and simple a remedy for disease such a preservative of health such a comfort such a stimulus be considered as much a matterofcourse in a house as a kitchenchimney at least there should be one bathroom always in order so arranged that all the family can have access to it if one cannot afford the luxury of many  a house in which water is universally and skillfully distributed is so much easier to take care of as almost to verify the saying of a friend that his house was so contrived that it did its own work one had better do without carpets on the floors without stuffed sofas and rockingchairs and secure this                                       well papa said marianne you have made out all your four elements in your house except one i cant imagine what you want of earth  i thought said jenny that the less of our common mother we had in our houses the better housekeepers we were  my dears said i we philosophers must give an occasional dip into the mystical and say something apparently absurd for the purpose of explaining that we mean nothing in particular by it it gives common people an idea of our sagacity to find how clear we come out of our apparent contradictions and absurdities listen                                       for the fourth requisite of our house earth let me point you to your mothers plantwindow and beg you to remember the fact that through our long dreary winters we are never a month without flowers and the vivid interest which always attaches to growing things the perfect house as i conceive it is to combine as many of the advantages of living out of doors as may be consistent with warmth and shelter and one of these is the sympathy with green and growing things plants are nearer in their relations to human health and vigor than is often imagined the cheerfulness that wellkept plants impart to a room comes not merely from gratification of the eyethere is a healthful exhalation from them they are a corrective of the impurities of the atmosphere plants too are valuable as tests of the vitality of the atmosphere their drooping and failure convey to us information that something is amiss with it a lady once told me that she could never raise plants in her parlors on account of the gas and anthracite coal i answered are you not afraid to live and bring up your children in an atmosphere which blights your plants if the gas escape from the pipes and the redhot anthracite coal or the redhot airtight stove burns out all the vital part of the air so that healthy plants in a few days wither and begin to drop their leaves it is sign that the air must be looked to and reformed it is a fatal augury for a room that plants cannot be made to thrive in it plants should not turn pale be longjointed longleaved and spindling and where they grow in this way we may be certain that there is a want of vitality for human beings but where plants appear as they do in the open air with vigorous stocky growth and shortstemmed deepgreen leaves we may believe the conditions of that atmosphere are healthy for human lungs  it is pleasant to see how the custom of plant growing has spread through our country in how many farmhouse windows do we see petunias and nasturtiums vivid with bloom while snows are whirling without and how much brightness have those cheap enjoyments shed on the lives of those who cared for them we do not believe there is a human being who would not become a passionate lover of plants if circumstances once made it imperative to tend upon and watch the growth of one the history of picciola for substance has been lived over and over by many a man and woman who once did not know that there was a particle of plantlove in their souls but to the proper care of plants in pots there are many hindrances and drawbacks the dust chokes the little pores of their green lungs and they require constant showering and to carry all ones plants to a sink or porch for this purpose is a labor which many will not endure consequently plants often do not get a showering once a month we should try to imitate more closely the action of mother nature who washes every green child of hers nightly with dews which lie glittering on its leaves till morning                                       yes there it is said jenny i think i could manage with plants if it were not for this eternal showering and washing they seem to require to keep them fresh they are always tempting one to spatter the carpet and surrounding furniture which are not equally benefited by the libation  it is partly for that very reason i replied that the plan of our house provides for the introduction of mother earth as you will see                                       a perfect house according to my idea should always include in it a little compartment where plants can be kept can be watered can be defended from the dust and have the sunshine and all the conditions of growth  people have generally supposed a conservatory to be one of the last trappings of wealthsomething not to be thought of for those in modest circumstances but is this so you have a bowwindow in your parlor leave out the flooring fill the space with rich earth close it from the parlor by glass doors and you have room for enough plants and flowers to keep you gay and happy all winter if on the south side where the sunbeams have power it requires no heat but that which warms the parlor and the comfort of it is incalculable and the expense a mere trifle greater than that of the bowwindow alone  in larger houses a larger space might be appropriated in this way we will not call it a conservatory because that name suggests ideas of gardeners and mysteries of culture and rare plants which bring all sorts of care and expense in their train we would rather call it a greenery a room floored with earth with glass sides to admit the sunand let it open on as many other rooms of the house as possible  why should not the diningroom and parlor be all winter connected by a spot of green and flowers with plants mosses and ferns for the shadowy portions and such simple blooms as petunias and nasturtiums garlanding the sunny portion near the windows if near the waterworks this greenery might be enlivened by the play of a fountain whose constant spray would give that softness to the air which is so often burned away by the dry heat of the furnace                                       and do you really think papa that houses built in this way are a practical result to be aimed at said jenny to me it seems like a dream of the alhambra  yet i happen to have seen real people in our day living in just such a house said i i could point you this very hour to a cottage which in style of building is the plainest possible which unites many of the best ideas of a true house my dear can you sketch the ground plan of that house we saw in brighton  here it is said my wife after a few dashes with her pencil an inexpensive house yet one of the pleasantest i ever saw  illustration house blueprint  this cottage which might at the rate of prices before the war have been built for five thousand dollars has many of the requirements which i seek for a house it has two stories and a tier of very pleasant atticrooms two bathingrooms and the water carried into each story the parlor and diningroom both look into a little bower where a fountain is ever playing into a little marble basin and which all the year through has its green and bloom it is heated simply from the furnace by a register like any other room of the house and requires no more care than a delicate woman could easily give the brightness and cheerfulness it brings during our long dreary winters is incredible                                       but one caution is necessary in all such appendages the earth must be thoroughly underdrained to prevent the vapors of stagnant water and have a large admixture of broken charcoal to obviate the consequences of vegetable decomposition great care must be taken that there be no leaves left to fall and decay on the ground since vegetable exhalations poison the air with these precautions such a plot will soften and purify the air of a house  where the means do not allow even so small a conservatory a recessed window might be fitted with a deep box which should have a drainpipe at the bottom and a thick layer of broken charcoal and gravel with a mixture of fine woodsoil and sand for the top stratum here ivies may be planted which will run and twine and strike their little tendrils here and there and give the room in time the aspect of a bower the various greenhouse nasturtiums will make winter gorgeous with blossoms in windows unblessed by sunshineand alas such are manyone can cultivate ferns and mosses the wintergrowing ferns of which there are many varieties can be mixed with mosses and woodland flowers  early in february when the cheerless frosts of winter seem most wearisome the common blue violet wood anemone hepatica or rockcolumbine if planted in this way will begin to bloom the common partridgeberry with its brilliant scarlet fruit and darkgreen leaves will also grow finely in such situations and have a beautiful effect these things require daily showering to keep them fresh and the moisture arising from them will soften and freshen the too dry air of heated winter rooms                                       thus i have been through my four essential elements in housebuildingair fire water and earth i would provide for these before anything else after they are secured i would gratify my taste and fancy as far as possible in other ways i quite agree with bob in hating commonplace houses and longing for some little bit of architectural effect and i grieve profoundly that every step in that direction must cost so much i have also a taste for niceness of finish i have no objection to silverplated doorlocks and hinges none to windows which are an entire plate of clear glass i congratulate neighbors who are so fortunate as to be able to get them and after i have put all the essentials into a house i would have these too if i had the means  but if all my wood work were to be without groove or moulding if my mantels were to be of simple wood if my doors were all to be machinemade and my lumber of the second quality i would have my bathrooms my conservatory my sunny bowwindows and my perfect ventilation and my house would then be so pleasant and every one in it in such a cheerful mood that it would verily seem to be ceiled with cedar  speaking of ceiling with cedar i have one thing more to say we americans have a country abounding in beautiful timber of whose beauties we know nothing on account of the pernicious and stupid habit of covering it with white paint  the celebrated zebra wood with its golden stripes cannot exceed in quaint beauty the grain of unpainted chestnut prepared simply with a coat or two of oil the butternut has a rich golden brown the very darling color of painters a shade so rich and grain so beautiful that it is of itself as charming to look at as a rich picture the blackwalnut with its heavy depth of tone works in well as an adjunct and as to oak what can we say enough of its quaint and many shadings even common pine which has been considered not decent to look upon till hastily shrouded in a friendly blanket of white paint has when oiled and varnished the beauty of satinwood the second quality of pine which has what are called shakes in it under this mode of treatment often shows clouds and veins equal in beauty to the choicest woods the cost of such a finish is greatly less than that of the old method and it saves those days and weeks of cleaning which are demanded by white paint while its general tone is softer and more harmonious experiments in color may be tried in the combinations of these woods which at small expense produce the most charming effects  as to paper hangings we are proud to say that our american manufacturers now furnish all that can be desired there are some branches of design where artistic ingenious france must still excel us but whoso has a house to fit up let him first look at what his own country has to show and he will be astonished  there is one topic in housebuilding on which i would add a few words the difficulty of procuring and keeping good servants which must long be one of our chief domestic troubles warns us so to arrange our houses that we shall need as few as possible there is the greatest conceivable difference in the planning and building of houses as to the amount of work which will be necessary to keep them in respectable condition some houses require a perfect staff of housemaids there are plated hinges to be rubbed paint to be cleaned with intricacies of moulding and carving which daily consume hours of dusting to preserve them from a slovenly look simple finish unpainted wood a general distribution of water through the dwelling will enable a very large house to be cared for by one pair of hands and yet maintain a creditable appearance  in kitchens one servant may perform the work of two by a close packing of all the conveniences for cooking and such arrangements as shall save time and steps washingday may be divested of its terrors by suitable provisions for water hot and cold by wringers which save at once the strength of the linen and of the laundress and by dryingclosets connected with ranges where articles can in a few moments be perfectly dried these with the use of a small mangle such as is now common in america reduce the labors of the laundry one half  there are many more things which might be said of our house and christopher may perhaps find some other opportunity to say them for the present his pen is tired and ceaseth     xii  home religion   it was sunday evening and our little circle were convened by my study fireside where a crackling hickory fire proclaimed the fall of the year to be coming on and cold weather impending sunday evenings my married boys and girls are fond of coming home and gathering round the old hearthstone and making believe that they are children again we get out the oldfashioned musicbooks and sing old hymns to very old tunes and my wife and her matron daughters talk about the babies in the intervals and we discourse of the sermon and of the choir and all the general outworks of good pious things which sunday suggests  papa said marianne you are closing up your house and home papers are you not  yesi am come to the last one for this year at least  my dear said my wife there is one subject you havent touched on yet you ought not to close the year without it no house and home can be complete without religion you should write a paper on home religion  my wife as you may have seen in these papers is an oldfashioned woman something of a conservative i am i confess rather given to progress and speculation but i feel always as if i were going on in these ways with a string round my waist and my wifes hand steadily pulling me back into the old paths my wife is a steady biblereading sabbathkeeping woman cherishing the memory of her fathers and loving to do as they didbelieving for the most part that the paths well beaten by righteous feet are safest even though much walking therein has worn away the grass and flowers nevertheless she has an indulgent ear for all that gives promise of bettering anybody or anything and therefore is not severe on any new methods that may arise in our progressive days of accomplishing old good objects  there must be a home religion said my wife  i believe in home religion said bob stephensbut not in the outward show of it the best sort of religion is that which one keeps at the bottom of his heart and which goes up thence quietly through all his actions and not the kind that comes through a certain routine of forms and ceremonies do you suppose family prayers now and a blessing at meals make people any better  depend upon it robert said my wifeshe always calls him robert on sunday eveningsdepend upon it we are not so very much wiser than our fathers were that we need depart from their good old ways of course i would have religion in the heart and spreading quietly through the life but does this interfere with those outward daily acts of respect and duty which we owe to our creator it is too much the slang of our day to decry forms and to exalt the excellency of the spirit in opposition to them but tell me are you satisfied with friendship that has none of the outward forms of friendship or love that has none of the outward forms of love are you satisfied of the existence of a sentiment that has no outward mode of expression even the old heathen had their pieties they would not begin a feast without a libation to their divinities and there was a shrine in every wellregulated house for household gods  the trouble with all these things said bob is that they get to be mere forms i never could see that family worship amounted to much more in most families  the outward expression of all good things is apt to degenerate into mere form said i the outward expression of social good feeling becomes a mere form but for that reason must we meet each other like oxen not say good morning or good evening or i am happy to see you must we never use any of the forms of mutual good will except in those moments when we are excited by a real present emotion what would become of society forms are so to speak a daguerreotype of a past good feeling meant to take and keep the impression of it when it is gone our best and most inspired moments are crystallized in them and even when the spirit that created them is gone they help to bring it back every one must be conscious that the use of the forms of social benevolence even towards those who are personally unpleasant to us tends to ameliorate prejudices we see a man entering our door who is a weary bore but we use with him those forms of civility which society prescribes and feel far kinder to him than if we had shut the door in his face and said go along you tiresome fellow now why does not this very obvious philosophy apply to better and higher feelings the forms of religion are as much more necessary than the forms of politeness and social good will as religion is more important than all other things  besides said my wife a form of worship kept up from year to year in a familythe assembling of parents and children for a few sacred moments each day though it may be a form many times especially in the gay and thoughtless hours of lifeoften becomes invested with deep sacredness in times of trouble or in those crises that rouse our deeper feelings in sickness in bereavement in separation the daily prayer at home has a sacred and healing power then we remember the scattered and wandering ones and the scattered and wandering think tenderly of that hour when they know they are remembered i know when i was a young girl i was often thoughtless and careless about family prayers but now that my father and mother are gone forever there is nothing i recall more often i remember the great old family bible the hymnbook the chair where father used to sit i see him as he looked bending over that bible more than in any other way and expressions and sentences in his prayers which fell unheeded on my ears in those days have often come back to me like comforting angels we are not aware of the influence things are having on us till we have left them far behind in years when we have summered and wintered them and look back on them from changed times and other days we find that they were making their mark upon us though we knew it not  i have often admired said i the stateliness and regularity of family worship in good old families in englandthe servants guests and children all assembledthe reading of the scriptures and the daily prayers by the master or mistress of the family ending with the united repetition of the lords prayer by all  no such assemblage is possible in our country said bob our servants are for the most part roman catholics and forbidden by their religion to join with us in acts of worship  the greater the pity said i it is a pity that all christians who can conscientiously repeat the apostles creed and the lords prayer together should for any reason be forbidden to do so it would do more to harmonize our families and promote good feeling between masters and servants to meet once a day on the religious ground common to both than many sermons on reciprocal duties  but while the case is so said marianne we cant help it our servants cannot unite with us our daily prayers are something forbidden to them  we cannot in this country said i give to family prayer that solemn stateliness which it has in a country where religion is a civil institution and masters and servants as a matter of course belong to one church our prayers must resemble more a private interview with a father than a solemn act of homage to a king they must be more intimate and domestic the hour of family devotion should be the childrens hourheld dear as the interval when the busy father drops his business and cares and like jesus of old takes the little ones in his arms and blesses them the child should remember it as the time when the father always seemed most accessible and loving the old family worship of new england lacked this character of domesticity and intimacyit was stately and formal distant and cold but whatever were its defects i cannot think it an improvement to leave it out altogether as too many good sort of people in our day are doing there may be practical religion where its outward daily forms are omitted but there is assuredly no more of it for the omission no man loves god and his neighbor less is a less honest and good man for daily prayers in his householdthe chances are quite the other way and if the spirit of love rules the family hour it may prove the source and spring of all that is good through the day it seems to be a solemn duty in the parents thus to make the invisible fatherhood real to their children who can receive this idea at first only through outward forms and observances the little one thus learns that his father has a father in heaven and that the earthly life he is living is only a sacrament and emblema type of the eternal life which infolds it and of more lasting relations there whether therefore it be the silent grace and silent prayer of the friends or the form of prayer of ritual churches or the extemporaneous outpouring of those whose habits and taste lead them to extempore prayer in one of these ways there should be daily outward and visible acts of worship in every family  well now said bob about this old question of sundaykeeping marianne and i are much divided i am always for doing something that she thinks isnt the thing  well you see said marianne bob is always talking against our old puritan fathers and saying all manner of hard things about them he seems to think that all their ways and doings must of course have been absurd for my part i dont think we are in any danger of being too strict about anything it appears to me that in this country there is a general tendency to let all sorts of old forms and observances float downstream and yet nobody seems quite to have made up his mind what shall come next  the fact is said i that we realize very fully all the objections and difficulties of the experiments in living that we have tried but the difficulties in others that we are intending to try have not yet come to light the puritan sabbath had great and very obvious evils its wearisome restraints and overstrictness cast a gloom on religion and arrayed against the day itself the active prejudices that now are undermining it and threatening its extinction but it had great merits and virtues and produced effects on society that we cannot well afford to dispense with the clearing of a whole day from all possibilities of labor and amusement necessarily produced a grave and thoughtful people and a democratic republic can be carried on by no other in lands which have sabbaths of mere amusement mere gala days republics rise and fall as quick as childrens cardhouses and the reason is they are built by those whose political and religious education has been childish the common people of europe have been sedulously nursed on amusements by the reigning powers to keep them from meddling with serious matters their religion has been sensuous and sentimental and their sabbaths thoughtless holidays the common people of new england are educated to think to reason to examine all questions of politics and religion for themselves and one deeply thoughtful day every week baptizes and strengthens their reflective and reasoning faculties the sundayschools of paris are whirligigs where young france rides round and round on little hobbyhorses till his brain spins even faster than nature made it to spin and when he grows up his political experiments are as whirligig as his sunday education if i were to choose between the sabbath of france and the old puritan sabbath i should hold up both hands for the latter with all its objectionable features  well said my wife cannot we contrive to retain all that is really valuable of the sabbath and to ameliorate and smooth away what is forbidding  that is the problem of our day said i we do not want the sabbath of continental europe it does not suit democratic institutions it cannot be made even a quiet or a safe day except by means of that everpresent armed police that exists there if the sabbath of america is simply to be a universal loafing picnicking diningout day as it is now with all our foreign population we shall need what they have in europe the gendarmes at every turn to protect the fruit on our trees and the melons in our fields people who live a little out from great cities see enough and more than enough of this sort of sabbathkeeping with our loose american police  the fact is our system of government was organized to go by moral influences as much as mills by water and sunday was the great day for concentrating these influences and bringing them to bear and we might just as well break down all the dams and let out all the water of the lowell mills and expect still to work the looms as to expect to work our laws and constitution with european notions of religion  it is true the puritan sabbath had its disagreeable points so have the laws of nature they are of a most uncomfortable sternness and rigidity yet for all that we would hardly join in a petition to have them repealed or made wavering and uncertain for human convenience we can bend to them in a thousand ways and live very comfortably under them  but said bob sabbathkeeping is the iron rod of bigots they dont allow a man any liberty of his own one says its wicked to write a letter sunday another holds that you must read no book but the bible and a third is scandalized if you take a walk ever so quietly in the fields there are all sorts of quips and turns we may fasten things with pins of a sunday but its wicked to fasten with needle and thread and so on and so on and each one planting himself on his own individual mode of keeping sunday points his guns and frowns severely over the battlements on his neighbors whose opinions and practice are different from his  yet said i sabbath days are expressly mentioned by saint paul as among those things concerning which no man should judge another it seems to me that the error as regards the puritan sabbath was in representing it not as a gift from god to man but as a tribute of man to god hence all these hagglings and nice questions and exactions to the uttermost farthing the holy time must be weighed and measured it must begin at twelve oclock of one night and end at twelve oclock of another and from beginning to end the mind must be kept in a state of tension by the effort not to think any of its usual thoughts or do any of its usual works the fact is that the metaphysical defining hairsplitting mind of new england turning its whole powers on this one bit of ritual this one only day of divine service which was left of all the feasts and fasts of the old churches made of it a thing straiter and stricter than ever the old jews dreamed of  the old jewish sabbath entered only into the physical region merely enjoining cessation from physical toil thou shalt not labor nor do any work covered the whole ground in other respects than this it was a joyful festival resembling in the mode of keeping it the christmas of the modern church it was a day of social hilaritythe jewish law strictly forbidding mourning and gloom during festivals the people were commanded on feast days to rejoice before the lord their god with all their might we fancy there were no houses where children were afraid to laugh where the voice of social cheerfulness quavered away in terror lest it should awake a wrathful god the jewish sabbath was instituted in the absence of printing of books and of all the advantages of literature to be the great means of preserving sacred historya day cleared from all possibility of other employment than social and family communion when the heads of families and the elders of tribes might instruct the young in those religious traditions which have thus come down to us  the christian sabbath is meant to supply the same moral need in that improved and higher state of society which christianity introduced thus it was changed from the day representing the creation of the world to the resurrection day of him who came to make all things new the jewish sabbath was buried with christ in the sepulchre and arose with him not a jewish but a christian festival still holding in itself that provision for mans needs which the old institution possessed but with a wider and more generous freedom of application it was given to the christian world as a day of rest of refreshment of hope and joy and of worship the manner of making it such a day was left open and free to the needs and convenience of the varying circumstances and characters of those for whose benefit it was instituted  well said bob dont you think there is a deal of nonsense about sabbathkeeping  there is a deal of nonsense about everything human beings have to deal with i said  and said marianne how to find out what is nonsense  by clear conceptions said i of what the day is for i should define the sabbath as a divine and fatherly gift to mana day expressly set apart for the cultivation of his moral nature its object is not merely physical rest and recreation but moral improvement the former are proper to the day only so far as they are subservient to the latter the whole human race have the conscious need of being made better purer and more spiritual the whole human race have one common danger of sinking to a mere animal life under the pressure of labor or in the dissipations of pleasure and of the whole human race the proverb holds good that what may be done any time is done at no time hence the heavenly father appoints one day as a special season for the culture of mans highest faculties accordingly whatever ways and practices interfere with the purpose of the sabbath as a day of worship and moral culture should be avoided and all family arrangements for the day should be made with reference thereto  cold dinners on sunday for example said bob marianne holds these as prime articles of faith  yesthey doubtless are most worthy and merciful in giving to the poor cook one day she may call her own and rest from the heat of range and cookingstove for the same reason i would suspend as far as possible all traveling and all public labor on sunday the hundreds of hands that these things require to carry them on are the hands of human beings whose right to this merciful pause of rest is as clear as their humanity let them have their day to look upward  but the little ones said my oldest matron daughter who had not as yet spokenthey are the problem oh this weary labor of making children keep sunday if i try it i have no rest at all myself if i must talk to them or read to them to keep them from play my sabbath becomes my hardest working day  and pray what commandment of the bible ever said children should not play on sunday said i we are forbidden to work and we see the reason why but lambs frisk and robins sing on sunday and little children who are as yet more than half animals must not be made to keep the day in the manner proper to our more developed faculties as much cheerful attractive religious instruction as they can bear without weariness may be given and then they may simply be restrained from disturbing others say to the little one this day we have noble and beautiful things to think of that interest us deeply you are a child you cannot read and think and enjoy such things as much as we can you may play softly and quietly and remember not to make a disturbance i would take a child to public worship at least once of a sunday it forms a good habit in him if the sermon be long and unintelligible there are the little sabbathschool books in every childs hands and while the grown people are getting what they understand who shall forbid a childs getting what is suited to him in a way that interests him and disturbs nobody the sabbathschool is the childs church and happily it is yearly becoming a more and more attractive institution i approve the custom of those who beautify the sabbath schoolroom with plants flowers and pictures thus making it an attractive place to the childish eye the more this custom prevails the more charming in after years will be the memories of sunday  it is most especially to be desired that the whole air and aspect of the day should be one of cheerfulness even the new dresses new bonnets and new shoes in which children delight of a sunday should not be despised they have their value in marking the day as a festival and it is better for the child to long for sunday for the sake of his little new shoes than that he should hate and dread it as a period of wearisome restraint all the latitude should be given to children that can be consistently with fixing in their minds the idea of a sacred season i would rather that the atmosphere of the day should resemble that of a weekly thanksgiving than that it should make its mark on the tender mind only by the memory of deprivations and restrictions  well said bob heres marianne always breaking her heart about my reading on sunday now i hold that what is bad on sunday is bad on mondayand what is good on monday is good on sunday  we cannot abridge other peoples liberty said i the generous confiding spirit of christianity has imposed not a single restriction upon us in reference to sunday the day is put at our disposal as a good father hands a piece of money to his childthere it is take it and spend it well the child knows from his fathers character what he means by spending it well but he is left free to use his own judgment as to the mode  if a man conscientiously feels that reading of this or that description is the best for him as regards his moral training and improvement let him pursue it and let no man judge him it is difficult with the varying temperaments of men to decide what are or are not religious books one man is more religiously impressed by the reading of history or astronomy than he would be by reading a sermon there may be overwrought and wearied states of the brain and nerves which require and make proper the diversions of light literature and if so let it be used the mind must have its recreations as well as the body  but for children and young people said my daughterwould you let them read novels on sunday  that is exactly like asking would you let them talk with people on sunday now people are different it depends therefore on who they are some are trifling and flighty some are positively badprincipled some are altogether good in their influence so of the class of books called novels some are merely frivolous some are absolutely noxious and dangerous others again are written with a strong moral and religious purpose and being vivid and interesting produce far more religious effect on the mind than dull treatises and sermons the parables of christ sufficiently establish the point that there is no inherent objection to the use of fiction in teaching religious truth good religious fiction thoughtfully read may be quite as profitable as any other reading  but dont you think said marianne that there is danger in too much fiction  yes said i but the chief danger of all that class of reading is its easiness and the indolent careless mental habits it induces a great deal of the reading of young people on all days is really reading to no purpose its object being merely present amusement it is a listless yielding of the mind to be washed over by a stream which leaves no fertilizing properties and carries away by constant wear the good soil of thought i should try to establish a barrier against this kind of reading not only on sunday but on monday on tuesday and on all days instead therefore of objecting to any particular class of books for sunday reading i should say in general that reading merely for pastime without any moral aim is the thing to be guarded against that which inspires no thought no purpose which steals away all our strength and energy and makes the sabbath a day of dreams is the reading i would object to  so of music i do not see the propriety of confining ones self to technical sacred music any grave solemn thoughtful or pathetic music has a proper relation to our higher spiritual nature whether it be printed in a church servicebook or on secular sheets on me for example beethovens sonatas have a far more deeply religious influence than much that has religious names and words music is to be judged of by its effects  well said bob if sunday is given for our own individual improvement i for one should not go to church i think i get a great deal more good in staying at home and reading  there are two considerations to be taken into account in reference to this matter of churchgoing i replied one relates to our duty as members of society in keeping up the influence of the sabbath and causing it to be respected in the community the other to the proper disposition of our time for our own moral improvement as members of the community we should go to church and do all in our power to support the outward ordinances of religion if a conscientious man makes up his mind that sunday is a day for outward acts of worship and reverence he should do his own part as an individual towards sustaining these observances even though he may have such mental and moral resources that as an individual he could gain much more in solitude than in a congregation still he owes to the congregation the influence of his presence and sympathy but i have never yet seen the man however finely gifted morally and intellectually whom i thought in the long run a gainer in either of these respects by the neglect of public worship i have seen many who in their pride kept aloof from the sympathies and communion of their brethren who lost strength morally and deteriorated in ways that made themselves painfully felt sunday is apt in such cases to degenerate into a day of mere mental idleness and reverie or to become a sort of wastepaper box for scraps odds and ends of secular affairs  as to those very good peopleand many such there arewho go straight on with the work of life on sunday on the plea that to labor is to pray i simply think they are mistaken in the first place to labor is not the same thing as to pray it may sometimes be as good a thing to do and in some cases even a better thing but it is not the same thing a man might as well never write a letter to his wife on the plea that making money for her is writing to her it may possibly be quite as great a proof of love to work for a wife as to write to her but few wives would not say that both were not better than either alone furthermore there is no doubt that the intervention of one day of spiritual rest and aspiration so refreshes a mans whole nature and oils the many wheels of existence that he who allows himself a weekly sabbath does more work in the course of his life for the omission of work on that day  a young student in a french college where the examinations are rigidly severe found by experience that he succeeded best in his examination by allowing one day of entire rest just before it his brain and nervous system refreshed in this way carried him through the work better than if taxed to the last moment there are men transacting a large and complicated business who can testify to the same influence from the repose of the sabbath  i believe those christian people who from conscience and principle turn their thoughts most entirely out of the current of worldly cares on sunday fulfill unconsciously a great law of health and that whether their moral nature be thereby advanced or not their brain will work more healthfully and actively for it even in physical and worldly matters it is because the sabbath thus harmonizes the physical and moral laws of our being that the injunction concerning it is placed among the ten great commandments each of which represents some one of the immutable needs of humanity  there is yet another point of family religion that ought to be thought of said my wife i mean the customs of mourning if there is anything that ought to distinguish christian families from pagans it should be their way of looking at and meeting those inevitable events that must from time to time break the family chain it seems to be the peculiarity of christianity to shed hope on such events and yet it seems to me as if it were the very intention of many of the customs of society to add tenfold to their gloom and horrorsuch swathings of black crape such funereal mufflings of every pleasant object such darkening of rooms and such seclusion from society and giving up to bitter thoughts and lamentation how can little children that look on such things believe that there is a particle of truth in all they hear about the joyous and comforting doctrines which the bible holds forth for such times  that subject is a difficult one i rejoined nature seems to indicate a propriety in some outward expressions of grief when we lose our friends all nations agree in these demonstrations in a certain degree they are soothing to sorrow they are the language of external life made to correspond to the internal wearing mourning has its advantages it is a protection to the feelings of the wearer for whom it procures sympathetic and tender consideration it saves grief from many a hard jostle in the ways of life it prevents the necessity of many a trying explanation and is the ready apology for many an omission of those tasks to which sorrow is unequal for all these reasons i never could join the crusade which some seem disposed to wage against it mourning however ought not to be continued for years its uses are more for the first few months of sorrow when it serves the mourner as a safeguard from intrusion insuring quiet and leisure in which to reunite the broken threads of life and to gather strength for a return to its duties but to wear mourning garments and forego society for two or three years after the loss of any friend however dear i cannot but regard as a morbid unhealthy nursing of sorrow unworthy of a christian  and yet said my wife to such an unhealthy degree does this custom prevail that i have actually known young girls who have never worn any other dress than mourning and consequently never been into society during the entire period of their girlhood first the death of a father necessitated three years of funereal garments and abandonment of social relations then the death of a brother added two years more and before that mourning was well ended another of a wide circle of relatives being taken the habitual seclusion was still protracted what must a child think of the christian doctrine of life and death who has never seen life except through black crape we profess to believe in a better life to which the departed good are calledto believe in the shortness of our separation the certainty of reunion and that all these events are arranged in all their relations by an infinite tenderness which cannot err surely christian funerals too often seem to say that affliction cometh of the dust and not from above  but said bob after all death is a horror you can make nothing less of it you cant smooth it over nor dress it with flowers it is what nature shudders at  it is precisely for this reason said i that christians should avoid those customs which aggravate and intensify this natural dread why overpower the senses with doleful and funereal images in the hour of weakness and bereavement when the soul needs all her force to rise above the gloom of earth and to realize the mysteries of faith why shut the friendly sunshine from the mourners room why muffle in a white shroud every picture that speaks a cheerful household word to the eye why make a house look stiff and ghastly and cold as a corpse in some of our cities on the occurrence of a death in the family all the shutters on the street are closed and tied with black crape and so remain for months what an oppressive gloom must this bring on a house how like the very shadow of death it is enlisting the nerves and the senses against our religion and making more difficult the great duty of returning to life and its interests i would have flowers and sunshine in the deserted rooms and make them symbolical of the cheerful mansions above to which our beloved ones are gone home ought to be so religiously cheerful so penetrated by the life of love and hope and christian faith that the other world may be made real by it our home life should be a type of the higher life our home should be so sanctified its joys and its sorrows so baptized and hallowed that it shall not be sacrilegious to think of heaven as a higher form of the same thinga fathers house in the better country whose mansions are many whose love is perfect whose joy is eternal     the chimneycorner  i  what will you do with her or the woman question   well what will you do with her said i to my wife  my wife had just come down from an interview with a pale fadedlooking young woman in rusty black attire who had called upon me on the very common supposition that i was an editor of the atlantic monthly  by the by this is a mistake that brings me christopher crowfield many letters that do not belong to me and which might with equal pertinency be addressed to the man in the moon yet these letters often make my heart achethey speak so of people who strive and sorrow and want help and it is hard to be called on in plaintive tones for help which you know it is perfectly impossible for you to give  for instance you get a letter in a delicate hand setting forth the old distressshe is poor and she has looking to her for support those that are poorer and more helpless than herself she has tried sewing but can make little at it tried teaching but cannot now get a schoolall places being filled and more than filled at last has tried literature and written some little things of which she sends you a modest specimen and wants your opinion whether she can gain her living by writing you run over the articles and perceive at a glance that there is no kind of hope or use in her trying to do anything at literature and then you ask yourself mentally what is to be done with her what can she do  such was the application that had come to me this morningonly instead of by note it came as i have said in the person of the applicant a thin delicate consumptivelooking being wearing that rusty mourning which speaks sadly at once of heart bereavement and material poverty  my usual course is to turn such cases over to mrs crowfield and it is to be confessed that this worthy woman spends a large portion of her time and wears out an extraordinary amount of shoeleather in performing the duties of a selfconstituted intelligence office talk of giving money to the poor what is that compared to giving sympathy thought time taking their burdens upon you sharing their perplexities they who are able to buy off every application at the door of their heart with a five or ten dollar bill are those who free themselves at least expense  my wife had communicated to our friend in the gentlest tones and in the blandest manner that her poor little pieces however interesting to her own household circle had nothing in them wherewith to enable her to make her way in the thronged and crowded thoroughfare of lettersthat they had no more strength or adaptation to win bread for her than a brokenwinged butterfly to draw a plough and it took some resolution in the background of her tenderness to make the poor applicant entirely certain of this in cases like this absolute certainty is the very greatest the only true kindness  it was grievous my wife said to see the discouraged shade which passed over her thin tremulous features when this certainty forced itself upon her it is hard when sinking in the waves to see the frail bush at which the hand clutches uprooted hard when alone in the crowded thoroughfare of travel to have ones last banknote declared a counterfeit i knew i should not be able to see her face under the shade of this disappointment and so coward that i was i turned this trouble where i have turned so many others upon my wife  well what shall we do with her said i  i really dont know said my wife musingly  do you think we could get that school in taunton for her  impossible mr herbert told me he had already twelve applicants for it  couldnt you get her plain sewing is she handy with her needle  she has tried that but it brings on a pain in her side and cough and the doctor has told her it will not do for her to confine herself  how is her handwriting does she write a good hand  only passable  because said i i was thinking if i could get steele and simpson to give her law papers to copy  they have more copyists than they need now and in fact this woman does not write the sort of hand at all that would enable her to get on as a copyist  well said i turning uneasily in my chair and at last hitting on a bright masculine expedient ill tell you what must be done she must get married  my dear said my wife marrying for a living is the very hardest way a woman can take to get it even marrying for love often turns out badly enough witness poor jane  jane was one of the large number of people whom it seemed my wifes fortune to carry through life on her back she was a pretty smiling pleasing daughter of erin who had been in our family originally as nurserymaid i had been greatly pleased in watching a little idyllic affair growing up between her and a joyous goodnatured young irishman to whom at last we married her mike soon after however took to drinking and unsteady courses and the result has been to jane only a yearly baby with poor health and no money  in fact said my wife if jane had only kept single she could have made her own way well enough and might have now been in good health and had a pretty sum in the savings bank as it is i must carry not only her but her three children on my back  you ought to drop her my dear you really ought not to burden yourself with other peoples affairs as you do said i inconsistently  how can i drop her can i help knowing that she is poor and suffering and if i drop her who will take her up  now there is a way of getting rid of cases of this kind spoken of in a quaint old book which occurred strongly to me at this moment  if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit  i must confess notwithstanding the strong point of the closing question i looked with an evil eye of longing on this very easy way of disposing of such cases a few sympathizing words a few expressions of hope that i did not feel a line written to turn the case into somebody elses handsany expedient in fact to hide the longing eyes and imploring hands from my sightwas what my carnal nature at this moment greatly craved  besides said my wife resuming the thread of her thoughts in regard to the subject just now before us as to marriage its out of the question at present for this poor child for the man she loved and would have married lies low in one of the graves before richmond its a sad storyone of a thousand like it she brightened for a few moments and looked almost handsome when she spoke of his bravery and goodness her father and lover have both died in this war her only brother has returned from it a brokendown cripple and she has him and her poor old mother to care for and so she seeks work i told her to come again tomorrow and i would look about for her a little today  let me see how many are now down on your list to be looked about for mrs crowfieldsome twelve or thirteen are there not youve got toms sister disposed of finally i hopethats a comfort  well im sorry to say she came back on my hands yesterday said my wife patiently she is a foolish young thing and said she didnt like living out in the country im sorry because the morrises are an excellent family and she might have had a life home there if she had only been steady and chosen to behave herself properly but yesterday i found her back on her mothers hands again and the poor woman told me that the dear child never could bear to be separated from her and that she hadnt the heart to send her back  and in short said i she gave you notice that you must provide for miss oconnor in some more agreeable way cross that name off your list at any rate that woman and girl need a few hard raps in the school of experience before you can do anything for them  i think i shall said my longsuffering wife but its a pity to see a young thing put in the direct road to ruin  it is one of the inevitables said i and we must save our strength for those that are willing to help themselves  whats all this talk about said bob coming in upon us rather brusquely  oh as usual the old question said iwhats to be done with her  well said bob its exactly what ive come to talk with mother about since she keeps a distressed womens agency office ive come to consult her about marianne that woman will die before six months are out a victim to high civilization and the paddies there we are twelve miles out from boston in a country villa so convenient that every part of it might almost do its own workeverything arranged in the most convenient contiguous selfadjusting selfacting patentright perfective mannerand yet i tell you marianne will die of that house it will yet be recorded on her tombstone died of conveniences for myself what i languish for is a logcabin with a bed in one corner a trundlebed underneath for the children a fireplace only six feet off a table four chairs one kettle a coffeepot and a tin bakerthats all i lived deliciously in an establishment of this kind last summer when i was up at lake superior and i am convinced if i could move marianne into it at once that she would become a healthy and a happy woman her life is smothered out of her with comforts we have too many rooms too many carpets too many vases and knickknacks too much china and silver she has too many laces and dresses and bonnets the children all have too many clothes in fact to put it scripturally our riches are corrupted our garments are motheaten our gold and our silver is cankered and in short marianne is sick in bed and i have come to the agency office for distressed women to take you out to attend to her  the fact is continued bob that since our cook married and alice went to california there seems to be no possibility of putting our domestic cabinet upon any permanent basis the number of female persons that have been through our house and the ravages they have wrought on it for the last six months pass belief i had yesterday a bill of sixty dollars plumbing to pay for damages of various kinds which had had to be repaired in our very convenient waterworks and the blame of each particular one had been bandied like a shuttlecock among our three household divinities biddy privately assured my wife that kate was in the habit of emptying dustpans of rubbish into the main drain from the chambers and washing any little extra bits down through the bowls and in fact when one of the bathingroom bowls had overflowed so as to damage the frescoes below my wife with great delicacy and precaution interrogated kate as to whether she had followed her instructions in the care of the waterpipes of course she protested the most immaculate care and circumspection sure and she knew how careful one ought to be and wasnt of the likes of thim as wouldnt mind what throuble they madelike biddy who would throw trash and hair in the pipes and niver listen to her tellin sure and hadnt she broken the pipes in the kitchen and lost the stoppers as it was a shame to see in a christian house ann the third girl being privately questioned blamed biddy on monday and kate on tuesday on wednesday however she exonerated both but on thursday being in a high quarrel with both she departed accusing them severally not only of all the evil practices aforesaid but of lying and stealing and all other miscellaneous wickednesses that came to hand whereat the two thus accused rushed in bewailing themselves and cursing ann in alternate strophes averring that she had given the baby laudanum and taking it out riding had stopped for hours with it in a filthy lane where the scarlet fever was said to be rifein short made so fearful a picture that marianne gave up the childs life at once and has taken to her bed i have endeavored all i could to quiet her by telling her that the scarlet fever story was probably an extemporaneous work of fiction got up to gratify the hibernian anger at ann and that it wasnt in the least worth while to believe one thing more than another from the fact that any of the tribe said it but she refuses to be comforted and is so utopian as to lie there crying oh if i only could get one that i could trustone that would really speak the truth to meone that i might know really went where she said she went and really did as she said she did to have to live so she says and bring up little children with those she cant trust out of her sight whose word is good for nothingto feel that her beautiful house and her lovely things are all going to rack and ruin and she cant take care of them and cant see where or when or how the mischief is donein short the poor child talks as women do who are violently attacked with housekeeping fever tending to congestion of the brain she actually yesterday told me that she wished on the whole she never had got married which i take to be the most positive indication of mental alienation  here said i we behold at this moment two women dying for the want of what they can mutually give one anothereach having a supply of what the other needs but held back by certain invisible cobwebs slight but strong from coming to each others assistance marianne has money enough but she wants a helper in her family such as all her money has been hitherto unable to buy and here close at hand is a woman who wants home shelter healthy varied active cheerful labor with nourishing food kind care and good wages what hinders these women from rushing to the help of one another just as two drops of water on a leaf rush together and make one nothing but a miserable prejudicebut a prejudice so strong that women will starve in any other mode of life rather than accept competency and comfort in this  you dont mean said my wife to propose that our prot√©g√©e should go to marianne as a servant  i do say it would be the best thing for her to dothe only opening that i see and a very good one too it is just look at it her bare living at this moment cannot cost her less than five or six dollars a weekeverything at the present time is so very dear in the city now by what possible calling open to her capacity can she pay her board and washing fuel and lights and clear a hundred and some odd dollars a year she could not do it as a district school teacher she certainly cannot with her feeble health do it by plain sewing she could not do it as a copyist a robust woman might go into a factory and earn more but factory work is unintermitted twelve hours daily week in and out in the same movement in close air amid the clatter of machinery and a person delicately organized soon sinks under it it takes a stolid enduring temperament to bear factory labor now look at mariannes house and family and see what is insured to your prot√©g√©e there  in the first place a homea neat quiet chamber quite as good as she has probably been accustomed tothe very best of food served in a pleasant light airy kitchen which is one of the most agreeable rooms in the house and the table and table service quite equal to those of most farmers and mechanics then her daily tasks would be light and variedsome sweeping some dusting the washing and dressing of children the care of their rooms and the nurseryall of it the most healthful the most natural work of a womanwork alternating with rest and diverting thought from painful subjects by its variety and what is more a kind of work in which a good christian woman might have satisfaction as feeling herself useful in the highest and best way for the childs nurse if she be a pious welleducated woman may make the whole course of nursery life an education in goodness then what is far different from any other modes of gaining a livelihood a woman in this capacity can make and feel herself really and truly beloved the hearts of little children are easily gained and their love is real and warm and no true woman can become the object of it without feeling her own life made brighter again she would have in marianne a sincere warmhearted friend who would care for her tenderly respect her sorrows shelter her feelings be considerate of her wants and in every way aid her in the cause she has most at heartthe succor of her family there are many ways besides her wages in which she would infallibly be assisted by marianne so that the probability would be that she could send her little salary almost untouched to those for whose support she was toilingall this on her part  but added my wife on the other hand she would be obliged to associate and be ranked with common irish servants  well i answered is there any occupation by which any of us gain our living which has not its disagreeable side does not the lawyer spend all his days either in a dusty office or in the foul air of a courtroom is he not brought into much disagreeable contact with the lowest class of society are not his labors dry and hard and exhausting does not the blacksmith spend half his life in soot and grime that he may gain a competence for the other half if this woman were to work in a factory would she not often be brought into associations distasteful to her might it not be the same in any of the arts and trades in which a living is to be got there must be unpleasant circumstances about earning a living in any way only i maintain that those which a woman would be likely to meet with as a servant in a refined wellbred christian family would be less than in almost any other calling are there no trials to a woman i beg to know in teaching a district school where all the boys big and little of a neighborhood congregate for my part were it my daughter or sister who was in necessitous circumstances i would choose for her a position such as i name in a kind intelligent christian family before many of those to which women do devote themselves  well said bob all this has a good sound enough but its quite impossible its true i verily believe that such a kind of servant in our family would really prolong mariannes life yearsthat it would improve her health and be an unspeakable blessing to her to me and the childrenand i would almost go down on my knees to a really welleducated good american woman who would come into our family and take that place but i know its perfectly vain and useless to expect it you know we have tried the experiment two or three times of having a person in our family who should be on the footing of a friend yet do the duties of a servant and that we never could make it work well these halfandhalf people are so sensitive so exacting in their demands so hard to please that we have come to the firm determination that we will have no slidingscale in our family and that whoever we are to depend on must come with bona fide willingness to take the position of a servant such as that position is in our house and that i suppose your prot√©g√©e would never do even if she could thereby live easier have less hard work better health and quite as much money as she could earn in any other way  she would consider it a personal degradation i suppose said my wife  and yet if she only knew it said bob i should respect her far more profoundly for her willingness to take that position when adverse fortune has shut other doors  well now said i this woman is as i understand the daughter of a respectable stonemason and the domestic habits of her early life have probably been economical and simple like most of our mechanics daughters she has received in one of our high schools an education which has cultivated and developed her mind far beyond those of her parents and the associates of her childhood this is a common fact in our american life by our high schools the daughters of plain workingmen are raised to a state of intellectual culture which seems to make the disposition of them in any kind of industrial calling a difficult one they all want to teach schooland schoolteaching consequently is an overcrowded professionand failing that there is only millinery and dressmaking of late it is true efforts have been made in various directions to widen their sphere typesetting and bookkeeping are in some instances beginning to be open to them  all this time there is lying neglected and despised a calling to which womanly talents and instincts are peculiarly fitteda calling full of opportunities of the most lasting usefulness a calling which insures a settled home respectable protection healthful exercise good air good food and good wages a calling in which a woman may make real friends and secure to herself warm affection and yet this calling is the one always refused shunned contemned left to the alien and the stranger and that simply and solely because it bears the name of servant a christian woman who holds the name of christ in her heart in true devotion would think it the greatest possible misfortune and degradation to become like him in taking upon her the form of a servant the founder of christianity says whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth but i am among you as he that serveth but notwithstanding these so plain declarations of jesus we find that scarce any one in a christian land will accept real advantages of position and employment that come with that name and condition  i suppose said my wife i could prevail upon this woman to do all the duties of the situation if she could be as they phrase it treated as one of the family  that is to say said bob if she could sit with us at the same table be introduced to our friends and be in all respects as one of us now as to this i am free to say that i have no false aristocratic scruples i consider every welleducated woman as fully my equal not to say my superior but it does not follow from this that she would be one whom i should wish to make a third party with me and my wife at mealtimes our meals are often our seasons of privacythe times when we wish in perfect unreserve to speak of matters that concern ourselves and our family alone even invited guests and family friends would not be always welcome however agreeable at times now a woman may be perfectly worthy of respect and we may be perfectly respectful to her whom nevertheless we do not wish to take into the circle of intimate friendship i regard the position of a woman who comes to perform domestic service as i do any other business relation we have a very respectable young lady in our employ who does legal copying for us and all is perfectly pleasant and agreeable in our mutual relations but the case would be far otherwise were she to take it into her head that we treated her with contempt because my wife did not call on her and because she was not occasionally invited to tea besides i apprehend that a woman of quick sensibilities employed in domestic service and who was so far treated as a member of the family as to share our table would find her position even more painful and embarrassing than if she took once for all the position of a servant we could not control the feelings of our friends we could not always insure that they would be free from aristocratic prejudice even were we so ourselves we could not force her upon their acquaintance and she might feel far more slighted than she would in a position where no attentions of any kind were to be expected besides which i have always noticed that persons standing in this uncertain position are objects of peculiar antipathy to the servants in full that they are the cause of constant and secret cabals and discontents and that a family where the two orders exist has always raked up in it the smouldering embers of a quarrel ready at any time to burst out into open feud  well said i here lies the problem of american life half our women like marianne are being faded and made old before their time by exhausting endeavors to lead a life of high civilization and refinement with only such untrained help as is washed up on our shores by the tide of emigration our houses are built upon a plan that precludes the necessity of much hard labor but requires rather careful and nice handling a welltrained intelligent woman who had vitalized her fingerends by means of a welldeveloped brain could do all the work of such a house with comparatively little physical fatigue so stands the case as regards our houses now over against the women that are perishing in them from too much care there is another class of american women that are wandering up and down perishing for lack of some remunerating employment that class of women whose developed brains and less developed muscles mark them as peculiarly fitted for the performance of the labors of a high civilization stand utterly aloof from paid domestic service sooner beg sooner starve sooner marry for money sooner hang on as dependents in families where they know they are not wanted than accept of a quiet home easy healthful work and certain wages in these refined and pleasant modern dwellings of ours  what is the reason of this said bob  the reason is that we have not yet come to the full development of christian democracy the taint of old aristocracies is yet pervading all parts of our society we have not yet realized fully the true dignity of labor and the surpassing dignity of domestic labor and i must say that the valuable and courageous women who have agitated the doctrines of womans rights among us have not in all things seen their way clear in this matter  dont talk to me of those creatures said bob those menwomen those anomalies neither flesh nor fish with their conventions and their cracked womanvoices strained in what they call public speaking but which i call public squeaking no man reverences true women more than i do i hold a real true thoroughly good woman whether in my parlor or my kitchen as my superior she can always teach me something that i need to know she has always in her somewhat of the divine gift of prophecy but in order to keep it she must remain a woman when she crops her hair puts on pantaloons and strides about in conventions she is an abortion and not a woman  come come said i after all speak with deference we that choose to wear soft clothing and dwell in kings houses must respect the baptists who wear leathern girdles and eat locusts and wild honey they are the voices crying in the wilderness preparing the way for a coming good they go down on their knees in the mire of life to lift up and brighten and restore a neglected truth and we that have not the energy to share their struggle should at least refrain from criticising their soiled garments and ungraceful action there have been excrescences eccentricities peculiarities about the camp of these reformers but the body of them have been true and noble women and worthy of all the reverence due to such they have already in many of our states reformed the laws relating to womans position and placed her on a more just and christian basis it is through their movements that in many of our states a woman can hold the fruits of her own earnings if it be her ill luck to have a worthless drunken spendthrift for a husband it is owing to their exertions that new trades and professions are opening to woman and all that i have to say to them is that in the suddenness of their zeal for opening new paths for her feet they have not sufficiently considered the propriety of straightening widening and mending the one broad good old path of domestic labor established by god himself it does appear to me that if at least a portion of their zeal could be spent in removing the stones out of this highway of domestic life and making it pleasant and honorable they would effect even more i would not have them leave undone what they are doing but i would were i worthy to be considered humbly suggest to their prophetic wisdom and enthusiasm whether in this new future of women which they wish to introduce womens natural godgiven employment of domestic service is not to receive a new character and rise in a new form  to love and serve is a motto worn with pride on some aristocratic family shields in england it ought to be graven on the christian shield servant is the name which christ gives to the christian and in speaking of his kingdom as distinguished from earthly kingdoms he distinctly said that rank there should be conditioned not upon desire to command but on willingness to serve  ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant  why is it that this name of servant which christ says is the highest in the kingdom of heaven is so dishonored among us professing christians that good women will beg or starve will suffer almost any extreme of poverty and privation rather than accept home competence security with this honored name  the fault with many of our friends of the womans rights order said my wife is the depreciatory tone in which they have spoken of the domestic labors of a family as being altogether below the scope of the faculties of woman domestic drudgery they call itan expression that has done more harm than any two words that ever were put together  think of a womans calling clearstarching and ironing domestic drudgery and to better the matter turning to typesetting in a grimy printing office call the care of china and silver the sweeping of carpets the arrangement of parlors and sittingrooms drudgery and go into a factory and spend the day amid the whir and clatter and thunder of machinery inhaling an atmosphere loaded with wool and machine grease and keeping on the feet for twelve hours nearly continuously think of its being called drudgery to take care of a clean light airy nursery to wash and dress and care for two or three children to mend their clothes tell them stories make them playthings take them out walking or driving and rather than this to wear out the whole livelong day extending often deep into the night in endless sewing in a close room of a dressmaking establishment is it any less drudgery to stand all day behind a counter serving customers than to tend a doorbell and wait on a table for my part said my wife i have often thought the matter over and concluded that if i were left in straitened circumstances as many are in a great city i would seek a position as a servant in one of our good families  i envy the family that you even think of in that connection said i i fancy the amazement which would take possession of them as you began to develop among them  i have always held said my wife that family work in many of its branches can be better performed by an educated woman than an uneducated one just as an army where even the bayonets think is superior to one of mere brute force and mechanical training so i have heard it said some of our distinguished modern female reformers show an equal superiority in the domestic sphereand i do not doubt it family work was never meant to be the special province of untaught brains i have sometimes thought i should like to show what i could do as a servant  well said bob to return from all this to the question whats to be done with her are you going to my distressed woman if you are suppose you take your distressed woman along and ask her to try it i can promise her a pleasant house a quiet room by herself healthful and not too hard work a kind friend and some leisure for reading writing or whatever other pursuit of her own she may choose for her recreation we are always quite willing to lend books to any who appreciate them our house is surrounded by pleasant grounds which are open to our servants as to ourselves so let her come and try us i am quite sure that country air quiet security and moderate exercise in a good home will bring up her health and if she is willing to take the one or two disagreeables which may come with all this let her try us  well said i so be it and would that all the women seeking homes and employment could thus fall in with women who have homes and are perishing in them for want of educated helpers  on this question of womans work i have yet more to say but must defer it till another time     ii  womans sphere   what do you think of this womans rights question said bob stephens from some of your remarks i apprehend that you think there is something in it i may be wrong but i must confess that i have looked with disgust on the whole movement no man reverences women as i do but i reverence them as women i reverence them for those very things in which their sex differs from ours but when they come upon our ground and begin to work and fight after our manner and with our weapons i regard them as fearful anomalies neither men nor women these womans rights conventions appear to me to have ventilated crudities absurdities and blasphemies to hear them talk about men one would suppose that the two sexes were naturalborn enemies and wonder whether they ever had fathers and brothers one would think upon their showing that all men were a set of ruffians in league against womenthey seeming at the same time to forget how on their very platforms the most constant and gallant defenders of their rights are men wendell phillips and wentworth higginson have put at the service of the cause masculine training and manly vehemence and complacently accepted the wholesale abuse of their own sex at the hands of their warrior sisters one would think were all they say of female powers true that our joanofarcs ought to have disdained to fight under male captains  i think said my wife that in all this talk about the rights of men and the rights of women and the rights of children the world seems to be forgetting what is quite as important the duties of men and women and children we all hear of our rights till we forget our duties and even theology is beginning to concern itself more with what man has a right to expect of his creator than what the creator has a right to expect of man  you say the truth said i there is danger of just this overaction and yet rights must be discussed because in order to understand the duties we owe to any class we must understand their rights to know our duties to men women and children we must know what the rights of men women and children justly are as to the womans rights movement it is not peculiar to america it is part of a great wave in the incoming tide of modern civilization the swell is felt no less in europe but it combs over and breaks on our american shore because our great wide beach affords the best play for its waters and as the ocean waves bring with them kelp seaweed mud sand gravel and even putrefying d√©bris which lie unsightly on the shore and yet on the whole are healthful and refreshingso the womans rights movement with its conventions its speechmakings its crudities and eccentricities is nevertheless a part of a healthful and necessary movement of the human race towards progress this question of woman and her sphere is now perhaps the greatest of the age we have put slavery under foot and with the downfall of slavery the only obstacle to the success of our great democratic experiment is overthrown and there seems no limit to the splendid possibilities which it may open before the human race  in the reconstruction that is now coming there lies more than the reconstruction of states and the arrangement of the machinery of government we need to know and feel all of us that from the moment of the death of slavery we parted finally from the r√©gime and control of all the old ideas formed under old oppressive systems of society and came upon a new plane of life  in this new life we must never forget that we are a peculiar people that we have to walk in paths unknown to the old worldpaths where its wisdom cannot guide us where its precedents can be of little use to us and its criticisms in most cases must be wholly irrelevant the history of our war has shown us of how little service to us in any important crisis the opinions and advice of the old world can be we have been hurt at what seemed to us the want of sympathy the direct antagonism of england we might have been less hurt if we had properly understood that providence had placed us in a position so far ahead of her ideas or power of comprehension that just judgment or sympathy was not to be expected from her  as we went through our great war with no help but that of god obliged to disregard the misconceptions and impertinences which the foreign press rained down upon us so if we are wise we shall continue to do our object must now be to make the principles on which our government is founded permeate consistently the mass of society and to purge out the leaven of aristocratic and old world ideas so long as there is an illogical working in our actual life so long as there is any class denied equal rights with other classes so long will there be agitation and trouble  then said my wife you believe that women ought to vote  if the principle on which we founded our government is true that taxation must not exist without representation and if women hold property and are taxed it follows that women should be represented in the state by their votes or there is an illogical working of our government  but my dear dont you think that this will have a bad effect on the female character  yes said bob it will make women caucus holders political candidates  it may make this of some women just as of some men said i but all men do not take any great interest in politics it is very difficult to get some of the best of them to do their duty in voting and the same will be found true among women  but after all said bob what do you gain what will a womans vote be but a duplicate of that of her husband or father or whatever man happens to be her adviser  that may be true on a variety of questions but there are subjects on which the vote of women would i think be essentially different from that of men on the subjects of temperance public morals and education i have no doubt that the introduction of the female vote into legislation in states counties and cities would produce results very different from that of men alone there are thousands of women who would close grogshops and stop the traffic in spirits if they had the legislative power and it would be well for society if they had in fact i think that a state can no more afford to dispense with the vote of women in its affairs than a family imagine a family where the female has no voice in the housekeeping a state is but a larger family and there are many of its concerns which equally with those of a private household would be bettered by female supervision  but fancy women going to those horrible votingplaces it is more than i can do myself said bob  but you forget said i that they are horrible and disgusting principally because women never go to them all places where women are excluded tend downward to barbarism but the moment she is introduced there come in with her courtesy cleanliness sobriety and order when a man can walk up to the ballotbox with his wife or his sister on his arm votingplaces will be far more agreeable than now and the polls will not be such beargardens that refined men will be constantly tempted to omit their political duties there  if for nothing else i would have women vote that the business of voting may not be so disagreeable and intolerable to men of refinement as it now is and i sincerely believe that the cause of good morals good order cleanliness and public health would be a gainer not merely by the added feminine vote but by the added vote of a great many excellent but too fastidious men who are now kept from the polls by the disagreeables they meet there  do you suppose that if women had equal representation with men in the municipal laws of new york its reputation for filth during the last year would have gone so far beyond that of cologne or any other city renowned for bad smells i trow not i believe a lady mayoress would have brought in a dispensation of brooms and whitewash and made a terrible searching into dark holes and vile corners before now female new york i have faith to believe has yet left in her enough of the primary instincts of womanhood to give us a clean healthy city if female votes had any power to do it  but said bob you forget that voting would bring together all the women of the lower classes  yes but thanks to the instincts of their sex they would come in their sunday clothes for where is the woman that hasnt her finery and will not embrace every chance to show it biddys parasol and hat with pink ribbons would necessitate a clean shirt in pat as much as on sunday voting would become a f√™te and we should have a population at the polls as welldressed as at church such is my belief  i do not see said bob but you go to the full extent with our modern female reformers  there are certain neglected truths which have been held up by these reformers that are gradually being accepted and infused into the life of modern society and their recognition will help to solidify and purify democratic institutions they are  1 the right of every woman to hold independent property  2 the right of every woman to receive equal pay with man for work which she does equally well  3 the right of any woman to do any work for which by her natural organization and talent she is peculiarly adapted  under the first head our energetic sisters have already by the help of their gallant male adjutants reformed the laws of several of our states so that a married woman is no longer left the unprotected legal slave of any unprincipled drunken spendthrift who may be her husbandbut in case of the imbecility or improvidence of the natural head of the family the wife if she have the ability can conduct business make contracts earn and retain money for the good of the household and i am sure no one can say that immense injustice and cruelty are not thereby prevented  it is quite easy for women who have the good fortune to have just and magnanimous husbands to say that they feel no interest in such reforms and that they would willingly trust their property to the man to whom they give themselves but they should remember that laws are not made for the restraint of the generous and just but of the dishonest and base the law which enables a married woman to hold her own property does not forbid her to give it to the man of her heart if she so pleases and it does protect many women who otherwise would be reduced to the extremest misery i once knew an energetic milliner who had her shop attached four times and a flourishing business broken up in four different cities because she was tracked from city to city by a worthless spendthrift who only waited till she had amassed a little property in a new place to swoop down upon and carry it off it is to be hoped that the time is not distant when every state will give to woman a fair chance to the ownership and use of her own earnings and her own property  under the head of the right of every woman to do any work for which by natural organization and talent she is especially adapted there is a word or two to be said  the talents and tastes of the majority of women are naturally domestic the family is evidently their sphere because in all ways their organization fits them for that more than for anything else  but there are occasionally women who are exceptions to the common law gifted with peculiar genius and adaptations with regard to such women there has never seemed to be any doubt in the verdict of mankind that they ought to follow their nature and that their particular sphere was the one to which they are called did anybody ever think that mrs siddons and mrs kemble and ristori had better have applied themselves sedulously to keeping house because they were women and womans noblest station is retreat  the world has always shown a fair average of good sense in this matter from the days of the fair hypatia in alexandria who we are told gave lectures on philosophy behind a curtain lest her charms should distract the attention of too impressible young men down to those of anna dickinson mankind are not after all quite fools and seem in these cases to have a reasonable idea that exceptional talents have exceptional laws and make their own code of proprieties  now there is no doubt that miss dickinson though as relating to her femininity she is quite as pretty and modest a young woman as any to be found in the most sheltered circle has yet a most exceptional talent for public speaking which draws crowds to hear her and makes lecturing for her a lucrative profession as well as a means of advocating just and generous sentiments and of stimulating her own sex to nobler purposes and the same law which relates to siddons and kemble and ristori relates also to her  the doctrine of vocations is a good one and a safe one if a woman mistakes her vocation so much the worse for her the world does not suffer but she does and the suffering speedily puts her where she belongs there is not near so much danger from attempts to imitate anna dickinson as there is from the more common feminine attempts to rival the demimonde of paris in fantastic extravagance and luxury  as to how a woman may determine whether she has any such vocation there is a story quite in point a good methodist elder was listening to an ardent young mechanic who thought he had a call to throw up his shop and go to preaching  i feel said the young ardent that i have a call to preach  hast thou noticed whether people seem to have a call to hear thee said the shrewd old man i have always noticed that a true call of the lord may be known by this that people have a call to hear  well said bob the most interesting question still remains what are to be the employments of woman what ways are there for her to use her talents to earn her livelihood and support those who are dear to her when providence throws that necessity upon her this is becoming more than ever one of the pressing questions of our age the war has deprived so many thousands of women of their natural protectors that everything must be thought of that may possibly open a way for their selfsupport  well let us look over the field said my wife what is there for woman  in the first place said i come the professions requiring natural geniusauthorship painting sculpture with the subordinate arts of photographing coloring and finishing but when all is told these furnish employment to a very limited numberalmost as nothing to the whole then there is teaching which is profitable in its higher branches and perhaps the very pleasantest of all the callings open to woman but teaching is at present an overcrowded profession the applicants everywhere outnumbering the places architecture and landscape gardening are arts every way suited to the genius of woman and there are enough who have the requisite mechanical skill and mathematical education and though never yet thought of for the sex that i know of i do not despair of seeing those who shall find in this field a profession at once useful and elegant when women plan dwellinghouses the vast body of tenements to be let in our cities will wear a more domestic and comfortable air and will be built more with reference to the real wants of their inmates  i have thought said bob that agencies of various sorts as canvassing the country for the sale of books maps and engravings might properly employ a great many women there is a large class whose health suffers from confinement and sedentary occupations who might i think be both usefully and agreeably employed in business of this sort and be recruiting their health at the same time  then said my wife there is the medical profession  yes said i the world is greatly obliged to miss blackwell and other noble pioneers who faced and overcame the obstacles to the attainment of a thorough medical education by females thanks to them a new and lucrative profession is now open to educated women in relieving the distresses of their own sex and we may hope that in time through their intervention the care of the sick may also become the vocation of cultivated refined intelligent women instead of being left as heretofore to the ignorant and vulgar the experience of our late war has shown us what women of a high class morally and intellectually can do in this capacity why should not this experience inaugurate a new and sacred calling for refined and educated women why should not nursing become a vocation equal in dignity and in general esteem to the medical profession of which it is the right hand why should our dearest hopes in the hour of their greatest peril be committed into the hands of sairey gamps when the world has seen florence nightingales  yes indeed said my wife i can testify from my own experience that the sufferings and dangers of the sickbed for the want of intelligent educated nursing have been dreadful a prejudiced pigheaded snufftaking old woman narrowminded and vulgar and more confident in her own way than seven men that can render a reason enters your house at just the hour and moment when all your dearest earthly hopes are brought to a crisis she becomes absolute dictator over your delicate helpless wife and your frail babethe absolute dictator of all in the house if it be her sovereign will and pleasure to enact all sorts of physiological absurdities in the premises who shall say her nay she knows her business she hopes and if it be her edict as it was of one of her class whom i knew that each of her babies shall eat four baked beans the day it is four days old eat them it must and if the baby die in convulsions four days after it is set down as the mysterious will of an overruling providence  i know and have seen women lying upon laced pillows under silken curtains who have been bullied and dominated over in the hour of their greatest helplessness by ignorant and vulgar tyrants in a way that would scarce be thought possible in civilized society and children that have been injured or done to death by the same means a celebrated physician told me of a babe whose eyesight was nearly ruined by its nurse taking a fancy to wash its eyes with camphorto keep it from catching cold she said i knew another infant that was poisoned by the nurse giving it laudanum in some of those patent nostrums which these ignorant creatures carry secretly in their pockets to secure quiet in their little charges i knew one delicate woman who never recovered from the effects of being left at her first confinement in the hands of an illtempered drinking nurse and whose feeble infant was neglected and abused by this woman in a way to cause lasting injury in the first four weeks of infancy the constitution is peculiarly impressible and infants of a delicate organization may if frightened and illtreated be the subjects of just such a shock to the nervous system as in mature age comes from the sudden stroke of a great affliction or terror a bad nurse may affect nerves predisposed to weakness in a manner they never will recover from i solemnly believe that the constitutions of more women are broken up by bad nursing in their first confinement than by any other cause whatever and yet there are at the same time hundreds and thousands of women wanting the means of support whose presence in a sickroom would be a benediction i do trust that miss blackwells band of educated nurses will not be long in coming and that the number of such may increase till they effect a complete revolution in this vocation a class of cultivated welltrained intelligent nurses would soon elevate the employment of attending on the sick into the noble calling it ought to be and secure for it its appropriate rewards  there is another opening for woman said iin the world of business the system of commercial colleges now spreading over our land is a new and most important development of our times there that large class of young men who have either no time or no inclination for an extended classical education can learn what will fit them for that active material life which in our broad country needs so many workers but the most pleasing feature of these institutions is that the complete course is open to women no less than to men and women there may acquire that knowledge of bookkeeping and accounts and of the forms and principles of business transactions which will qualify them for some of the lucrative situations hitherto monopolized by the other sex and the expenses of the course of instruction are so arranged as to come within the scope of very moderate means a fee of fifty dollars entitles a woman to the benefit of the whole course and she has the privilege of attending at any hours that may suit her own engagements and convenience  then again said my wife there are the departments of millinery and dressmaking and the various branches of needlework which afford employment to thousands of women there is typesetting by which many are beginning to get a living there are the manufactures of cotton woolen silk and the numberless useful articles which employ female hands in their fabricationall of them opening avenues by which with more or less success a subsistence can be gained  well really said bob it would appear after all that there are abundance of openings for women what is the cause of the outcry and distress how is it that we hear of women starving driven to vice and crime by want when so many doors of useful and profitable employment stand open to them  the question would easily be solved said my wife if you could once see the kind and class of women who thus suffer and starve there may be exceptions but too large a portion of them are girls and women who can or will do no earthly thing welland what is worse are not willing to take the pains to be taught to do anything well i will describe to you one girl and you will find in every intelligenceoffice a hundred of her kind to five thoroughly trained ones  imprimis she is rather delicate and genteellooking and you may know from the arrangement of her hair just what the last mode is of disposing of rats or waterfalls she has a lace bonnet with roses a silk mantilla a silk dress trimmed with velvet a white skirt with sixteen tucks and an embroidered edge a pair of cloth gaiters underneath which are a pair of stockings without feet the only pair in her possession she has no underlinen and sleeps at night in the workingclothes she wears in the day she never seems to have in her outfit either comb brush or toothbrush of her ownneither needles thread scissors nor pins her money when she has any being spent on more important articles such as the lace bonnet or silk mantilla or the rats and waterfalls that glorify her head when she wishes to sew she borrows what is needful of a convenient next neighbor and if she gets a place in a family as second girl she expects to subsist in these respects by borrowing of the betterappointed servants or helping herself from the family stores  she expects of course the very highest wages if she condescends to live out and by help of a trim outside appearance and the many vacancies that are continually occurring in households she gets places where her object is to do just as little of any duty assigned to her as possible to hurry through her performances put on her fine clothes and go agadding she is on freeandeasy terms with all the men she meets and ready at jests and repartee sometimes far from seemly her time of service in any one place lasts indifferently from a fortnight to two or three months when she takes her wages buys her a new parasol in the latest style and goes back to the intelligenceoffice in the different families where she has lived she has been told a hundred times the proprieties of household life how to make beds arrange rooms wash china glass and silver and set tables but her habitual rule is to try in each place how small and how poor services will be accepted when she finds less will not do she gives more when the mistress follows her constantly and shows an energetic determination to be well served she shows that she can serve well but the moment such attention relaxes she slides back again she is as destructive to a house as a fire the very spirit of wastefulness is in her she cracks the china dents the silver stops the waterpipes with rubbish and after she is gone there is generally a sum equal to half her wages to be expended in repairing the effects of her carelessness and yet there is one thing to be said for her she is quite as careful of her employers things as of her own the full amount of her mischiefs often does not appear at once as she is glib of tongue adroit in apologies and lies with as much alertness and as little thought of conscience as a blackbird chatters it is difficult for people who have been trained from childhood in the school of veritieswho have been lectured for even the shadow of a prevarication and shut up in disgrace for a lie till truth becomes a habit of their soulsit is very difficult for people so educated to understand how to get on with those who never speak the truth except by mere accident who assert any and every thing that comes into their heads with all the assurance and all the energy of perfect verity  what becomes of this girl she finds means by begging borrowing living out to keep herself extremely trim and airy for a certain length of time till the rats and waterfalls the lace hat and parasol and the glib tongue have done their work in making a fool of some honest young mechanic who earns three dollars a day she marries him with no higher object than to have somebody to earn money for her to spend and what comes of such marriages  that is one ending of her career the other is on the street in haunts of vice in prison in drunkenness and death  whence come these girls they are as numerous as yellow butterflies in autumn they flutter up to cities from the country they grow up from mothers who ran the same sort of career before them and the reason why in the end they fall out of all reputable employment and starve on poor wages is that they become physically mentally and morally incapable of rendering any service which society will think worth paying for  i remember said i that the head of the most celebrated dressmaking establishment in new york in reply to the appeals of the needlewomen of the city for sympathy and wages came out with published statements to this effect that the difficulty lay not in unwillingness of employers to pay what work was worth but in finding any work worth paying for that she had many applicants but among them few who could be of real use to her that she in common with everybody in this country who has any kind of serious responsibilities to carry was continually embarrassed for want of skilled workpeople who could take and go on with the labor of her various departments without her constant supervision that out of a hundred girls there would not be more than five to whom she could give a dress to be made and dismiss it from her mind as something certain to be properly done  let people individually look around their own little sphere and ask themselves if they know any woman really excelling in any valuable calling or accomplishment who is suffering for want of work all of us know seamstresses dressmakers nurses and laundresses who have made themselves such a reputation and are so beset and overcrowded with work that the whole neighborhood is constantly on its knees to them with uplifted hands the fine seamstress who can cut and make trousseaus and layettes in elegant perfection is always engaged six months in advance the pet dressmaker of a neighborhood must be engaged in may for september and in september for may a laundress who sends your clothes home in nice order always has all the work that she can do good work in any department is the rarest possible thing in our american life and it is a fact that the great majority of workers both in the family and out do only tolerably wellnot so badly that it actually cannot be borne yet not so well as to be a source of real thorough satisfaction the exceptional worker in every neighborhood who does things really well can always set her own price and is always having more offering than she can possibly do  the trouble then in finding employment for women lies deeper than the purses or consciences of the employers it lies in the want of education in women the want of education i saymeaning by education that which fits a woman for practical and profitable employment in life and not mere commonschool learning  yes said my wife for it is a fact that the most troublesome and helpless persons to provide for are often those who have a good medium education but no feminine habits no industry no practical calculation no muscular strength and no knowledge of any one of womans peculiar duties in the earlier days of new england women as a class had far fewer opportunities for acquiring learning yet were far better educated physically and morally than now the high school did not exist at the common school they learned reading writing and arithmetic and practiced spelling while at home they did the work of the household they were cheerful bright and active ever on the alert able to do anything from the harnessing and driving of a horse to the finest embroidery the daughters of new england in those days looked the world in the face without a fear they shunned no labor they were afraid of none and they could always find their way to a living  but although less instructed in school learning said i they showed no deficiency in intellectual acumen i see no such women nowadays as some i remember of that olden timewomen whose strong minds and everactive industry carried on reading and study side by side with household toils  i remember a young lady friend of mine attending a celebrated boardingschool boarded in the family of a woman who had never been to school longer than was necessary to learn to read and write yet who was a perfect cyclopedia of general information the young scholar used to take her chemistry and natural philosophy into the kitchen where her friend was busy with her household work and read her lessons to her that she might have the benefit of her explanations and so while the good lady scoured her andirons or kneaded her bread she lectured to her prot√©g√©e on mysteries of science far beyond the limits of the textbook many of the graduates of our modern high schools would find it hard to shine in conversation on the subjects they had studied in the searching presence of some of these vigorous matrons of the olden time whose only school had been the leisure hours gained by energy and method from their family cares  and in those days said my wife there lived in our families a class of american domestics women of good sense and good powers of reflection who applied this sense and power of reflection to household matters in the early part of my married life i myself had american help and they were not only excellent servants but trusty and invaluable friends but now all this class of applicants for domestic service have disappeared i scarce know why or how all i know is there is no more a betsey or a lois such as used to take domestic cares off my shoulders so completely  good heavens where are they cried bob where do they hide i would search through the world after such a prodigy  the fact is said i there has been a slow and gradual reaction against household labor in america mothers began to feel that it was a sort of curse to be spared if possible to their daughters women began to feel that they were fortunate in proportion as they were able to be entirely clear of family responsibilities then irish labor began to come in simultaneously with a great advance in female education  for a long while nothing was talked of written of thought of in teachers meetings conventions and assemblies but the neglected state of female education and the whole circle of the arts and sciences was suddenly introduced into our freeschool system from which needlework as gradually and quietly was suffered to drop out the girl who attended the primary and high school had so much study imposed on her that she had no time for sewing or housework and the delighted mother was only too happy to darn her stockings and do the housework alone that her daughter might rise to a higher plane than she herself had attained to the daughter thus educated had on coming to womanhood no solidity of muscle no manual dexterity no practice or experience in domestic life and if she were to seek a livelihood there remained only teaching or some feminine trade or the factory  these factories said my wife have been the ruin of hundreds and hundreds of our once healthy farmers daughters and others from the country they go there young and unprotected they live there in great boardinghouses and associate with a promiscuous crowd without even such restraints of maternal supervision as they would have in great boardingschools their bodies are enfeebled by labor often necessarily carried on in a foul and heated atmosphere and at the hours when off duty they are exposed to all the dangers of unwatched intimacy with the other sex  moreover the factory girl learns and practices but one thingsome one mechanical movement which gives no scope for invention ingenuity or any other of the powers called into play by domestic labor so that she is in reality unfitted in every way for family duties  many times it has been my lot to try in my family service girls who have left factories and i have found them wholly useless for any of the things which a woman ought to be good for they knew nothing of a house or what ought to be done in it they had imbibed a thorough contempt of household labor and looked upon it but as a dernier ressort and it was only the very lightest of its tasks that they could even begin to think of i remember i tried to persuade one of these girls the pretty daughter of a fisherman to take some lessons in washing and ironing she was at that time engaged to be married to a young mechanic who earned something like two or three dollars a day  my child said i you will need to understand all kinds of housework if you are going to be married  she tossed her little head  indeed she wasnt going to trouble herself about that  but who will get up your husbands shirts  oh he must put them out im not going to be married to make a slave of myself  another young factory girl who came for table and parlor work was so full of airs and fine notions that it seemed as difficult to treat with her as with a princess she could not sweep because it blistered her hands which in fact were long and delicate she could not think of putting them into hot dishwater and for that reason preferred washing the dishes in cold water she required a full hour in the morning to make her toilet she was laced so tightly that she could not stoop without vertigo and her hoops were of dimensions which seemed to render it impossible for her to wait upon table she was quite exhausted with the effort of ironing the tablenapkins and chambertowels yet she could not think of living out under two dollars a week  both these girls had had a good freeschool education and could read any amount of novels write a tolerable letter but had not learned anything with sufficient accuracy to fit them for teachers they were pretty and their destiny was to marry and lie a deadweight on the hands of some honest man and to increase in their children the number of incapables  well said bob what would you have what is to be done  in the first place said i i would have it felt by those who are seeking to elevate woman that the work is to be done not so much by creating for her new spheres of action as by elevating her conceptions of that domestic vocation to which god and nature have assigned her it is all very well to open to her avenues of profit and advancement in the great outer world but after all to make and keep a home is and ever must be a womans first glory her highest aim no work of art can compare with a perfect home the training and guiding of a family must be recognized as the highest work a woman can perform and female education ought to be conducted with special reference to this  men are trained to be lawyers to be physicians to be mechanics by long and selfdenying study and practice a man cannot even make shoes merely by going to the high school and learning reading writing and mathematics he cannot be a bookkeeper or a printer simply from general education  now women have a sphere and profession of their owna profession for which they are fitted by physical organization by their own instincts and to which they are directed by the pointing and manifest finger of godand that sphere is family life duties to the state and to public life they may have but the public duties of women must bear to their family ones the same relation that the family duties of men bear to their public ones the defect in the late efforts to push on female education is that it has been for her merely general and that it has left out and excluded all that is professional and she undertakes the essential duties of womanhood when they do devolve on her without any adequate preparation  but is it possible for a girl to learn at school the things which fit for her family life said bob  why not i replied once it was thought impossible in school to teach girls geometry or algebra or the higher mathematics it was thought impossible to put them through collegiate courses but it has been done and we see it women study treatises on political economy in schools and why should not the study of domestic economy form a part of every school course a young girl will stand up at the blackboard and draw and explain the compound blowpipe and describe all the processes of making oxygen and hydrogen why should she not draw and explain a refrigerator as well as an airpump both are to be explained on philosophical principles when a schoolgirl in her chemistry studies the reciprocal action of acids and alkalies what is there to hinder the teaching her its application to the various processes of cooking where acids and alkalies are employed why should she not be led to see how effervescence and fermentation can be made to perform their office in the preparation of light and digestible bread why should she not be taught the chemical substances by which food is often adulterated and the test by which such adulterations are detected why should she not understand the processes of confectionery and know how to guard against the deleterious or poisonous elements that are introduced into childrens sugarplums and candies why when she learns the doctrine of mordants the substances by which different colors are set should she not learn it with some practical view to future life so that she may know how to set the color of a fading calico or restore the color of a spotted one why in short when a girl has labored through a profound chemical work and listened to courses of chemical lectures should she come to domestic life which presents a constant series of chemical experiments and changes and go blindly along as without chart or compass unable to tell what will take out a stain or what will brighten a metal what are common poisons and what their antidotes and not knowing enough of the laws of caloric to understand how to warm a house or of the laws of atmosphere to know how to ventilate one why should the preparation of food that subtile art on which life health cheerfulness good temper and good looks so largely depend forever be left in the hands of the illiterate and vulgar  a benevolent gentleman has lately left a large fortune for the founding of a university for women and the object is stated to be to give to women who have already acquired a general education the means of acquiring a professional one to fit themselves for some employment by which they may gain a livelihood  in this institution the women are to be instructed in bookkeeping stenography telegraphing photographing drawing modeling and various other arts but so far as i remember there is no proposal to teach domestic economy as at least one of womans professions  why should there not be a professor of domestic economy in every large female school why should not this professor give lectures first on house planning and building illustrated by appropriate apparatus why should not the pupils have presented to their inspection models of houses planned with reference to economy to ease of domestic service to warmth to ventilation and to architectural appearance why should not the professor go on to lecture further on housefixtures with models of the best mangles washingmachines clotheswringers ranges furnaces and cookingstoves together with drawings and apparatus illustrative of domestic hydraulics showing the best contrivances for bathingrooms and the obvious principles of plumbing so that the pupils may have some idea how to work the machinery of a convenient house when they have it and to have such conveniences introduced when wanting if it is thought worth while to provide at great expense apparatus for teaching the revolutions of saturns moons and the precession of the equinoxes why should there not be some also to teach what it may greatly concern a womans earthly happiness to know  why should not the professor lecture on home chemistry devoting his first lecture to breadmaking and why might not a batch of bread be made and baked and exhibited to the class together with specimens of morbid anatomy in the bread linethe sour cotton bread of the baker the rough bigholed bread the heavy fossil bread the bitter bread of too much yeastand the causes of their defects pointed out and so with regard to the various articles of foodwhy might not chemical lectures be given on all of them one after another in short it would be easy to trace out a course of lectures on common things to occupy a whole year and for which the pupils whenever they come to have homes of their own will thank the lecturer to the last day of their life  then there is no impossibility in teaching needlework the cutting and fitting of dresses in female schools the thing is done very perfectly in english schools for the working classes a girl trained at one of these schools came into a family i once knew she brought with her a sewingbook in which the process of making various articles was exhibited in miniature the several parts of a shirt were first shown each perfectly made and fastened to a leaf of the book by itself and then the successive steps of uniting the parts till finally appeared a miniature model of the whole the sewing was done with red thread so that every stitch might show and any imperfections be at once remedied the same process was pursued with regard to other garments and a good general idea of cutting and fitting them was thus given to an entire class of girls  in the same manner the care and nursing of young children and the tending of the sick might be made the subject of lectures every woman ought to have some general principles to guide her with regard to what is to be done in case of the various accidents that may befall either children or grown people and of their lesser illnesses and ought to know how to prepare comforts and nourishment for the sick hawthornes satirical remarks upon the contrast between the elegant zenobias conversation and the smoky porridge she made for him when he was an invalid might apply to the volunteer cookery of many charming women  i think said bob that your professor of domestic economy would find enough to occupy his pupils  in fact said i were domestic economy properly honored and properly taught in the manner described it would open a sphere of employment to so many women in the home life that we should not be obliged to send our women out to california or the pacific to put an end to an anxious and aimless life  when domestic work is sufficiently honored to be taught as an art and science in our boardingschools and highschools then possibly it may acquire also dignity in the eyes of our working classes and young girls who have to earn their own living may no longer feel degraded in engaging in domestic service the place of a domestic in a family may become as respectable in their eyes as a place in a factory in a printingoffice in a dressmaking or millinery establishment or behind the counter of a shop  in america there is no class which will confess itself the lower class and a thing recommended solely for the benefit of any such class finds no one to receive it  if the intelligent and cultivated look down on household work with disdain if they consider it as degrading a thing to be shunned by every possible devicethey may depend upon it that the influence of such contempt of womans noble duties will flow downward producing a like contempt in every class in life  our sovereign princesses learn the doctrine of equality very quickly and are not going to sacrifice themselves to what is not considered de bon ton by the upper classes and the girl with the laced hat and parasol without underclothes who does her best to shirk her duties as housemaid and is looking for marriage as an escape from work is a fair copy of her mistress who married for much the same reason who hates housekeeping and would rather board or do anything else than have the care of a family the one is about as respectable as the other  when housekeeping becomes an enthusiasm and its study and practice a fashion then we shall have in america that class of persons to rely on for help in household labors who are now going to factories to printingoffices to every kind of toil forgetful of the best life and sphere of woman     iii  a family talk on reconstruction   our chimneycorner of which we have spoken somewhat has besides the wonted domestic circle its habitu√©s who have a frequent seat there among these none is more welcome than theophilus thoro  friend theophilus was born on the shady side of nature and endowed by his patron saint with every grace and gift which can make a human creature worthy and available except the gift of seeing the bright side of things his beadroll of christian virtues includes all the graces of the spirit except hope and so if one wants to know exactly the flaw the defect the doubtful side and to take into account all the untoward possibilities of any person place or thing he had best apply to friend theophilus he can tell you just where and how the bestlaid scheme is likely to fail just the screw that will fall loose in the smoothestworking machinery just the flaw in the most perfect character just the defect in the bestwritten book just the variety of thorn that must accompany each particular species of rose  yet theophilus is without guile or malice his want of faith in human nature is not bitter and censorious but melting and pitiful we are all poor trash miserable dogs together he seems to say as he looks out on the world and its ways there is not much to be expected of or for any of us but let us love one another and be patient  accordingly theophilus is one of the most incessant workers for human good and perseveringly busy in every scheme of benevolent enterprise in all which he labors with melancholy steadiness without hope in religion he has the soul of a martyrnothing would suit him better than to be burned alive for his faith but his belief in the success of christianity is about on a par with that of the melancholy disciple of old who when christ would go to jud√¶a could only say let us also go that we may die with him theophilus is always ready to die for the truth and the right for which he never sees anything but defeat and destruction ahead  during the late war theophilus has been a despairing patriot dying daily and giving all up for lost in every reverse from bull run to fredericksburg the surrender of richmond and the capitulation of lee shortened his visage somewhat but the murder of the president soon brought it back to its old length it is true that while lincoln lived he was in a perpetual state of dissent from all his measures he had broken his heart for years over the miseries of the slaves but he shuddered at the emancipation proclamation a whirlwind of anarchy was about to sweep over the country in which the black and the white would dash against each other and be shivered like potters vessels he was in despair at the accession of johnson believing the worst of the unfavorable reports that clouded his reputation nevertheless he was among the first of loyal citizens to rally to the support of the new administration because though he had no hope in that he could see nothing better  you must not infer from all this that friend theophilus is a social wet blanket a goblin shadow at the domestic hearth by no means nature has gifted him with that vein of humor and that impulse to friendly joviality which are frequent developments in sadnatured men and often deceive superficial observers as to their real character he who laughs well and makes you laugh is often called a man of cheerful disposition yet in many cases nothing can be further from it than precisely this kind of person  theophilus frequents our chimneycorner perhaps because mrs crowfield and myself are so to speak children of the light and the day my wife has precisely the opposite talent to that of our friend she can discover the good point the sound spot where others see only defect and corruption i myself am somewhat sanguine and prone rather to expect good than evil and with a vast stock of faith in the excellent things that may turn up in the future the millennium is one of the prime articles of my creed and all the ups and downs of society i regard only as so many jolts on a very rough road that is taking the world on through many upsets and disasters to that final consummation  theophilus holds the same belief theoretically but it is apt to sink so far out of sight in the mire of present disaster as to be of very little comfort to him  yes he said we are going to ruin in my view about as fast as we can go miss jenny i will trouble you for another small lump of sugar in my tea  you have been saying that about our going to ruin every time you have taken tea here for four years past said jenny but i always noticed that your fears never spoiled your relish either for tea or muffins people talk about being on the brink of a volcano and the country going to destruction and all that just as they put pepper on their potatoes it is an agreeable stimulant in conversationthats all  for my part said my wife i can speak in another vein when had we ever in all our history so bright prospects so much to be thankful for slavery is abolished the last stain of disgrace is wiped from our national honor we stand now before the world selfconsistent with our principles we have come out of one of the severest struggles that ever tried a nation purer and stronger in morals and religion as well as more prosperous in material things  my dear madam excuse me said theophilus but i cannot help being reminded of what an english reviewer once saidthat a ladys facts have as much poetry in them as tom moores lyrics of course poetry is always agreeable even though of no statistical value  i see no poetry in my facts said mrs crowfield is not slavery forever abolished by the confession of its best friendseven of those who declare its abolition a misfortune and themselves ruined in consequence  i confess my dear madam that we have succeeded as we human creatures commonly do in supposing that we have destroyed an evil when we have only changed its name we have contrived to withdraw from the slave just that fiction of property relation which made it for the interest of some one to care for him a little however imperfectly and having destroyed that we turn him out defenseless to shift for himself in a community every member of which is embittered against him the whole south resounds with the outcries of slaves suffering the vindictive wrath of former masters laws are being passed hunting them out of this state and out of that the animosity of raceat all times the most bitter and unreasonable of animositiesis being aroused all over the land and the free states take the lead in injustice to them witness a late vote of connecticut on the suffrage question the efforts of government to protect the rights of these poor defenseless creatures are about as energetic as such efforts always have been and always will be while human nature remains what it is for a while the obvious rights of the weaker party will be confessed with some show of consideration in public speeches they will be paraded by philanthropic sentimentalists to give point to their eloquence they will be here and there sustained in governmental measures when there is no strong temptation to the contrary and nothing better to be done but the moment that political combinations begin to be formed all the rights and interests of this helpless people will be bandied about as so many makeweights in the political scale any troublesome lion will have a negro thrown to him to keep him quiet all their hopes will be dashed to the ground by the imperious southern white no longer feeling for them even the interest of a master and regarding them with a mixture of hatred and loathing as the cause of all his reverses then if driven to despair they seek to defend themselves by force they will be crushed by the power of the government and ground to powder as the weak have always been under the heel of the strong  so much for our abolition of slavery as to our material prosperity it consists of an inflated paper currency an immense debt a giddy foolhardy spirit of speculation and stockgambling and a perfect furor of extravagance which is driving everybody to live beyond his means and casting contempt on the republican virtues of simplicity and economy  as to advancement in morals there never was so much intemperance in our people before and the papers are full of accounts of frauds defalcations forgeries robberies assassinations and arsons against this tide of corruption the various organized denominations of religion do nothing effectual they are an army shut up within their own intrenchments holding their own with difficulty and in no situation to turn back the furious assaults of the enemy  in short said jenny according to your showing the whole country is going to destruction now if things really are so bad if you really believe all you have been saying you ought not to be sitting drinking your tea as you are now or to have spent the afternoon playing croquet with us girls you ought to gird yourself with sackcloth and go up and down the land raising the alarm and saying yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown  well said theophilus while a covert smile played about his lips you know the saying let us eat and drink for tomorrow etc things are not yet gone to destruction only goingand why not have a good time on deck before the ship goes to pieces your chimneycorner is a tranquil island in the ocean of trouble and your muffins are absolutely perfect ill take another if youll please to pass them  ive a great mind not to pass them said jenny are you in earnest in what you are saying or are you only saying it for sensation how can people believe such things and be comfortable i could not if i believed all you have been saying i could not sleep nightsi should be perfectly miserable and you cannot really believe all this or you would be  my dear child said mrs crowfield our friends picture is the truth painted with all its shadows and none of its lights all the dangers he speaks of are real and great but he omits the counterbalancing good let me speak now there never has been a time in our history when so many honest and just men held power in our land as nownever a government before in which the public councils recognized with more respect the just and the right there never was an instance of a powerful government showing more tenderness in the protection of a weak and defenseless race than ours has shown in the care of the freedmen hitherto there never was a case in which the people of a country were more willing to give money and time and disinterested labor to raise and educate those who have thus been thrown on their care considering that we have had a great harassing and expensive war on our hands i think the amount done by government and individuals for the freedmen unequaled in the history of nations and i do not know why it should be predicted from this past fact that in the future both government and people are about to throw them to the lions as mr theophilus supposes let us wait at least and see so long as government maintains a freedmens bureau administered by men of such high moral character we must think at all events that there are strong indications in the right direction just think of the immense advance of public opinion within four years and of the grand successive steps of this advanceemancipation in the district of columbia the repeal of the fugitive slave law the general emancipation act the amendment of the constitution all these do not look as if the black were about to be ground to powder beneath the heel of the white if the negroes are oppressed in the south they can emigrate no laws hold them active industrious laborers will soon find openings in any part of the union  no said theophilus there will be black laws like those of illinois and tennessee there will be turbulent uprisings of the irish excited by political demagogues that will bar them out of northern states besides as a class they will be idle and worthless it will not be their fault but it will be the result of their slave education all their past observation of their masters has taught them that liberty means licensed laziness that work means degradation and therefore they will loathe work and cherish laziness as the sign of liberty am not i free have i not as good a right to do nothing as you will be the cry  already the lazy whites who never lifted a hand in any useful employment begin to raise the cry that niggers wont work and i suspect the cry may not be without reason industrious citizens can never be made in a community where the higher class think useful labor a disgrace the whites will oppose the negro in every effort to rise they will debar him of every civil and social right they will set him the worst possible example as they have been doing for hundreds of years and then they will hound and hiss at him for being what they made him this is the old track of the worldthe good broad reputable road on which all aristocracies and privileged classes have been always traveling and its not likely that we shall have much of a secession from it the millennium isnt so near us as that by a great deal  its all very well arguing from human selfishness and human sin in that way said i but you cant take up a newspaper that doesnt contain abundant facts to the contrary here nowand i turned to the tribuneis one item that fell under my eye accidentally as you were speaking  the superintendent of freedmens affairs in louisiana in making up his last annual report says he has 1952 blacks settled temporarily on 9650 acres of land who last year raised crops to the value of 175000 and that he had but few worthless blacks under his care and that as a class the blacks have fewer vagrants than can be found among any other class of persons  such testimonies gem the newspapers like stars  newspapers of your way of thinking very likely said theophilus but if it comes to statistics i can bring counterstatements numerous and dire from scores of southern papers of vagrancy laziness improvidence and wretchedness  probably both are true said i according to the greater or less care which has been taken of the blacks in different regions left to themselves they tend downward pressed down by the whole weight of semibarbarous white society but when the free north protects and guides the results are as you see  and do you think the free north has salt enough in it to save this whole southern mass from corruption i wish i could think so but all i can see in the free north at present is a raging tearing headlong chase after money now money is of significance only as it gives people the power of expressing their ideal of life and what does this ideal prove to be among us is it not to ape all the splendors and vices of old aristocratic society is it not to be able to live in idleness without useful employment a life of glitter and flutter and show what do our new york dames of fashion seek after to avoid family care to find servants at any price who will relieve them of home responsibilities and take charge of their houses and children while they shine at ball and opera and drive in the park and the servants who learn of these mistresseswhat do they seek after they seek also to get rid of care to live as nearly as possible without work to dress and shine in their secondary sphere as the mistresses do in the primary one high wages with little work and plenty of company express biddys ideal of life which is a little more respectable than that of her mistress who wants high wages with no work the house and the children are not biddys and why should she care more for their wellbeing than the mistress and the mother  hence come wranglings and moanings biddy uses a chest of tea in three months and the amount of the butchers bill is fabulous jane gives the baby laudanum to quiet it while she slips out to her parties and the upper classes are shocked at the demoralized state of the irish their utter want of faithfulness and moral principle how dreadful that there are no people who enjoy the selfdenials and the cares which they dislike that there are no people who rejoice in carrying that burden of duties which they do not wish to touch with one of their fingers the outcry about the badness of servants means just this that everybody is tired of selfhelpfulnessthe servants as thoroughly as the masters and mistresses all want the cream of life without even the trouble of skimming and the great fight now is who shall drink the skimmilk which nobody wants workhonorable toilmanly womanly endeavoris just what nobody likes and this is as much a fact in the free north as in the slave south  what are all the young girls looking for in marriage some man with money enough to save them from taking any care or having any trouble in domestic life enabling them like the lilies of the field to rival solomon in all his glory while they toil not neither do they spin and when they find that even money cannot purchase freedom from care in family life because their servants are exactly of the same mind with themselves and hate to do their duties as cordially as they themselves do then are they in anguish of spirit and wish for slavery or aristocracy or anything that would give them power over the lower classes  but surely mr theophilus said jenny there is no sin in disliking trouble and wanting to live easily and have a good time in ones lifeits so very natural  no sin my dear i admit but there is a certain amount of work and trouble that somebody must take to carry on the family and the world and the mischief is that all are agreed in wanting to get rid of it human nature is above all things lazy i am lazy myself everybody is the whole struggle of society is as to who shall eat the hard breadandcheese of labor which must be eaten by somebody nobody wants itneither you in the parlor nor biddy in the kitchen  the mass ought to labor and we lie on sofas is a sentence that would unite more subscribers than any confession of faith that ever was presented whether religious or political and its subscribers would be as numerous and sincere in the free states as in the slave states or i am much mistaken in my judgment the negroes are men and women like any of the rest of us and particularly apt in the imitation of the ways and ideas current in good society and consequently to learn to play on the piano and to have nothing in particular to do will be the goal of aspiration among colored girls and woman and to do housework will seem to them intolerable drudgery simply because it is so among the fair models to whom they look up in humble admiration you see my dear what it is to live in a democracy it deprives us of the vantageground on which we cultivated people can stand and say to our neighborthe cream is for me and the skimmilk for you the white bread for me and the brown for you i am born to amuse myself and have a good time and you are born to do everything that is tiresome and disagreeable to me the my lady ludlows of the old world can stand on their platform and lecture the lower classes from the church catechism to order themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters and they can base their exhortations on the old established law of society by which some are born to inherit the earth and live a life of ease and pleasure and others to toil without pleasure or amusement for their support and aggrandizement an aristocracy as i take it is a combination of human beings to divide life into two parts one of which shall comprise all social and moral advantages refinement elegance leisure ease pleasure and amusementand the other incessant toil with the absence of every privilege and blessing of human existence life thus divided we aristocrats keep the good for ourselves and our children and distribute the evil as the lot of the general mass of mankind the desire to monopolize and to dominate is the most rooted form of human selfishness it is the hydra with many heads and cut off in one place it puts out in another  nominally the great aristocratic arrangement of american society has just been destroyed but really i take it the essential animus of the slave system still exists and pervades the community north as well as south everybody is wanting to get the work done by somebody else and to take the money himself the grinding between employers and employed is going on all the time and the field of controversy has only been made wider by bringing in a whole new class of laborers the irish have now the opportunity to sustain their aristocracy over the negro shall they not have somebody to look down upon  all through free society employers and employed are at incessant feud and the more free and enlightened the society the more bitter the feud the standing complaint of life in america is the badness of servants and england which always follows at a certain rate behind us in our social movements is beginning to raise very loudly the same complaint the condition of service has been thought worthy of public attention in some of the leading british prints and ruskin in a summingup article speaks of it as a deep ulcer in societya thing hopeless of remedy  my dear mr theophilus said my wife i cannot imagine whither you are rambling or to what purpose you are getting up these horrible shadows you talk of the world as if there were no god in it overruling the selfishness of men and educating it up to order and justice i do not deny that there is a vast deal of truth in what you say nobody doubts that in general human nature is selfish callous unfeeling willing to engross all good to itself and to trample on the rights of others nevertheless thanks to gods teaching and fatherly care the world has worked along to the point of a great nation founded on the principles of strict equality forbidding all monopolies aristocracies privileged classes by its very constitution and now by gods wonderful providence this nation has been brought and forced as it were to overturn and abolish the only aristocratic institution that interfered with its free development does not this look as if a mightier power than ours were working in and for us supplementing our weakness and infirmity and if we believe that man is always ready to drop everything and let it run back to evil shall we not have faith that god will not drop the noble work he has so evidently taken in hand in this nation  and i want to know said jenny why your illustrations of selfishness are all drawn from the female sex why do you speak of girls that marry for money any more than men of mistresses of families that want to be free from household duties and responsibilities rather than of masters  my charming young lady said theophilus it is a fact that in america except the slaveholders women have hitherto been the only aristocracy women have been the privileged classthe only one to which our rough democracy has always and everywhere given the precedenceand consequently the vices of aristocrats are more developed in them as a class than among men the leading principle of aristocracy which is to take pay without work to live on the toils and earnings of others is one which obtains more generally among women than among men in this country the men of our country as a general thing even in our uppermost classes always propose to themselves some work or business by which they may acquire a fortune or enlarge that already made for them by their fathers the women of the same class propose to themselves nothing but to live at their ease on the money made for them by the labors of fathers and husbands as a consequence they become enervated and indolentaverse to any bracing wholesome effort either mental or physical the unavoidable responsibilities and cares of a family instead of being viewed by them in the light of a noble life work in which they do their part in the general labors of the world seem to them so many injuries and wrongs they seek to turn them upon servants and find servants unwilling to take them and so selfish are they that i have heard more than one lady declare that she didnt care if it was unjust she should like to have slaves rather than be plagued with servants who had so much liberty all the novels poetry and light literature of the world which form the general staple of female reading are based upon aristocratic institutions and impregnated with aristocratic ideas and women among us are constantly aspiring to foreign and aristocratic modes of life rather than to those of native republican simplicity how many women are there think you that would not go in for aristocracy and aristocratic prerogatives if they were only sure that they themselves should be of the privileged class to be my lady duchess and to have a right by that simple title to the prostrate deference of all the lower orders how many would have firmness to vote against such an establishment merely because it was bad for society tell the fair mrs feathercap in order that you may be a duchess and have everything a paradise of elegance and luxury around you and your children a hundred poor families must have no chance for anything better than black bread and muddy water all their lives a hundred poor men must work all their lives on such wages that a fortnights sickness will send their families to the almshouse and that no amount of honesty and forethought can lay up any provision for old age  come now sir said jenny dont tell me that there are any girls or women so mean and selfish as to want aristocracy or rank so purchased you are too bad mr theophilus  perhaps they might not were it stated in just these terms yet i think if the question of the establishment of an order of aristocracy among us were put to vote we should find more women than men who would go for it and they would flout at the consequences to society with the lively wit and the musical laugh which make feminine selfishness so genteel and agreeable  no it is a fact that in america the women in the wealthy classes are like the noblemen of aristocracies and the men are the workers and in all this outcry that has been raised about womens wages being inferior to those of men there is one thing overlookedand that is that womens work is generally inferior to that of men because in every rank they are the pets of society and are excused from the laborious drill and training by which men are fitted for their callings our fair friends come in generally by some royal road to knowledge which saves them the dire necessity of real worka sort of feminine hopskipandjump into science or mechanical skillnothing like the uncompromising hard labor to which the boy is put who would be a mechanic or farmer a lawyer or physician  i admit freely that we men are to blame for most of the faults of our fair nobility there is plenty of heroism abundance of energy and love of noble endeavor lying dormant in these sheltered and petted daughters of the better classes but we keep it down and smother it fathers and brothers think it discreditable to themselves not to give their daughters and sisters the means of living in idleness and any adventurous fair one who seeks to end the ennui of utter aimlessness by applying herself to some occupation whereby she may earn her own living infallibly draws down on her the comments of her whole circle keeping school is she isnt her father rich enough to support her what could possess her  i am glad my dear sir oracle that you are beginning to recollect yourself and temper your severities on our sex said my wife as usual there is much truth lying about loosely in the vicinity of your assertions but they are as far from being in themselves the truth as would be their exact opposites  the class of american women who travel live abroad and represent our country to the foreign eye have acquired the reputation of being sybarites in luxury and extravagance and there is much in the modes of life that are creeping into our richer circles to justify this  miss murray exmaidofhonor to the queen of england among other impressions which she received from an extended tour through our country states it as her conviction that young american girls of the better classes are less helpful in nursing the sick and in the general duties of family life than the daughters of the aristocracy of england and i am inclined to believe it because even the queen has taken special pains to cultivate habits of energy and selfhelpfulness in her children one of the toys of the princess royal was said to be a cottage of her own furnished with every accommodation for cooking and housekeeping where she from time to time enacted the part of housekeeper making bread and biscuit boiling potatoes which she herself had gathered from her own gardenpatch and inviting her royal parents to meals of her own preparing and report says that the dignitaries of the german court have been horrified at the energetic determination of the young royal housekeeper to overlook her own linen closets and attend to her own affairs but as an offset to what i have been saying it must be admitted that america is a country where a young woman can be selfsupporting without forfeiting her place in society all our new england and western towns show us female teachers who are as well received and as much caressed in society and as often contract advantageous marriages as any women whatever and the productive labor of american women in various arts trades and callings would be found i think not inferior to that of any women in the world  furthermore the history of the late war has shown them capable of every form of heroic endeavor we have had hundreds of florence nightingales and an amount of real hard work has been done by female hands not inferior to that performed by men in the camp and field and enough to make sure that american womanhood is not yet so enervated as seriously to interfere with the prospects of free republican society  i wonder said jenny what it is in our country that spoils the working classes that come into it they say that the emigrants as they land here are often simplehearted people willing to work accustomed to early hours and plain living decorous and respectful in their manners it would seem as if aristocratic drilling had done them good in a few months they become brawling impertinent grasping want high wages and are very unwilling to work i went to several intelligenceoffices the other day to look for a girl for marianne and i thought by the way the candidates catechized the ladies and the airs they took upon them that they considered themselves the future mistresses interrogating their subordinates  does ye expect me to do the washin with the cookin  yes  thin ill niver go to that place  and does ye expect me to get the early breakfast for yer husband to be off in the train every mornin  yes  i niver does thatthat ought to be a second girls work  how many servants does ye keep maam  two  i niver lives with people that keeps but two servants  how many has ye in yer family  seven  thats too large a family has ye much company  yes we have company occasionally  thin i cant come to ye itll be too harrd a place  in fact the thing they were all in quest of seemed to be a very small family with very high wages and many perquisites and privileges  this is the kind of workpeople our manners and institutions make of people that come over here i remember one day seeing a coachman touch his cap to his mistress when she spoke to him as is the way in europe and hearing one or two others saying among themselves  that chaps a greenie hell get over that soon  all these things show said i that the staff of power has passed from the hands of gentility into those of labor we may think the working classes somewhat unseemly in their assertion of selfimportance but after all are they considering their inferior advantages of breeding any more overbearing and impertinent than the upper classes have always been to them in all ages and countries  when biddy looks long hedges in her work with many conditions and is careful to get the most she can for the least labor is she after all doing any more than you or i or all the rest of the world i myself will not write articles for five dollars a page when there are those who will give me fifteen i would not do double duty as an editor on a salary of seven thousand when i could get ten thousand for less work  biddy and her mistress are two human beings with the same human wants both want to escape trouble to make their life comfortable and easy with the least outlay of expense biddys capital is her muscles and sinews and she wants to get as many greenbacks in exchange for them as her wit and shrewdness will enable her to do you feel when you bargain with her that she is nothing to you except so far as her strength and knowledge may save you care and trouble and she feels that you are nothing to her except so far as she can get your money for her work the freeandeasy airs of those seeking employment show one thingthat the country in general is prosperous and that openings for profitable employment are so numerous that it is not thought necessary to try to conciliate favor if the community were at starvationpoint and the loss of a situation brought fear of the almshouse the laboringclass would be more subservient as it is there is a little spice of the bitterness of a past age of servitude in their present attitudea bristling selfdefensive impertinence which will gradually smooth away as society learns to accommodate itself to the new order of things  well but papa said jenny dont you think all this a very severe test if applied to us women particularly more than to the men mr theophilus seems to think women are aristocrats and go for enslaving the lower classes out of mere selfishness but i say that we are a great deal more strongly tempted than men because all these annoyances and trials of domestic life come upon us it is very insidious the aristocratic argument as it appeals to us there seems much to be said in its favor it does appear to me that it is better to have servants and workpeople tidy industrious respectful and decorous as they are in europe than domineering impertinent and negligent as they are hereand it seems that there is something in our institutions that produces these disagreeable traits and i presume that the negroes will eventually be traveling the same road as the irish and from the same influences  when people see all these things and feel all the inconveniences of them i dont wonder that they are tempted not to like democracy and to feel as if aristocratic institutions made a more agreeable state of society it is not such a blank bald downright piece of brutal selfishness as mr theophilus there seems to suppose for us to wish there were some quiet submissive laborious lower class who would be content to work for kind treatment and moderate wages  but my little dear said i the matter is not left to our choice wish it or not wish it its what we evidently cant have the day for that thing is past the power is passing out of the hands of the cultivated few into those of the strong laborious many numbers is the king of our era and he will reign over us whether we will hear or whether we will forbear the sighers for an obedient lower class and the mourners for slavery may get ready their crape and have their pockethandkerchiefs bordered with black for they have much weeping to do and for many years to come the good old feudal times when two thirds of the population thought themselves born only for the honor glory and profit of the other third are gone with all their beautiful devotions all their trappings of song and story in the land where such institutions were most deeply rooted and most firmly established they are assailed every day by hard hands and stout hearts and their position resembles that of some of the picturesque ruins of italy which are constantly being torn away to build prosaic modern shops and houses  this great democratic movement is coming down into modern society with a march as irresistible as the glacier moves down from the mountains its front is in americaand behind are england france italy prussia and the mohammedan countries in all the rights of the laboring masses are a living force bearing slowly and inevitably all before it our war has been a marshaling of its armies commanded by a hardhanded inspired man of the workingclass an intelligent american recently resident in egypt says it was affecting to notice the interest with which the working classes there were looking upon our late struggle in america and the earnestness of their wishes for the triumph of the union it is our cause it is for us they said as said the cotton spinners of england and the silk weavers of lyons the forces of this mighty movement are still directed by a man from the lower orders the sworn foe of exclusive privileges and landed aristocracies if andy johnson is consistent with himself with the principles which raised him from a tailors bench to the head of a mighty nation he will see to it that the work that lincoln began is so thoroughly done that every man and every woman in america of whatever race or complexion shall have exactly equal rights before the law and be free to rise or fall according to their individual intelligence industry and moral worth so long as everything is not strictly in accordance with our principles of democracy so long as there is in any part of the country an aristocratic upper class who despise labor and a laboring lower class that is denied equal political rights so long this grinding and discord between the two will never cease in america it will make trouble not only in the south but in the northtrouble between all employers and employedtrouble in every branch and department of labortrouble in every parlor and every kitchen  what is it that has driven every american woman out of domestic service when domestic service is full as well paid is easier healthier and in many cases far more agreeable than shop and factory work it is more than anything else the influence of slavery in the southits insensible influence on the minds of mistresses giving them false ideas of what ought to be the position and treatment of a female citizen in domestic service and its very marked influence on the minds of freedomloving americans causing them to choose any position rather than one which is regarded as assimilating them to slaves it is difficult to say what are the very worst results of a system so altogether bad as that of slavery but one of the worst is certainly the utter contempt it brings on useful labor and the consequent utter physical and moral degradation of a large body of the whites and this contempt of useful labor has been constantly spreading like an infection from the southern to the northern states particularly among women who as our friend here has truly said are by our worship and exaltation of them made peculiarly liable to take the malaria of aristocratic society let anybody observe the conversation in good society for an hour or two and hear the tone in which servantgirls seamstresses mechanics and all who work for their living are sometimes mentioned and he will see that while every one of the speakers professes to regard useful labor as respectable she is yet deeply imbued with the leaven of aristocratic ideas  in the south the contempt for labor bred of slavery has so permeated society that we see great coarse vulgar lazzaroni lying about in rags and vermin and dependent on government rations maintaining as their only source of selfrespect that they never have done and never will do a stroke of useful work in all their lives in the north there are i believe no men who would make such a boast but i think there are many womenbeautiful fascinating lazzaroni of the parlor and boudoirwho make their boast of elegant helplessness and utter incompetence for any of womans duties with equal na√Øvet√© the spartans made their slaves drunk to teach their children the evils of intoxication and it seems to be the policy of a large class in the south now to keep down and degrade the only working class they have for the sake of teaching their children to despise work  we of the north who know the dignity of labor who know the value of free and equal institutions who have enjoyed advantages for seeing their operation ought in true brotherliness to exercise the power given us by the present position of the people of the southern states and put things thoroughly right for them well knowing that though they may not like it at the moment they will like it in the end and that it will bring them peace plenty and settled prosperity such as they have long envied here in the north it is no kindness to an invalid brother half recovered from delirium to leave him a knife to cut his throat with should he be so disposed we should rather appeal from philip drunk to philip sober and do real kindness trusting to the future for our meed of gratitude  giving equal political rights to all the inhabitants of the southern states will be their shortest way to quiet and to wealth it will avert what is else almost certaina war of races since all experience shows that the ballot introduces the very politest relations between the higher and lower classes if the right be restricted let it be by requirements of property and education applying to all the population equally  meanwhile we citizens and citizenesses of the north should remember that reconstruction means something more than setting things right in the southern states we have saved our government and institutions but we have paid a fearful price for their salvation and we ought to prove now that they are worth the price  the empty chair never to be filled the light gone out on its candlestick never on earth to be rekindled gallant souls that have exhaled to heaven in slow torture and starvation the precious blood that has drenched a hundred battlefieldsall call to us with warning voices and tell us not to let such sacrifices be in vain they call on us by our clear understanding of the great principles of democratic equality for which our martyred brethren suffered and died to show to all the world that their death was no mean and useless waste but a glorious investment for the future of mankind  this war these sufferings these sacrifices ought to make every american man and woman look on himself and herself as belonging to a royal priesthood a peculiar people the blood of our slain ought to be a gulf wide and deep as the atlantic dividing us from the opinions and the practices of countries whose government and society are founded on other and antagonistic ideas democratic republicanism has never yet been perfectly worked out either in this or any other country it is a splendid edifice half built deformed by rude scaffolding noisy with the clink of trowels blinding the eyes with the dust of lime and endangering our heads with falling brick we make our way over heaps of shavings and lumber to view the stately apartmentswe endanger our necks in climbing ladders standing in the place of future staircases but let us not for all this cry out that the old ratholed mansions of former ages with their mould and moss and cockroaches are better than this new palace there is no limedust no clink of trowels no rough scaffolding there to be sure and life goes on very quietly but there is the foul air of slow and sure decay  republican institutions in america are in a transition state they have not yet separated themselves from foreign and antagonistic ideas and traditions derived from old countries and the labors necessary for the upbuilding of society are not yet so adjusted that there is mutual pleasure and comfort in the relations of employer and employed we still incline to class distinctions and aristocracies we incline to the scheme of dividing the worlds work into two orders first physical labor which is held to be rude and vulgar and the province of a lower class and second brain labor held to be refined and aristocratic and the province of a higher class meanwhile the creator who is the greatest of levelers has given to every human being both a physical system needing to be kept in order by physical labor and an intellectual or brain power needing to be kept in order by brain labor work use employment is the condition of health in both and he who works either to the neglect of the other lives but a halflife and is an imperfect human being  the aristocracies of the old world claim that their only labor should be that of the brain and they keep their physical system in order by violent exercise which is made genteel from the fact only that it is not useful or productive it would be losing caste to refresh the muscles by handling the plough or the axe and so foxes and hares must be kept to be hunted and whole counties turned into preserves in order that the nobility and gentry may have physical exercise in a way befitting their stationthat is to say in a way that produces nothing and does good only to themselves  the model republican uses his brain for the highest purposes of brain work and his muscles in productive physical labor and useful labor he respects above that which is merely agreeable when this equal respect for physical and mental labor shall have taken possession of every american citizen there will be no socalled laboring class there will no more be a class all muscle without brain power to guide it and a class all brain without muscular power to execute the labors of society will be lighter because each individual will take his part in them they will be performed better because no one will be overburdened in those days miss jenny it will be an easier matter to keep house because housework being no longer regarded as degrading drudgery you will find a superior class of women ready to engage in it  every young girl and woman who in her sphere and by her example shows that she is not ashamed of domestic labor and that she considers the necessary work and duties of family life as dignified and important is helping to bring on this good day louis philippe once jestingly remarked i have this qualification for being a king in these days that i have blacked my own boots and could black them again  every american ought to cultivate as his pride and birthright the habit of selfhelpfulness our command of the labors of good employees in any department is liable to such interruptions that he who has blacked his own boots and can do it again is on the whole likely to secure the most comfort in life  as to that which mr ruskin pronounces to be a deep irremediable ulcer in society namely domestic service we hold that the last workings of pure democracy will cleanse and heal it when right ideas are sufficiently spread when everybody is selfhelpful and capable of being selfsupporting when there is a fair start for every human being in the race of life and all its prizes are without respect of persons to be obtained by the best runner when every kind of useful labor is thoroughly respectedthen there will be a clear just wholesome basis of intercourse on which employers and employed can move without wrangling or discord  renouncing all claims to superiority on the one hand and all thought of servility on the other service can be rendered by fair contracts and agreements with that mutual respect and benevolence which every human being owes to every other but for this transition period which is wearing out the life of so many women and making so many households uncomfortable i have some alleviating suggestions which i shall give in my next chapter     iv  is woman a worker   papa do you see what the evening post says of your new years article on reconstruction said jenny as we were all sitting in the library after tea  i have not seen it  well then the charming writer whoever he is takes up for us girls and women and maintains that no work of any sort ought to be expected of us that our only mission in life is to be beautiful and to refresh and elevate the spirits of men by being so if i get a husband my mission is to be always becomingly dressed to display most captivating toilettes and to be always in good spiritsas under the circumstances i always should beand thus renew his spirits when he comes in weary with the toils of life household cares are to be far from me they destroy my cheerfulness and injure my beauty  he says that the new england standard of excellence as applied to woman has been a mistaken one and in consequence though the girls are beautiful the matrons are faded overworked and uninteresting and that such a state of society tends to immorality because when wives are no longer charming men are open to the temptation to desert their firesides and get into mischief generally he seems particularly to complain of your calling ladies who do nothing the fascinating lazzaroni of the parlor and boudoir  there was too much truth back of that arrow not to wound said theophilus thoro who was ensconced as usual in his dark corner whence he supervises our discussions  come mr thoro we wont have any of your bitter moralities said jenny they are only to be taken as the invariable bayleaf which professor blot introduces into all his recipes for soups and stewsa little elegant bitterness to be kept tastefully in the background you see now papa i should like the vocation of being beautiful it would just suit me to wear pointlace and jewelry and to have life revolve round me as some beautiful star and feel that i had nothing to do but shine and refresh the spirits of all gazers and that in this way i was truly useful and fulfilling the great end of my being but alas for this doctrine all women have not beauty the most of us can only hope not to be called illlooking and when we get ourselves up with care to look fresh and trim and agreeable which fact interferes with the theory  well for my part said young rudolph i go for the theory of the beautiful if ever i marry it is to find an asylum for ideality i dont want to make a culinary marriage or a business partnership i want a being whom i can keep in a sphere of poetry and beauty out of the dust and grime of everylay life  then said mr theophilus you must either be a rich man in your own right or your fair ideal must have a handsome fortune of her own  i never will marry a rich wife quoth rudolph my wife must be supported by me not i by her  rudolph is another of the habitu√©s of our chimneycorner representing the order of young knighthood in america and his dreams and fancies if impracticable are always of a kind to make every one think him a good fellow he who has no romantic dreams at twentyone will be a horribly dry peascod at fifty therefore it is that i gaze reverently at all rudolphs chateaus in spain which want nothing to complete them except solid earth to stand on  and pray said theophilus how long will it take a young lawyer or physician starting with no heritage but his own brain to create a sphere of poetry and beauty in which to keep his goddess how much a year will be necessary as the english say to do this garden of eden whereinto shall enter only the poetry of life  i dont know i havent seen it near enough to consider it is because i know the difficulty of its attainment that i have no present thoughts of marriage marriage is to me in the bluest of all blue distancesfar off mysterious and dreamy as the mountains of the moon or sources of the nile it shall come only when i have secured a fortune that shall place my wife above all necessity of work or care  i desire to hear from you said theophilus when you have found the sum that will keep a woman from care i know of women now inhabiting palaces waited on at every turn by servants with carriages horses jewels laces cashmeres enough for princesses who are eaten up by care one lies awake all night on account of a wrinkle in the waist of her dress another is dying because no silk of a certain inexpressible shade is to be found in new york a third has had a dress sent home which has proved such a failure that life seems no longer worth having if it were not for the consolations of religion one doesnt know what would become of her the fact is that care and labor are as much correlated to human existence as shadow is to light there is no such thing as excluding them from any mortal lot you may make a canarybird or a goldfish live in absolute contentment without a care or labor but a human being you cannot human beings are restless and active in their very nature and will do something and that something will prove a care a labor and a fatigue arrange it how you will as long as there is anything to be desired and not yet attained so long its attainment will be attempted so long as that attainment is doubtful or difficult so long will there be care and anxiety when boundless wealth releases woman from every family care she immediately makes herself a new set of cares in another direction and has just as many anxieties as the most toilful housekeeper only they are of a different kind talk of labor and look at the upper classes in london or in new york in the fashionable season do any women work harder to rush from crowd to crowd all night night after night seeing what they are tired of making the agreeable over an abyss of inward yawning crowded jostled breathing hot air and crushed in halls and stairways without a moment of leisure for months and months till brain and nerve and sense reel and the country is longed for as a period of resuscitation and relief such is the release from labor and fatigue brought by wealth the only thing that makes all this labor at all endurable is that it is utterly and entirely useless and does no good to any one in creation this alone makes it genteel and distinguishes it from the vulgar toils of a housekeeper these delicate creatures who can go to three or four parties a night for three months would be utterly desolate if they had to watch one night in a sickroom and though they can exhibit any amount of physical endurance and vigor in crowding into assembly rooms and breathe tainted air in an operahouse with the most martyrlike constancy they could not sit one halfhour in the close room where the sister of charity spends hours in consoling the sick or aged poor  mr theophilus is quite at home now said jenny only start him on the track of fashionable life and he takes the course like a hound but hear now our champion of the evening post  the instinct of women to seek a life of repose their eagerness to attain the life of elegance does not mean contempt for labor but it is a confession of unfitness for labor women were not intended to worknot because work is ignoble but because it is as disastrous to the beauty of a woman as is friction to the bloom and softness of a flower woman is to be kept in the garden of life she is to rest to receive to praise she is to be kept from the workshop world where innocence is snatched with rude hands and softness is blistered into unsightliness or hardened into adamant no social truth is more in need of exposition and illustration than this one and above all the people of new england need to know it and better they need to believe it  it is therefore with regret that we discover christopher crowfield applying so harshly and as we think so indiscriminatingly the theory of work to women and teaching a society made up of women sacrificed in the workshops of the state or to the dustpans and kitchens of the house that women must work ought to work and are dishonored if they do not work and that a woman committed to the drudgery of a household is more creditably employed than when she is charming fascinating irresistible in the parlor or boudoir the consequence of this fatal mistake is manifest throughout new englandin new england where the girls are all beautiful and the wives and mothers faded disfigured and without charm or attractiveness the moment a girl marries in new england she is apt to become a drudge or a lay figure on which to exhibit the latest fashions she never has beautiful hands and she would not have a beautiful face if a utilitarian society could apply her face to anything but the pleasure of the eye her hands lose their shape and softness after childhood and domestic drudgery destroys her beauty of form and softness and bloom of complexion after marriage to correct or rather to break up this despotism of household cares or of work over woman american society must be taught that women will inevitably fade and deteriorate unless it insures repose and comfort to them it must be taught that reverence for beauty is the normal condition while the theory of work applied to women is disastrous alike to beauty and morals work when it is destructive to men or women is forced and unjust  all the great masculine or creative epochs have been distinguished by spontaneous work on the part of men and universal reverence and care for beauty the praise of work and sacrifice of women to this great heartless devil of work belong only to and are the social doctrine of a mechanical age and a utilitarian epoch and if the new england idea of social life continues to bear so cruelly on woman we shall have a reaction somewhat unexpected and shocking  well now say what you will said rudolph you have expressed my idea of the conditions of the sex woman was not made to work she was made to be taken care of by man all that is severe and trying whether in study or in practical life is and ought to be in its very nature essentially the work of the male sex the value of woman is precisely the value of those priceless works of art for which we build museumswhich we shelter and guard as the worlds choicest heritage and a lovely cultivated refined woman thus sheltered and guarded and developed has a worth that cannot be estimated by any gross material standard so i subscribe to the sentiments of miss jennys friend without scruple  the great trouble in settling all these society questions said i lies in the goldwashingthe cradling i think the miners call it if all the quartz were in one stratum and all the gold in another it would save us a vast deal of trouble in the ideas of jennys friend of the evening post there is a line of truth and a line of falsehood so interwoven and threaded together that it is impossible wholly to assent or dissent so with your ideas rudolph there is a degree of truth in them but there is also a fallacy  it is a truth that woman as a sex ought not to do the hard work of the world either social intellectual or moral these are evidences in her physiology that this was not intended for her and our friend of the evening post is right in saying that any country will advance more rapidly in civilization and refinement where woman is thus sheltered and protected and i think furthermore that there is no country in the world where women are so much considered and cared for and sheltered in every walk of life as in america in england and franceall over the continent of europe in factthe other sex are deferential to women only from some presumption of their social standing or from the fact of acquaintanceship but among strangers and under circumstances where no particular rank or position can be inferred a woman traveling in england or france is jostled and pushed to the wall and left to take her own chance precisely as if she were not a woman deference to delicacy and weakness the instinct of protection does not appear to characterize the masculine population of any other quarter of the world so much as that of america in france les messieurs will form a circle round the fire in the receivingroom of a railroad station and sit tranquilly smoking their cigars while ladies who do not happen to be of their acquaintance are standing shivering at the other side of the room in england if a lady is incautiously booked for an outside place on a coach in hope of seeing the scenery and the day turns out hopelessly rainy no gentleman in the coach below ever thinks of offering to change seats with her though it pour torrents in america the roughest backwoods steamboat or canalboat captain always as a matter of course considers himself charged with the protection of the ladies place aux dames is written in the heart of many a shaggy fellow who could not utter a french word any more than could a buffalo it is just as i have before saidwomen are the recognized aristocracy the only aristocracy of america and so far from regarding this fact as objectionable it is an unceasing source of pride in my country  that kind of knightly feeling towards woman which reverences her delicacy her frailty which protects and cares for her is i think the crown of manhood and without it a man is only a rough animal but our fair aristocrats and their knightly defenders need to be cautioned lest they lose their position as many privileged orders have before done by an arrogant and selfish use of power  i have said that the vices of aristocracy are more developed among women in america than among men and that while there are no men in the northern states who are not ashamed of living a merely idle life of pleasure there are many women who make a boast of helplessness and ignorance in womans family duties which any man would be ashamed to make with regard to mans duties as if such helplessness and ignorance were a grace and a charm  there are women who contentedly live on year after year a life of idleness while the husband and father is straining every nerve growing prematurely old and gray abridged of almost every form of recreation or pleasureall that he may keep them in a state of careless ease and festivity it may be very fine very generous very knightly in the man who thus toils at the oar that his princesses may enjoy their painted voyages but what is it for the women  a woman is a moral beingan immortal soulbefore she is a woman and as such she is charged by her maker with some share of the great burden of work which lies on the world  selfdenial the bearing of the cross are stated by christ as indispensable conditions to the entrance into his kingdom and no exception is made for man or woman some task some burden some cross each one must carry and there must be something done in every true and worthy life not as amusement but as dutynot as play but as earnest workand no human being can attain to the christian standard without this  when jesus christ took a towel and girded himself poured water into a basin and washed his disciples feet he performed a significant and sacramental act which no man or woman should ever forget if wealth and rank and power absolve from the services of life then certainly were jesus christ absolved as he says ye call me master and lord if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you  let a man who seeks to make a terrestrial paradise for the woman of his heartto absolve her from all care from all labor to teach her to accept and to receive the labor of others without any attempt to offer labor in returnconsider whether he is not thus going directly against the fundamental idea of christianity taking the direct way to make his idol selfish and exacting to rob her of the highest and noblest beauty of womanhood  in that chapter of the bible where the relation between man and woman is stated it is thus said with quaint simplicity it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him woman the helper of man not his toynot a picture not a statue not a work of art but a helper a doersuch is the view of the bible and the christian religion  it is not necessary that women should work physically or morally to an extent which impairs beauty in france where woman is harnessed with an ass to the plough which her husband driveswhere she digs and wields the pickaxeshe becomes prematurely hideous but in america where woman reigns as queen in every household she may surely be a good and thoughtful housekeeper she may have physical strength exercised in lighter domestic toils not only without injuring her beauty but with manifest advantage to it almost every growing young girl would be the better in health and therefore handsomer for two hours of active housework daily and the habit of usefulness thereby gained would be an equal advantage to her moral development the labors of modern wellarranged houses are not in any sense severe they are as gentle as any kind of exercise that can be devised and they bring into play muscles that ought to be exercised to be healthily developed  the great danger to the beauty of american women does not lie as the writer of the post contends in an overworking of the physical system which shall stunt and deform on the contrary american women of the comfortable classes are in danger of a loss of physical beauty from the entire deterioration of the muscular system for want of exercise take the life of any american girl in one of our large towns and see what it is we have an educational system of public schools which for intellectual culture is a just matter of pride to any country from the time that the girl is seven years old her first thought when she rises in the morning is to eat her breakfast and be off to her school there really is no more time than enough to allow her to make that complete toilet which every wellbred female ought to make and to take her morning meal before her school begins she returns at noon with just time to eat her dinner and the afternoon session begins she comes home at night with books slate and lessons enough to occupy her evening what time is there for teaching her any household work for teaching her to cut or fit or sew or to inspire her with any taste for domestic duties her arms have no exercise her chest and lungs and all the complex system of muscles which are to be perfected by quick and active movement are compressed while she bends over book and slate and drawingboard while the ever active brain is kept all the while going at the top of its speed she grows up spare thin and delicate and while the irish girl who sweeps the parlors rubs the silver and irons the muslins is developing a finely rounded arm and bust the american girl has a pair of bones at her sides and a bust composed of cotton padding the work of a skillful dressmaker nature who is no respecter of persons gives to colleen bawn who uses her arms and chest a beauty which perishes in the gentle languid edith who does nothing but study and read  but is it not a fact said rudolph as stated by our friend of the post that american matrons are perishing and their beauty and grace all withered from overwork  it is said my wife but why it is because they are brought up without vigor or muscular strength without the least practical experience of household labor or those means of saving it which come by daily practice and then after marriage when physically weakened by maternity embarrassed by the care of young children they are often suddenly deserted by every efficient servant and the whole machinery of a complicated household left in their weak inexperienced hands in the country you see a household perhaps made void some fine morning by biddys sudden departure and nobody to make the bread or cook the steak or sweep the parlors or do one of the complicated offices of a family and no bakery cookshop or laundry to turn to for alleviation a lovely refined home becomes in a few hours a howling desolation and then ensues a long season of breakage waste distraction as one wild irish immigrant after another introduces the style of irish cottage life into an elegant dwelling  now suppose i grant to the evening post that woman ought to rest to be kept in the garden of life and all that how is this to be done in a country where a state of things like this is the commonest of occurrences and is it any kindness or reverence to woman to educate her for such an inevitable destiny by a life of complete physical delicacy and incapacity many a woman who has been brought into these cruel circumstances would willingly exchange all her knowledge of german and italian and all her graceful accomplishments for a good physical development and some respectable savoir faire in ordinary life  moreover american matrons are overworked because some unaccountable glamour leads them to continue to bring up their girls in the same inefficient physical habits which resulted in so much misery to themselves housework as they are obliged to do it untrained untaught exhausted and in company with rude dirty unkempt foreigners seems to them a degradation which they will spare to their daughters the daughter goes on with her schools and accomplishments and leads in the family the life of an elegant little visitor during all those years when a young girl might be gradually developing and strengthening her muscles in healthy household work it never occurs to her that she can or ought to fill any of the domestic gaps into which her mother always steps and she comforts herself with the thought i dont know how i cant i havent the strength i cant sweep it blisters my hands if i should stand at the ironingtable an hour i should be ill for a week as to cooking i dont know anything about it and so when the cook or the chambermaid or nurse or all together vacate the premises it is the mamma who is successively cook and chambermaid and nurse and this is the reason why matrons fade and are overworked  now mr rudolph do you think a woman any less beautiful or interesting because she is a fully developed physical beingbecause her muscles have been rounded and matured into strength so that she can meet the inevitable emergencies of life without feeling them to be distressing hardships if there be a competent welltrained servant to sweep and dust the parlor and keep all the machinery of the house in motion she may very properly select her work out of the family in some form of benevolent helpfulness but when the inevitable evil hour comes which is likely to come first or last in every american household is a woman any less an elegant woman because her love of neatness order and beauty leads her to make vigorous personal exertions to keep her own home undefiled for my part i think a disorderly illkept home a sordid uninviting table has driven more husbands from domestic life than the unattractiveness of any overworked woman so long as a woman makes her home harmonious and orderly so long as the hour of assembling around the family table is something to be looked forward to as a comfort and a refreshment a man cannot see that the good house fairy who by some magic keeps everything so delightfully has either a wrinkle or a gray hair  besides said i i must tell you rudolph what you fellows of twentyone are slow to believe and that is that the kind of ideal paradise you propose in marriage is in the very nature of things an impossibilitythat the familiarities of everyday life between two people who keep house together must and will destroy it suppose you are married to cytherea herself and the next week attacked with a rheumatic fever if the tie between you is that of true and honest love cytherea will put on a gingham wrapper and with her own sculptured hands wring out the flannels which shall relieve your pains and she will be no true woman if she do not prefer to do this to employing any nurse that could be hired true love ennobles and dignifies the material labors of life and homely services rendered for loves sake have in them a poetry that is immortal  no truehearted woman can find herself in real actual life unskilled and unfit to minister to the wants and sorrows of those dearest to her without a secret sense of degradation the feeling of uselessness is an extremely unpleasant one tom hood in a very humorous paper describes a most accomplished schoolmistress a teacher of all the arts and crafts which are supposed to make up fine gentlewomen who is stranded in a rude german inn with her father writhing in the anguish of a severe attack of gastric inflammation the helpless lady gazes on her suffering parent longing to help him and thinking over all her various little store of accomplishments not one of which bears the remotest relation to the case she could knit him a bead purse or make him a guardchain or work him a footstool or festoon him with cut tissuepaper or sketch his likeness or crust him over with alum crystals or stick him over with little rosettes of red and white wafers but none of these being applicable to his present case she sits gazing in resigned imbecility till finally she desperately resolves to improvise him some gruel and after a laborious turn in the kitchenafter burning her dress and blacking her fingerssucceeds only in bringing him a bowl of paste  not unlike this might be the feeling of many an elegant and accomplished woman whose education has taught and practiced her in everything that woman ought to know except those identical ones which fit her for the care of a home for the comfort of a sickroom and so i say again that whatever a woman may be in the way of beauty and elegance she must have the strength and skill of a practical worker or she is nothing she is not simply to be the beautifulshe is to make the beautiful and preserve it and she who makes and she who keeps the beautiful must be able to work and know how to work whatever offices of life are performed by women of culture and refinement are thenceforth elevated they cease to be mere servile toils and become expressions of the ideas of superior beings if a true lady makes even a plate of toast in arranging a petit souper for her invalid friend she does it as a lady should she does not cut blundering and uneven slices she does not burn the edges she does not deluge it with bad butter and serve it cold but she arranges and serves all with an artistic care with a nicety and delicacy which make it worth ones while to have a lady friend in sickness  and i am glad to hear that monsieur blot is teaching classes of new york ladies that cooking is not a vulgar kitchen toil to be left to blundering servants but an elegant feminine accomplishment better worth a womans learning than crochet or embroidery and that a wellkept culinary apartment may be so inviting and orderly that no lady need feel her ladyhood compromised by participating in its pleasant toils i am glad to know that his cookingacademy is thronged with more scholars than he can accommodate and from ladies in the best classes of society  moreover i am glad to see that in new bedford recently a public course of instruction in the art of breadmaking has been commenced by a lady and that classes of the most respectable young and married ladies in the place are attending them these are steps in the right direction and show that our fair countrywomen with the grand good sense which is their leading characteristic are resolved to supply whatever in our national life is wanting  i do not fear that women of such sense and energy will listen to the sophistries which would persuade them that elegant imbecility and inefficiency are charms of cultivated womanhood or ingredients in the poetry of life she alone can keep the poetry and beauty of married life who has this poetry in her soul who with energy and discretion can throw back and out of sight the sordid and disagreeable details which beset all human living and can keep in the foreground that which is agreeable who has enough knowledge of practical household matters to make unskilled and rude hands minister to her cultivated and refined tastes and constitute her skilled brain the guide of unskilled hands from such a home with such a mistress no sirens will seduce a man even though the hair grow gray and the merely physical charms of early days gradually pass away the enchantment that was about her person alone in the days of courtship seems in the course of years to have interfused and penetrated the home which she has created and which in every detail is only an expression of her personality her thoughts her plans her provident care are everywhere and the home attracts and holds by a thousand ties the heart which before marriage was held by the woman alone     v  the transition   the fact is my dear said my wife that you have thrown a stone into a congregation of blackbirds in writing as you have of our family wars and wants the response comes from all parts of the country and the task of looking over and answering your letters becomes increasingly formidable everybody has something to saysomething to propose  give me a r√©sum√© said i  well said my wife here are three pages from an elderly gentleman to the effect that women are not what they used to bethat daughters are a great care and no help that girls have no health and no energy in practical life that the expense of maintaining a household is so great that young men are afraid to marry and that it costs more now per annum to dress one young woman than it used to cost to carry a whole family of sons through college in short the poor old gentleman is in a desperate state of mind and is firmly of opinion that society is going to ruin by an express train  poor old fellow said i the only comfort i can offer him is what i take myselfthat this sad world will last out our time at least now for the next  the next is more concise and spicy said my wife i will read it    christopher crowfield esq    sirif you want to know how american women are to be brought   back to family work i can tell you a short method pay them as   good wages for it as they can make in any other way i get from   seven to nine dollars a week in a shop where i work if i could   make the same in any good family i should have no objection to   doing it    your obedient servant    letitia  my correspondent letitia does not tell me said i how much of this seven or nine dollars she pays out for board and washing fire and lights if she worked in a good family at two or three dollars a week it is easily demonstrable that at the present cost of these items she would make as much clear profit as she now does at nine dollars for her shopwork  and there are two other things moreover which she does not consider first that besides board washing fuel and lights which she would have in a family she would have also less unintermitted toil shopwork exacts its ten hours per diem and it makes no allowance for sickness or accident  a good domestic in a good family finds many hours when she can feel free to attend to her own affairs her work consists of certain definite matters which being done her time is her own and if she have skill and address in the management of her duties she may secure many leisure hours as houses are now built and with the many laborsaving conveniences that are being introduced the physical labor of housework is no more than a healthy woman really needs to keep her in health in case however of those slight illnesses to which all are more or less liable and which if neglected often lead to graver ones the advantage is still on the side of domestic service in the shop and factory every hour of unemployed time is deducted an illness of a day or two is an appreciable loss of just so much money while the expense of board is still going on but in the family a good servant is always considered when ill she is carefully nursed as one of the family has the family physician and is subject to no deduction from her wages for loss of time i have known more than one instance in which a valued domestic has been sent at her employers expense to the seaside or some other pleasant locality for change of air when her health has been run down  in the second place family work is more remunerative even at a lower rate of wages than shop or factory work because it is better for the health all sorts of sedentary employment pursued by numbers of persons together in one apartment are more or less debilitating and unhealthy through foul air and confinement  a womans health is her capital in certain ways of work she obtains more income but she spends on her capital to do it in another way she may get less income and yet increase her capital a woman cannot work at dressmaking tailoring or any other sedentary employment ten hours a day year in and out without enfeebling her constitution impairing her eyesight and bringing on a complication of complaints but she can sweep wash cook and do the varied duties of a wellordered house with modern arrangements and grow healthier every year the times in new england when all women did housework a part of every day were the times when all women were healthy at present the heritage of vigorous muscles firm nerves strong backs and cheerful physical life has gone from american women and is taken up by irish women a thrifty young man i have lately heard of married a rosy young irish girl quite to the horror of his mother and sisters but defended himself by the following very conclusive logic if i marry an american girl i must have an irish girl to take care of her and i cannot afford to support both  besides all this there is a third consideration which i humbly commend to my friend letitia the turn of her note speaks her a girl of good common sense with a faculty of hitting the nail square on the head and such a girl must see that nothing is more likely to fall out than that she will some day be married evidently our fair friend is born to rule and at this hour doubtless her foreordained throne and humble servant are somewhere awaiting her  now domestic service is all the while fitting a girl physically mentally and morally for her ultimate vocation and sphereto be a happy wife and to make a happy home but factory work shop work and all employments of that sort are in their nature essentially undomesticentailing the constant necessity of a boardinghouse life and of habits as different as possible from the quiet routine of home the girl who is ten hours on the strain of continued unintermitted toil feels no inclination when evening comes to sit down and darn her stockings or make over her dresses or study any of those multifarious economies which turn a wardrobe to the best account her nervous system is flagging she craves company and excitement and her dull narrow room is deserted for some place of amusement or gay street promenade and who can blame her let any sensible woman who has had experience of shop and factory life recall to her mind the ways and manners in which young girls grow up who leave a fathers roof for a crowded boardinghouse without any supervision of matron or mother and ask whether this is the best school for training young american wives and mothers  doubtless there are discreet and thoughtful women who amid all these difficulties do keep up thrifty womanly habits but they do it by an effort greater than the majority of girls are willing to make and greater than they ought to make to sew or read or study after ten hours of factory or shop work is a further drain on the nervous powers which no woman can long endure without exhaustion  when the time arrives that such a girl comes to a house of her own she comes to it as unskilled in all household lore with muscles as incapable of domestic labor and nerves as sensitive as if she had been leading the most luxurious donothing fashionable life how different would be her preparation had the forming years of her life been spent in the labors of a family i know at this moment a lady at the head of a rich country establishment filling her station in society with dignity and honor who gained her domestic education in a kitchen in our vicinity she was the daughter of a small farmer and when the time came for her to be earning her living her parents wisely thought it far better that she should gain it in a way which would at the same time establish her health and fit her for her own future home in a cheerful light airy kitchen which was kept so tidy always as to be an attractive sittingroom she and another young country girl were trained up in the best of domestic economies by a mistress who looked well to the ways of her household till at length they married from the house with honor and went to practice in homes of their own the lessons they had learned in the home of another formerly in new england such instances were not uncommon would that they might become so again  the fact is said my wife the places which the daughters of american farmers used to occupy in our families are now taken by young girls from the families of small farmers in ireland they are respectable tidy healthy and capable of being taught a good mistress who is reasonable and liberal in her treatment is able to make them fixtures they get good wages and have few expenses they dress handsomely have abundant leisure to take care of their clothes and turn their wardrobes to the best account and they very soon acquire skill in doing it equal to that displayed by any women of any country they remit money continually to relatives in ireland and from time to time pay the passage of one and another to this countryand whole families have thus been established in american life by the efforts of one young girl now for my part i do not grudge my irish fellow citizens these advantages obtained by honest labor and good conduct they deserve all the good fortune thus accruing to them but when i see sickly nervous american women jostling and struggling in the few crowded avenues which are open to mere brain i cannot help thinking how much better their lot would have been with good strong bodies steady nerves healthy digestion and the habit of looking any kind of work in the face which used to be characteristic of american women generally and of yankee women in particular  the matter becomes still graver said i by the laws of descent the woman who enfeebles her muscular system by sedentary occupation and overstimulates her brain and nervous system when she becomes a mother perpetuates these evils to her offspring her children will be born feeble and delicate incapable of sustaining any severe strain of body or mind the universal cry now about the ill health of young american girls is the fruit of some three generations of neglect of physical exercise and undue stimulus of brain and nerves young girls now are universally born delicate the most careful hygienic treatment during childhood the strictest attention to diet dress and exercise succeeds merely so far as to produce a girl who is healthy so long only as she does nothing with the least strain her delicate organism gives out now here now there she cannot study without her eyes fail or she has headacheshe cannot get up her own muslins or sweep a room or pack a trunk without bringing on a backacheshe goes to a concert or a lecture and must lie by all the next day from the exertion if she skates she is sure to strain some muscle or if she falls and strikes her knee or hits her ankle a blow that a healthy girl would forget in five minutes terminates in some mysterious lameness which confines our poor sibyl for months  the young american girl of our times is a creature who has not a particle of vitality to spareno reserved stock of force to draw upon in cases of family exigency she is exquisitely strung she is cultivated she is refined but she is too nervous too wiry too sensitiveshe burns away too fast only the easiest of circumstances the most watchful of care and nursing can keep her within the limits of comfortable health and yet this is the creature who must undertake family life in a country where it is next to an absolute impossibility to have permanent domestics frequent change occasional entire breakdowns must be the lot of the majority of housekeepersparticularly those who do not live in cities  in fact said my wife we in america have so far got out of the way of a womanhood that has any vigor of outline or opulence of physical proportions that when we see a woman made as a woman ought to be she strikes us as a monster our willowy girls are afraid of nothing so much as growing stout and if a young lady begins to round into proportions like the women in titians and giorgiones pictures she is distressed above measure and begins to make secret inquiries into reducing diet and to cling desperately to the strongest corsetlacing as her only hope it would require one to be better educated than most of our girls are to be willing to look like the sistine madonna or the venus of milo  once in a while our italian operasingers bring to our shores those glorious physiques which formed the inspiration of italian painters and then american editors make coarse jokes about barnums fat woman and avalanches and pretend to be struck with terror at such dimensions  we should be better instructed and consider that italy does us a favor in sending us specimens not only of higher styles of musical art but of a warmer richer and more abundant womanly life the magnificent voice is only in keeping with the magnificent proportions of the singer a voice which has no grate no strain which flows without effortwhich does not labor eagerly up to a high note but alights on it like a bird from above there carelessly warbling and trillinga voice which then without effort sinks into broad rich sombre depths of soft heavy chesttonecan come only with a physical nature at once strong wide and finefrom a nature such as the sun of italy ripens as he does her golden grapes filling it with the new wine of song  well said i so much for our strictures on miss letitias letter what comes next  here is a correspondent who answers the question what shall we do with herapropos of the case of the distressed young woman which we considered in our first chapter  and what does he recommend  he tells us that he should advise us to make our distressed woman mariannes housekeeper and to send south for three or four contrabands for her to train and with great apparent complacency seems to think that course will solve all similar cases of difficulty  thats quite a mans view of the subject said jenny they think any woman who isnt particularly fitted to do anything else can keep house  as if housekeeping were not the very highest craft and mystery of social life said i i admit that our sex speak too unadvisedly on such topics and being well instructed by my household priestesses will humbly suggest the following ideas to my correspondent  1st a woman is not of course fit to be a housekeeper because she is a woman of good education and refinement  2d if she were a family with young children in it is not the proper place to establish a school for untaught contrabands however desirable their training may be  a woman of good education and good common sense may learn to be a good housekeeper as she learns any trade by going into a good family and practicing first one and then another branch of the business till finally she shall acquire the comprehensive knowledge to direct all  the next letter i will read    dear mr crowfieldyour papers relating to the domestic problem   have touched upon a difficulty which threatens to become a matter   of life and death with me    i am a young man with good health good courage and good   prospects i have for a young man a fair income and a prospect   of its increase but my business requires me to reside in a   country town near a great manufacturing city the demand for   labor there has made such a drain on the female population of the   vicinity that it seems for a great part of the time impossible   to keep any servants at all and what we can hire are of the   poorest quality and want exorbitant wages my wife was a   welltrained housekeeper and knows perfectly all that pertains to   the care of a family but she has three little children and a   delicate babe only a few weeks old and can any one woman do all   that is needed for such a household something must be trusted to   servants and what is thus trusted brings such confusion and waste   and dirt into our house that the poor woman is constantly   distraught between the disgust of having them and the utter   impossibility of doing without them    now it has been suggested that we remedy the trouble by paying   higher wages but i find that for the very highest wages i secure   only the most miserable service and yet poor as it is we are   obliged to put up with it because there is an amount of work to   be done in our family that is absolutely beyond my wifes   strength    i see her health wearing away under these trials her life made a   burden i feel no power to help her and i ask you mr crowfield   what are we to do what is to become of family life in this   country    yours truly    a young family man  my friends letter said i touches upon the very hinge of the difficulty of domestic life with the present generation  the real vital difficulty after all in our american life is that our country is so wide so various so abounding in the richest fields of enterprise that in every direction the cry is of the plenteousness of the harvest and the fewness of the laborers in short there really are not laborers enough to do the work of the country  since the war has thrown the whole south open to the competition of free labor the demand for workers is doubled and trebled manufactories of all sorts are enlarging their borders increasing their machinery and calling for more hands every article of living is demanded with an imperativeness and over an extent of territory which set at once additional thousands to the task of production instead of being easier to find hands to execute in all branches of useful labor it is likely to grow every year more difficult as new departments of manufacture and trade divide the workers the price of labor even now higher in this country than in any other will rise still higher and thus complicate still more the problem of domestic life even if a reasonable quota of intelligent women choose domestic service the demand will be increasingly beyond the supply  and what have you to say to this said my wife seeing you cannot stop the prosperity of the country  simply thisthat communities will be driven to organize as they now do in europe to lessen the labors of individual families by having some of the present domestic tasks done out of the house  in france for example no housekeeper counts either washing ironing or breadmaking as part of her domestic cares all the family washing goes out to a laundry and being attended to by those who make that department of labor a specialty it comes home in refreshingly beautiful order  we in america though we pride ourselves on our yankee thrift are far behind the french in domestic economy if all the families of a neighborhood should put together the sums they separately spend in buying or fitting up and keeping in repair tubs boilers and other accommodations for washing all that is consumed or wasted in soap starch bluing fuel together with the wages and board of an extra servant the aggregate would suffice to fit up a neighborhood laundry where one or two capable women could do easily and well what ten or fifteen women now do painfully and ill and to the confusion and derangement of all other family processes  the model laundries for the poor in london had facilities which would enable a woman to do both the washing and ironing of a small family in from two to three hours and were so arranged that a very few women could with ease do the work of a neighborhood  but in the absence of an establishment of this sort the housekeepers of a country village might help themselves very much by owning a mangle in common to which all the heavier parts of the ironing could be sent american ingenuity has greatly improved the machinery of the mangle it is no longer the heavy cumbersome structure that it used to be in the old world but a compact neat piece of apparatus made in three or four different sizes to suit differentsized apartments  mr h f bond of waltham massachusetts now manufactures these articles and sends them to all parts of the country the smallest of them does not take up much more room than a sewingmachine can be turned by a boy of ten or twelve and thus in the course of an hour or two the heaviest and most fatiguing part of a family ironing may be accomplished  i should certainly advise the young family man with a delicate wife and uncertain domestic help to fortify his kitchen with one of these fixtures  but after all i still say that the quarter to which i look for the solution of the american problem of domestic life is a wise use of the principle of association  the future model village of new england as i see it shall have for the use of its inhabitants not merely a town lyceum hall and a town library but a town laundry fitted up with conveniences such as no private house can afford and paying a price to the operators which will enable them to command an excellence of work such as private families seldom realize it will also have a town bakery where the best of family bread white brown and of all grains shall be compounded and lastly a town cookshop where soup and meats may be bought ready for the table those of us who have kept house abroad remember the ease with which our foreign establishments were carried on a suite of elegant apartments a courier and one female servant were the foundation of domestic life our courier boarded us at a moderate expense and the servant took care of our rooms punctually at the dinner hour every day our dinner came in on the head of a porter from a neighboring cookshop a large chest lined with tin and kept warm by a tiny charcoal stove in the centre being deposited in an anteroom from it came forth first soup then fish then roasts of various names and lastly pastry and confectionsfar more courses than any reasonable christian needs to keep him in healthy condition and dinner being over our box with its d√©bris went out of the house leaving a clear field  now i put it to the distressed young family man whether these three institutions of a bakery a cookshop and a laundry in the village where he lives would not virtually annihilate his household cares and restore peace and comfort to his now distracted family  there really is no more reason why every family should make its own bread than its own butterwhy every family should do its own washing and ironing than its own tailoring or mantuamaking in france where certainly the arts of economy are well studied there is some specialty for many domestic needs for which we keep servants the beautiful inlaid floors are kept waxed and glossy by a professional gentleman who wears a brush on his footsole skates gracefully over the surface and leaving all right departeth many families each paying a small sum keep this servant in common  now if ever there was a community which needed to study the art of living it is our american one for at present domestic life is so wearing and so oppressive as seriously to affect health and happiness whatever has been done abroad in the way of comfort and convenience can be done here and the first neighborhood that shall set the example of dividing the tasks and burdens of life by the judicious use of the principle of association will initiate a most important step in the way of national happiness and prosperity  my solution then of the domestic problem may be formulized as follows  1st that women make self helpfulness and family helpfulness fashionable and every woman use her muscles daily in enough household work to give her a good digestion  2d that the situation of a domestic be made so respectable and respected that welleducated american women shall be induced to take it as a trainingschool for their future family life  3d that families by association lighten the multifarious labors of the domestic sphere  all of which i humbly submit to the good sense and enterprise of american readers and workers     vi  bodily religion a sermon on good health   one of our recent writers has said that good health is physical religion and it is a saying worthy to be printed in golden letters but good health being physical religion it fully shares that indifference with which the human race regards things confessedly the most important the neglect of the soul is the trite theme of all religious teachers and next to their souls there is nothing that people neglect so much as their bodies every person ought to be perfectly healthy just as everybody ought to be perfectly religious but in point of fact the greater part of mankind are so far from perfect moral or physical religion that they cannot even form a conception of the blessing beyond them  the mass of good wellmeaning christians are not yet advanced enough to guess at the change which a perfect fidelity to christs spirit and precepts would produce in them and the majority of people who call themselves well because they are not at present upon any particular doctors list are not within sight of what perfect health would be that fullness of life that vigorous tone and that elastic cheerfulness which make the mere fact of existence a luxury that suppleness which carries one like a wellbuilt boat over every wave of unfavorable chancethese are attributes of the perfect health seldom enjoyed we see them in young children in animals and now and then but rarely in some adult human being who has preserved intact the religion of the body through all opposing influences perfect health supposes not a state of mere quiescence but of positive enjoyment in living see that little fellow as his nurse turns him out in the morning fresh from his bath his hair newly curled and his cheeks polished like apples every step is a spring or a dance he runs he laughs he shouts his face breaks into a thousand dimpling smiles at a word his breakfast of plain bread and milk is swallowed with an eager and incredible delightit is so good that he stops to laugh or thump the table now and then in expression of his ecstasy all day long he runs and frisks and plays and when at night the little head seeks the pillow down go the eyecurtains and sleep comes without a dream in the morning his first note is a laugh and a crow as he sits up in his crib and tries to pull papas eyes open with his fat fingers he is an embodied joyhe is sunshine and music and laughter for all the house with what a magnificent generosity does the author of life endow a little mortal pilgrim in giving him at the outset of his career such a body as this how miserable it is to look forward twenty years when the same child now grown a man wakes in the morning with a dull heavy head the consequence of smoking and studying till twelve or one the night before when he rises languidly to a late breakfast and turns from this and tries thatwants a deviled bone or a cutlet with worcestershire sauce to make eating possible and then with slow and plodding step finds his way to his office and his books verily the shades of the prisonhouse gather round the growing boy for surely no one will deny that life often begins with health little less perfect than that of the angels  but the man who habitually wakes sodden headachy and a little stupid and who needs a cup of strong coffee and various stimulating condiments to coax his bodily system into something like fair working order does not suppose he is out of health he says very well i thank you to your inquiriesmerely because he has entirely forgotten what good health is he is well not because of any particular pleasure in physical existence but well simply because he is not a subject for prescriptions yet there is no store of vitality no buoyancy no superabundant vigor to resist the strain and pressure to which life puts him a checked perspiration a draught of air illtimed a crisis of perplexing business or care and he is down with a bilious attack or an influenza and subject to doctors orders for an indefinite period and if the case be so with men how is it with women how many women have at maturity the keen appetite the joyous love of life and motion the elasticity and sense of physical delight in existence that little children have how many have any superabundance of vitality with which to meet the wear and strain of life and yet they call themselves well  but is it possible in maturity to have the joyful fullness of the life of childhood experience has shown that the delicious freshness of this dawning hour may be preserved even to midday and may be brought back and restored after it has been for years a stranger nature though a severe disciplinarian is still in many respects most patient and easy to be entreated and meets any repentant movement of her prodigal children with wonderful condescension take bulwers account of the first few weeks of his sojourn at malvern and you will read in very elegant english the story of an experience of pleasure which has surprised and delighted many a patient at a watercure the return to the great primitive elements of healthwater air and simple food with a regular system of exercisehas brought to many a jaded weary worndown human being the elastic spirits the simple eager appetite the sound sleep of a little child hence the rude huts and ch√¢lets of the peasant priessnitz were crowded with battered dukes and princesses and notables of every degree who came from the hot enervating luxury which had drained them of existence to find a keener pleasure in peasants bread under peasants roofs than in soft raiment and palaces no arts of french cookery can possibly make anything taste so well to a feeble and palled appetite as plain brown bread and milk taste to a hungry watercure patient fresh from bath and exercise  if the watercure had done nothing more than establish the fact that the glow and joyousness of early life are things which may be restored after having been once wasted it would have done a good work for if nature is so forgiving to those who have once lost or have squandered her treasures what may not be hoped for us if we can learn the art of never losing the first health of childhood and though with us who have passed to maturity it may be too late for the blessing cannot something be done for the children who are yet to come after us  why is the first health of childhood lost is it not the answer that childhood is the only period of life in which bodily health is made a prominent object take our pretty boy with cheeks like apples who started in life with a hop skip and danceto whom laughter was like breathing and who was enraptured with plain bread and milkhow did he grow into the man who wakes so languid and dull who wants strong coffee and worcestershire sauce to make his breakfast go down when and where did he drop the invaluable talisman that once made everything look brighter and taste better to him however rude and simple than now do the most elaborate combinations what is the boys history why for the first seven years of his life his body is made of some account it is watched cared for dieted disciplined fed with fresh air and left to grow and develop like a thrifty plant but from the time school education begins the body is steadily ignored and left to take care of itself  the boy is made to sit six hours a day in a close hot room breathing impure air putting the brain and the nervous system upon a constant strain while the muscular system is repressed to an unnatural quiet during the six hours perhaps twenty minutes are allowed for all that play of the muscles which up to this time has been the constant habit of his life after this he is sent home with books slate and lessons to occupy an hour or two more in preparing for the next day in the whole of this time there is no kind of effort to train the physical system by appropriate exercise something of the sort was attempted years ago in the infant schools but soon given up and now from the time study first begins the muscles are ignored in all primary schools one of the first results is the loss of that animal vigor which formerly made the boy love motion for its own sake even in his leisure hours he no longer leaps and runs as he used to he learns to sit still and by and by sitting and lounging come to be the habit and vigorous motion the exception for most of the hours of the day the education thus begun goes on from primary to high school from high school to college from college through professional studies of law medicine or theology with this steady contempt for the body with no provision for its culture training or development but rather a direct and evident provision for its deterioration and decay  the want of suitable ventilation in schoolrooms recitationrooms lecturerooms offices courtrooms conferencerooms and vestries where young students of law medicine and theology acquire their earlier practice is something simply appalling of itself it would answer for men the question why so many thousand glad active children come to a middle life without joya life whose best estate is a sort of slow plodding endurance the despite and hatred which most men seem to feel for gods gift of fresh air and their resolution to breathe as little of it as possible could only come from a long course of education in which they have been accustomed to live without it let any one notice the conduct of our american people traveling in railroad cars we will suppose that about half of them are what might be called welleducated people who have learned in books or otherwise that the air breathed from the lungs is laden with impuritiesthat it is noxious and poisonous and yet travel with these people half a day and you would suppose from their actions that they considered the external air as a poison created expressly to injure them and that the only course of safety lay in keeping the cars hermetically sealed and breathing over and over the vapor from each others lungs if a person in despair at the intolerable foulness raises a window what frowns from all the neighboring seats especially from great roughcoated men who always seem the first to be apprehensive the request to put down that window is almost sure to follow a moment or two of fresh air in vain have rows of ventilators been put in the tops of some of the cars for conductors and passengers are both of one mind that these ventilators are inlets of danger and must be kept carefully closed  railroad traveling in america is systematically and one would think carefully arranged so as to violate every possible law of health the old rule to keep the head cool and the feet warm is precisely reversed a redhot stove heats the upper stratum of air to oppression while a stream of cold air is constantly circulating about the lower extremities the most indigestible and unhealthy substances conceivable are generally sold in the cars or at waystations for the confusion and distress of the stomach rarely can a traveler obtain so innocent a thing as a plain good sandwich of bread and meat while pie cake doughnuts and all other culinary atrocities are almost forced upon him at every stoppingplace in france england and germany the railroad cars are perfectly ventilated the feet are kept warm by flat cases filled with hot water and covered with carpet and answering the double purpose of warming the feet and diffusing an agreeable temperature through the car without burning away the vitality of the air while the arrangements at the refreshmentrooms provide for the passenger as wholesome and wellserved a meal of healthy nutritious food as could be obtained in any home circle  what are we to infer concerning the home habits of a nation of men who so resignedly allow their bodies to be poisoned and maltreated in traveling over such an extent of territory as is covered by our railroad lines does it not show that foul air and improper food are too much matters of course to excite attention as a writer in the nation has lately remarked it is simply and only because the american nation like to have unventilated cars and to be fed on pie and coffee at stoppingplaces that nothing better is known to our travelers if there were any marked dislike of such a state of things on the part of the people it would not exist we have wealth enough and enterprise enough and ingenuity enough in our american nation to compass with wonderful rapidity any end that really seems to us desirable an army was improvised when an army was wantedand an army more perfectly equipped more bountifully fed than so great a body of men ever was before hospitals sanitary commissions and christian commissions all arose out of the simple conviction of the american people that they must arise if the american people were equally convinced that foul air was a poisonthat to have cold feet and hot heads was to invite an attack of illnessthat maplesugar popcorn peppermint candy pie doughnuts and peanuts are not diet for reasonable beingsthey would have railroad accommodations very different from those now in existence  we have spoken of the foul air of courtrooms what better illustration could be given of the utter contempt with which the laws of bodily health are treated than the condition of these places our lawyers are our highly educated men they have been through highschool and college training they have learned the properties of oxygen nitrogen and carbonicacid gas and have seen a mouse die under an exhausted receiver and of course they know that foul unventilated rooms are bad for the health and yet generation after generation of men so taught and trained will spend the greater part of their lives in rooms notorious for their close and impure air without so much as an attempt to remedy the evil a wellventilated courtroom is a fourleaved clover among courtrooms young men are constantly losing their health at the bar lung diseases dyspepsia follow them up gradually sapping their vitality some of the brightest ornaments of the profession have actually fallen dead as they stood pleadingvictims of the fearful pressure of poisonous and heated air upon the excited brain the deaths of salmon p chase of portland uncle of our present chief justice and of ezekiel webster the brother of our great statesman are memorable examples of the calamitous effects of the errors dwelt upon and yet strange to say nothing efficient is done to mend these errors and give the body an equal chance with the mind in the pressure of the worlds affairs  but churches lecturerooms and vestries and all buildings devoted especially to the good of the soul are equally witness of the minds disdain of the bodys needs and the bodys consequent revenge upon the soul in how many of these places has the question of a thorough provision of fresh air been even considered people would never think of bringing a thousand persons into a desert place and keeping them there without making preparations to feed them bread and butter potatoes and meat must plainly be found for them but a thousand human beings are put into a building to remain a given number of hours and no one asks the question whether means exist for giving each one the quantum of fresh air needed for his circulation and these thousand victims will consent to be slowly poisoned gasping sweating getting red in the face with confused and sleepy brains while a minister with a yet redder face and a more oppressed brain struggles and wrestles through the hot seething vapors to make clear to them the mysteries of faith how many churches are there that for six or eight months in the year are never ventilated at all except by the accidental opening of doors the foul air generated by one congregation is locked up by the sexton for the use of the next assembly and so gathers and gathers from week to week and month to month while devout persons upbraid themselves and are ready to tear their hair because they always feel stupid and sleepy in church the proper ventilation of their churches and vestries would remove that spiritual deadness of which their prayers and hymns complain a man hoeing his corn out on a breezy hillside is bright and alert his mind works clearly and he feels interested in religion and thinks of many a thing that might be said at the prayermeeting at night but at night when he sits down in a little room where the air reeks with the vapor of his neighbors breath and the smoke of kerosene lamps he finds himself suddenly dull and drowsywithout emotion without thought without feelingand he rises and reproaches himself for this state of things he calls upon his soul and all that is within him to bless the lord but the indignant body abused insulted ignored takes the soul by the throat and says if you wont let me have a good time neither shall you revivals of religion with ministers and with those people whose moral organization leads them to take most interest in them often end in periods of bodily ill health and depression but is there any need of this suppose that a revival of religion required as a formula that all the members of a given congregation should daily take a minute dose of arsenic in concertwe should not be surprised after a while to hear of various ill effects therefrom and as vestries and lecturerooms are now arranged a daily prayermeeting is often nothing more nor less than a number of persons spending half an hour a day breathing poison from each others lungs there is not only no need of this but on the contrary a good supply of pure air would make the daily prayermeeting far more enjoyable the body if allowed the slightest degree of fair play so far from being a contumacious infidel and opposer becomes a very fair christian helper and instead of throttling the soul gives it wings to rise to celestial regions  this branch of our subject we will quit with one significant anecdote a certain rural church was somewhat famous for its picturesque gothic architecture and equally famous for its sleepy atmosphere the rules of gothic symmetry requiring very small windows which could be only partially opened everybody was affected alike in this church minister and people complained that it was like the enchanted ground in the pilgrims progress do what they would sleep was ever at their elbows the blue red and green of the painted windows melted into a rainbow dimness of hazy confusion and ere they were aware they were off on a cloud to the land of dreams  an energetic sister in the church suggested the inquiry whether it was ever ventilated and discovered that it was regularly locked up at the close of service and remained so till opened for the next week she suggested the inquiry whether giving the church a thorough airing on saturday would not improve the sunday services but nobody acted on her suggestion finally she borrowed the sextons key one saturday night and went into the church and opened all the windows herself and let them remain so for the night the next day everybody remarked the improved comfort of the church and wondered what had produced the change nevertheless when it was discovered it was not deemed a matter of enough importance to call for an order on the sexton to perpetuate the improvement  the ventilation of private dwellings in this country is such as might be expected from that entire indifference to the laws of health manifested in public establishments let a person travel in private conveyance up through the valley of the connecticut and stop for a night at the taverns which he will usually find at the end of each days stage the bedchamber into which he will be ushered will be the concentration of all forms of bad air the house is redolent of the vegetables in the cellarcabbages turnips and potatoes and this fragrance is confined and retained by the custom of closing the window blinds and dropping the inside curtains so that neither air nor sunshine enters in to purify add to this the strong odor of a new feather bed and pillows and you have a combination of perfumes most appalling to a delicate sense yet travelers take possession of these rooms sleep in them all night without raising the window or opening the blinds and leave them to be shut up for other travelers  the spare chamber of many dwellings seems to be an hermetically closed box opened only twice a year for spring and fall cleaning but for the rest of the time closed to the sun and the air of heaven thrifty country housekeepers often adopt the custom of making their beds on the instant after they are left without airing the sheets and mattresses and a bed so made gradually becomes permeated with the insensible emanations of the human body so as to be a steady corrupter of the atmosphere  in the winter the windows are calked and listed the throat of the chimney built up with a tight brick wall and a close stove is introduced to help burn out the vitality of the air in a sittingroom like this from five to ten persons will spend about eight months of the year with no other ventilation than that gained by the casual opening and shutting of doors is it any wonder that consumption every year sweeps away its thousandsthat people are suffering constant chronic ailmentsneuralgia nervous dyspepsia and all the host of indefinite bad feelings that rob life of sweetness and flower and bloom  a recent writer raises the inquiry whether the community would not gain in health by the demolition of all dwellinghouses that is he suggests the question whether the evils from foul air are not so great and so constant that they countervail the advantages of shelter consumptive patients far gone have been known to be cured by long journeys which have required them to be day and night in the open air sleep under the open heaven even though the person be exposed to the various accidents of weather has often proved a miraculous restorer after everything else had failed but surely if simple fresh air is so healing and preserving a thing some means might be found to keep the air in a house just as pure and vigorous as it is outside  an article in the may number of harpers magazine presents drawings of a very simple arrangement by which any house can be made thoroughly selfventilating ventilation as this article shows consists in two thingsa perfect and certain expulsion from the dwelling of all foul air breathed from the lungs or arising from any other cause and the constant supply of pure air  one source of foul air cannot be too much guarded againstwe mean imperfect gaspipes a want of thoroughness in execution is the sin of our american artisans and very few gasfixtures are so thoroughly made that more or less gas does not escape and mingle with the air of the dwelling there are parlors where plants cannot be made to live because the gas kills them and yet their occupants do not seem to reflect that an air in which a plant cannot live must be dangerous for a human being the very clemency and longsuffering of nature to those who persistently violate her laws is one great cause why men are physically speaking such sinners as they are if foul air poisoned at once and completely we should have wellventilated houses whatever else we failed to have but because people can go on for weeks months and years breathing poisons and slowly and imperceptibly lowering the tone of their vital powers and yet be what they call pretty well i thank you sermons on ventilation and fresh air go by them as an idle song i dont see but we are well enough and we never took much pains about these things theres air enough gets into houses of course what with doors opening and windows occasionally lifted the air of houses is generally good enoughand so the matter is dismissed  one of heavens great hygienic teachers is now abroad in the world giving lessons on health to the children of men the cholera is like the angel whom god threatened to send as leader to the rebellious israelites beware of him obey his voice and provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions the advent of this fearful messenger seems really to be made necessary by the contempt with which men treat the physical laws of their being what else could have purified the dark places of new york what a wipingup and reforming and cleansing is going before him through the country at last we find that nature is in earnest and that her laws cannot be always ignored with impunity poisoned air is recognized at last as an evileven although the poison cannot be weighed measured or tasted and if all the precautions that men are now willing to take could be made perpetual the alarm would be a blessing to the world  like the principles of spiritual religion the principles of physical religion are few and easy to be understood an old medical apothegm personifies the hygienic forces as the doctors air diet exercise and quiet and these four will be found on reflection to cover the whole ground of what is required to preserve human health a human being whose lungs have always been nourished by pure air whose stomach has been fed only by appropriate food whose muscles have been systematically trained by appropriate exercises and whose mind is kept tranquil by faith in god and a good conscience has perfect physical religion there is a line where physical religion must necessarily overlap spiritual religion and rest upon it no human being can be assured of perfect health through all the strain and wear and tear of such cares and such perplexities as life brings without the rest of faith in god an unsubmissive unconfiding unresigned soul will make vain the best hygienic treatment and on the contrary the most saintly religious resolution and purpose may be defeated and vitiated by an habitual ignorance and disregard of the laws of the physical system  perfect spiritual religion cannot exist without perfect physical religion every flaw and defect in the bodily system is just so much taken from the spiritual vitality we are commanded to glorify god not simply in our spirits but in our bodies and spirits the only example of perfect manhood the world ever saw impresses us more than anything else by an atmosphere of perfect healthiness there is a calmness a steadiness in the character of jesus a naturalness in his evolution of the sublimest truths under the strain of the most absorbing and intense excitement that could come only from the one perfectly trained and developed body bearing as a pure and sacred shrine the one perfect spirit jesus of nazareth journeying on foot from city to city always calm yet always fervent always steady yet glowing with a white heat of sacred enthusiasm able to walk and teach all day and afterwards to continue in prayer all night with unshaken nerves sedately patient serenely reticent perfectly selfcontrolled walked the earth the only man that perfectly glorified god in his body no less than in his spirit it is worthy of remark that in choosing his disciples he chose plain men from the laboring classes who had lived the most obediently to the simple unperverted laws of nature he chose men of good and pure bodiessimple natural childlike healthy menand baptized their souls with the inspiration of the holy spirit  the hygienic bearings of the new testament have never been sufficiently understood the basis of them lies in the solemn declaration that our bodies are to be temples of the holy spirit and that all abuse of them is of the nature of sacrilege reverence for the physical system as the outward shrine and temple of the spiritual is the peculiarity of the christian religion the doctrine of the resurrection of the body and its physical immortality sets the last crown of honor upon it that bodily system which god declared worthy to be gathered back from the dust of the grave and recreated as the souls immortal companion must necessarily be dear and precious in the eyes of its creator the one passage in the new testament in which it is spoken of disparagingly is where paul contrasts it with the brighter glory of what is to come he shall change our vile bodies that they may be fashioned like his glorious body from this passage has come abundance of reviling of the physical system memoirs of good men are full of abuse of it as the clog the load the burden the chain it is spoken of as pollution as corruptionin short one would think that the creator had imitated the cruelty of some oriental despots who have been known to chain a festering corpse to a living body accordingly the memoirs of these pious men are also mournful records of slow suicide wrought by the persistent neglect of the most necessary and important laws of the bodily system and the body outraged and downtrodden has turned traitor to the soul and played the adversary with fearful power who can tell the countless temptations to evil which flow in from a neglected disordered deranged nervous systemtemptations to anger to irritability to selfishness to every kind of sin of appetite and passion no wonder that the poor soul longs for the hour of release from such a companion  but that human body which god declares expressly was made to be the temple of the holy spirit which he considers worthy to be perpetuated by a resurrection and an immortal existence cannot be intended to be a clog and a hindrance to spiritual advancement a perfect body working in perfect tune and time would open glimpses of happiness to the soul approaching the joys we hope for in heaven it is only through the images of things which our bodily senses have taught us that we can form any conception of that future bliss and the more perfect these senses the more perfect our conceptions must be  the conclusion of the whole matter and the practical application of this sermon isfirst that all men set themselves to form the idea of what perfect health is and resolve to realize it for themselves and their children second that with a view to this they study the religion of the body in such simple and popular treatises as those of george combe dr dio lewis and others and with simple and honest hearts practice what they there learn third that the training of the bodily system should form a regular part of our commonschool educationevery common school being provided with a wellinstructed teacher of gymnastics and the growth and development of each pupils body being as much noticed and marked as is now the growth of his mind the same course should be continued and enlarged in colleges and female seminaries which should have professors of hygiene appointed to give thorough instruction concerning the laws of health  and when this is all done we may hope that crooked spines pimpled faces sallow complexions stooping shoulders and all other signs indicating an undeveloped physical vitality will in the course of a few generations disappear from the earth and men will have bodies which will glorify god their great architect  the soul of man has got as far as it can without the body religion herself stops and looks back waiting for the body to overtake her the souls great enemy and hindrance can be made her best friend and most powerful help and it is high time that this era were begun we old sinners who have lived carelessly and almost spent our day of grace may not gain much of its good but the childrenshall there not be a more perfect day for them shall there not come a day when the little child whom christ set forth to his disciples as the type of the greatest in the kingdom of heaven shall be the type no less of our physical than our spiritual advancementwhen men and women shall arise keeping through long and happy lives the simple unperverted appetites the joyous freshness of spirit the keen delight in mere existence the dreamless sleep and happy waking of early childhood     vii  how shall we entertain our company   the fact is said marianne we must have a party bob dont like to hear of it but it must come we are in debt to everybody we have been invited everywhere and never had anything like a party since we were married and it wont do  for my part i hate parties said bob they put your house all out of order give all the women a sickheadache and all the men an indigestion you never see anybody to any purpose the girls look bewitched and the women answer you at crosspurposes and call you by the name of your nextdoor neighbor in their agitation of mind we stay out beyond our usual bedtime come home and find some baby crying or child who has been sitting up till nobody knows when and the next morning when i must be at my office by eight and wife must attend to her children we are sleepy and headachy i protest against making overtures to entrap some hundred of my respectable married friends into this snare which has so often entangled me if i had my way i would never go to another party and as to giving onei suppose since my empress has declared her intentions that i shall be brought into doing it but it shall be under protest  but you see we must keep up society said marianne  but i insist on it said bob it isnt keeping up society what earthly thing do you learn about people by meeting them in a general crush where all are coming going laughing talking and looking at each other no person of common sense ever puts forth any idea he cares twopence about under such circumstances all that is exchanged is a certain set of commonplaces and platitudes which people keep for parties just as they do their kid gloves and finery now there are our neighbors the browns when they drop in of an evening she knitting and he with the last article in the paper she really comes out with a great deal of fresh lively earnest original talk we have a good time and i like her so much that it quite verges on loving but see her in a party when she manifests herself over five or six flounces of pink silk and a perfect eggfroth of tulle her head adorned with a thicket of cr√™ped hair and roses and it is plain at first view that talking with her is quite out of the question what has been done to her head on the outside has evidently had some effect within for she is no longer the mrs brown you knew in her everyday dress but mrs brown in a party state of mind and too distracted to think of anything in particular she has a few words that she answers to everything you say as for example oh very certainly how extraordinary so happy to etc the fact is that she has come into a state in which any real communication with her mind and character must be suspended till the party is over and she is rested now i like society which is the reason why i hate parties  but you see said marianne what are we to do everybody cant drop in to spend an evening with you if it were not for these parties there are quantities of your acquaintances whom you would never meet  and of what use is it to meet them do you really know them any better for meeting them got up in unusual dresses and sitting down together when the only thing exchanged is the remark that it is hot or cold or it rains or it is dry or any other patent surfacefact that answers the purpose of making believe you are talking when neither of you is saying a word  well now for my part said marianne i confess i like parties they amuse me i come home feeling kinder and better to people just for the little i see of them when they are all dressed up and in good humor with themselves to be sure we dont say anything very profoundi dont think the most of us have anything profound to say but i ask mrs brown where she buys her lace and she tells me how she washes it and somebody else tells me about her baby and promises me a new sackpattern then i like to see the pretty nice young girls flirting with the nice young men and i like to be dressed up a little myself even if my finery is all old and many times made over it does me good to be rubbed up and brightened  like old silver said bob  yes like old silver precisely and even if i do come home tired it does my mind good to have that change of scene and faces you men do not know what it is to be tied to house and nursery all day and what a perfect weariness and lassitude it often brings on us women for my part i think parties are a beneficial institution of society and that it is worth a good deal of fatigue and trouble to get one up  then theres the expense said bob what earthly need is there of a grand regale of oysters chicken salad icecreams coffee and champagne between eleven and twelve oclock at night when no one of us would ever think of wanting or taking any such articles upon our stomachs in our own homes if we were all of us in the habit of having a regular repast at that hour it might be well enough to enjoy one with our neighbor but the party fare is generally just so much in addition to the honest three meals which we have eaten during the day now to spend from fifty to one two or three hundred dollars in giving all our friends an indigestion from a midnight meal seems to me a very poor investment yet if we once begin to give the party we must have everything that is given at the other parties or wherefore do we live and caterers and waiters rack their brains to devise new forms of expense and extravagance and when the bill comes in one is sure to feel that one is paying a great deal of money for a great deal of nonsense it is in fact worse than nonsense because our dear friends are in half the cases not only no better but a great deal worse for what they have eaten  but there is this advantage to society said rudolphit helps us young physicians what would the physicians do if parties were abolished take all the colds that are caught by our fair friends with low necks and short sleeves all the troubles from dancing in tight dresses and inhaling bad air and all the headaches and indigestion from the m√©lange of lobster salad two or three kinds of icecream cake and coffee on delicate stomachs and our profession gets a degree of encouragement that is worthy to be thought of  but the question arises said my wife whether there are not ways of promoting social feeling less expensive more simple and natural and rational i am inclined to think that there are  yes said theophilus thoro for large parties are not as a general thing given with any wish or intention of really improving our acquaintance with our neighbors in many cases they are openly and avowedly a general tribute paid at intervals to society for and in consideration of which you are to sit with closed blinds and doors and be let alone for the rest of the year mrs bogus for instance lives to keep her house in order her closets locked her silver counted and in the safe and her chinacloset in undisturbed order her best things are put away with such admirable precision in so many wrappings and foldings and secured with so many a twist and twine that to get them out is one of the seven labors of hercules not to be lightly or unadvisedly taken in hand but reverently discreetly and once for all in an annual or biennial party then says mrs bogus for heavens sake lets have every creature we can think of and have em all over with at once for pitys sake lets have no driblets left that we shall have to be inviting to dinner or to tea no matter whether they can come or notonly send them the invitation and our part is done and thank heaven we shall be free for a year  yes said my wife a great standup party bears just the same relation towards the offer of real hospitality and good will as miss sally brasss offer of meat to the little hungry marchioness when with a bit uplifted on the end of a fork she addressed her will you have this piece of meat no well then remember and dont say you havent had meat offered to you you are invited to a general jam at the risk of your life and health and if you refuse dont say you havent had hospitality offered to you all our debts are wiped out and our slate clean now we will have our own closed doors no company and no trouble and our best china shall repose undisturbed on its shelves mrs bogus says she never could exist in the way that mrs easygo does with a constant drip of companytwo or three to breakfast one day half a dozen to dinner the next and little evening gatherings once or twice a week it must keep her house in confusion all the time yet for real social feeling real exchange of thought and opinion there is more of it in one halfhour at mrs easygos than in a dozen of mrs boguss great parties  the fact is that mrs easygo really does like the society of human beings she is genuinely and heartily social and in consequence though she has very limited means and no money to spend in giving great entertainments her domestic establishment is a sort of social exchange where more friendships are formed more real acquaintance made and more agreeable hours spent than in any other place that can be named she never has large partiesgreat general paydays of social debtsbut small wellchosen circles of people selected so thoughtfully with a view to the pleasure which congenial persons give each other as to make the invitation an act of real personal kindness she always manages to have something for the entertainment of her friends so that they are not reduced to the simple alternative of gaping at each others dresses and eating lobster salad and icecream there is either some choice music or a reading of fine poetry or a wellacted charade or a portfolio of photographs and pictures to enliven the hour and start conversation and as the people are skillfully chosen with reference to each other as there is no hurry or heat or confusion conversation in its best sense can bubble up fresh genuine clear and sparkling as a woodland spring and one goes away really rested and refreshed the slight entertainment provided is just enough to enable you to eat salt together in arab fashionnot enough to form the leading feature of the evening a cup of tea and a basket of cake or a salver of ices silently passed at quiet intervals do not interrupt conversation or overload the stomach  the fact is said i that the art of society among us anglosaxons is yet in its rudest stages we are not as a race social and confiding like the french and italians and germans we have a word for home and our home is often a moated grange an island a castle with its drawbridge up cutting us off from all but our own homecircle in france and germany and italy there are the boulevards and public gardens where people do their family living in common mr a is breakfasting under one tree with wife and children around and mr b is breakfasting under another tree hard by and messages nods and smiles pass backward and forward families see each other daily in these public resorts and exchange mutual offices of good will perhaps from these customs of society come that na√Øve simplicity and abandon which one remarks in the continental in opposition to the anglosaxon habits of conversation a frenchman or an italian will talk to you of his feeling and plans and prospects with an unreserve that is perfectly unaccountable to you who have always felt that such things must be kept for the very innermost circle of home privacy but the frenchman or italian has from a child been brought up to pass his family life in places of public resort in constant contact and intercommunion with other families and the social and conversational instinct has thus been daily strengthened hence the reunions of these people have been characterized by a sprightliness and vigor and spirit that the anglosaxon has in vain attempted to seize and reproduce english and american conversazioni have very generally proved a failure from the rooted frozen habit of reticence and reserve which grows with our growth and strengthens with our strength the fact is that the anglosaxon race as a race does not enjoy talking and except in rare instances does not talk well a daily convocation of people without refreshments or any extraneous object but the simple pleasure of seeing and talking with each other is a thing that can scarcely be understood in english or american society social entertainment presupposes in the anglosaxon mind something to eat and not only something but a great deal enormous dinners or great suppers constitute the entertainment nobody seems to have formed the idea that the talkingthe simple exchange of social feelingsis of itself the entertainment and that being together is the pleasure  madame rocamier for years had a circle of friends who met every afternoon in her salon from four to six oclock for the simple and sole pleasure of talking with each other the very first wits and men of letters and statesmen and savans were enrolled in it and each brought to the entertainment some choice morceau which he had laid aside from his own particular field to add to the feast the daily intimacy gave each one such perfect insight into all the others habits of thought tastes and preferences that the conversation was like the celebrated music of the conservatoire in paris a concert of perfectly chorded instruments taught by long habit of harmonious intercourse to keep exact time and tune together  real conversation presupposes intimate acquaintance people must see each other often enough to wear off the rough bark and outside rind of commonplaces and conventionalities in which their real ideas are enwrapped and give forth without reserve their innermost and best feelings now what is called a large party is the first and rudest form of social intercourse the most we can say of it is that it is better than nothing men and women are crowded together like cattle in a pen they look at each other they jostle each other exchange a few common bleatings and eat together and so the performance terminates one may be crushed evening after evening against men or women and learn very little about them you may decide that a lady is goodtempered when any amount of trampling on the skirt of her new silk dress brings no cloud to her brow but is it good temper or only wanton carelessness which cares nothing for waste you can see that a man is not a gentleman who squares his back to ladies at the suppertable and devours boned turkey and pat√© de foie gras while they vainly reach over and around him for something and that another is a gentleman so far as to prefer the care of his weaker neighbors to the immediate indulgence of his own appetites but further than this you learn little sometimes it is true in some secluded corner two people of fine nervous system undisturbed by the general confusion may have a sociable halfhour and really part feeling that they like each other better and know more of each other than before yet these general gatherings have after all their value they are not so good as something better would be but they cannot be wholly dispensed with it is far better that mrs bogus should give an annual party when she takes down all her bedsteads and throws open her whole house than that she should never see her friends and neighbors inside her doors at all she may feel that she has neither the taste nor the talent for constant small reunions such things she may feel require a social tact which she has not she would be utterly at a loss how to conduct them each one would cost her as much anxiety and thought as her annual gathering and prove a failure after all whereas the annual demonstration can be put wholly into the hands of the caterer who comes in force with flowers silver china servants and taking the house into his own hands gives her entertainment for her leaving to her no responsibility but the payment of the bills and if mr bogus does not quarrel with them we know no reason why any one else should and i think mrs bogus merits well of the republic for doing what she can do towards the hospitalities of the season im sure i never cursed her in my heart even when her strong coffee has held mine eyes open till morning and her superlative lobster salads have given me the very darkest views of human life that ever dyspepsia and east wind could engender mrs bogus is the eve who offers the apple but after all i am the foolish adam who take and eat what i know is going to hurt me and i am too gallant to visit my sins on the head of my too obliging tempter in country places in particular where little is going on and life is apt to stagnate a good large generous party which brings the whole neighborhood into one house to have a jolly time to eat drink and be merry is really quite a work of love and mercy people see one another in their best clothes and that is something the elders exchange all manner of simple pleasantries and civilities and talk over their domestic affairs while the young people flirt in that wholesome manner which is one of the safest of youthful follies a country party in fact may be set down as a work of benevolence and the money expended thereon fairly charged to the account of the great cause of peace and good will on earth  but dont you think said my wife that if the charge of providing the entertainment were less laborious these gatherings could be more frequent you see if a woman feels that she must have five kinds of cake and six kinds of preserves and even icecream and jellies in a region where no confectioner comes in to abbreviate her labors she will sit with closed doors and do nothing towards the general exchange of life because she cannot do as much as mrs smith or mrs parsons if the idea of meeting together had some other focal point than eating i think there would be more social feeling it might be a musical reunion where the various young people of a circle agreed to furnish each a song or an instrumental performance it might be an impromptu charade party bringing out something of that taste in arrangement of costume and capacity for dramatic effect of which there is more latent in society than we think it might be the reading of articles in prose and poetry furnished to a common paper or portfolio which would awaken an abundance of interest and speculation on the authorship or it might be dramatic readings and recitations any or all of these pastimes might make an evening so entertaining that a simple cup of tea and a plate of cake or biscuit would be all the refreshment needed  we may with advantage steal a leaf now and then from some foreign book said i in france and italy families have their peculiar days set apart for the reception of friends at their own houses the whole house is put upon a footing of hospitality and invitation and the whole mind is given to receiving the various friends in the evening the salon is filled the guests coming from week to week for years become in time friends the resort has the charm of a home circle there are certain faces that you are always sure to meet there a lady once said to me of a certain gentleman and lady whom she missed from her circle they have been at our house every wednesday evening for twenty years it seems to me that this frequency of meeting is the great secret of agreeable society one sees in our american life abundance of people who are everything that is charming and cultivated but one never sees enough of them one meets them at some quiet reunion passes a delightful hour thinks how charming they are and wishes one could see more of them but the pleasant meeting is like the encounter of two ships in midocean away we sail each on his respective course to see each other no more till the pleasant remembrance has died away yet were there some quiet homelike resort where we might turn in to renew from time to time the pleasant intercourse to continue the last conversation and to compare anew our readings and our experiences the pleasant hour of liking would ripen into a warm friendship  but in order that this may be made possible and practicable the utmost simplicity of entertainment must prevail in a french salon all is to the last degree informal the bouilloire the french teakettle is often tended by one of the gentlemen who aids his fair neighbors in the mysteries of teamaking one nymph is always to be found at the table dispensing tea and talk and a basket of simple biscuit and cakes offered by another is all the further repast the teacups and cakebasket are a real addition to the scene because they cause a little lively social bustle a little chatter and motionalways of advantage in breaking up stiffness and giving occasion for those graceful airy nothings that answer so good a purpose in facilitating acquaintance  nothing can be more charming than the description which edmond about gives in his novel of tolla of the reception evenings of an old noble roman familythe spirit of repose and quietude through all the apartments the ease of coming and going the perfect homelike spirit in which the guests settle themselves to any employment of the hour that best suits them some to lively chat some to dreamy silent lounging some to a game others in a distant apartment to music and others still to a promenade along the terraces  one is often in a state of mind and nerves which indisposes for the effort of active conversation one wishes to rest to observe to be amused without an effort and a mansion which opens wide its hospitable arms and offers itself to you as a sort of home where you may rest and do just as the humor suits you is a perfect godsend at such times you are at home there your ways are understood you can do as you pleasecome early or late be brilliant or dullyou are always welcome if you can do nothing for the social whole tonight it matters not there are many more nights to come in the future and you are entertained on trust without a challenge  i have one frienda man of genius subject to the ebbs and flows of animal spirits which attend that organization of general society he has a nervous horror a regular dinner or evening party is to him a terror an impossibility but there is a quiet parlor where stands a muchworn old sofa and it is his delight to enter without knocking and be found lying with halfshut eyes on this friendly couch while the family life goes on around him without a question nobody is to mind him to tease him with inquiries or salutations if he will he breaks into the stream of conversation and sometimes rousing up from one of these dreamy trances finds himself ere he or they know how in the mood for free and friendly talk people often wonder how do you catch soandso he is so shy i have invited and invited and he never comes we never invite and he comes we take no note of his coming or his going we do not startle his entrance with acclamation nor clog his departure with expostulation it is fully understood that with us he shall do just as he chooses and so he chooses to do much that we like  the sum of this whole doctrine of society is that we are to try the value of all modes and forms of social entertainment by their effect in producing real acquaintance and real friendship and good will the first and rudest form of seeking this is by a great promiscuous party which simply effects thisthat people at least see each other on the outside and eat together next come all those various forms of reunion in which the entertainment consists of something higher than staring and eatingsome exercise of the faculties of the guests in music acting recitation reading etc and these are a great advance because they show people what is in them and thus lay a foundation for a more intelligent appreciation and acquaintance these are the best substitute for the expense show and trouble of large parties they are in their nature more refining and intellectual it is astonishing when people really put together in some one club or association all the different talents for pleasing possessed by different persons how clever a circle may be gatheredin the least promising neighborhood a club of ladies in one of our cities has had quite a brilliant success it is held every fortnight at the houses of the members according to alphabetical sequence the lady who receives has charge of arranging what the entertainment shall bewhether charade tableau reading recitation or music and the interest is much increased by the individual taste shown in the choice of the diversion and the variety which thence follows  in the summertime in the country openair reunions are charming forms of social entertainment croquet parties which bring young people together by daylight for a healthy exercise and end with a moderate share of the evening are a very desirable amusement what are called lawn teas are finding great favor in england and some parts of our country they are simply an early tea enjoyed in a sort of picnic style in the grounds about the house such an entertainment enables one to receive a great many at a time without crowding and being in its very idea rustic and informal can be arranged with very little expense or trouble with the addition of lanterns in the trees and a little music this entertainment may be carried on far into the evening with a very pretty effect  as to dancing i have this much to say of it either our houses must be all built over and made larger or female crinolines must be made smaller or dancing must continue as it now is the most absurd and ungraceful of all attempts at amusement the effort to execute round dances in the limits of modern houses in the prevailing style of dress can only lead to developments more startling than agreeable dancing in the open air on the shaven green of lawns is a pretty and graceful exercise and there only can full sweep be allowed for the present feminine toilet  the english breakfast is an institution growing in favor here and rightfully too for a party of fresh goodnatured welldressed people assembled at breakfast on a summer morning is as nearly perfect a form of reunion as can be devised all are in full strength from their nights rest the hour is fresh and lovely and they are in condition to give each other the very cream of their thoughts the first keen sparkle of the uncorked nervous system the only drawback is that in our busy american life the most desirable gentlemen often cannot spare their morning hours breakfast parties presuppose a condition of leisure but when they can be compassed they are perhaps the most perfectly enjoyable of entertainments  well said marianne i begin to waver about my party i dont know after all but the desire of paying off social debts prompted the idea perhaps we might try some of the agreeable things suggested but dear me theres the baby well finish the talk some other time     viii  how shall we be amused   one two three fourthis makes the fifth accident on the fourth of july in the two papers i have just read said jenny  a very moderate allowance said theophilus thoro if you consider the fourth as a great national saturnalia in which every boy in the land has the privilege of doing whatever is right in his own eyes  the poor boys said mrs crowfield all the troubles of the world are laid at their door  well said jenny they did burn the city of portland it appears the fire arose from firecrackers thrown by boys among the shavings of a carpenters shopso says the paper  and said rudolph we surgeons expect a harvest of business from the fourth as surely as from a battle certain to be woundings fractures possibly amputations following the proceedings of our glorious festival  why cannot we americans learn to amuse ourselves peaceably like other nations said bob stephens in france and italy the greatest national festivals pass off without fatal accident or danger to any one the fact is in our country we have not learned how to be amused amusement has been made of so small account in our philosophy of life that we are raw and unpracticed in being amused our diversions compared with those of the politer nations of europe are coarse and savageand consist mainly in making disagreeable noises and disturbing the peace of the community by rude uproar the only idea an american boy associates with the fourth of july is that of gunpowder in some form and a wild liberty to fire off pistols in all miscellaneous directions and to throw firecrackers under the heels of horses and into crowds of women and children for the fun of seeing the stir and commotion thus produced now take a young parisian boy and give him a f√™te and he conducts himself with greater gentleness and good breeding because he is part of a community in which the art of amusement has been refined and perfected so that he has a thousand resources beyond the very obvious one of making a great banging and disturbance  yes continued bob stephens the fact is that our grim old puritan fathers set their feet down resolutely on all forms of amusement they would have stopped the lambs from wagging their tails and shot the birds for singing if they could have had their way and in consequence of it what a barren cold flowerless life is our new england existence life is all as mantalini said one demd horrid grind nothing here but working and going to church said the german emigrantsand they were about right a french traveler in the year 1837 says that attending the thursdayevening lectures and church prayermeetings was the only recreation of the young people of boston and we can remember the time when this really was no exaggeration think of that with all the seriousness of our boston east winds to give it force and fancy the provision for amusement in our society the consequence is that boys who have the longing for amusement strongest within them and plenty of combativeness to back it are the standing terror of good society and our fourth of july is a day of fear to all invalids and persons of delicate nervous organization and of real appreciable danger of life and limb to every one  well robert said my wife though i agree with you as to the actual state of society in this respect i must enter my protest against your slur on the memory of our pilgrim fathers  yes said theophilus thoro the new englanders are the only people i believe who take delight in vilifying their ancestry every young hopeful in our day makes a target of his grandfathers gravestone and fires away with great selfapplause people in general seem to like to show that they are wellborn and come of good stock but the young new englanders many of them appear to take pleasure in insisting that they came of a race of narrowminded persecuting bigots  it is true that our puritan fathers saw not everything they made a state where there were no amusements but where people could go to bed and leave their house doors wide open all night without a shadow of fear or danger as was for years the custom in all our country villages the fact is that the simple early new england life before we began to import foreigners realized a state of society in whose possibility europe would scarcely believe if our fathers had few amusements they needed few life was too really and solidly comfortable and happy to need much amusement  look over the countries where people are most sedulously amused by their rulers and governors are they not the countries where the people are most oppressed most unhappy in their circumstances and therefore in greatest need of amusement it is the slave who dances and sings and why because he owns nothing and can own nothing and may as well dance and forget the fact but give the slave a farm of his own a wife of his own and children of his own with a schoolhouse and a vote and ten to one he dances no more he needs no amusement because he is happy  the legislators of europe wished nothing more than to bring up a people who would be content with amusements and not ask after their rights or think too closely how they were governed gild the dome of the invalides was napoleons scornful prescription when he heard the parisian population were discontented they gilded it and the people forgot to talk about anything else they were a childish race educated from the cradle on spectacle and show and by the sight of their eyes could they be governed the people of boston in 1776 could not have been managed in this way chiefly because they were brought up in the strict schools of the fathers  but dont you think said jenny that something might be added and amended in the state of society our fathers established here in new england without becoming frivolous there might be more attention paid to rational amusement  certainly said my wife the state and the church both might take a lesson from the providence of foreign governments and make liberty to say the least as attractive as despotism it is a very unwise mother that does not provide her children with playthings  and yet said bob the only thing that the church has yet done is to forbid and to frown we have abundance of tracts against dancing whistplaying ninepins billiards operas theatresin short anything that young people would be apt to like the general assembly of the presbyterian church refused to testify against slavery because of political diffidence but made up for it by ordering a more stringent crusade against dancing the theatre and opera grow up and exist among us like plants on the windy side of a hill blown all awry by a constant blast of conscientious rebuke there is really no amusement young people are fond of which they do not pursue in a sort of defiance of the frown of the peculiarly religious world with all the telling of what the young shall not do there has been very little telling what they shall do  the whole department of amusementscertainly one of the most important in educationhas been by the church made a sort of outlaws ground to be taken possession of and held by all sorts of spiritual ragamuffins and then the faults and shortcomings resulting from this arrangement have been held up and insisted on as reasons why no christian should ever venture into it  if the church would set herself to amuse her young folks instead of discussing doctrines and metaphysical hairsplitting she would prove herself a true mother and not a hardvisaged stepdame let her keep this department so powerful and so difficult to manage in what are morally the strongest hands instead of giving it up to the weakest  i think if the different churches of a city for example would rent a building where there should be a billiardtable one or two ninepinalleys a readingroom a garden and grounds for ball playing or innocent lounging that they would do more to keep their young people from the ways of sin than a sundayschool could nay more i would go further i would have a portion of the building fitted up with scenery and a stage for the getting up of tableaux or dramatic performances and thus give scope for the exercise of that histrionic talent of which there is so much lying unemployed in society  young people do not like amusements any better for the wickedness connected with them the spectacle of a sweet little child singing hymns and repeating prayers of a pious old uncle tom dying for his religion has filled theatres night after night and proved that there really is no need of indecent or improper plays to draw full houses  the things that draw young people to places of amusement are not at first gross things take the most notorious public place in paristhe jardin mabille for instanceand the things which give it its first charm are all innocent and artistic exquisite beds of lilies roses gillyflowers lighted with jets of gas so artfully as to make every flower translucent as a gem fountains where the gaslight streams out from behind misty wreaths of falling water and callablossoms sofas of velvet turf canopied with fragrant honeysuckle dim bowers overarched with lilacs and roses a dancingground under trees whose branches bend with a fruitage of manycolored lamps enchanting music and graceful motion in all these there is not only no sin but they are really beautiful and desirable and if they were only used on the side and in the service of virtue and religion if they were contrived and kept up by the guardians and instructors of youth instead of by those whose interest it is to demoralize and destroy young people would have no temptation to stray into the haunts of vice  in prussia under the reign of frederick william ii when one good hardhanded man governed the whole country like a strict schoolmaster the public amusements for the people were made such as to present a model for all states the theatres were strictly supervised and actors obliged to conform to the rules of decorum and morality the plays and performances were under the immediate supervision of men of grave morals who allowed nothing corrupting to appear and the effect of this administration and restraint is to be seen in berlin even to this day the public gardens are full of charming little resorts where every afternoon for a very moderate sum one can have either a concert of good music or a very fair dramatic or operatic performance here whole families may be seen enjoying together a wholesome and refreshing entertainmentthe mother and aunts with their knitting the baby the children of all ages and the fathertheir faces radiant with that mild german light of contentment and good will which one feels to be characteristic of the nation when i saw these things and thought of our own outcast unprovided boys and young men haunting the streets and alleys of cities in places far from the companionship of mothers and sisters i felt as if it would be better for a nation to be brought up by a good strict schoolmaster king than to try to be a republic  yes said i but the difficulty is to get the good schoolmaster king for one good shepherd there are twenty who use the sheep only for their flesh and their wool republics can do all that kings canwitness our late army and sanitary commission once fix the idea thoroughly in the public mind that there ought to be as regular and careful provision for public amusement as there is for going to church and sundayschool and it will be done central park in new york is a beginning in the right direction and brooklyn is following the example of her sister city there is moreover an indication of the proper spirit in the increased efforts that are made to beautify sundayschool rooms and make them interesting and to have sundayschool f√™tes and picnicsthe most harmless and commendable way of celebrating the fourth of july why should saloons and barrooms be made attractive by fine paintings choice music flowers and fountains and sundayschool rooms be four bare walls there are churches whose broad aisles represent ten and twenty millions of dollars and whose sons and daughters are daily drawn to circuses operas theatres because they have tastes and feelings in themselves perfectly laudable and innocent for the gratification of which no provision is made in any other place  i know one church said rudolph whose sundayschool room is as beautifully adorned as any haunt of sin there is a fountain in the centre which plays into a basin surrounded with shells and flowers it has a small organ to lead the childrens voices and the walls are hung with oil paintings and engravings from the best masters the festivals of the sabbath school which are from time to time held in this place educate the taste of the children as well as amuse them and above all they have through life the advantage of associating with their early religious education all those ideas of taste elegance and artistic culture which too often come through polluted channels  when the amusement of the young shall become the care of the experienced and the wise and the floods of wealth that are now rolling over and over in silent investments shall be put into the form of innocent and refined pleasures for the children and youth of the state our national festivals may become days to be desired and not dreaded  on the fourth of july our city fathers do in a certain dim wise perceive that the public owes some attempt at amusement to its children and they vote large sums principally expended in bellringing cannon and fireworks the sidewalks are witness to the number who fall victims to the temptations held out by grogshops and saloons and the papers for weeks after are crowded with accounts of accidents now a yearly sum expended to keep up and keep pure places of amusement which hold out no temptation to vice but which excel all vicious places in real beauty and attractiveness would greatly lessen the sum needed to be expended on any one particular day and would refine and prepare our people to keep holidays and festivals appropriately  for my part said mrs crowfield i am grieved at the opprobrium which falls on the race of boys why should the most critical era in the life of those who are to be men and to govern society be passed in a sort of outlawrya rude warfare with all existing institutions the years between ten and twenty are full of the nervous excitability which marks the growth and maturing of the manly nature the boy feels wild impulses which ought to be vented in legitimate and healthful exercise he wants to run shout wrestle ride row skate and all these together are often not sufficient to relieve the need he feels of throwing off the excitability that burns within  for the wants of this period what safe provision is made by the church or by the state or any of the boys lawful educators in all the prussian schools amusements are as much a part of the regular school system as grammar or geography the teacher is with the boys on the playground and plays as heartily as any of them the boy has his physical wants anticipated he is not left to fight his way blindly stumbling against society but goes forward in a safe path which his elders and betters have marked out for him  in our country the boys career is often a series of skirmishes with society he wants to skate and contrives ingeniously to dam the course of a brook and flood a meadow which makes a splendid skatingground great is the joy for a season and great the skating but the water floods the neighboring cellars the boys are cursed through all the moods and tensesboys are such a plague the dam is torn down with emphasis and execration the boys however lie in wait some cold night between twelve and one and build it up again and thus goes on the battle the boys care not whose cellar they flood because nobody cares for their amusement they understand themselves to be outlaws and take an outlaws advantage  again the boys have their sleds and sliding down hill is splendid fun but they trip up some grave citizen who sprains his shoulder what is the result not the provision of a safe good place where boys may slide down hill without danger to any one but an edict forbidding all sliding under penalty of fine  boys want to swim it is best they should swim and if city fathers foreseeing and caring for this want should think it worth while to mark off some good place and have it under such police surveillance as to enforce decency of language and demeanor they would prevent a great deal that now is disagreeable in the unguided efforts of boys to enjoy this luxury  it would be cheaper in the end even if one had to build slidingpiles as they do in russia or to build skatingrinks as they do in montrealit would be cheaper for every city town and village to provide legitimate amusement for boys under proper superintendence than to leave them as they are now left to fight their way against society  in the boys academies of our country what provision is made for amusement there are stringent rules and any number of them to prevent boys making any noise that may disturb the neighbors and generally the teacher thinks that if he keeps the boys still and sees that they get their lessons his duty is done but a hundred boys ought not to be kept still there ought to be noise and motion among them in order that they may healthily survive the great changes which nature is working within them if they become silent averse to movement fond of indoor lounging and warm rooms they are going in far worse ways than any amount of outward lawlessness could bring them to  smoking and yellowcovered novels are worse than any amount of hullabaloo and the quietest boy is often a poor ignorant victim whose life is being drained out of him before it is well begun if mothers could only see the series of books that are sold behind counters to boardingschool boys whom nobody warns and nobody cares forif they could see the poison going from pillow to pillow in books pretending to make clear the great sacred mysteries of our nature but trailing them over with the filth of utter corruption these horrible works are the inward and secret channel of hell into which a boy is thrust by the pressure of strict outward rules forbidding that physical and outofdoor exercise and motion to which he ought rather to be encouraged and even driven  it is melancholy to see that while parents teachers and churches make no provision for boys in the way of amusement the world the flesh and the devil are incessantly busy and active in giving it to them there are ninepinalleys with cigars and a bar there are billiardsaloons with a bar and alas with the occasional company of girls who are still beautiful but who have lost the innocence of womanhood while yet retaining many of its charms there are theatres with a bar and with the society of lost women the boy comes to one and all of these places seeking only what is natural and proper he should havewhat should be given him under the eye and by the care of the church the school he comes for exercise and amusementhe gets these and a ticket to destruction besidesand whose fault is it  these are the aspects of public life said i which make me feel that we never shall have a perfect state till women vote and bear rule equally with men state housekeeping has been hitherto like what any housekeeping would be conducted by the voice and knowledge of man alone  if women had an equal voice in the management of our public money i have faith to believe that thousands which are now wasted in mere political charlatanism would go to provide for the rearing of the children of the state male and female my wife has spoken for the boys i speak for the girls also what is provided for their physical development and amusement hot gaslighted theatric and operatic performances beginning at eight and ending at midnight hot crowded parties and balls dancing with dresses tightly laced over the laboring lungsthese are almost the whole story i bless the advent of croquet and skating and yet the latter exercise pursued as it generally is is a most terrible exposure there is no kindly parental provision for the poor thoughtless delicate young creaturenot even the shelter of a dressingroom with a fire at which she may warm her numb fingers and put on her skates when she arrives on the ground and to which she may retreat in intervals of fatigue so she catches cold and perhaps sows the seed which with airtight stoves and other appliances of hothouse culture may ripen into consumption  what provision is there for the amusement of all the shop girls seamstresses factory girls that crowd our cities what for the thousands of young clerks and operatives not long since in a respectable old town in new england the body of a beautiful girl was drawn from the river in which she had drowned herselfa young girl only fifteen who came to the city far from home and parents and fell a victim to the temptation which brought her to shame and desperation many thus fall every year who are never counted they fall into the ranks of those whom the world abandons as irreclaimable  let those who have homes and every appliance to make life pass agreeably and who yet yawn over an unoccupied evening fancy a lively young girl all day cooped up at sewing in a close illventilated room evening comes and she has three times the desire for amusement and three times the need of it that her fashionable sister has and where can she go to the theatre perhaps with some young man as thoughtless as herself and more depraved then to the bar for a glass of wine and another and then with a head swimming and turning who shall say where else she may be led past midnight and no one to look after herand one night ruins her utterly and for life and she as yet only a child  john newton had a very wise saying here is a man trying to fill a bushel with chaff now if i fill it with wheat first it is better than to fight him this apothegm contains in it the whole of what i would say on the subject of amusements     ix  dress or who makes the fashions   the door of my study being open i heard in the distant parlor a sort of flutter of silken wings and chatter of birdlike voices which told me that a covey of jennys pretty young street birds had just alighted there i could not forbear a peep at the rosy faces that glanced out under pheasants tails doves wings and nodding hummingbirds and made one or two errands in that direction only that i might gratify my eyes with a look at them  your nice young girl of good family and good breeding is always a pretty object and for my part i regularly lose my heart in a sort of figurative way to every fresh charming creature that trips across my path all their mysterious rattletraps and whirligigstheir curls and networks and crimples and rimples and crispingpinstheir little absurdities if you willhave to me a sort of charm like the tricks and stammerings of a curlyheaded child i should have made a very poor censor if i had been put in catos place the witches would have thrown all my wisdom into some private chipbasket of their own and walked off with it in triumph never a girl bows to me that i do not see in her eye a twinkle of confidence that she could if she chose make an old fool of me i surrender at discretion on first sight  jennys friends are nice girlsthe flowers of good staid sensible familiesnot heathen blossoms nursed in the hotbed heat of wild highflying fashionable society they have been duly and truly taught and brought up by good mothers and painstaking aunties to understand in their infancy that handsome is that handsome does that little girls must not be vain of their pretty red shoes and nice curls and must remember that it is better to be good than to be handsome with all other wholesome truisms of the kind they have been to school and had their minds improved in all modern wayshave calculated eclipses and read virgil schiller and la fontaine and understand all about the geological strata and the different systems of metaphysicsso that a person reading the list of their acquirements might be a little appalled at the prospect of entering into conversation with them for all these reasons i listened quite indulgently to the animated conversation that was going on aboutwell  what do girls generally talk about when a knot of them get together not i believe about the sources of the nile or the precession of the equinoxes or the nature of the human understanding or dante or shakespeare or milton although they have learned all about them in school but upon a theme much nearer and dearerthe one allpervading feminine topic ever since eve started the first toilet of figleaves and as i caught now and then a phrase of their chatter i jotted it down in pure amusement giving to each charming speaker the name of the bird under whose colors she was sailing  for my part said little hummingbird im quite worn out with sewing the fashions are all so different from what they were last year that everything has to be made over  isnt it dreadful said pheasant theres my new mauve silk dress it was a very expensive silk and i havent worn it more than three or four times and it really looks quite dowdy and i cant get patterson to do it over for me for this party well really i shall have to give up company because i have nothing to wear  who does set the fashions i wonder said hummingbird they seem nowadays to whirl faster and faster till really they dont leave one time for anything  yes said dove i havent a moment for reading or drawing or keeping up my music the fact is nowadays to keep ones self properly dressed is all one can do if i were grande dame now and had only to send an order to my milliner and dressmaker i might be beautifully dressed all the time without giving much thought to it myself and that is what i should like but this constant planning about ones toilet changing your buttons and your fringes and your bonnettrimmings and your hats every other day and then being behindhand it is really too fatiguing  well said jenny i never pretend to keep up i never expect to be in the front rank of fashion but no girl wants to be behind every one nobody wants to have people say do see what an oldtimes rubbishy looking creature that is and now with my small means and my conscience for i have a conscience in this matter and dont wish to spend any more time and money than is needed to keep ones self fresh and tasteful i find my dress quite a fatiguing care  well now girls said hummingbird do you really know i have sometimes thought i should like to be a nun just to get rid of all this labor if i once gave up dress altogether and knew i was to have nothing but one plain robe tied round my waist with a cord it does seem to me as if it would be a perfect reposeonly one is a protestant you know  now as hummingbird was the most notoriously dressy individual in the little circle this suggestion was received with quite a laugh but dove took it up  well really she said when dear mr s preaches those saintly sermons to us about our baptismal vows and the nobleness of an unworldly life and calls on us to live for something purer and higher than we are living for i confess that sometimes all my life seems to me a mere shamthat i am going to church and saying solemn words and being wrought up by solemn music and uttering most solemn vows and prayers all to no purpose and then i come away and look at my life all resolving itself into a fritter about dress and sewingsilk cord braid and buttonsthe next fashion of bonnetshow to make my old dresses answer instead of newhow to keep the air of the world while in my heart i am cherishing something higher and better if theres anything i detest it is hypocrisy and sometimes the life i lead looks like it but how to get out of itwhat to do  im sure said hummingbird that taking care of my clothes and going into company is frankly all i do if i go to parties as other girls do and make calls and keep dressedyou know papa is not rich and one must do these things economicallyit really does take all the time i have when i was confirmed the bishop talked to us so sweetly and i really meant sincerely to be a good girlto be as good as i knew how but now when they talk about fighting the good fight and running the christian race i feel very mean and little for i am quite sure this isnt doing it but what isand who is  aunt betsey titcomb is doing it i suppose said pheasant  aunt betsey said hummingbird well she is she spends all her money in doing good she goes round visiting the poor all the time she is a perfect saintbut oh girls how she looks well now i confess when i think i must look like aunt betsey my courage gives out is it necessary to go without hoops and look like a dipped candle in order to be unworldly must one wear such a fright of a bonnet  no said jenny i think not i think miss betsey titcomb good as she is injures the cause of goodness by making it outwardly repulsive i really think if she would take some pains with her dress and spend upon her own wardrobe a little of the money she gives away that she might have influence in leading others to higher aims now all her influence is against it her outr√© and repulsive exterior arrays our natural and innocent feelings against goodness for surely it is natural and innocent to wish to look well and i am really afraid a great many of us are more afraid of being thought ridiculous than of being wicked  and after all said pheasant you know mr st clair says dress is one of the fine arts and if it is why of course we ought to cultivate it certainly welldressed men and women are more agreeable objects than rude and unkempt ones there must be somebody whose mission it is to preside over the agreeable arts of life and i suppose it falls to us girls thats the way i comfort myself at all events then i must confess that i do like dress im not cultivated enough to be a painter or a poet and i have all my artistic nature such as it is in dress i love harmonies of color exact shades and matches i love to see a uniform idea carried all through a womans toilether dress her bonnet her gloves her shoes her pockethandkerchief and cuffs her very parasol all in correspondence  but my dear said jenny anything of this kind must take a fortune  and if i had a fortune im pretty sure i should spend a good deal of it in this way said pheasant i can imagine such completeness of toilet as i have never seen how i would like the means to show what i could do my life now is perpetual disquiet i always feel shabby my things must all be bought at haphazard as they can be got out of my poor little allowanceand things are getting so horridly dear only think of it girls gloves at two and a quarter and boots at seven eight and ten dollars and then as you say the fashions changing so why i bought a sack last fall and gave forty dollars for it and this winter im wearing it to be sure but it has no style at alllooks quite antiquated  now i say said jenny that you are really morbid on the subject of dress you are fastidious and particular and exacting in your ideas in a way that really ought to be put down there is not a girl of our set that dresses as nicely as you do except emma seyton and her father you know has no end of income  nonsense jenny said pheasant i think i really look like a beggar but then i bear it as well as i can because you see i know papa does all for us he can and i wont be extravagant but i do think as hummingbird says that it would be a great relief to give it up altogether and retire from the world or as cousin john says climb a tree and pull it up after you and so be in peace  well said jenny all this seems to have come on since the war it seems to me that not only has everything doubled in price but all the habits of the world seem to require that you shall have double the quantity of everything two or three years ago a good balmoral skirt was a fixed fact it was a convenient thing for sloppy unpleasant weather but now dear me there is no end to them they cost fifteen and twenty dollars and girls that i know have one or two every season besides all sorts of quilled and embroidered and ruffled and tucked and flounced ones then in dressing ones hair what a perfect overflow there is of all manner of waterfalls and braids and rats and mice and curls and combs when three or four years ago we combed our own hair innocently behind our ears and put flowers in it and thought we looked nicely at our evening parties i dont believe we look any better now when we are dressed than we did thenso whats the use  well did you ever see such a tyranny as this of fashion said hummingbird we know its silly but we all bow down before it we are afraid of our lives before it and who makes all this and sets it going the paris milliners the empress or who  the question where fashions come from is like the question where pins go to said pheasant think of the thousands and millions of pins that are being used every year and not one of them worn out where do they all go to one would expect to find a pin mine somewhere  victor hugo says they go into the sewers in paris said jenny  and the fashions come from a source about as pure said i from the next room  bless me jenny do tell us if your father has been listening to us all this time was the next exclamation and forthwith there was a whir and rustle of the silken wings as the whole troop fluttered into my study  now mr crowfield you are too bad said hummingbird as she perched upon a corner of my studytable and put her little feet upon an old froissart which filled the armchair  to be listening to our nonsense said pheasant  lying in wait for us said dove  well now you have brought us all down on you said hummingbird and you wont find it so easy to be rid of us you will have to answer all our questions  my dears i am at your service as far as mortal man may be said i  well then said hummingbird tell us all about everythinghow things come to be as they are who makes the fashions  i believe it is universally admitted that in the matter of feminine toilet france rules the world said i  but who rules france said pheasant who decides what the fashions shall be there  it is the great misfortune of the civilized world at the present hour said i that the state of morals in france is apparently at the very lowest ebb and consequently the leadership of fashion is entirely in the hands of a class of women who could not be admitted into good society in any country women who can never have the name of wifewho know none of the ties of familythese are the dictators whose dress and equipage and appointments give the law first to france and through france to the civilized world such was the confession of monsieur dupin made in a late speech before the french senate and acknowledged with murmurs of assent on all sides to be the truth this is the reason why the fashions have such an utter disregard of all those laws of prudence and economy which regulate the expenditures of families they are made by women whose sole and only hold on life is personal attractiveness and with whom to keep this up at any cost is a desperate necessity no moral quality no association of purity truth modesty selfdenial or family love comes in to hallow the atmosphere about them and create a sphere of loveliness which brightens as mere physical beauty fades the ravages of time and dissipation must be made up by an unceasing study of the arts of the toilet artists of all sorts moving in their train rack all the stores of ancient and modern art for the picturesque the dazzling the grotesque and so lest these circes of society should carry all before them and enchant every husband brother and lover the staid and lawful penelopes leave the hearth and home to follow in their triumphal march and imitate their arts thus it goes in france and in england virtuous and domestic princesses and peeresses must take obediently what has been decreed by their rulers in the demimonde of france and we in america have leaders of fashion who make it their pride and glory to turn new york into paris and to keep even step with everything that is going on there so the whole world of womankind is marching under the command of those leaders the love of dress and glitter and fashion is getting to be a morbid unhealthy epidemic which really eats away the nobleness and purity of women  in france as monsieur dupin edmond about and michelet tell us the extravagant demands of love for dress lead women to contract debts unknown to their husbands and sign obligations which are paid by the sacrifice of honor and thus the purity of the family is continually undermined in england there is a voice of complaint sounding from the leading periodicals that the extravagant demands of female fashion are bringing distress into families and making marriages impossible and something of the same sort seems to have begun here we are across the atlantic to be sure but we feel the swirl and drift of the great whirlpool only fortunately we are far enough off to be able to see whither things are tending and to stop ourselves if we will  we have just come through a great struggle in which our women have borne an heroic parthave shown themselves capable of any kind of endurance and selfsacrifice and now we are in that reconstructive state which makes it of the greatest consequence to ourselves and the world that we understand our own institutions and position and learn that instead of following the corrupt and wornout ways of the old world we are called on to set the example of a new state of societynoble simple pure and religious and women can do more towards this even than men for women are the real architects of society  viewed in this light even the small frittering cares of womens lifethe attention to buttons trimmings thread and sewingsilkmay be an expression of their patriotism and their religion a noblehearted woman puts a noble meaning into even the commonplace details of life the women of america can if they choose hold back their country from following in the wake of old corrupt wornout effeminate european society and make america the leader of the world in all that is good  im sure said hummingbird we all would like to be noble and heroic during the war i did so long to be a man i felt so poor and insignificant because i was nothing but a girl  ah well said pheasant but then one wants to do something worth doing if one is going to do anything one would like to be grand and heroic if one could but if not why try at all one wants to be very something very great very heroic or if not that then at least very stylish and very fashionable it is this everlasting mediocrity that bores me  then i suppose you agree with the man we read of who buried his one talent in the earth as hardly worth caring for  to say the truth i always had something of a sympathy for that man said pheasant i cant enjoy goodness and heroism in homoeopathic doses i want something appreciable what i can do being a woman is a very different thing from what i should try to do if i were a man and had a mans chances it is so much lessso poorthat it is scarcely worth trying for  you remember said i the apothegm of one of the old divines that if two angels were sent down from heaven the one to govern a kingdom and the other to sweep a street they would not feel any disposition to change works  well that just shows that they are angels and not mortals said pheasant but we poor human beings see things differently  yet my child what could grant or sherman have done if it had not been for the thousands of brave privates who were content to do each their imperceptible littleif it had not been for the poor unnoticed faithful neverfailing common soldiers who did the work and bore the suffering no one man saved our country or could save it nor could the men have saved it without the women every mother that said to her son go every wife that strengthened the hands of her husband every girl who sent courageous letters to her betrothed every woman who worked for a fair every grandam whose trembling hands knit stockings and scraped lint every little maiden who hemmed shirts and made comfortbags for soldierseach and all have been the joint doers of a great heroic work the doing of which has been the regeneration of our era a whole generation has learned the luxury of thinking heroic thoughts and being conversant with heroic deeds and i have faith to believe that all this is not to go out in a mere crush of fashionable luxury and folly and frivolous emptinessbut that our girls are going to merit the high praise given us by de tocqueville when he placed first among the causes of our prosperity the noble character of american women because foolish female persons in new york are striving to outdo the demimonde of paris in extravagance it must not follow that every sensible and patriotic matron and every nice modest young girl must forthwith and without inquiry rush as far after them as they possibly can because mrs shoddy opens a ball in a twothousanddollar lace dress every girl in the land need not look with shame on her modest white muslin somewhere between the fast women of paris and the daughters of christian american families there should be established a cordon sanitaire to keep out the contagion of manners customs and habits with which a nobleminded religious democratic people ought to have nothing to do  well now mr crowfield said the dove since you speak us so fair and expect so much of us we must of course try not to fall below your compliments but after all tell us what is the right standard about dress now we have daily lectures about this at home aunt maria says that she never saw such times as these when mothers and daughters churchmembers and worldly people all seem to be going one way and sit down together and talk as they will on dress and fashionhow to have this made and that altered we used to be taught she said that churchmembers had higher things to think ofthat their thoughts ought to be fixed on something better and that they ought to restrain the vanity and worldliness of children and young people but now she says even before a girl is born dress is the one thing needfulthe great thing to be thought of and so in every step of the way upward her little shoes and her little bonnets and her little dresses and her corals and her ribbons are constantly being discussed in her presence as the one allimportant object of life aunt maria thinks mamma is dreadful because she has maternal yearnings over our toilet successes and fortunes and we secretly think aunt maria is rather soured by old age and has forgotten how a girl feels  the fact is said i that the love of dress and outside show has been always such an exacting and absorbing tendency that it seems to have furnished work for religionists and economists in all ages to keep it within bounds various religious bodies at the outset adopted severe rules in protest against it the quakers and the methodists prescribed certain fixed modes of costume as a barrier against its frivolities and follies in the romish church an entrance on any religious order prescribed entire and total renunciation of all thought and care for the beautiful in person or apparel as the first step towards saintship the costume of the religieuse seemed to be purposely intended to imitate the shroudings and swathings of a corpse and the lugubrious color of a pall so as forever to remind the wearer that she was dead to the world of ornament and physical beauty all great christian preachers and reformers have leveled their artillery against the toilet from the time of st jerome downward and tom moore has put into beautiful and graceful verse st jeromes admonitions to the fair churchgoers of his time   who is the maid                  st jeromes love    who is the maid my spirit seeks     through cold reproof and slanders blight   has she loves roses on her cheeks     is hers an eye of this worlds light   no wan and sunk with midnight prayer     are the pale looks of her i love   or if at times a light be there     its beam is kindled from above    i chose not her my hearts elect     from those who seek their makers shrine   in gems and garlands proudly decked     as if themselves were things divine   no heaven but faintly warms the breast     that beats beneath a broidered veil   and she who comes in glittering vest     to mourn her frailty still is frail    not so the faded form i prize     and love because its bloom is gone   the glory in those sainted eyes     is all the grace her brow puts on   and neer was beautys dawn so bright     so touching as that forms decay   which like the altars trembling light     in holy lustre wastes away  but the defect of all these modes of warfare on the elegances and refinements of the toilet was that they were too indiscriminate they were in reality founded on a false principle they took for granted that there was something radically corrupt and wicked in the body and in the physical system according to this mode of viewing things the body was a loathsome and pestilent prison in which the soul was locked up and enslaved and the eyes the ears the taste the smell were all so many corrupt traitors in conspiracy to poison her physical beauty of every sort was a snare a circean enchantment to be valiantly contended with and straitly eschewed hence they preached not moderation but total abstinence from all pursuit of physical grace and beauty  now a resistance founded on an overstatement is constantly tending to reaction people always have a tendency to begin thinking for themselves and when they so think they perceive that a good and wise god would not have framed our bodies with such exquisite care only to corrupt our soulsthat physical beauty being created in such profuse abundance around us and we being possessed with such a longing for it must have its uses its legitimate sphere of exercise even the poor shrouded nun as she walks the convent garden cannot help asking herself why if the crimson velvet of the rose was made by god all colors except black and white are sinful for her and the modest quaker after hanging all her house and dressing all her children in drab cannot but marvel at the sudden outstreaking of blue and yellow and crimson in the tulipbeds under her window and reflect how very differently the great allfather arrays the worlds housekeeping the consequence of all this has been that the reforms based upon these severe and exclusive views have gradually gone backward the quaker dress is imperceptibly and gracefully melting away into a refined simplicity of modern costume which in many cases seems to be the perfection of taste the obvious reflection that one color of the rainbow is quite as much of god as another has led the children of gentle dovecolored mothers to appear in shades of rosecolor blue and lilac and wise elders have said it is not so much the color or the shape that we object to as giving too much time and too much moneyif the heart be right with god and man the bonnet ribbon may be of any shade you please  but dont you think said pheasant that a certain fixed dress marking the unworldly character of a religious order is desirable now i have said before that i am very fond of dress i have a passion for beauty and completeness in it and as long as i am in the world and obliged to dress as the world does it constantly haunts me and tempts me to give more time more thought more money to these things than i really think they are worth but i can conceive of giving up this thing altogether as being much easier than regulating it to the precise point i never read of a nuns taking the veil without a certain thrill of sympathy to cut off ones hair to take off and cast from her one by one all ones trinkets and jewels to lie down and have the pall thrown over one and feel ones self once for all dead to the worldi cannot help feeling as if this were real thorough noble renunciation and as if one might rise up from it with a grand calm consciousness of having risen to a higher and purer atmosphere and got above all the littlenesses and distractions that beset us here so i have heard charming young quaker girls who in more thoughtless days indulged in what for them was a slight shading of worldly conformity say that it was to them a blessed rest when they put on the strict plain dress and felt that they really had taken up the cross and turned their backs on the world i can conceive of doing this much more easily than i can of striking the exact line between worldly conformity and noble aspiration in the life i live now  my dear child said i we all overlook one great leading principle of our nature and that is that we are made to find a higher pleasure in selfsacrifice than in any form of selfindulgence there is something grand and pathetic in the idea of an entire selfsurrender to which every human soul leaps up as we do to the sound of martial music  how many boys of boston and new york who had lived effeminate and idle lives felt this new power uprising in them in our war how they embraced the dirt and discomfort and fatigue and watchings and toils of camplife with an eagerness of zest which they had never felt in the pursuit of mere pleasure and wrote home burning letters that they never were so happy in their lives it was not that dirt and fatigue and discomfort and watchings and weariness were in themselves agreeable but it was a joy to feel themselves able to bear all and surrender all for something higher than self many a poor battery bully of new york many a street rowdy felt uplifted by the discovery that he too had hid away under the dirt and dust of his former life this divine and precious jewel he leaped for joy to find that he too could be a hero think of the hundreds of thousands of plain ordinary workingmen and of seemingly ordinary boys who but for such a crisis might have passed through life never knowing this to be in them and who courageously endured hunger and thirst and cold and separation from dearest friends for days and weeks and months when they might at any day have bought a respite by deserting their countrys flag starving boys sick at heart dizzy in head pining for home and mother still found warmth and comfort in the one thought that they could suffer die for their country and the graves at salisbury and andersonville show in how many souls this noble power of selfsacrifice to the higher good was lodgedhow many there were even in the humblest walks of life who preferred death by torture to life in dishonor  it is this heroic element in man and woman that makes selfsacrifice an ennobling and purifying ordeal in any religious profession the man really is taken into a higher region of his own nature and finds a pleasure in the exercise of higher faculties which he did not suppose himself to possess whatever sacrifice is supposed to be duty whether the supposition be really correct or not has in it an ennobling and purifying power and thus the eras of conversion from one form of the christian religion to another are often marked with a real and permanent exaltation of the whole character but it does not follow that certain religious beliefs and ordinances are in themselves just because they thus touch the great heroic masterchord of the human soul to wear sackcloth and sleep on a plank may have been of use to many souls as symbolizing the awakening of this higher nature but still the religion of the new testament is plainly one which calls to no such outward and evident sacrifices  it was john the baptist and not the messiah who dwelt in the wilderness and wore garments of camels hair and jesus was commented on not for his asceticism but for his cheerful social acceptance of the average innocent wants and enjoyments of humanity the son of man came eating and drinking the great and never ceasing and utter selfsacrifice of his life was not signified by any peculiarity of costume or language or manner it showed itself only as it unconsciously welled up in all his words and actions in his estimates of life in all that marked him out as a being of a higher and holier sphere  then you do not believe in influencing this subject of dress by religious persons adopting any particular laws of costume said pheasant  i do not see it to be possible said i considering how society is made up there are such differences of taste and characterpeople move in such different spheres are influenced by such different circumstancesthat all we can do is to lay down certain great principles and leave it to every one to apply them according to individual needs  but what are these principles there is the grand inquiry  well said i let us feel our way in the first place then we are all agreed in one startingpointthat beauty is not to be considered as a bad thingthat the love of ornament in our outward and physical life is not a sinful or a dangerous feeling and only leads to evil as all other innocent things do by being used in wrong ways so far we are all agreed are we not  certainly said all the voices  it is therefore neither wicked nor silly nor weakminded to like beautiful dress and all that goes to make it up jewelry diamonds pearls emeralds rubies and all sorts of pretty things that are made of them are as lawful and innocent objects of admiration and desire as flowers or birds or butterflies or the tints of evening skies gems in fact are a species of mineral flower they are the blossoms of the dark hard mine and what they want in perfume they make up in durability the best christian in the world may without the least inconsistency admire them and say as a charming benevolent old quaker lady once said to me i do so love to look at beautiful jewelry the love of beautiful dress in itself therefore so far from being in a bad sense worldly may be the same indication of a refined and poetical nature that is given by the love of flowers and of natural objects  in the third place there is nothing in itself wrong or unworthy a rational being in a certain degree of attention to the fashion of society in our costume it is not wrong to be annoyed at unnecessary departures from the commonly received practices of good society in the matter of the arrangement of our toilet and it would indicate rather an unamiable want of sympathy with our fellow beings if we were not willing for the most part to follow what they indicate to be agreeable in the disposition of our outward affairs  well i must say mr crowfield you are allowing us all a very generous margin said hummingbird  but now said i i am coming to the restrictions when is love of dress excessive and wrong to this i answer by stating my faith in one of old platos ideas in which he speaks of beauty and its uses he says there were two impersonations of beauty worshiped under the name of venus in the ancient timesthe one celestial born of the highest gods the other earthly to the earthly venus the sacrifices were such as were more trivial to the celestial such as were more holy the worship of the earthly venus he says sends us oftentimes on unworthy and trivial errands but the worship of the celestial to high and honorable friendships to noble aspirations and heroic actions  now it seems to me that if we bear in mind this truth in regard to beauty we shall have a test with which to try ourselves in the matter of physical adornment we are always excessive when we sacrifice the higher beauty to attain the lower one a woman who will sacrifice domestic affection conscience selfrespect honor to love of dress we all agree loves dress too much she loses the true and higher beauty of womanhood for the lower beauty of gems and flowers and colors a girl who sacrifices to dress all her time all her strength all her money to the neglect of the cultivation of her mind and heart and to the neglect of the claims of others on her helpfulness is sacrificing the higher to the lower beauty her fault is not the love of beauty but loving the wrong and inferior kind  it is remarkable that the directions of holy writ in regard to the female dress should distinctly take note of this difference between the higher and the lower beauty which we find in the works of plato the apostle gives no rule no specific costume which should mark the christian woman from the pagan but says whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price the gold and gems and apparel are not forbidden but we are told not to depend on them for beauty to the neglect of those imperishable immortal graces that belong to the soul the makers of fashion among whom christian women lived when the apostle wrote were the same class of brilliant and worthless aspasias who make the fashions of modern paris and all womankind was sunk into slavish adoration of more physical adornment when the gospel sent forth among them this call to the culture of a higher and immortal beauty  in fine girls said i you may try yourselves by this standard you love dress too much when you care more for your outward adornings than for your inward dispositions when it afflicts you more to have torn your dress than to have lost your temper when you are more troubled by an illfitting gown than by a neglected dutywhen you are less concerned at having made an unjust comment or spread a scandalous report than at having worn a pass√© bonnet when you are less troubled at the thought of being found at the last great feast without the wedding garment than at being found at the party tonight in the fashion of last year no christian woman as i view it ought to give such attention to her dress as to allow it to take up all of three very important things viz        all her time       all her strength       all her money  whoever does this lives not the christian but the pagan lifeworships not at the christians altar of our lord jesus but at the shrine of the lower venus of corinth and rome  oh now mr crowfield you frighten me said hummingbird im so afraid do you know that i am doing exactly that  and so am i said pheasant and yet certainly it is not what i mean or intend to do  but how to help it said dove  my dears said i where there is a will there is a way only resolve that you will put the true beauty firstthat even if you do have to seem unfashionable you will follow the highest beauty of womanhoodand the battle is half gained only resolve that your time your strength your money such as you have shall not allnor more than halfbe given to mere outward adornment and you will go right it requires only an army of girls animated with this noble purpose to declare independence in america and emancipate us from the decrees and tyrannies of french actresses and balletdancers en avant girls you yet can if you will save the republic     x  what are the sources of beauty in dress   the conversation on dress which i had held with jenny and her little covey of birds of paradise appeared to have worked in the minds of the fair council for it was not long before they invaded my study again in a body they were going out to a party but called for jenny and of course gave me and mrs crowfield the privilege of seeing them equipped for conquest  latterly i must confess the mysteries of the toilet rites have impressed me with a kind of superstitious awe only a year ago my daughter jenny had smooth dark hair which she wreathed in various soft flowing lines about her face and confined in a classical knot on the back of her head jenny had rather a talent for coiffure and the arrangement of her hair was one of my little artistic delights she always had something therea leaf a spray a bud or blossom that looked fresh and had a sort of poetical grace of its own  but in a gradual way all this has been changing jennys hair first became slightly wavy then curly finally frizzly presenting a tumbled and twisted appearance which gave me great inward concern but when i spoke upon the subject i was always laughingly silenced with the definitive settling remark oh its the fashion papa everybody wears it so  i particularly objected to the change on my own small account because the smooth breakfasttable coiffure which i had always so much enjoyed was now often exchanged for a peculiarly bristling appearance the hair being variously twisted tortured woven and wound without the least view to immediate beauty or grace but all this i was informed was the necessary means towards crimping for some evening display of a more elaborate nature than usual  mrs crowfield and myself are not partygoers by profession but jenny insists on our going out at least once or twice in a season just as she says to keep up with the progress of society and at these times i have been struck with frequent surprise by the general untidiness which appeared to have come over the heads of all my female friends i know of course that i am only a poor ignorant bewildered man creature but to my uninitiated eyes they looked as if they had all after a very restless and perturbed sleep come out of bed without smoothing their tumbled and disordered locks then every young lady without exception seemed to have one kind of hair and that the kind which was rather suggestive of the term woolly every sort of wild abandon of frowzy locks seemed to be in vogue in some cases the hair appearing to my vision nothing but a confused snarl in which glittered tinklers spangles and bits of tinsel and from which waved long pennants and streamers of different colored ribbons  i was in fact very greatly embarrassed by my first meeting with some very charming girls whom i thought i knew as familiarly as my own daughter jenny and whose soft pretty hair had often formed the object of my admiration now however they revealed themselves to me in coiffures which forcibly reminded me of the electrical experiments which used to entertain us in college when the subject stood on the insulated stool and each particular hair of his head bristled and rose and set up as it were on its own account this highflying condition of the tresses and the singularity of the ornaments which appeared to be thrown at haphazard into them suggested so oddly the idea of a bewitched person that i could scarcely converse with any presence of mind or realize that these really were the nice wellinformed sensible little girls of my own neighborhoodthe good daughters good sisters sundayschool teachers and other familiar members of our best educated circles and i came away from the party in a sort of blue maze and hardly in a state to conduct myself with credit in the examination through which i knew jenny would put me as to the appearance of her different friends  i know not how it is but the glamour of fashion in the eyes of girlhood is so complete that the oddest wildest most uncouth devices find grace and favor in the eyes of even wellbred girls when once that invisible ineffable aura has breathed over them which declares them to be fashionable they may defy them for a timethey may pronounce them horrid but it is with a secretly melting heart and with a mental reservation to look as nearly like the abhorred spectacle as they possibly can on the first favorable opportunity  on the occasion of the visit referred to jenny ushered her three friends in triumph into my study and in truth the little room seemed to be perfectly transformed by their brightness my honest nice lovable little yankee fireside girls were to be sure got up in a style that would have done credit to madame pompadour or any of the most questionable characters of the time of louis xiv or xv they were frizzled and powdered and built up in elaborate devices they wore on their hair flowers gems streamers tinklers hummingbirds butterflies south american beetles beads bugles and all imaginable rattletraps which jingled and clinked with every motion and yet as they were three or four fresh handsome intelligent brighteyed girls there was no denying the fact that they did look extremely pretty and as they sailed hither and thither before me and gazed down upon me in the saucy might of their rosy girlhood there was a gay defiance in jennys demand now papa how do you like us  very charming answered i surrendering at discretion  i told you girls that you could convert him to the fashions if he should once see you in party trim  i beg pardon my dear i am not converted to the fashion but to you and that is a point on which i didnt need conversion but the present fashions even so fairly represented as i see them i humbly confess i dislike  oh mr crowfield  yes my dears i do but then i protest im not fairly treated i think for a young american girl who looks as most of my fair friends do look to come down with her bright eyes and all her little panoply of graces upon an old fellow like me and expect him to like a fashion merely because she looks well in it is all sheer nonsense why girls if you wore rings in your noses and bangles on your arms up to your elbows if you tied your hair in a warknot on the top of your heads like the sioux indians you would still look pretty the question isnt as i view it whether you look prettyfor that you do and that you will do what you please and dress how you will the question is whether you might not look prettier whether another style of dress and another mode of getting up would not be far more becoming i am one who thinks that it would  now mr crowfield you positively are too bad said hummingbird whose delicate head was encircled by a sort of cr√™py cloud of bright hair sparkling with golddust and spangles in the midst of which just over her forehead a gorgeous blue butterfly was perched while a confused mixture of hairs goldpowder spangles stars and tinkling ornaments fell in a sort of cataract down her pretty neck you see we girls think everything of you and now we dont like it that you dont like our fashions  why my little princess so long as i like you better than your fashions and merely think they are not worthy of you whats the harm  oh yes to be sure you sweeten the dose to us babies with that sugarplum but really mr crowfield why dont you like the fashions  because to my view they are in great part in false taste and injure the beauty of the girls said i they are inappropriate to their characters and make them look like a kind and class of women whom they do not and i trust never will resemble internally and whose mark therefore they ought not to bear externally but there you are beguiling me into a sermon which you will only hate me in your hearts for preaching go along children you certainly look as well as anybody can in that style of getting up so go to your party and tomorrow night when you are tired and sleepy if youll come with your crochet and sit in my study i will read you christopher crowfields dissertation on dress  that will be amusing to say the least said hummingbird and be sure we will all be here and mind you have to show good reasons for disliking the present fashion  so the next evening there was a worsted party in my study sitting in the midst of which i read as follows   what are the sources of beauty in dress  the first one is appropriateness colors and forms and modes in themselves graceful or beautiful can become ungraceful and ridiculous simply through inappropriateness the most lovely bonnet that the most approved modiste can invent if worn on the head of a coarsefaced irishwoman bearing a marketbasket on her arm excites no emotion but that of the ludicrous the most elegant and brilliant evening dress if worn in the daytime in a railroad car strikes every one with a sense of absurdity whereas both these objects in appropriate associations would excite only the idea of beauty so a mode of dress obviously intended for driving strikes us as outr√© in a parlor and a parlor dress would no less shock our eyes on horseback in short the course of this principle through all varieties of form can easily be perceived besides appropriateness to time place and circumstances there is appropriateness to age position and character this is the foundation of all our ideas of professional propriety in costume one would not like to see a clergyman in his external air and appointments resembling a gentleman of the turf one would not wish a refined and modest scholar to wear the outward air of a fast fellow or an aged and venerable statesman to appear with all the peculiarities of a young dandy the flowers feathers and furbelows which a lighthearted young girl of seventeen embellishes by the airy grace with which she wears them are simply ridiculous when transferred to the toilet of her serious wellmeaning mamma who bears them about with an anxious face merely because a loquacious milliner has assured her with many protestations that it is the fashion and the only thing remaining for her to do  there are again modes of dress in themselves very beautiful and very striking which are peculiarly adapted to theatrical representation and to pictures but the adoption of which as a part of unprofessional toilet produces a sense of incongruity a mode of dress maybe in perfect taste on the stage that would be absurd in an evening party absurd in the street absurd in short everywhere else  now you come to my first objection to our present american toiletits being to a very great extent inappropriate to our climate to our habits of life and thought and to the whole structure of ideas on which our life is built what we want apparently is some court of inquiry and adaptation that shall pass judgment on the fashions of other countries and modify them to make them a graceful expression of our own national character and modes of thinking and living a certain class of women in paris at this present hour makes the fashions that rule the feminine world they are women who live only for the senses with as utter and obvious disregard of any moral or intellectual purpose to be answered in living as a paroquet or a macaw they have no family ties love in its pure domestic sense is an impossibility in their lot religion in any sense is another impossibility and their whole intensity of existence therefore is concentrated on the question of sensuous enjoyment and that personal adornment which is necessary to secure it when the great ruling country in the world of taste and fashion has fallen into such a state that the virtual leaders of fashion are women of this character it is not to be supposed that the fashions emanating from them will be of a kind well adapted to express the ideas the thoughts the state of society of a great christian democracy such as ours ought to be  what is called for example the pompadour style of dress so much in vogue of late we can see to be perfectly adapted to the kind of existence led by dissipated women whose life is one revel of excitement and who never proposing to themselves any intellectual employment or any domestic duty can afford to spend three or four hours every day under the hands of a waitingmaid in alternately tangling and untangling their hair powder paint golddust and silverdust pomatums cosmetics are all perfectly appropriate where the ideal of life is to keep up a false show of beauty after the true bloom is wasted by dissipation the woman who never goes to bed till morning who never even dresses herself who never takes a needle in her hand who never goes to church and never entertains one serious idea of duty of any kind when got up in pompadour style has to say the truth the good taste and merit of appropriateness her dress expresses just what she isall false all artificial all meretricious and unnatural no part or portion of her from which it might be inferred what her creator originally designed her to be  but when a nice little american girl who has been brought up to cultivate her mind to refine her taste to care for her health to be a helpful daughter and a good sister to visit the poor and teach in sunday schools when a good sweet modest little puss of this kind combs all her pretty hair backward till it is one mass of frowsy confusion when she powders and paints under her eyes when she adopts with eager enthusiasm every outr√© unnatural fashion that comes from the most dissipated foreign circlesshe is in bad taste because she does not represent either her character her education or her good points she looks like a secondrate actress when she is in fact a most thoroughly respectable estimable lovable little girl and on the way as we poor fellows fondly hope to bless some one of us with her tenderness and care in some nice home in the future  it is not the fashion in america for young girls to have waitingmaidsin foreign countries it is the fashion all this meretricious toiletso elaborate so complicated and so contrary to naturemust be accomplished and it is accomplished by the busy little fingers of each girl for herself and so it seems to be very evident that a style of hairdressing which it will require hours to disentangle which must injure and in time ruin the natural beauty of the hair ought to be one thing which a wellregulated court of inquiry would reject in our american fashions  again the genius of american life is for simplicity and absence of ostentation we have no parade of office our public men wear no robes no stars garters collars etc and it would therefore be in good taste in our women to cultivate simple styles of dress now i object to the present fashions as adopted from france that they are flashy and theatrical having their origin with a community whose senses are blunted drugged and deadened with dissipation and ostentation they reject the simpler forms of beauty and seek for startling effects for odd and unexpected results the contemplation of one of our fashionable churches at the hour when its fair occupants pour forth gives one a great deal of surprise the toilets there displayed might have been in good keeping among showy parisian women in an opera house but even their original inventors would have been shocked at the idea of carrying them into a church the rawness of our american mind as to the subject of propriety in dress is nowhere more shown than in the fact that no apparent distinction is made between church and opera house in the adaptation of attire very estimable and we trust very religious young women sometimes enter the house of god in a costume which makes their utterance of the words of the litany and the acts of prostrate devotion in the service seem almost burlesque when a brisk little creature comes into a pew with hair frizzed till it stands on end in a most startling manner rattling strings of beads and bits of tinsel mounting over all some pert little hat with a red or green feather standing saucily upright in front she may look exceedingly pretty and piquant and if she came there for a game of croquet or a tableau party would be all in very good taste but as she comes to confess that she is a miserable sinner that she has done the things she ought not to have done and left undone the things she ought to have doneas she takes upon her lips most solemn and tremendous words whose meaning runs far beyond life into a sublime eternitythere is a discrepancy which would be ludicrous if it were not melancholy  one is apt to think at first view that st jerome was right in saying    she who comes in glittering vest   to mourn her frailty still is frail  but st jerome was in the wrong after all for a flashy unsuitable attire in church is not always a mark of an undevout or entirely worldly mind it is simply a mark of a raw uncultivated taste in italy the ecclesiastical law prescribing a uniform black dress for the churches gives a sort of education to european ideas of propriety in toilet which prevents churches from being made theatres for the same kind of display which is held to be in good taste at places of public amusement it is but justice to the inventors of parisian fashions to say that had they ever had the smallest idea of going to church and sunday school as our good girls do they would immediately have devised toilets appropriate to such exigencies if it were any part of their plan of life to appear statedly in public to confess themselves miserable sinners we should doubtless have sent over here the design of some graceful penitential habit which would give our places of worship a much more appropriate air than they now have as it is it would form a subject for such a court of inquiry and adaptation as we have supposed to draw a line between the costume of the theatre and the church  in the same manner there is a want of appropriateness in the costume of our american women who display in the street promenade a style of dress and adornment originally intended for showy carriage drives in such great exhibition grounds as the bois de boulogne the makers of parisian fashions are not generally walkers they do not with all their extravagance have the bad taste to trail yards of silk and velvet over the mud and dirt of a pavement or promenade the street in a costume so pronounced and striking as to draw the involuntary glance of every eye and the showy toilets displayed on the pav√© by american young women have more than once exposed them to misconstruction in the eyes of foreign observers  next to appropriateness the second requisite to beauty in dress i take to be unity of effect in speaking of the arrangement of rooms in the house and home papers i criticised some apartments wherein were many showy articles of furniture and much expense had been incurred because with all this there was no unity of result the carpet was costly and in itself handsome the paper was also in itself handsome and costly the tables and chairs also in themselves very elegant and yet owing to a want of any unity of idea any grand harmonizing tint of color or method of arrangement the rooms had a jumbled confused air and nothing about them seemed particularly pretty or effective i instanced rooms where thousands of dollars had been spent which because of this defect never excited admiration and others in which the furniture was of the cheapest description but which always gave immediate and universal pleasure the same rule holds good in dress as in every apartment so in every toilet there should be one groundtone or dominant color which should rule all the others and there should be a general style of idea to which everything should be subjected  we may illustrate the effect of this principle in a very familiar case it is generally conceded that the majority of women look better in mourning than they do in their ordinary apparel a comparatively plain person looks almost handsome in simple black now why is this simply because mourning requires a severe uniformity of color and idea and forbids the display of that variety of colors and objects which go to make up the ordinary female costume and which very few women have such skill in using as to produce really beautiful effects  very similar results have been attained by the quaker costume which in spite of the quaint severity of the forms to which it adhered has always had a remarkable degree of becomingness because of its restriction to a few simple colors and to the absence of distracting ornament  but the same effect which is produced in mourning or the quaker costume may be preserved in a style of dress admitting color and ornamentation a dress may have the richest fullness of color and still the tints may be so chastened and subdued as to produce the impression of a severe simplicity suppose for example a goldenhaired blonde chooses for the groundtone of her toilet a deep shade of purple such as affords a good background for the hair and complexion the larger draperies of the costume being of this color the bonnet may be of a lighter shade of the same ornamented with lilac hyacinths shading insensibly towards rosecolor the effect of such a costume is simple even though there be much ornament because it is ornament artistically disposed towards a general result  a dark shade of green being chosen as the groundtone of a dress the whole costume may in like manner be worked up through lighter and brighter shades of green in which rosecolored flowers may appear with the same impression of simple appropriateness that is made by the pink blossom over the green leaves of a rose there have been times in france when the study of color produced artistic effects in costume worthy of attention and resulted in styles of dress of real beauty but the present corrupted state of morals there has introduced a corrupt taste in dress and it is worthy of thought that the decline of moral purity in society is often marked by the deterioration of the sense of artistic beauty corrupt and dissipated social epochs produce corrupt styles of architecture and corrupt styles of drawing and painting as might easily be illustrated by the history of art when the leaders of society have blunted their finer perceptions by dissipation and immorality they are incapable of feeling the beauties which come from delicate concords and truly artistic combinations they verge towards barbarism and require things that are strange odd dazzling and peculiar to captivate their jaded senses such we take to be the condition of parisian society now the tone of it is given by women who are essentially impudent and vulgar who override and overrule by the mere brute force of opulence and luxury women of finer natures and moral tone the court of france is a court of adventurers of parvenus and the palaces the toilets the equipage the entertainments of the mistresses outshine those of the lawful wives hence comes a style of dress which is in itself vulgar ostentatious pretentious without simplicity without unity seeking to dazzle by strange combinations and daring contrasts  now when the fashions emanating from such a state of society come to our country where it has been too much the habit to put on and wear without dispute and without inquiry any or every thing that france sends the results produced are often things to make one wonder a respectable man sitting quietly in church or other public assembly may be pardoned sometimes for indulging a silent sense of the ridiculous in the contemplation of the forest of bonnets which surround him as he humbly asks himself the question were these meant to cover the head to defend it or to ornament it and if they are intended for any of these purposes how  i confess to me nothing is so surprising as the sort of things which wellbred women serenely wear on their heads with the idea that they are ornaments on my right hand sits a goodlooking girl with a thing on her head which seems to consist mostly of bunches of grass straws with a confusion of lace in which sits a draggled bird looking as if the cat had had him before the lady in front of her sits another who has a glittering confusion of beads swinging hither and thither from a jaunty little structure of black and red velvet an anxiouslooking matron appears under the high eaves of a bonnet with a gigantic crimson rose crushed down into a mass of tangled hair she is ornamented she has no doubt about it  the fact is that a style of dress which allows the use of everything in heaven above or earth beneath requires more taste and skill in disposition than falls to the lot of most of the female sex to make it even tolerable in consequence the flowers fruits grass hay straw oats butterflies beads birds tinsel streamers jinglers lace bugles crape which seem to be appointed to form a covering for the female head very often appear in combinations so singular and the results taken in connection with all the rest of the costume are such that we really think the people who usually assemble in a quaker meetinghouse are with their entire absence of ornament more becomingly attired than the majority of our public audiences for if one considers his own impression after having seen an assemblage of women dressed in quaker costume he will find it to be not of a confusion of twinkling finery but of many fair sweet faces of charming nicelooking women and not of articles of dress now this shows that the severe dress after all has better answered the true purpose of dress in setting forth the woman than our modern costume where the woman is but one item in a flying mass of colors and forms all of which distract attention from the faces they are supposed to adorn the dress of the philadelphian ladies has always been celebrated for its elegance of effect from the fact probably that the early quaker parentage of the city formed the eye and the taste of its women for uniform and simple styles of color and for purity and chastity of lines the most perfect toilets that have ever been achieved in america have probably been those of the class familiarly called the gay quakerschildren of quaker families who while abandoning the strict rules of the sect yet retain their modest and severe reticence relying on richness of material and soft harmonious coloring rather than striking and dazzling ornament  the next source of beauty in dress is the impression of truthfulness and reality it is a wellknown principle of the fine arts in all their branches that all shams and mere pretenses are to be rejecteda truth which ruskin has shown with the full lustre of his manycolored prosepoetry as stucco pretending to be marble and graining pretending to be wood are in false taste in building so false jewelry and cheap fineries of every kind are in bad taste so also is powder instead of natural complexion false hair instead of real and fleshpainting of every description i have even the hardihood to think and assert in the presence of a generation whereof not one woman in twenty wears her own hair that the simple shortcropped locks of rosa bonheur are in a more beautiful style of hairdressing than the most elaborate edifice of curls rats and waterfalls that is erected on any fair head nowadays  oh mr crowfield you hit us all now cried several voices  i know it girlsi know it i admit that you are all looking very pretty but i do maintain that you are none of you doing yourselves justice and that nature if you would only follow her would do better for you than all these elaborations a short crop of your own hair that you could brush out in ten minutes every morning would have a more real healthy beauty than the elaborate structures which cost you hours of time and give you the headache besides i speak of the short cropto put the case at the very lowest figurefor many of you have lovely hair of different lengths and susceptible of a variety of arrangements if you did not suppose yourself obliged to build after a foreign pattern instead of following out the intentions of the great artist who made you  is it necessary absolutely that every woman and girl should look exactly like every other one there are women whom nature makes with wavy or curly hair let them follow her there are those whom she makes with soft and smooth locks and with whom crinkling and cr√™ping is only a sham they look very pretty with it to be sure but after all is there but one style of beauty and might they not look prettier in cultivating the style which nature seemed to have intended for them  as to the floods of false jewelry glass beads and tinsel finery which seem to be sweeping over the toilet of our women i must protest that they are vulgarizing the taste and having a seriously bad effect on the delicacy of artistic perception it is almost impossible to manage such material and give any kind of idea of neatness or purity for the least wear takes away their newness and of all disreputable things tumbled rumpled and tousled finery is the most disreputable a simple white muslin that can come fresh from the laundry every week is in point of real taste worth any amount of spangled tissues a plain straw bonnet with only a ribbon across it is in reality in better taste than rubbishy birds or butterflies or tinsel ornaments  finally girls dont dress at haphazard for dress so far from being a matter of small consequence is in reality one of the fine artsso far from trivial that each country ought to have a style of its own and each individual such a liberty of modification of the general fashion as suits and befits her person her age her position in life and the kind of character she wishes to maintain  the only motive in toilet which seems to have obtained much as yet among young girls is the very vague impulse to look stylisha desire which must answer for more vulgar dressing than one would wish to see if girls would rise above this and desire to express by their dress the attributes of true ladyhood nicety of eye fastidious neatness purity of taste truthfulness and sincerity of nature they might form each one for herself a style having its own individual beauty incapable of ever becoming common and vulgar  a truly trained taste and eye would enable a lady to select from the permitted forms of fashion such as might be modified to her purposes always remembering that simplicity is safe that to attempt little and succeed is better than to attempt a great deal and fail  and now girls i will finish by reciting to you the lines old ben jonson addressed to the pretty girls of his time which form an appropriate ending to my remarks              still to be dressed   as you were going to a feast   still to be powdered still perfumed   lady it is to be presumed   though arts hid causes are not found   all is not sweet all is not sound    give me a look give me a face   that makes simplicity a grace   robes loosely flowing hair as free   such sweet neglect more taketh me   than all the adulteries of art   that strike my eyes but not my heart     xi  the cathedral   i am going to build a cathedral one of these days said i to my wife as i sat looking at the slant line of light made by the afternoon sun on our picture of the cathedral of milan  that picture is one of the most poetic things you have among your house ornaments said rudolph its original is the worlds chief beautya tribute to religion such as art never gave before and never can againas much before the pantheon as the alps with their virgin snows and glittering pinnacles are above all temples made with hands say what you will those middle ages that you call dark had a glory of faith that never will be seen in our days of cottonmills and manchester prints where will you marshal such an army of saints as stands in yonder whitemarble forest visibly transfigured and glorified in that celestial italian air saintship belonged to the medieval church the heroism of religion has died with it  thats just like one of your assertions rudolph said i you might as well say that nature has never made any flowers since linn√¶us shut up his herbarium we have no statues and pictures of modern saints but saints themselves thank god have never been wanting as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be  but what about your cathedral said my wife  oh yesmy cathedralyes when my stocks in cloudland rise ill build a cathedral larger than milans and the men but more particularly the women thereon shall be those who have done even more than saint paul tells of in the saints of old who subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens i am not now thinking of florence nightingale nor of the host of women who have been walking worthily in her footsteps but of nameless saints of more retired and private statedomestic saints who have tended children not their own through whoopingcough and measles and borne the unruly whims of fretful invalidsstockingdarning shirtmaking saintssaints who wore no visible garment of haircloth bound themselves with no belts of spikes and nails yet in their inmost souls were marked and seared with the red cross of a lifelong selfsacrificesaints for whom the mystical terms selfannihilation and selfcrucifixion had a real and tangible meaning all the stronger because their daily death was marked by no outward sign no mystical rites consecrated them no organmusic burst forth in solemn rapture to welcome them no habit of their order proclaimed to themselves and the world that they were the elect of christ the brides of another life but small eating cares daily prosaic duties the petty friction of all the littleness and all the inglorious annoyances of every day were as dust that hid the beauty and grandeur of their calling even from themselves they walked unknown even to their households unknown even to their own souls but when the lord comes to build his new jerusalem we shall find many a white stone with a new name thereon and the record of deeds and words which only he that seeth in secret knows many a humble soul will be amazed to find that the seed it sowed in such weakness in the dust of daily life has blossomed into immortal flowers under the eye of the lord  when i build my cathedral that woman i said pointing to a small painting by the fire shall be among the first of my saints you see her there in an everyday dresscap with a mortal threadlace border and with a very ordinary worked collar fastened by a visible and terrestrial breastpin there is no nimbus around her head no sign of the cross upon her breast her hands are clasped on no crucifix or rosary her clear keen hazel eye looks as if it could sparkle with mirthfulness as in fact it could there are in it both the subtile flash of wit and the subdued light of humor and though the whole face smiles it has yet a certain decisive firmness that speaks the soul immutable in good that woman shall be the first saint in my cathedral and her name shall be recorded as saint esther what makes saintliness in my view as distinguished from ordinary goodness is a certain quality of magnanimity and greatness of soul that brings life within the circle of the heroic to be really great in little things to be truly noble and heroic in the insipid details of everyday life is a virtue so rare as to be worthy of canonizationand this virtue was hers new england puritanism must be credited with the making of many such women severe as was her discipline and harsh as seems now her rule we have yet to see whether women will be born of modern systems of tolerance and indulgence equal to those grand ones of the olden times whose places now know them no more the inconceivable austerity and solemnity with which puritanism invested this mortal life the awful grandeur of the themes which it made household words the sublimity of the issues which it hung upon the commonest acts of our earthly existence created characters of more than roman strength and greatness and the good men and women of puritan training excelled the saints of the middle ages as a soul fully developed intellectually educated to closest thought and exercised in reasoning is superior to a soul great merely through impulse and sentiment  my earliest recollections of aunt esther for so our saint was known were of a brightfaced cheerful witty quickmoving little middleaged person who came into our house like a good fairy whenever there was a call of sickness or trouble if an accident happened in the great roystering family of eight or ten children and when was not something happening to some of us and we were shut up in a sickroom then duly as daylight came the quick step and cheerful face of aunt esthernot solemn and lugubrious like so many sickroom nurses but with a never failing flow of wit and story that could beguile even the most doleful into laughing at their own afflictions i remember how a fit of the quinsymost tedious of all sicknesses to an active childwas gilded and glorified into quite a f√™te by my having aunt esther all to myself for two whole days with nothing to do but amuse me she charmed me into smiling at the very pangs which had made me weep before and of which she described her own experiences in a manner to make me think that after all the quinsy was something with an amusing side to it her knowledge of all sorts of medicines gargles and alleviatives her perfect familiarity with every canon and law of good nursing and tending was something that could only have come from long experience in those good old new england days when there were no nurses recognized as a class in the land but when watching and the care of the sick were among those offices of christian life which the families of a neighborhood reciprocally rendered each other even from early youth she had obeyed a special vocation as sister of charity in many a sickroom and with the usual keen intelligence of new england had widened her powers of doing good by the reading of medical and physiological works her legends of nursing in those days of long typhus fever and other formidable and protracted forms of disease were to our ears quite wonderful and we regarded her as a sort of patron saint of the sickroom she seemed always so cheerful so bright and so devoted that it never occurred to us youngsters to doubt that she enjoyed above all things being with us waiting on us all day watching over us by night telling us stories and answering in her lively and always amusing and instructive way that incessant fire of questions with which a child persecutes a grown person  sometimes as a reward of goodness we were allowed to visit her in her own room a neat little parlor in the neighborhood whose windows looked down a hillside on one hand under the boughs of an appleorchard where daisies and clover and bobolinks always abounded in summer time and on the other faced the street with a green yard flanked by one or two shady elms between them and the street no nuns cell was ever neater no bees cell ever more compactly and carefully arranged and to us familiar with the confusion of a great family of little ones there was always something inviting about its stillness its perfect order and the air of thoughtful repose that breathed over it she lived there in perfect independence doing as it was her delight to do every office of life for herself she was her own cook her own parlor and chamber maid her own laundress and very faultless the cooking washing ironing and care of her premises were a slice of aunt esthers gingerbread one of aunt esthers cookies had we all believed certain magical properties such as belonged to no other mortal mixture even a handful of walnuts that were brought from the depths of her mysterious closet had virtues in our eyes such as no other walnuts could approach the little shelf of books that hung suspended by cords against her wall was sacred in our regard the volumes were like no other books and we supposed that she derived from them those stores of knowledge on all subjects which she unconsciously dispensed among usfor she was always telling us something of metals or minerals or gems or plants or animals which awakened our curiosity stimulated our inquiries and above all led us to wonder where she had learned it all even the slight restrictions which her neat habits imposed on our breezy and turbulent natures seemed all quite graceful and becoming it was right in our eyes to cleanse our shoes on scraper and mat with extra diligence and then to place a couple of chips under the heels of our boots when we essayed to dry our feet at her spotless hearth we marveled to see our own faces reflected in a thousand smiles and winks from her bright brass andironssuch andirons we thought were seen on earth in no other placeand a pair of radiant brass candlesticks that illustrated the mantelpiece were viewed with no less respect  aunt esthers cat was a model for all catsso sleek so intelligent so decorous and welltrained always occupying exactly her own cushion by the fire and never transgressing in one iota the proprieties belonging to a cat of good breeding she shared our affections with her mistress and we were allowed as a great favor and privilege now and then to hold the favorite on our knees and stroke her satin coat to a smoother gloss  but it was not for cats alone that she had attractions she was in sympathy and fellowship with everything that moved and lived knew every bird and beast with a friendly acquaintanceship the squirrels that inhabited the trees in the front yard were won in time by her blandishments to come and perch on her windowsills and thence by trains of nuts adroitly laid to disport themselves on the shining cherry teatable that stood between the windows and we youngsters used to sit entranced with delight as they gamboled and waved their feathery tails in frolicsome security eating rations of gingerbread and bits of seedcake with as good a relish as any child among us  the habits the rights the wrongs the wants and the sufferings of the animal creation formed the subject of many an interesting conversation with her and we boys with the natural male instinct of hunting trapping and pursuing were often made to pause in our career remembering her pleas for the dumb things which could not speak for themselves  her little hermitage was the favorite resort of numerous friends many of the young girls who attended the village academy made her acquaintance and nothing delighted her more than that they should come there and read to her the books they were studying when her superior and wide information enabled her to light up and explain much that was not clear to the immature students  in her shady retirement too she was a sort of egeria to certain men of genius who came to read to her their writings to consult her in their arguments and to discuss with her the literature and politics of the daythrough all which her mind moved with an equal step yet with a sprightliness and vivacity peculiarly feminine  her memory was remarkably retentive not only of the contents of books but of all that great outlying fund of anecdote and story which the quaint and earnest new england life always supplied there were pictures of peculiar characters legends of true events stranger than romance all stored in the cabinets of her mind and these came from her lips with the greater force because the precision of her memory enabled her to authenticate them with name date and circumstances of vivid reality from that shadowy line of incidents which marks the twilight boundary between the spiritual world and the present life she drew legends of peculiar clearness but invested with the mysterious charm which always dwells in that uncertain region and the shrewd flash of her eye and the keen bright smile with which she answered the wondering question what do you suppose it was or what could it have been showed how evenly rationalism in her mind kept pace with romance  the retired room in which she thus read studied thought and surveyed from afar the whole world of science and literature and in which she received friends and entertained children was perhaps the dearest and freshest spot to her in the world there came a time however when the neat little independent establishment was given up and she went to associate herself with two of her nieces in keeping house for a boardingschool of young girls here her lively manners and her gracious interest in the young made her a universal favorite though the cares she assumed broke in upon those habits of solitude and study which formed her delight from the day that she surrendered this independency of hers she had never for more than a score of years a home of her own but filled the trying position of an accessory in the home of others leaving the boardingschool she became the helper of an invalid wife and mother in the early nursing and rearing of a family of young childrenan office which leaves no privacy and no leisure her bed was always shared with some little one her territories were exposed to the constant inroads of little pattering feet and all the various sicknesses and ailments of delicate childhood made absorbing drafts upon her time  after a while she left new england with the brother to whose family she devoted herself the failing health of the wife and mother left more and more the charge of all things in her hands servants were poor and all the appliances of living had the rawness and inconvenience which in those days attended western life it became her fate to supply all other peoples defects and deficiencies wherever a hand failed there must her hand be whenever a foot faltered she must step into the ranks she was the one who thought for and cared for and toiled for all yet made never a claim that any one should care for her  it was not till late in my life that i became acquainted with the deep interior sacrifice the constant selfabnegation which all her life involved she was born with a strong vehement impulsive naturea nature both proud and sensitivea nature whose tastes were passions whose likings and whose aversions were of the most intense and positive character devoted as she always seemed to the mere practical and material she had naturally a deep romance and enthusiasm of temperament which exceeded all that can be written in novels it was chiefly owing to this that a home and a central affection of her own were never hers in her early days of attractiveness none who would have sought her could meet the high requirements of her ideality she never saw her hero and so never married family cares the tending of young children she often confessed were peculiarly irksome to her she had the head of a student a passionate love for the world of books a protestant convent where she might devote herself without interruption to study was her ideal of happiness she had too the keenest appreciation of poetry of music of painting and of natural scenery her enjoyment in any of these things was intensely vivid whenever by chance a stray sunbeam of the kind darted across the dusty path of her life yet in all these her life was a constant repression the eagerness with which she would listen to any account from those more fortunate ones who had known these things showed how ardent a passion was constantly held in check a short time before her death talking with a friend who had visited switzerland she said with great feeling all my life my desire to visit the beautiful places of this earth has been so intense that i cannot but hope that after my death i shall be permitted to go and look at them  the completeness of her selfdiscipline may be gathered from the fact that no child could ever be brought to believe she had not a natural fondness for children or that she found the care of them burdensome it was easy to see that she had naturally all those particular habits those minute pertinacities in respect to her daily movements and the arrangement of all her belongings which would make the meddling intrusive demands of infancy and childhood peculiarly hard for her to meet yet never was there a pair of toddling feet that did not make free with aunt esthers room never a curly head that did not look up in confiding assurance of a welcome smile to her bright eyes the inconsiderate and never ceasing requirements of children and invalids never drew from her other than a cheerful response and to my mind there is more saintship in this than in the private wearing of any number of haircloth shirts or belts lined with spikes  in a large family of careless noisy children there will be constant losing of thimbles and needles and scissors but aunt esther was always ready without reproach to help the careless and the luckless her things so well kept and so treasured she was willing to lend with many a caution and injunction it is true but also with a relish of right good will and to do us justice we generally felt the sacredness of the trust and were more careful of her things than of our own if a shade of sewingsilk were wanting or a choice button or a bit of braid or tape aunt esther cheerfully volunteered something from her wellkept stores not regarding the trouble she made herself in seeking the key unlocking the drawer and searching out in bag or parcel just the treasure demanded never was more perfect precision or more perfect readiness to accommodate others  her little income scarcely reaching a hundred dollars yearly was disposed of with a generosity worthy a fortune one tenth was sacredly devoted to charity and a still further sum laid by every year for presents to friends no christmas or new year ever came round that aunt esther out of this very tiny fund did not find something for children and servants her gifts were trifling in value but well timeda ball of threadwax a paper of pins a pincushionsomething generally so well chosen as to show that she had been running over our needs and noting what to give she was no less gracious as receiver than as giver the little articles that we made for her or the small presents that we could buy out of our childish resources she always declared were exactly what she needed and she delighted us by the care she took of them and the value she set upon them  her income was a source of the greatest pleasure to her as maintaining an independence without which she could not have been happy though she constantly gave to every family in which she lived services which no money could repay it would have been the greatest trial to her not to be able to provide for herself her dress always that of a true gentlewomanrefined quiet and neatwas bought from this restricted sum and her small traveling expenses were paid out of it she abhorred anything false or flashy her caps were trimmed with real thread lace and her silk dresses were of the best quality perfectly well made and kept and after all a little sum always remained over in her hands for unforeseen exigencies  this love of independence was one of the strongest features of her life and we often playfully told her that her only form of selfishness was the monopoly of saintshipthat she who gave so much was not willing to allow others to give to her that she who made herself servant of all was not willing to allow others to serve her  among the trials of her life must be reckoned much ill health borne however with such heroic patience that it was not easy to say when the hand of pain was laid upon her she inherited too a tendency to depression of spirits which at times increased to a morbid and distressing gloom few knew or suspected these sufferings so completely had she learned to suppress every outward manifestation that might interfere with the happiness of others in her hours of depression she resolutely forbore to sadden the lives of those around her with her own melancholy and often her darkest moods were so lighted up and adorned with an outside show of wit and humor that those who had known her intimately were astonished to hear that she had ever been subject to depression  her truthfulness of nature amounted almost to superstition from her promise once given she felt no change of purpose could absolve her and therefore rarely would she give it absolutely for she could not alter the thing that had gone forth from her lips our belief in the certainty of her fulfilling her word was like our belief in the immutability of the laws of nature whoever asked her got of her the absolute truth on every subject and when she had no good thing to say her silence was often truly awful when anything mean or ungenerous was brought to her knowledge she would close her lips resolutely but the flash in her eyes showed what she would speak were speech permitted in her last days she spoke to a friend of what she had suffered from the strength of her personal antipathies i thank god she said that i believe at last i have overcome all that too and that there has not been for some years any human being toward whom i have felt a movement of dislike  the last year of her life was a constant discipline of unceasing pain borne with that fortitude which could make her an entertaining and interesting companion even while the sweat of mortal agony was starting from her brow her own room she kept as a last asylum to which she would silently retreat when the torture became too intense for the repression of society and there alone with closed doors she wrestled with her agony the stubborn independence of her nature took refuge in this final fastness and she prayed only that she might go down to death with the full ability to steady herself all the way needing the help of no other hand  the ultimate struggle of earthly feeling came when this proud selfreliance was forced to give way and she was obliged to leave herself helpless in the hands of others god requires that i should give up my last form of selfwill she said now i have resigned this perhaps he will let me go home  in a good old age death the friend came and opened the door of this mortal state and a great soul that had served a long appenticeship to little things went forth into the joy of its lord a life of selfsacrifice and selfabnegation passed into a life of endless rest  but said rudolph i rebel at this life of selfabnegation and selfsacrifice i do not think it the duty of noble women who have beautiful natures and enlarged and cultivated tastes to make themselves the slaves of the sickroom and nursery  such was not the teaching of our new england faith said i absolute unselfishnessthe death of selfsuch were its teachings and such as esthers the characters it made do the duty nearest thee was the only message it gave to women with a mission and from duty to duty from one selfdenial to another they rose to a majesty of moral strength impossible to any form of mere selfindulgence it is of souls thus sculptured and chiseled by selfdenial and selfdiscipline that the living temple of the perfect hereafter is to be built the pain of the discipline is short but the glory of the fruition is eternal     xii  the new year 1865   here comes the first of january eighteen hundred and sixtyfive and we are all settled comfortably into our winter places with our winter surroundings and belongings all cracks and openings are calked and listed the double windows are in the furnace dragon in the cellar is ruddy and in good liking sending up his warming respirations through every pipe and register in the house and yet though an artificial summer reigns everywhere like bees we have our swarming placein my library there is my chimneycorner and my table permanently established on one side of the hearth and each of the female genus has so to speak pitched her own winter tent within sight of the blaze of my campfire i discerned today that jenny had surreptitiously appropriated one of the drawers of my studytable to knittingneedles and worsted and wicker workbaskets and stands of various heights and sizes seem to be planted here and there for permanence among the bookcases the canarybird has a sunny window and the plants spread out their leaves and unfold their blossoms as if there were no ice and snow in the street and rover makes a hearthrug of himself in winking satisfaction in front of my fire except when jenny is taken with a fit of discipline when he beats a retreat and secretes himself under my table  peaceable ah how peaceable home and quiet and warmth in winter and how when we hear the wind whistle we think of you o our brave brothers our saviors and defenders who for our sake have no home but the muddy camp the hard pillow of the barrack the weary march the uncertain fareyou the rank and file the thousand unnoticed ones who have left warm fires dear wives loving little children without even the hope of glory or famewithout even the hope of doing anything remarkable or perceptible for the cause you loveresigned only to fill the ditch or bridge the chasm over which your country shall walk to peace and joy good men and true brave unknown hearts we salute you and feel that we in our soft peace and security are not worthy of you when we think of you our simple comforts seem luxuries all too good for us who give so little when you give all  but there are others to whom from our bright homes our cheerful firesides we would fain say a word if we dared  think of a mother receiving a letter with such a passage as this in it it is extracted from one we have just seen written by a private in the army of sheridan describing the death of a private he fell instantly gave a peculiar smile and look and then closed his eyes we laid him down gently at the foot of a large tree i crossed his hands over his breast closed his eyelids down but the smile was still on his face i wrapt him in his tent spread my pockethandkerchief over his face wrote his name on a piece of paper and pinned it on his breast and there we left him we could not find pick or shovel to dig a grave there it isa history that is multiplying itself by hundreds daily the substance of what has come to so many homes and must come to so many more before the great price of our ransom is paid  what can we say to you in those many many homes where the light has gone out foreveryou o fathers mothers wives sisters haunted by a name that has ceased to be spoken on earthyou for whom there is no more news from the camp no more reading of lists no more tracing of maps no more letters but only a blank dead silence the battlecry goes on but for you it is passed by the victory comes but oh never more to bring him back to you your offering to this great cause has been made and been taken you have thrown into it all your living even all that you had and from henceforth your house is left unto you desolate o ye watchers of the cross ye waiters by the sepulchre what can be said to you we could almost extinguish our own homefires that seem too bright when we think of your darkness the laugh dies on our lip the lamp burns dim through our tears and we seem scarcely worthy to speak words of comfort lest we seem as those who mock a grief they cannot know  but is there no consolation is it nothing to have had such a treasure to give and to have given it freely for the noblest cause for which ever battle was setfor the salvation of your country for the freedom of all mankind had he died a fruitless death in the track of common life blasted by fever smitten or rent by crushing accident then might his most precious life seem to be as water spilled upon the ground but now it has been given for a cause and a purpose worthy even the anguish of your loss and sacrifice he has been counted worthy to be numbered with those who stood with precious incense between the living and the dead that the plague which was consuming us might be stayed the blood of these young martyrs shall be the seed of the future church of liberty and from every drop shall spring up flowers of healing o widow o mother blessed among bereaved women there remains to you a treasure that belongs not to those who have lost in any other wisethe power to say he died for his country in all the good that comes of this anguish you shall have a right and share by virtue of this sacrifice the joy of freedmen bursting from chains the glory of a nation newborn the assurance of a triumphant future for your country and the worldall these become yours by the purchasemoney of that precious blood  besides this there are other treasures that come through sorrow and sorrow alone there are celestial plants of root so long and so deep that the land must be torn and furrowed ploughed up from the very foundation before they can strike and nourish and when we see how gods plough is driving backward and forward and across this nation rending tearing up tender shoots and burying soft wildflowers we ask ourselves what is he going to plant  not the first year nor the second after the ground has been broken up does the purpose of the husbandman appear at first we see only what is uprooted and ploughed inthe daisy drabbled and the violet crushedand the first trees planted amid the unsightly furrows stand dumb and disconsolate irresolute in leaf and without flower or fruit their work is under the ground in darkness and silence they are putting forth long fibres searching hither and thither under the black soil for the strength that years hence shall burst into bloom and bearing  what is true of nations is true of individuals it may seem now winter and desolation with you your hearts have been ploughed and harrowed and are now frozen up there is not a flower left not a blade of grass not a bird to singand it is hard to believe that any brighter flowers any greener herbage shall spring up than those which have been torn away and yet there will nature herself teaches you today outdoors nothing but bare branches and shrouding snow and yet you know that there is not a tree that is not patiently holding out at the end of its boughs next years buds frozen indeed but unkilled the rhododendron and the lilac have their blossoms all ready wrapped in cerecloth waiting in patient faith under the frozen ground the crocus and the hyacinth and the tulip hide in their hearts the perfect forms of future flowers and it is even so with you your leaf buds of the future are frozen but not killed the soil of your heart has many flowers under it cold and still now but they will yet come up and bloom  the dear old book of comfort tells of no present healing for sorrow no chastening for the present seemeth joyous but grievous but afterwards it yieldeth peaceable fruits of righteousness we as individuals as a nation need to have faith in that afterwards it is sure to comesure as spring and summer to follow winter  there is a certain amount of suffering which must follow the rending of the great cords of life suffering which is natural and inevitable it cannot be argued down it cannot be stilled it can no more be soothed by any effort of faith and reason than the pain of a fractured limb or the agony of fire on the living flesh all that we can do is to brace ourselves to bear it calling on god as the martyrs did in the fire and resigning ourselves to let it burn on we must be willing to suffer since god so wills there are just so many waves to go over us just so many arrows of stinging thought to be shot into our soul just so many faintings and sinkings and revivings only to suffer again belonging to and inherent in our portion of sorrow and there is a work of healing that god has placed in the hands of time alone  time heals all things at last yet it depends much on us in our suffering whether time shall send us forth healed indeed but maimed and crippled and callous or whether looking to the great physician of sorrows and coworking with him we come forth stronger and fairer even for our wounds  we call ourselves a christian people and the peculiarity of christianity is that it is a worship and doctrine of sorrow the five wounds of jesus the instruments of the passion the cross the sepulchrethese are its emblems and watchwords in thousands of churches amid gold and gems and altars fragrant with perfume are seen the crown of thorns the nails the spear the cup of vinegar mingled with gall the sponge that could not slake that burning deaththirst and in a voice choked with anguish the church in many lands and divers tongues prays from age to age by thine agony and bloody sweat by thy cross and passion by thy precious death and burialmighty words of comfort whose meaning reveals itself only to souls fainting in the cold deathsweat of mortal anguish they tell all christians that by uttermost distress alone was the captain of their salvation made perfect as a saviour  sorrow brings us into the true unity of the churchthat unity which underlies all external creeds and unites all hearts that have suffered deeply enough to know that when sorrow is at its utmost there is but one kind of sorrow and but one remedy what matter in extremis whether we be called romanist or protestant or greek or calvinist  we suffer and christ suffered we die and christ died he conquered suffering and death he rose and lives and reignsand we shall conquer rise live and reign the hours on the cross were long the thirst was bitter the darkness and horror realbut they ended after the wail my god why hast thou forsaken me came the calm it is finished pledge to us all that our it is finished shall come also  christ arose fresh joyous no more to die and it is written that when the disciples were gathered together in fear and sorrow he stood in the midst of them and showed unto them his hands and his side and then were they glad already had the healed wounds of jesus become pledges of consolation to innumerable thousands and those who like christ have suffered the weary struggles the dim horrors of the crosswho have lain like him cold and chilled in the hopeless sepulchreif his spirit wakes them to life shall come forth with healing power for others who have suffered and are suffering  count the good and beautiful ministrations that have been wrought in this world of need and labor and how many of them have been wrought by hands wounded and scarred by hearts that had scarcely ceased to bleed  how many priests of consolation is god now ordaining by the fiery imposition of sorrow how many sisters of the bleeding heart daughters of mercy sisters of charity are receiving their first vocation in tears and blood  the report of every battle strikes into some home and heads fall low and hearts are shattered and only god sees the joy that is set before them and that shall come out of their sorrow he sees our morning at the same moment that he sees our nightsees us comforted healed risen to a higher life at the same moment that he sees us crushed and broken in the dust and so though tenderer than we he bears our great sorrows for the joy that is set before us  after the napoleonic wars had desolated europe the country was like all countries after war full of shattered households of widows and orphans and homeless wanderers a nobleman of silesia the baron von kottwitz who had lost his wife and all his family in the reverses and sorrows of the times found himself alone in the world which looked more dreary and miserable through the multiplying lenses of his own tears but he was one of those whose heart had been quickened in its death anguish by the resurrection voice of christ and he came forth to life and comfort he bravely resolved to do all that one man could to lessen the great sum of misery he sold his estates in silesia bought in berlin a large building that had been used as barracks for the soldiers and fitting it up in plain commodious apartments formed there a great familyestablishment into which he received the wrecks and fragments of families that had been broken up by the warorphan children widowed and helpless women decrepit old people disabled soldiers these he made his family and constituted himself their father and chief he abode with them and cared for them as a parent he had schools for the children the more advanced he put to trades and employments he set up a hospital for the sick and for all he had the priestly ministrations of his own christlike heart the celebrated professor tholuck one of the most learned men of modern germany was an early prot√©g√© of the old barons who discerning his talents put him in the way of a liberal education in his earlier years like many others of the young who play with life ignorant of its needs tholuck piqued himself on a lordly skepticism with regard to the commonly received christianity and even wrote an essay to prove the superiority of the mohammedan to the christian religion in speaking of his conversion he sayswhat moved me was no argument nor any spoken reproof but simply that divine image of the old baron walking before my soul that life was an argument always present to me and which i never could answer and so i became a christian in the life of this man we see the victory over sorrow how many with means like his when desolated by like bereavements have lain coldly and idly gazing on the miseries of life and weaving around themselves icy tissues of doubt and despairdoubting the being of a god doubting the reality of a providence doubting the divine love embittered and rebellious against the power which they could not resist yet to which they would not submit in such a chill heartfreeze lies the danger of sorrow and it is a mortal danger it is a torpor that must be resisted as the man in the whirling snows must bestir himself or he will perish the apathy of melancholy must be broken by an effort of religion and duty the stagnant blood must be made to flow by active work and the cold hand warmed by clasping the hands outstretched towards it in sympathy or supplication one orphan child taken in to be fed clothed and nurtured may save a heart from freezing to death and god knows this war is making but too many orphans  it is easy to subscribe to an orphan asylum and go on in ones despair and loneliness such ministries may do good to the children who are thereby saved from the street but they impart little warmth and comfort to the giver one destitute child housed taught cared for and tended personally will bring more solace to a suffering heart than a dozen maintained in an asylum not that the child will probably prove an angel or even an uncommonly interesting mortal it is a prosaic work this bringingup of children and there can be little rosewater in it the child may not appreciate what is done for him may not be particularly grateful may have disagreeable faults and continue to have them after much pains on your part to eradicate themand yet it is a fact that to redeem one human being from destitution and ruin even in some homely everyday course of ministrations is one of the best possible tonics and alteratives to a sick and wounded spirit  but this is not the only avenue to beneficence which the war opens we need but name the service of hospitals the care and education of the freedmenfor these are charities that have long been before the eyes of the community and have employed thousands of busy hands thousands of sick and dying beds to tend a race to be educated civilized and christianized surely were work enough for one age and yet this is not all war shatters everything and it is hard to say what in society will not need rebuilding and binding up and strengthening anew not the least of the evils of war are the vices which a great army engenders wherever it movesvices peculiar to military life as others are peculiar to peace the poor soldier perils for us not merely his body but his soul he leads a life of harassing and exhausting toil and privation of violent strain on the nervous energies alternating with sudden collapse creating a craving for stimulants and endangering the formation of fatal habits what furies and harpies are those that follow the army and that seek out the soldier in his tent far from home mother wife and sister tired disheartened and tempt him to forget his troubles in a momentary exhilaration that burns only to chill and to destroy evil angels are always active and indefatigable and there must be good angels enlisted to face them and here is employment for the slack hand of grief ah we have known mothers bereft of sons in this war who have seemed at once to open wide their hearts and to become mothers to every brave soldier in the field they have lived only to workand in place of one lost their sons have been counted by thousands  and not least of all the fields for exertion and christian charity opened by this war is that presented by womanhood the war is abstracting from the community its protecting and sheltering elements and leaving the helpless and dependent in vast disproportion for years to come the average of lone women will be largely increased and the demand always great for some means by which they may provide for themselves in the rude jostle of the world will become more urgent and imperative  will any one sit pining away in inert grief when two streets off are the midnight dancehouses where girls of twelve thirteen and fourteen are being lured into the way of swift destruction how many of these are daughters of soldiers who have given their hearts blood for us and our liberties  two noble women of the society of friends have lately been taking the gauge of suffering and misery in our land visiting the hospitals at every accessible point pausing in our great cities and going in their purity to those midnight orgies where mere children are being trained for a life of vice and infamy they have talked with these poor bewildered souls entangled in toils as terrible and inexorable as those of the slavemarket and many of whom are frightened and distressed at the life they are beginning to lead and earnestly looking for the means of escape in the judgment of these holy women at least one third of those with whom they have talked are children so recently entrapped and so capable of reformation that there would be the greatest hope in efforts for their salvation while such things are to be done in our land is there any reason why any one should die of grief one soul redeemed will do more to lift the burden of sorrow than all the blandishments and diversions of art all the alleviations of luxury all the sympathy of friends  in the roman catholic church there is an order of women called the sisters of the good shepherd who have renounced the world to devote themselves their talents and property entirely to the work of seeking out and saving the fallen of their own sex and the wonders worked by their selfdenying love on the hearts and lives of even the most depraved are credible only to those who know that the good shepherd himself ever lives and works with such spirits engaged in such a work a similar order of women exists in new york under the direction of the episcopal church in connection with st lukes hospital and another in england who tend the house of mercy of clewer  such benevolent associations offer objects of interest to that class which most needs something to fill the void made by bereavement the wounds of grief are less apt to find a cure in that rank of life where the sufferer has wealth and leisure the poor widow whoso husband was her all must break the paralysis of grief the hard necessities of life are her physicians they send her out to unwelcome yet friendly toil which hard as it seems has yet its healing power but the sufferer surrounded by the appliances of wealth and luxury may long indulge the baleful apathy and remain in the damp shadows of the valley of death till strength and health are irrecoverably lost how christlike is the thought of a woman graceful elegant cultivated refined whose voice has been trained to melody whose fingers can make sweet harmony with every touch whose pencil and whose needle can awake the beautiful creations of art devoting all these powers to the work of charming back to the sheepfold those wandering and bewildered lambs whom the good shepherd still calls his own jenny lind once when she sang at a concert for destitute children exclaimed in her enthusiasm is it not beautiful that i can sing so and so may not every woman feel when her graces and accomplishments draw the wanderer and charm away evil demons and soothe the sore and sickened spirit and make the christian fold more attractive than the dizzy gardens of false pleasure  in such associations and others of kindred nature how many of the stricken and bereaved women of our country might find at once a home and an object in life motherless hearts might be made glad in a better and higher motherhood and the stock of earthly life that seemed cut off at the root and dead past recovery may be grafted upon with a shoot from the tree of life which is in the paradise of god  so the beginning of this eventful 1865 which finds us still treading the winepress of our great conflict should bring with it a serene and solemn hope a joy such as those had with whom in the midst of the fiery furnace there walked one like unto the son of god  the great affliction that has come upon our country is so evidently the purifying chastening of a father rather than the avenging anger of a destroyer that all hearts may submit themselves in a solemn and holy calm still to bear the burning that shall make us clean from dross and bring us forth to a higher national life never in the whole course of our history have such teachings of the pure abstract right been so commended and forced upon us by providence never have public men been so constrained to humble themselves before god and to acknowledge that there is a judge that ruleth in the earth verily his inquisition for blood has been strict and awful and for every stricken household of the poor and lowly hundreds of households of the oppressor have been scattered the land where the family of the slave was first annihilated and the negro with all the loves and hopes of a man was proclaimed to be a beast to be bred and sold in market with the horse and the swinethat land with its fair name virginia has been made a desolation so signal so wonderful that the blindest passerby cannot but ask for what sin so awful a doom has been meted out the prophetic visions of nat turner who saw the leaves drop blood and the land darkened have been fulfilled the work of justice which he predicted is being executed to the uttermost  but when this strange work of judgment and justice is consummated when our country through a thousand battles and ten thousands of precious deaths shall have come forth from this long agony redeemed and regenerated then god himself shall return and dwell with us and the lord god shall wipe away all tears from all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he utterly take away     xiii  the noble army of martyrs   when the first number of the chimneycorner appeared the snow lay white on the ground the buds on the trees were closed and frozen and beneath the hard frostbound soil lay buried the last years flowerroots waiting for a resurrection  so in our hearts it was wintera winter of patient suffering and expectancya winter of suppressed sobs of inward bleedingsa cold choked compressed anguish of endurance for how long and how much god only could tell us  the first paper of the chimneycorner as was most meet and fitting was given to those homes made sacred and venerable by the cross of martyrdomby the chrism of a great sorrow that chimneycorner made bright by home firelight seemed a fitting place for a solemn act of reverent sympathy for the homes by whose darkness our homes had been preserved bright by whose emptiness our homes had been kept full by whose losses our homes had been enriched and so we ventured with trembling to utter these words of sympathy and cheer to those whom god had chosen to this great sacrifice of sorrow  the winter months passed with silent footsteps spring returned and the sun with ever waxing power unsealed the snowy sepulchre of buds and leavesbirds reappeared brooks were unchained flowers filled every desolate dell with blossoms and perfume and with returning spring in like manner the chill frost of our fears and of our dangers melted before the breath of the lord the great war which lay like a mountain of ice upon our hearts suddenly dissolved and was gone the fears of the past were as a dream when one awaketh and now we scarce realize our deliverance a thousand hopes are springing up everywhere like spring flowers in the forest all is hopefulness all is bewildering joy  but this our joy has been ordained to be changed into a wail of sorrow the kind hard hand that held the helm so steadily in the desperate tossings of the storm has been stricken down just as we entered portthe fatherly heart that bore all our sorrows can take no earthly part in our joys his were the cares the watchings the toils the agonies of a nation in mortal struggle and god looking down was so well pleased with his humble faithfulness his patient continuance in welldoing that earthly rewards and honors seemed all too poor for him so he reached down and took him to immortal glories well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy lord  henceforth the place of abraham lincoln is first among that noble army of martyrs who have given their blood to the cause of human freedom the eyes are yet too dim with tears that would seek calmly to trace out his place in history he has been a marvel and a phenomenon among statesmen a new kind of ruler in the earth there has been something even unearthly about his extreme unselfishness his utter want of personal ambition personal selfvaluation personal feeling  the most unsparing criticism denunciation and ridicule never moved him to a single bitter expression never seemed to awaken in him a single bitter thought the most exultant hour of party victory brought no exultation to him he accepted power not as an honor but as a responsibility and when after a severe struggle that power came a second time into his hands there was something preternatural in the calmness of his acceptance of it the first impulse seemed to be a disclaimer of all triumph over the party that had strained their utmost to push him from his seat and then a sober girding up of his loins to go on with the work to which he was appointed his last inaugural was characterized by a tone so peculiarly solemn and free from earthly passion that it seems to us now who look back on it in the light of what has followed as if his soul had already parted from earthly things and felt the powers of the world to come it was not the formal state paper of the chief of a party in an hour of victory so much as the solemn soliloquy of a great soul reviewing its course under a vast responsibility and appealing from all earthly judgments to the tribunal of infinite justice it was the solemn clearing of his soul for the great sacrament of death and the words that he quoted in it with such thrilling power were those of the adoring spirits that veil their faces before the thronejust and true are thy ways thou king of saints  among the rich treasures which this bitter struggle has brought to our country not the least is the moral wealth which has come to us in the memory of our martyrs thousands of men women and children too in this great conflict have endured tortures not accepting deliverance counting not their lives dear unto them in the holy cause and they have done this as understandingly and thoughtfully as the first christians who sealed their witness with their blood  let us in our hour of deliverance and victory record the solemn vow that our right hand shall forget her cunning before we forget them and their sufferingsthat our tongue shall cleave to the roof of our mouth if we remember them not above our chief joy  least suffering among that noble band were those who laid down their lives on the battlefield to whom was given a brief and speedy passage to the victors meed the mourners who mourn for such as these must give place to another and more august band who have sounded lower deeps of anguish and drained bitterer drops out of our great cup of trembling  the narrative of the lingering tortures indignities and sufferings of our soldiers in rebel prisons has been something so harrowing that we have not dared to dwell upon it we have been helplessly dumb before it and have turned away our eyes from what we could not relieve and therefore could not endure to look upon but now when the nation is called to strike the great and solemn balance of justice and to decide measures of final retribution it behooves us all that we should at least watch with our brethren for one hour and take into our account what they have been made to suffer for us  sterne said he could realize the miseries of captivity only by setting before him the image of a miserable captive with hollow cheek and wasted eye notching upon a stick day after day the weary record of the flight of time so we can form a more vivid picture of the sufferings of our martyrs from one simple story than from any general description and therefore we will speak right on and tell one story which might stand as a specimen of what has been done and suffered by thousands  in the town of andover massachusetts a boy of sixteen named walter raymond enlisted among our volunteers he was under the prescribed age but his eager zeal led him to follow the footsteps of an elder brother who had already enlisted and the father of the boy though these two were all the sons he had instead of availing himself of his legal right to withdraw him indorsed the act in the following letter addressed to his captain    andover mass august 15 1862    captain huntmy eldest son has enlisted in your company i send   you his younger brother he is and always has been in perfect   health of more than the ordinary power of endurance honest   truthful and courageous i doubt not you will find him on trial   all you can ask except his age and that i am sorry to say is   only sixteen yet if our country needs his service take him    your obedient servant    samuel raymond  the boy went forth to real service and to successive battles at kingston at whitehall and at goldsborough and in all this did his duty bravely and faithfully he met the temptations and dangers of a soldiers life with the purehearted firmness of a christian child neither afraid nor ashamed to remember his baptismal vows his sundayschool teachings and his mothers wishes  he had passed his promise to his mother against drinking and smoking and held it with a simple childlike steadiness when in the midst of malarious swamps physicians and officers advised the use of tobacco the boy writes to his mother a great many have begun to smoke but i shall not do it without your permission though i think it does a great deal of good  in his leisure hours he was found in his tent reading and before battle he prepared his soul with the beautiful psalms and collects for the day as appointed by his church and writes with simplicity to his friends  i prayed god that he would watch over me and if i fell receive my soul in heaven and i also prayed that i might not forget the cause i was fighting for and turn my back in fear  after nine months service he returned with a soldiers experience though with a frame weakened by sickness in a malarious region but no sooner did health and strength return than he again enlisted in the massachusetts cavalry service and passed many months of constant activity and adventure being in some severe skirmishes and battles with that portion of sheridans troops who approached nearest to richmond getting within a mile and a half of the city at the close of this raid so hard had been the service that only thirty horses were left out of seventyfour in his company and walter and two others were the sole survivors among eight who occupied the same tent  on the sixteenth of august walter was taken prisoner in a skirmish and from the time that this news reached his parents until the 18th of the following march they could ascertain nothing of his fate a general exchange of prisoners having been then effected they learned that he had died on christmas day in salisbury prison of hardship and privation  what these hardships were is alas easy to be known from those too wellauthenticated accounts published by our government of the treatment experienced by our soldiers in the rebel prisons  robbed of clothing of money of the soldiers best friend his sheltering blanketherded in shivering nakedness on the bare grounddeprived of every implement by which men of energy and spirit had soon bettered their lotforbidden to cut in adjacent forests branches for shelter or fuel to cook their coarse foodfed on a pint of cornandcobmeal per day with some slight addition of molasses or rancid meatdenied all mental resources all letters from home all writing to friendsthese men were cut off from the land of the living while yet they livedthey were made to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead  by such slow lingering torturessuch weary wasting anguish and sickness of body and soulit was the infernal policy of the rebel government either to wring from them an abjuration of their country or by slow and steady draining away of the vital forces to render them forever unfit to serve in her armies  walters constitution bore four months of this usage when death came to his release a fellow sufferer who was with him in his last hours brought the account to his parents  through all his terrible privations even the lingering pains of slow starvation walter preserved his steady simplicity his faith in god and unswerving fidelity to the cause for which he was suffering  when the rebels had kept the prisoners fasting for days and then brought in delicacies to tempt their appetite hoping thereby to induce them to desert their flag he only answered i would rather be carried out in that deadcart  when told by some that he must steal from his fellow sufferers as many did in order to relieve the pangs of hunger he answered no i was not brought up to that and so when his weakened system would no longer receive the cobmeal which was his principal allowance he set his face calmly towards death he grew gradually weaker and weaker and fainter and fainter and at last disease of the lungs set in and it became apparent that the end was at hand  on christmas day while thousands among us were bowing in our garlanded churches or surrounding festive tables this young martyr lay on the cold damp ground watched over by his destitute friends who sought to soothe his last hours with such scanty comforts as their utter poverty affordedraising his head on the block of wood which was his only pillow and moistening his brow and lips with water while his life ebbed slowly away until about two oclock when he suddenly roused himself stretched out his hand and drawing to him his dearest friend among those around him said in a strong clear voice  i am going to die go tell my father i am ready to die for i die for god and my countryand looking up with a triumphant smile he passed to the reward of the faithful  and now men and brethren if this story were a single one it were worthy to be had in remembrance but walter raymond is not the only noblehearted boy or man that has been slowly tortured and starved and done to death by the fiendish policy of jefferson davis and robert edmund lee nowherever this simple history shall be read there will arise hundreds of men and women who will testify just so died my son so died my brother so died my husband so died my father the numbers who have died in these lingering tortures are to be counted not by hundreds or even by thousands but by tens of thousands  and is there to be no retribution for a cruelty so vast so aggravated so cowardly and base and if there is retribution on whose head should it fall shall we seize and hang the poor ignorant stupid imbruted semibarbarians who were set as jailers to keep these hells of torment and inflict these insults and cruelties or shall we punish the educated intelligent chiefs who were the head and brain of the iniquity  if general lee had been determined not to have prisoners starved or abused does any one doubt that he could have prevented these things nobody doubts it his raiment is red with the blood of his helpless captives does any one doubt that jefferson davis living in ease and luxury in richmond knew that men were dying by inches in filth and squalor and privation in the libby prison within bowshot of his own door nobody doubts it it was his will his deliberate policy thus to destroy those who fell into his hands the chief of a socalled confederacy who could calmly consider among his official documents incendiary plots for the secret destruction of ships hotels and cities full of peaceable people is a chief well worthy to preside over such cruelties but his only just title is president of assassins and the whole civilized world should make common cause against such a miscreant  there has been on both sides of the water much weak illadvised talk of mercy and magnanimity to be extended to these men whose crimes have produced a misery so vast and incalculable the wretches who have tortured the weak and the helpless who have secretly plotted to supplement by dastardly schemes of murder and arson that strength which failed them in fair fight have been commiserated as brave generals and unfortunate patriots and efforts are made to place them within the comities of war  it is no feeling of personal vengeance but a sense of the eternal fitness of things that makes us rejoice when criminals who have so outraged every sentiment of humanity are arrested and arraigned and awarded due retribution at the bar of their countrys justice there are crimes against god and human nature which it is treason alike to god and man not to punish and such have been the crimes of the traitors who were banded together in richmond  if there be those whose hearts lean to pity we can show them where all the pity of their hearts may be better bestowed than in deploring the woes of assassins let them think of the thousands of fathers mothers wives sisters whose lives will be forever haunted with memories of the slow tortures in which their best and bravest were done to death  the sufferings of those brave men are ended nearly a hundred thousand are sleeping in those sad nameless gravesand may their rest be sweet there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor but o ye who have pity to spare spare it for the brokenhearted friends who to lifes end will suffer over and over all that their dear ones endured pity the mothers who hear their sons faint calls in dreams who in many a weary nightwatch see them pining and wasting and yearn with a lifelong unappeasable yearning to have been able to soothe those forsaken lonely deathbeds o man or woman if you have pity to spare spend it not on lee or davisspend it on their victims on the thousands of living hearts which these men of sin have doomed to an anguish that will end only with life  blessed are the mothers whose sons passed in battlea quick a painless a glorious death blessed in comparisonyet we weep for them we rise up and give place at sight of their mourninggarments we reverence the sanctity of their sorrow but before this other sorrow we are dumb in awful silence we find no words with which to console such grief we feel that our peace our liberties have been bought at a fearful price when we think of the sufferings of our martyred soldiers let us think of them it was for us they bore hunger and cold and nakedness they might have had food and raiment and comforts if they would have deserted our causeand they did not cut off from all communication with home or friends or brethren dragging on the weary months apparently forgottenstill they would not yield they would not fight against us and so for us at last they died  what return can we make them peace has come and we take up all our blessings restored and brightened but if we look we shall see on every blessing a bloody cross  when three brave men broke through the ranks of the enemy to bring to king david a draught from the home well for which he longed the generoushearted prince would not drink it but poured it out as an offering before the lord for he said is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives  thousands of noble hearts have been slowly consumed to secure to us the blessings we are rejoicing in we owe a duty to these our martyrsthe only one we can pay  in every place honored by such a history and example let a monument be raised at the public expense on which shall be inscribed the names of those who died for their country and the manner of their death such monuments will educate our young men in heroic virtue and keep alive to future ages the flame of patriotism and thus too to the aching heart of bereaved love shall be given the only consolation of which its sorrows admit in the reverence which is paid to its lost loved ones     our second girl   our establishment on beacon street had been for some days in a revolutionary state owing to the fact that our second girl had gone from us into the holy estate of matrimony alice was a pretty tidy neathanded creature and like many other blessings of life so good as to be little appreciated while with us it was not till she had left us that we began to learn that clean glass bright silver spotless and untumbled tablelinen and in short all the appetizing arrangements and appointments of our daily meals were not always and in all hands matters of course  in a day or two our silver began to have the appearance of old pewter and our glass looked as if nothing but muddy water could be found on coming down to our meals we found the dishes in all sorts of conversational attitudes on the tablethe meat placed diagonally the potatoes crosswise and the other vegetables scattered here and therewhile the table itself stood rakishly aslant and wore the air of a table slightly intoxicated  our beautiful china moreover began to have little chipped places in the edges most unusual and distressing to our eyes the handles vanished from our teacups and here and there a small mouthful appeared to be bitten out of the nose of some pretty fancy pitchers which had been the delight of my eyes  now if there is anything which i specially affect it is a refined and pretty table arrangement and at our house for years and years such had prevailed all of us had rather a weakness for china and the attractions of the fragile world as presented in the great crockerystores had been many times too much for our prudence and purse consequently we had all sorts of little domestic idols of the breakfast and dinner tablebohemianglass drinkingmugs of antique shape lovely bits of biscuit choicely moulded in classic patterns beauties oddities and quaintnesses in the way of especial teacups and saucers devoted to different members of the family wherein each took a particular and individual delight our especial china or glass pets of the table often started interesting conversations on the state of the plastic arts as applied to everyday life and the charm of being encircled even in the material act of feeding our mortal bodies with a sort of halo of art and beauty  all this time none of us ever thought in how great degree our feeling for elegance and refinement owed its gratification at the hour of meals to the care the tidiness and neat handling of our now lost and wedded alice  nothing presents so forlorn an appearance as battered and neglected finery of any kind and elegant pitchers with their noses knocked off cut glass with cracked edges and fragments of artistic teacups and saucers on a tumbled tablecloth have a peculiarly dismal appearance in fact we had really occasion to wonder at the perfectly weird and bewitched effect which one of our two hibernian successors to the pretty alice succeeded in establishing in our table department every caprice in the use and employment of dishes short of serving cream in the gravyboats and using the sugarbowl for pickled oysters and the creampitcher for vinegar seemed possible and permissible my horror was completed one morning on finding a china hen artistically represented as brooding on a nest made to cover not boiled eggs but a lot of greasy hash over which she sat so that her head and tail bewilderingly projected beyond the sides of the nest instead of keeping lengthwise within it as a respectable hen in her senses might be expected to do there certainly is a great amount of native vigor shown by these untrained hibernians in always finding an unexpected wrong way of doing the simplest thing it quite enlarges ones ideas of human possibilities  in a paroxysm of vexation i reviled matrimony and murphy oconnor who had stolen our household treasure and further expressed my griefs as elder sons are apt to do by earnest expostulations with the maternal officer on the discouraging state of things declaring most earnestly morning noon and night that all was going to ruin that everything was being spoiled that nothing was even decent and that if things went on so much longer i should be obliged to go out and boardby which style of remark i nearly drove that longsuffering woman frantic  do be reasonable tom said she can i make girls to order can i do anything more than try such as apply when they seem to give promise of success delicacy of hand neatness nicety of eye are not things likely to be cultivated in the irish boardinghouses from which our candidates emerge what chance have the most of them had to learn anything except the most ordinary rough housework a trained girl is rare as a nugget of gold amid the sands of the washings but let us persevere in trying and one will come at last  well i hope at any rate you have sent off that bridget i said in high disdain i verily believe if that girl stays a week longer i shall have to leave the house  compose yourself said my mother bridgets bundle is made up and she is going im sorry for her too poor thing for she seemed anxious to keep the place  at this moment the doorbell rang i presume thats the new girl whom they have sent round for me to see said my mother  i opened the door and there in fact stood a girl dressed in a neatfitting dark calico with a straw bonnet simply tied with some dark ribbon and a veil which concealed her face  is mrs seymour at home  she is  i was told that she wanted a girl  she does will you walk in  i pique myself somewhat on the power of judging character and there was something about this applicant which inspired hope so that before i introduced her into the room i felt it necessary to enlighten my mother with a little of my wisdom i therefore whispered in her ear with the decisive tone of an eldest son i think mother this one will do you had better engage her at once  have you lived out much said my mother commencing the usual inquiries  i have not maam i am but lately come to the city  are you irish  no maam i am american  have you been accustomed to the care of the tablesilver glass and china  i think maam i understand what is necessary for that  all this while the speaker remained standing with her veil down her answers seemed to be the briefest possible and yet notwithstanding the homely plainness of her dress there was something about her that impressed both my mother and me with an idea of cultivation and refinement above her apparent stationthere was a composure and quiet decision in her manner of speaking which produced the same impression on us both  what wages do you expect said my mother  whatever you have been accustomed to give to a girl in that place will satisfy me she said  there is only one thing i would like to ask she added with a slight hesitation and embarrassment of manner would it be convenient for me to have a room by myself  i nodded to my mother to answer in the affirmative  the three girls who composed our establishment had usually roomed in one large apartment but there was a small closet of a room which i had taken for books fishingrods guns and any miscellaneous property of my own i mentally turned these out and devoted the room to the newcomer whose appearance interested me  and as my mother hesitated i remarked with the assured tone of master of the house that certainly she could have a small room to herself  it is all i ask she briefly answered in that case i will come for the same wages you paid the last girl in my situation  when will you come said my mother  i am ready to come immediately i only want time to go and order my things to be sent here  she rose and left us saying that we might expect her that afternoon  well sir said my mother you seem to have taken it upon you to settle this matter on your own authority  my dear little mother said i in a patronizing tone i have an instinctive certainty that she will do i wanted to make sure of a prize for you  but the single room  never mind ill move all my traps out of the little thirdstory room its my belief that this girl or woman has seen better days and if she has a room to herself will be a necessity of her casepoor thing  i dont know said my mother hesitatingly i never wish to employ in my service those above their stationthey always make trouble and there is something in this womans air and manner and pronunciation that makes me feel as if she had been born and bred in cultivated society  supposing she has said i its quite evident that she for some reason means to conform to this position you seldom have a girl apply for work who comes dressed with such severe simplicity her manner is retiring and she seemed perfectly willing and desirous to undertake any of the things which you mentioned as among her daily tasks  on the afternoon of that day our new assistant came and my mother was delighted with the way she set herself at work the chinacloset desecrated and disordered in the preceding reigns of terror and confusion immediately underwent a most quiet but thorough transformation everything was cleaned brightened and arranged with a system and thoroughness which showed as my mother remarked a good head and all this was done so silently and quietly that it seemed like magic by the time we came down to breakfast the next morning we perceived that the reforms of our new prime minister had extended everywhere the diningroom was clean cool thoroughly dusted and freshly aired the tablecloth and napkins were smooth and clean the glass glittered like crystal and the silver wore a cheerful brightness added to this were some extra touches of refinement which i should call table coquetry the cold meat was laid out with green fringes of parsley and a bunch of heliotrope lemon verbena and mignonette with a fresh rosebud all culled from our little back yard stood in a wineglass on my mothers waiter  well mary you have done wonders said my mother as she took her place your arrangements restore appetite to all of us  mary received our praises with a gracious smile yet with a composed gravity which somewhat puzzled me she seemed perfectly obliging and amiable yet there was a serious reticence about her that quite piqued my curiosity i could not help recurring to the idea of a lady in disguise though i scarcely knew to what circumstance about her i could attach the idea so far from the least effort to play the lady her dress was in homely plainness a perfect contrast to that of the girls who had preceded her it consisted of strong darkblue stuff made perfectly plain to her figure with a narrow band of white linen around her throat her dark brown hair was brushed smoothly away from her face and confined simply behind in a net there was not the slightest pretension to coquetry in its arrangement in fact the object seemed to be to get it snugly out of the way rather than to make it a matter of ornament nevertheless i could not help remarking that there was a good deal of it and that it waved very prettily notwithstanding the care that had been taken to brush the curl out of it  she was apparently about twenty years of age her face was not handsome but it was a refined and intelligent one the skin had a sallow hue which told of ill health or of misfortune there were lines of trouble about the eye but the mouth and chin had that unmistakable look of firmness which speaks a person able and resolved to do a quiet battle with adverse fate and to go through to the end with whatever is needed to be done without fretfulness and without complaint she had large cool gray eyes attentive and thoughtful and she met the look of any one who addressed her with an honest firmness she seemed to be in fact simply and only interested to know and to do the work she had undertakenbut what there might be behind and beyond that i could not conjecture  one thing about her dress most in contrast with that of the other servants was that she evidently wore no crinoline the exuberance of this article in the toilet of our domestics had become threatening of late apparently requiring that the kitchens and pantries should be torn down and rebuilt as matters were our three girls never could be in our kitchen at one time without reefings and manoeuvrings of their apparel which much impeded any other labor and caused some loss of temper and our chinacloset was altogether too small for the officials who had to wash the china there and they were constantly at odds with my mother for her firmness in resisting their tendency to carry our china and silver to the general m√©l√©e of the kitchen sink moreover our diningroom not having been constructed with an eye to modern expansions of the female toilet it happened that if our table was to be enlarged for guests there arose serious questions of the waiters crinoline to complicate the calculations and for all these reasons i was inclined to look with increasing wonder on a being in female form who could so far defy the tyranny of custom as to dress in a convenient and comfortable manner adapted to the work which she undertook to perform a goodlooking girl without crinoline had a sort of unworldly freshness of air that really constituted a charm if it had been a piece of refined coquetryas certainly it was notit could not have been better planned  nothing could be more perfectly proper than the demeanor of this girl in relation to all the proprieties of her position she seemed to give her whole mind to it with an anxious exactness but she appeared to desire no relations with the family other than those of a mere business character it was impossible to draw her into conversation if a goodnatured remark was addressed to her on any subject such as in kindly disposed families is often extended as an invitation to a servant to talk a little with an employer mary met it with the briefest and gravest response that was compatible with propriety and with a definite and marked respectfulness of demeanor which had precisely the effect of throwing us all at a distance like ceremonious politeness in the intercourse of good society  i cannot make out our mary said i to my mother she is a perfect treasure but who or what do you suppose she is  i cannot tell you said my mother all i know is she understands her business perfectly and does it exactly but she no more belongs to the class of common servants than i do  does she associate with the other girls  not at allexcept at mealtimes and when about her work  i should think that would provoke the pride of sweet erin said i  one would think so said my mother but she certainly has managed her relations with them with a curious kind of tact she always treats them with perfect consideration and politeness talks with them during the times that they necessarily are thrown together in the most affable and cheerful manner and never assumes any airs of supremacy with them her wanting a room to herself gave them at first an idea that she would hold herself aloof from them and in fact for the first few days there was a subterranean fire in the kitchen ready to burst forth but now all that is past and in some way or other without being in the least like any of them she has contrived to make them her fast friends i found her last night in the kitchen writing a letter for the cook and the other day she was sitting in her room trimming a bonnet for katy and her opinion seems to be law in the kitchen she seldom sits there and spends most of her leisure in her own room which is as tidy as a bees cell  what is she doing there  reading sewing and writing as far as i can see there are a few books and a portfolio and a small inkstand thereand a neat little workbasket she is very nice with her needle and obliging in putting her talents to the service of the other girls but towards me she is the most perfectly silent and reserved being that one can conceive i cant make conversation with her she keeps me off by a most rigid respectfulness of demeanor which seems to say that she wants nothing from me but my orders i feel that i could no more ask her a question about her private affairs than i could ask one of mrs mcgregor in the next street but then it is a comfort to have some one so entirely trustworthy as she is in charge of all the nice little articles which require attention and delicate handling she is the only girl i ever had whom i could trust to arrange a parlor and a table without any looking after her eye and hand and her ideas are certainly those of a lady whatever her position may have been  in time our mary became quite a family institution for us seeming to fill a thousand little places in the domestic arrangement where a hand or an eye was needed she was deft at mending glass and china and equally so at mending all sorts of household things she darned the napkins and tablecloths in a way that excited my mothers admiration and was always so obliging and ready to offer her services that in time a resort to marys workbasket and ever ready needle became the most natural thing in the world to all of us she seemed to have no acquaintance in the city never went out visiting received no lettersin short seemed to live a completely isolated life and to dwell in her own thoughts in her own solitary little room  by that talent for systematic arrangement which she possessed she secured for herself a good many hours to spend there my mother seeing her taste for reading offered her the use of our books and one volume after another spent its quiet week or fortnight in her room and returned to our shelves in due time they were mostly works of solid informationhistory travelsand a geography and atlas which had formed part of the school outfit of one of the younger children she seemed interested to retain for some time it is my opinion said my mother that she is studyingperhaps with a view to getting some better situation  pray keep her with us said i if you can why dont you raise her wages you know that she does more than any other girl ever did before in her place and is so trustworthy that she is invaluable to us persons of her class are worth higher wages than common uneducated servants  my mother accordingly did make a handsome addition to marys wages and by the time she had been with us a year the confidence which her quiet manner had inspired was such that if my mother wished to be gone for a day or two the house with all that was in it was left trustingly in marys hands as with a sort of housekeeper she was charged with all the last directions as well as the keys to the jellies cakes and preserves with discretionary power as to their use and yet for some reason such was the ascendency she contrived to keep over her hibernian friends in the kitchen all this confidence evidently seemed to them quite as proper as to us  she aint quite like us said biddy one day mysteriously as she looked after her shes seen better days or im mistaken but she dont take airs on her she knows how to take the bad luck quiet like and do the best she can  has she ever told you anything of herself biddy said my mother  me no its a quiet tongue she keeps in her head she is ready enough to do good turns for us and to smooth out our ways and hear our stories but its close in her own affairs she is maybe she dont like to be talkin when talkin does no goodpoor soul  matters thus went on and i amused myself now and then with speculating about mary i would sometimes go to her to ask some of those little charities of the needle which our sex are always needing from feminine hands but never in the course of any of these little transactions could i establish the slightest degree of confidential communication if she sewed on a shirtbutton she did it with as abstracted an air as if my arm were a post which she was required to handle and not the arm of a goodlooking youth of twentyfiveas i fondly hoped i was and certain remarks which i once addressed to her in regard to her studies and reading in her own apartment were met with that cool wideopen gaze of her calm gray eyes that seemed to say pray what is that to your purpose sir and she merely answered is there anything else that you would like me to do sir with a marked deference that was really defiant  but one day i fancied i had got hold of a clue i was standing in our lower front hall when i saw young mcpherson whom i used to know in new york coming up the doorsteps  at the moment that he rung the doorbell our mary who had seen him from the chamber window suddenly grew pale and said to my mother please maam will you be so good as to excuse my going to the door i feel faint  my mother spoke over the banisters and i opened the door and let in mcpherson  he and i were jolly together as old classmates are wont to be and orders were given to lay a plate for him at dinner  mary prepared the service with her usual skill and care but pleaded that her illness increased so that it would be impossible for her to wait on table now nobody in the house thought there was anything peculiar about this but myself my mother indeed had noticed that marys faintness had come on very suddenly as she looked out on the street but it was i who suggested to her that mcpherson might have some connection with it  depend upon it mother he is somebody whom she has known in her former life and doesnt wish to meet said i  nonsense tom you are always getting up mysteries and fancying romances  nevertheless i took a vicious pleasure in experimenting on the subject and therefore a day or two after when i had got mary fairly within eyerange as she waited on table i remarked to my mother carelessly by the bye the mcphersons are coming to boston to live  there was a momentary jerk of marys hand as she was filling a tumbler and then i could see the restraint of selfcommand passing all over her i had hit something i knew so i pursued my game  yes i continued jim is here to look at houses he is thinking strongly of one in the next block  there was a look of repressed fear and distress on marys face as she hastily turned away and made an errand into the chinacloset  i have found a clue i said to my mother triumphantly going to her room after dinner did you notice marys agitation when i spoke of the mcphersons coming to boston by jove but the girl is plucky though it was the least little start and in a minute she had her visor down and her armor buckled this certainly becomes interesting  tom i certainly must ask you what business it is of yours said my mother settling back into the hortatory attitude familiar to mothers supposing the thing is as you thinksuppose that mary is a girl of refinement and education who from some unfortunate reason has no resource but her present positionwhy should you hunt her out of it if she is as you think a lady there is the strongest reason why a gentleman should respect her feelings i fear the result of all this restless prying and intermeddling of yours will be to drive her away and really now i have had her i dont know how i ever could do without her people talk of female curiosity said my mother with a slightly belligerent air i never found but men had fully as much curiosity as women now what will become of us all if your restlessness about this should be the means of marys leaving us you know the perfectly dreadful times we had before she came and i dont know anybody who has less patience to bear such things than you  in short my mother was in that positive state of mind which is expressed by the colloquial phrase of being on her high horse ias the male part of creation always must in such casesbecame very meek and retiring and promised to close my eyes and ears and not dream or think or want to know anything which it was not agreeable to mary and my mother that i should i would not look towards the doorbell nor utter a word about the mcphersons who by the bye decided to take the house in our neighborhood  but though i was as exemplary as one of the saints it did no good mary for some reasons known to herself became fidgety nervous restless and had frequent headaches and long crying spells in her own private apartment after the manner of women when something is the matter with them  my mother was as she always is with every creature in her employ maternal and sympathetic and tried her very best to get into her confidence  mary only confessed to feeling a little unwell and hinted obscurely that perhaps she should be obliged to leave the place but it was quite evident that her leaving was connected with the near advent of the mcphersons in the next block for i observed that she always showed some little irrepressible signs of nervousness whenever that subject was incidentally alluded to finally on the day that their furniture began to arrive and to provide abundant material for gossip and comment to the other members of the kitchen cabinet marys mind appeared suddenly made up she came into my mothers room looking as a certain sort of women do when they have made a resolution which they mean to stand byvery pale very quiet and very decided she asked to see my mother alone and in that interview she simply expressed gratitude for all her kindness to her but said that circumstances would oblige her to go to new york  my mother now tried her best to draw from her her history whatever that might be she spoke with tact and tenderness and with the respect due from one human being to another for my mother always held that every soul has its own inviolable private door which it has a right to keep closed and at which even queens and duchesses if they wish to enter must knock humbly and reverently  mary was almost overcome by her kindness she thanked her over and over at times my mother said she looked at her wistfully as if on the very point of speaking and then quietly gathering herself within herself she remained silent all that could be got from her was that it was necessary for her hereafter to live in new york  the servants in the kitchen with the warmheartedness of their race broke out into a perfect irish howl of sorrow and at the last moment biddy our fat cook fell on her neck and lifted up her voice and wept almost smothering her with her tumultuous embraces and the whole party of them would go with her to the new york station one carrying her shawl another her handbag and parasol with emulous affection and so our very pleasant and desirable second girl disappeared and we saw her no more  six months after this when our mary had become only a memory of the past i went to spend a week or two in newport and took among other matters and things a letter of introduction to mrs mcintyre a scotch lady who had just bought a pretty cottage there and as my friend who gave it told me would prove an interesting acquaintance  she has a pretty niece said he who im told is heiress to her property and is called a very nice girl  so at the proper time i lounged in one morning and found a very charming cosy homelike parlor arranged with all those little refined touches and artistic effects by which people of certain tastes and habits at once recognize each other in all parts of the world as by the tokens of freemasonry i felt perfectly acquainted with mrs mcintyre from the first glance at her parlorwhere the books the music the birds the flowers and that everlasting variety of female smallwork prepared me for a bright chatty easygoing homeloving kind of body such as i found mrs mcintyre to be she was as english and scotch ladies are apt to be very oddly dressed in very nice and choice articles it takes the eye of the connoisseur to appreciate these oddly dressed englishwomen they are like antique china but a discriminating eye soon sees the real quality that underlies their quaint adornment mrs mcintyre was scrupulously exquisitely neat all her articles of dress were of the choicest quality the yellow and tumbled lace that was fussed about her neck and wrists might have been the heirloom of a countess her satin gown though very short and very scanty was of a fabulous richness and the rings that glittered on her withered hands were of the fashion of two centuries ago but of wonderful brilliancy  she was very gracious in her reception as my letter was from an old friend and said many obliging things of me so i was taken at once to her friendship with the frankness characteristic of people of her class when they make up their minds to know you at all  i must introduce you to my mary she said she has just gone into the garden to cut flowers for the vases  in a moment more mary entered the room with a little white apron full of flowers and a fresh bloom on her cheeks and i wasas the reader has already anticipatedto my undisguised amazement formally introduced to miss mary mcintyre our second girl  of all things for which i consider women admirable there is no trait which fills me with such positive awe as their social tact and selfcommand evidently this meeting was quite as unexpected to mary as to me but except for a sudden flash of amused astonishment in the eyes and a becoming flush of complexion she met me as any thoroughbred young lady meets a young man properly presented by her maternal guardian  for my part i had one of those dreamy periods of existence in which people doubt whether they are awake or asleep the world seemed all turning topsyturvy i was filled with curiosity which i could with difficulty keep within the limits of conventional propriety  i see mr seymour that you are very much astonished said mary to me when mrs mcintyre had left the room to give some directions to the servants  upon my word said i i never was more so i feel as if i were in the midst of a fairy tale  nothing so remarkable as that she said but since i saw you a happy change as i need not tell you now has come over my life through the coming of my mothers sister to america when my mother died my aunt was in india the letters that i addressed to her in scotland were a long time in reaching her and then it took a long time for her to wind up her affairs there and find her way to this country  but said i what could  what could induce me to do as i did well i knew your mothers characterno matter how i needed a support and protection and i resolved for a time to put myself under her wing i knew that in case of any real trouble i should find in her a true friend and a safe adviser and i hoped to earn her esteem and confidence by steadily doing my duty some other time perhaps i will tell you more she added  the return of mrs mcintyre put an end to our private communication but she insisted with true oldworld hospitality on my remaining to dinner  here i was precipitated into a romance at once mary had just enough of that perverse feminine pleasure in teasing to keep my interest alive the fact was she saw me becoming entangled from day to day without any more misgivings of conscience than the celebrated spider of the poem felt when she invited the fly to walk into her parlor  mrs mcintyre took me in a very marked way into her good graces and i had every opportunity to ride walk sketch and otherwise to attend upon mary and mary was gracious also but so quietly and discreetly mistress of herself that i could not for the life of me tell what to make of her there were all sorts of wonders and surmises boiling up within me what was it about mcpherson was there anything there was mary engaged or was there any old affair etc etc not that it was any business of mine but then a fellow likes to know his ground beforebefore what i thought to myself and that unknown what every day assumed new importance in my eyes mary had many admirers her quiet easy selfpossessed manners her perfect tact and grace always made her a favorite but i could not help hoping that between her and me there was that confidential sense of a mutually kept secret which it is delightful to share with the woman you wish to please  why wont women sometimes enlighten a fellow a little in this dark valley that lies between intimate acquaintance and the awful final proposal to be sure there are kind souls who will come more than halfway to meet you but they are always sure to be those you dont want to meet the woman you want is always as reticent as a nut and leaves you the whole work of this last dread scene without a bit of help on her part to be sure she smiles on you but what of that you see she smiles also on tom dick and harry    bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike   and like the sun they shine on all alike  i fought out a battle of two or three weeks with my fair foe trying to get in advance some hint from her as to what she would do with me if i put myself at her mercy no use our sex may as well give up first as last before one of these quiet resolved little pieces of femininity who are perfect mistresses of all the peculiar weapons defensive and offensive of womanhood there was nothing for it but to surrender at discretion but when i had done this i was granted all the honors of war mrs mcintyre received me with an oldfashioned maternal blessing and all was as happy as possible  and now said mary i suppose sir you will claim a right to know all about me  something of the sort i said complacently  i know you have been dying of curiosity ever since i was waiting behind your lordships chair at your mothers i knew you suspected something thenconfess now  but what could have led you there  just hear my mother who was mrs mcintyres sister had by a first marriage only myself shortly after my fathers death she married a widower with several children as long as she lived i never knew what want or care or trouble was but just as i was entering upon my seventeenth year she died a year after her death my stepfather who was one of those men devoted to matrimony at all hazards married another woman by whom he had children  in a few years more he died and his affairs on examination proved to be in a very bad state there was in fact scarcely anything for us to live on our stepmother had a settlement from her brother the two other daughters of my father were married and went to houses of their own and i was left related really to nobody without property and without home  i suppose hundreds of young girls are from one reason or other left just in this way and have without any previous preparation in their education and habits to face the question how can i get a living  i assure you it is a serious question for a young girl who has grown up in the easy manner in which i had my stepfather had always been a cheery kindly generous man one of those who love to see people enjoy themselves and to have things done handsomely and had kept house in a free abundant hospitable manner so that when i came to look myself over in relation to the great uses of life i could make out very little besides expensive tastes and careless habits  i had been to the very best schools but then i had studied as most girls in easy circumstances do without a thought of using my knowledge for any practical purpose i could speak very fair english but how i did it or why i didnt knowall the technical rules of grammar had passed from my head like a dream i could play a little on the piano and sing a few songs but i did not know enough of music to venture to propose myself as a teacher and so with every other study all the situations of profit in the profession of teaching are now crowded and blocked by girls who have been studying for that express objectand what could i hope among them  my motherinlaw was a smart enterprising driving woman of the world who told all her acquaintance that of course she should give me a home although i was no kind of relation to her and who gave me to understand that i was under infinite obligations to her on this account and must pay for the privilege by making myself generally useful i soon found that this meant doing a servants work without wages during six months i filled i may say the place of a seamstress and nursery governess to some very ungoverned children varying with occasional weeks of servants work when either the table girl or the cook left a place vacant for all this i received my board and some castoff dresses and underclothes to make over for myself i was tired of this and begged my stepmother to find me some place where i could earn my own living she was astonished and indignant at the demand when providence had provided me a good home under respectable protection she said why should i ask to leave it for her part she thought the situation of a young lady making herself generally useful in domestic life in the family of her near connections was a delightful one she had no words to say how much more respectable and proper it was thus to live in the circle of family usefulness and protection than to go out in the world looking for employment  i did not suggest to her that the chief difference in the cases would be that in a hired situation i should have regular wages and regular work whereas in my present position it was irregular work and no wages  her views on the subject were perhaps somewhat beclouded by the extreme convenience she found in being able to go into company and to range about the city at all hours unembarrassed by those family cares which generally fall to the mistress but which her views of what constituted general usefulness devolved upon me  i had no retirement no leisure no fixed place anywhere my bed was in the nursery where the children felt always free to come and go and even this i was occasionally requested to resign to share the couch of the housemaid when sickness in the family or a surplus of guests caused us to be crowded for room  i grew very unhappy my health failed and the demands upon me were entirely beyond my strength and without any consideration the doer of all the odds and ends in a family has altogether the most work and least praise of any as i discovered to my cost i found one thing after another falling into my long list of appointed duties by a regular progress thus first it would be mary wont you see to the dusting of the parlors for bridget isetc etc this would be the form for a week or two and then mary have you dusted the parlors and at last mary why have you not dusted the parlors  as i said i never studied anything to practical advantage and though i had been through arithmetic and algebra i had never made any particular use of my knowledge but now under the influence of misfortune my thoughts took an arithmetical turn by inquiring among the servants i found that in different families in the neighborhood girls were receiving three dollars a week for rendering just such services as mine here was a sum of a hundred and fiftysix dollars yearly in ready money put into their hands besides their board the privilege of knowing their work exactly and having a control of their own time when certain definite duties were performed compared with what i was doing and receiving this was riches and ease and rest  after all i thought to myself why should not i find some respectable superior motherly woman and put myself under her as a servant make her my friend by good conduct and have some regular hours and some definite income instead of wearing out my life in service without pay nothing stood in my way but the traditionary shadow of gentility and i resolved it should not stop me  years before when i was only eight or ten years old i had met your mother with your family at the seaside where my mother took me i had seen a great deal of her and knew all about her i remembered well her habitual consideration for the nurses and servants in her employ i knew her address in boston and i resolved to try to find a refuge in her family and so there is my story i left a note with my stepmother saying that i was going to seek independent employment and then went to boston to your house there i hoped to find a quiet asylumat least till i could hear from my aunt in scotland the delay of hearing from her during those two years at your house often made me lowspirited  but what made you so afraid of mcpherson said i nervously i remember your faintness and all that the day he called  oh that why it was merely thisthey were on intimate visiting terms with my motherinlaw and i knew that it would be all up with my plans if they were to be often at the house  why didnt you tell my mother said i  i did think of it but thenshe gave me a curious glance  but what mary  well i could see plainly enough that there were no secrets between you and her and i did not wish to take so fine a young gentleman into my confidence said mary you will observe i was not out seeking flirtations but an honest independence                                       my mother was apprised of our engagement in due form and came to newport all innocence to call on miss mcintyre her intended daughterinlaw her astonishment at the moment of introduction was quite satisfactory to me  for the rest marys talents in making a home agreeable have had since then many years of proof and where any of the little domestic chasms appear which are formed by the shifting nature of the american workingclass she always slides into the place with a quiet grace and reminds me with a humorous twinkle of the eye that she is used to being second girl     a scholars adventures in the country   if we could only live in the country said my wife how much easier it would be to live  and how much cheaper said i  to have a little place of our own and raise our own things said my wife dear me i am heartsick when i think of the old place at home and fathers great garden what peaches and melons we used to have what green peas and corn now one has to buy every cents worth of these thingsand how they taste such wilted miserable corn such peas then if we lived in the country we should have our own cow and milk and cream in abundance our own hens and chickens we could have custard and icecream every day  to say nothing of the trees and flowers and all that said i  the result of this little domestic duet was that my wife and i began to ride about the city of  to look up some pretty interesting cottage where our visions of rural bliss might be realized country residences near the city we found to bear rather a high price so that it was no easy matter to find a situation suitable to the length of our purse till at last a judicious friend suggested a happy expedient  borrow a few hundred he said and give your note you can save enough very soon to make the difference when you raise everything you eat you know it will make your salary go a wonderful deal further  certainly it will said i and what can be more beautiful than to buy places by the simple process of giving ones notetis so neat and handy and convenient  why pursued my friend there is mr b my nextdoor neighbortis enough to make one sick of life in the city to spend a week out on his farm such princely living as one gets and he assures me that it costs him very littlescarce anything perceptible in fact  indeed said i few people can say that  why said my friend he has a couple of peachtrees for every month from june till frost that furnish as many peaches as he and his wife and ten children can dispose of and then he has grapes apricots etc and last year his wife sold fifty dollars worth from her strawberry patch and had an abundance for the table besides out of the milk of only one cow they had butter enough to sell three or four pounds a week besides abundance of milk and cream and madam has the butter for her pocket money this is the way country people manage  glorious thought i and my wife and i could scarcely sleep all night for the brilliancy of our anticipations  to be sure our delight was somewhat damped the next day by the coldness with which my good old uncle jeremiah standfast who happened along at precisely this crisis listened to our visions  youll find it pleasant children in the summer time said the hardfisted old man twirling his bluechecked pockethandkerchief but im sorry youve gone in debt for the land  oh but we shall soon save thatits so much cheaper living in the country said both of us together  well as to that i dont think it is to citybred folks  here i broke in with a flood of accounts of mr bs peachtrees and mrs bs strawberries butter apricots etc etc to which the old gentleman listened with such a long leathery unmoved quietude of visage as quite provoked me and gave me the worst possible opinion of his judgment i was disappointed too for as he was reckoned one of the best practical farmers in the county i had counted on an enthusiastic sympathy with all my agricultural designs  i tell you what children he said a body can live in the country as you say amazin cheap but then a body must know howand my uncle spread his pockethandkerchief thoughtfully out upon his knees and shook his head gravely  i thought him a terribly slow stupid old body and wondered how i had always entertained so high an opinion of his sense  he is evidently getting old said i to my wife his judgment is not what it used to be  at all events our place was bought and we moved out well pleased the first morning in april not at all remembering the ill savor of that day for matters of wisdom our place was a pretty cottage about two miles from the city with grounds that had been tastefully laid out there was no lack of winding paths arbors flower borders and rosebushes with which my wife was especially pleased there was a little green lot strolling off down to a brook with a thick grove of trees at the end where our cow was to be pastured  the first week or two went on happily enough in getting our little new pet of a house into trimness and good order for as it had been long for sale of course there was any amount of little repairs that had been left to amuse the leisure hours of the purchaser here a doorstep had given way and needed replacing there a shutter hung loose and wanted a hinge abundance of glass needed setting and as to painting and papering there was no end to that then my wife wanted a door cut here to make our bedroom more convenient and a china closet knocked up there where no china closet before had been we even ventured on throwing out a baywindow from our sittingroom because we had luckily lighted on a workman who was so cheap that it was an actual saving of money to employ him and to be sure our darling little cottage did lift up its head wonderfully for all this garnishing and furbishing i got up early every morning and nailed up the rosebushes and my wife got up and watered geraniums and both flattered ourselves and each other on our early hours and thrifty habits but soon like adam and eve in paradise we found our little domain to ask more hands than ours to get it into shape so says i to my wife i will bring out a gardener when i come next time and he shall lay the garden out and get it into order and after that i can easily keep it by the work of my leisure hours  our gardener was a very sublime sort of manan englishman and of course used to laying out noblemens placesand we became as grasshoppers in our own eyes when he talked of lord this and thats estate and began to question us about our carriage drive and conservatory and we could with difficulty bring the gentleman down to any understanding of the humble limits of our expectations merely to dress out the walks and lay out a kitchen garden and plant potatoes turnips beets and carrots was quite a descent for him in fact so strong were his √¶sthetic preferences that he persuaded my wife to let him dig all the turf off from a green square opposite the bay window and to lay it out into divers little triangles resembling small pieces of pie together with circles mounds and various other geometrical ornaments the planning and planting of which soon engrossed my wifes whole soul the planting of the potatoes beets carrots etc was intrusted to a raw irishman for as to me to confess the truth i began to fear that digging did not agree with me it is true that i was exceedingly vigorous at first and actually planted with my own hands two or three long rows of potatoes after which i got a turn of rheumatism in my shoulder which lasted me a week stooping down to plant beets and radishes gave me a vertigo so that i was obliged to content myself with a general superintendence of the garden that is to say i charged my englishman to see that my irishman did his duty properly and then got on to my horse and rode to the city but about one part of the matter i must say i was not remiss and that is in the purchase of seed and garden utensils not a day passed that i did not come home with my pockets stuffed with choice seeds roots etc and the variety of my garden utensils was unequaled there was not a priming hook of any pattern not a hoe rake or spade great or small that i did not have specimens of and flower seeds and bulbs were also forthcoming in liberal proportions in fact i had opened an account at a thriving seed store for when a man is driving business on a large scale it is not always convenient to hand out the change for every little matter and buying things on account is as neat and agreeable a mode of acquisition as paying bills with ones notes  you know we must have a cow said my wife the morning of our second week our friend the gardener who had now worked with us at the rate of two dollars a day for two weeks was at hand in a moment in our emergency we wanted to buy a cow and he had one to sella wonderful cow of a real english breed he would not sell her for any money except to oblige particular friends but as we had patronized him we should have her for forty dollars how much we were obliged to him the forty dollars were speedily forthcoming and so also was the cow  what makes her shake her head in that way said my wife apprehensively as she observed the interesting beast making sundry demonstrations with her horns i hope shes gentle  the gardener fluently demonstrated that the animal was a pattern of all the softer graces and that this headshaking was merely a little nervous affection consequent on the embarrassment of a new position we had faith to believe almost anything at this time and therefore came from the barn yard to the house as much satisfied with our purchase as job with his three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen her quondam master milked her for us the first evening out of a delicate regard to her feelings as a stranger and we fancied that we discerned forty dollars worth of excellence in the very quality of the milk  but alas the next morning our irish girl came in with a most rueful face and is it milking that baste youd have me be after she said sure and she wont let me come near her  nonsense biddy said i you frightened her perhaps the cow is perfectly gentle and with the pail on my arm i sallied forth the moment madam saw me entering the cow yard she greeted me with a very expressive flourish of her horns  this wont do said i and i stopped the lady evidently was serious in her intentions of resisting any personal approaches i cut a cudgel and putting on a bold face marched towards her while biddy followed with her milking stool apparently the beast saw the necessity of temporizing for she assumed a demure expression and biddy sat down to milk i stood sentry and if the lady shook her head i shook my stick and thus the milking operation proceeded with tolerable serenity and success  there said i with dignity when the frothing pail was full to the brim that will do biddy and i dropped my stick dump came madams heel on the side of the pail and it flew like a rocket into the air while the milky flood showered plentifully over me and a new broadcloth ridingcoat that i had assumed for the first time that morning whew said i as soon as i could get my breath from this extraordinary shower bath whats all this my wife came running towards the cow yard as i stood with the milk streaming from my hair filling my eyes and dropping from the tip of my nose and she and biddy performed a recitative lamentation over me in alternate strophes like the chorus in a greek tragedy such was our first mornings experience but as we had announced our bargain with some considerable flourish of trumpets among our neighbors and friends we concluded to hush the matter up as much as possible  these very superior cows are apt to be cross said i we must bear with it as we do with the eccentricities of genius besides when she gets accustomed to us it will be better  madam was therefore installed into her pretty pasture lot and my wife contemplated with pleasure the picturesque effect of her appearance reclining on the green slope of the pasture lot or standing ankle deep in the gurgling brook or reclining under the deep shadows of the trees she was in fact a handsome cow which may account in part for some of her sins and this consideration inspired me with some degree of indulgence towards her foibles  but when i found that biddy could never succeed in getting near her in the pasture and that any kind of success in the milking operations required my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening the matter wore a more serious aspect and i began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive it is very well to talk of the pleasures of the milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a drizzly rainy morning and equipping himself for a scamper through a wet pasture lot rope in hand at the heels of such a termagant as mine in fact madam established a regular series of exercises which had all to be gone through before she would suffer herself to be captured as first she would station herself plump in the middle of a marsh which lay at the lower part of the lot and look very innocent and absentminded as if reflecting on some sentimental subject suke suke suke i ejaculate cautiously tottering along the edge of the marsh and holding out an ear of corn the lady looks gracious and comes forward almost within reach of my hand i make a plunge to throw the rope over her horns and away she goes kicking up mud and water into my face in her flight while i losing my balance tumble forward into the marsh i pick myself up and full of wrath behold her placidly chewing her cud on the other side with the meekest air imaginable as who should say i hope you are not hurt sir i dash through swamp and bog furiously resolving to carry all by a coup de main then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging scampering and bopeeping among the trees of the grove interspersed with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid i always wondered how i caught her every day and when i had tied her head to one post and her heels to another i wiped the sweat from my brow and thought i was paying dear for the eccentricities of genius a genius she certainly was for besides her surprising agility she had other talents equally extraordinary there was no fence that she could not take down nowhere that she could not go she took the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure using her horns as handily as i could use a claw hammer whatever she had a mind to whether it were a bite in the cabbage garden or a run in the corn patch or a foraging expedition into the flower borders she made herself equally welcome and at home such a scampering and driving such cries of suke here and suke there as constantly greeted our ears kept our little establishment in a constant commotion at last when she one morning made a plunge at the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat and carried off one flap on her horns my patience gave out and i determined to sell her  as however i had made a good story of my misfortunes among my friends and neighbors and amused them with sundry whimsical accounts of my various adventures in the cowcatching line i found when i came to speak of selling that there was a general coolness on the subject and nobody seemed disposed to be the recipient of my responsibilities in short i was glad at last to get fifteen dollars for her and comforted myself with thinking that i had at least gained twentyfive dollars worth of experience in the transaction to say nothing of the fine exercise  i comforted my soul however the day after by purchasing and bringing home to my wife a fine swarm of bees  your bee now says i is a really classical insect and breathes of virgil and the augustan ageand then she is a domestic tranquil placid creature how beautiful the murmuring of a hive near our honeysuckle of a calm summer evening then they are tranquilly and peacefully amassing for us their stores of sweetness while they lull us with their murmurs what a beautiful image of disinterested benevolence  my wife declared that i was quite a poet and the beehive was duly installed near the flower plots that the delicate creatures might have the full benefit of the honeysuckle and mignonette my spirits began to rise i bought three different treatises on the rearing of bees and also one or two new patterns of hives and proposed to rear my bees on the most approved model i charged all the establishment to let me know when there was any indication of an emigrating spirit that i might be ready to receive the new swarm into my patent mansion  accordingly one afternoon when i was deep in an article that i was preparing for the north american review intelligence was brought me that a swarm had risen i was on the alert at once and discovered on going out that the provoking creatures had chosen the top of a tree about thirty feet high to settle on now my books had carefully instructed me just how to approach the swarm and cover them with a new hive but i had never contemplated the possibility of the swarm being like hamans gallows forty cubits high i looked despairingly upon the smoothbark tree which rose like a column full twenty feet without branch or twig what is to be done said i appealing to two or three neighbors at last at the recommendation of one of them a ladder was raised against the tree and equipped with a shirt outside of my clothes a green veil over my head and a pair of leather gloves on my hands i went up with a saw at my girdle to saw off the branch on which they had settled and lower it by a rope to a neighbor similarly equipped who stood below with the hive  as a result of this manoeuvre the fastidious little insects were at length fairly installed at housekeeping in my new patent hive and rejoicing in my success i again sat down to my article  that evening my wife and i took tea in our honeysuckle arbor with our little ones and a friend or two to whom i showed my treasures and expatiated at large on the comforts and conveniences of the new patent hive  but alas for the hopes of man the little ungrateful wretcheswhat must they do but take advantage of my oversleeping myself the next morning to clear out for new quarters without so much as leaving me a p p c such was the fact at eight oclock i found the new patent hive as good as ever but the bees i have never seen from that day to this  the rascally little conservatives said i i believe they have never had a new idea from the days of virgil down and are entirely unprepared to appreciate improvements  meanwhile the seeds began to germinate in our garden when we found to our chagrin that between john bull and paddy there had occurred sundry confusions in the several departments radishes had been planted broadcast carrots and beets arranged in hills and here and there a whole paper of seed appeared to have been planted bodily my good old uncle who somewhat to my confusion made me a call at this time was greatly distressed and scandalized by the appearance of our garden but by a deal of fussing transplanting and replanting it was got into some shape and order my uncle was rather troublesome as careful old people are apt to beannoying us by perpetual inquiries of what we gave for this and that and running up provoking calculations on the final cost of matters and we began to wish that his visits might be as short as would be convenient  but when on taking leave he promised to send us a fine young cow of his own raising our hearts rather smote us for our impatience  taint any of your new breeds nephew said the old man yet i can say that shes a gentle likely young crittur and better worth forty dollars than many a one thats cried up for ayrshire or durham and you shall be quite welcome to her  we thanked him as in duty bound and thought that if he was full of oldfashioned notions he was no less full of kindness and good will  and now with a new cow with our garden beginning to thrive under the gentle showers of may with our flower borders blooming my wife and i began to think ourselves in paradise but alas the same sun and rain that warmed our fruit and flowers brought up from the earth like sulky gnomes a vast array of purpleleaved weeds that almost in a night seemed to cover the whole surface of the garden beds our gardeners both being gone the weeding was expected to be done by meone of the anticipated relaxations of my leisure hours  well said i in reply to a gentle intimation from my wife when my article is finished ill take a day and weed all up clean  thus days slipped by till at length the article was dispatched and i proceeded to my garden amazement who could have possibly foreseen that anything earthly could grow so fast in a few days there were no bounds no alleys no beds no distinction of beet and carrot nothing but a flourishing congregation of weeds nodding and bobbing in the morning breeze as if to say we hope you are well sirweve got the ground you see i began to explore and to hoe and to weed ah did anybody ever try to clean a neglected carrot or beet bed or bend his back in a hot sun over rows of weedy onions he is the man to feel for my despair how i weeded and sweat and sighed till when high noon came on as the result of all my toils only three beds were cleaned and how disconsolate looked the good seed thus unexpectedly delivered from its sheltering tares and laid open to a broiling july sun every juvenile beet and carrot lay flat down wilted and drooping as if like me they had been weeding instead of being weeded  this weeding is quite a serious matter said i to my wife the fact is i must have help about it  just what i was myself thinking said my wife my flower borders are all in confusion and my petunia mounds so completely overgrown that nobody would dream what they were meant for  in short it was agreed between us that we could not afford the expense of a fullgrown man to keep our place yet we must reinforce ourselves by the addition of a boy and a brisk youngster from the vicinity was pitched upon as the happy addition this youth was a fellow of decidedly quick parts and in one forenoon made such a clearing in our garden that i was delighted bed after bed appeared to view all cleared and dressed out with such celerity that i was quite ashamed of my own slowness until on examination i discovered that he had with great impartiality pulled up both weeds and vegetables  this hopeful beginning was followed up by a succession of proceedings which should be recorded for the instruction of all who seek for help from the race of boys such a loser of all tools great and small such an invariable leaveropen of all gates and letterdown of bars such a personification of all manner of anarchy and ill luck had never before been seen on the estate his time while i was gone to the city was agreeably diversified with roosting on the fence swinging on the gates making poplar whistles for the children hunting eggs and eating whatever fruit happened to be in season in which latter accomplishment he was certainly quite distinguished after about three weeks of this kind of joint gardening we concluded to dismiss master tom from the firm and employ a man  things must be taken care of said i and i cannot do it tis out of the question and so the man was secured  but i am making a long story and may chance to outrun the sympathies of my readers time would fail me to tell of the distresses manifold that fell upon meof cows dried up by poor milkers of hens that wouldnt set at all and hens that despite all law and reason would set on one egg of hens that having hatched families straightway led them into all manner of high grass and weeds by which means numerous young chicks caught premature colds and perished and how when i with manifold toil had driven one of these inconsiderate gadders into a coop to teach her domestic habits the rats came down upon her and slew every chick in one night how my pigs were always practicing gymnastic exercises over the fence of the sty and marauding in the garden i wonder that fourier never conceived the idea of having his garden land ploughed by pigs for certainly they manifest quite a decided elective attraction for turning up the earth  when autumn came i went soberly to market in the neighboring city and bought my potatoes and turnips like any other man for between all the various systems of gardening pursued i was obliged to confess that my first horticultural effort was a decided failure but though all my rural visions had proved illusive there were some very substantial realities my bill at the seed store for seeds roots and tools for example had run up to an amount that was perfectly unaccountable then there were various smaller items such as horseshoeing carriage mendingfor he who lives in the country and does business in the city must keep his vehicle and appurtenances i had always prided myself on being an exact man and settling every account great and small with the going out of the old year but this season i found myself sorely put to it in fact had not i received a timely lift from my good old uncle i should have made a complete break down the old gentlemans troublesome habit of ciphering and calculating it seems had led him beforehand to foresee that i was not exactly in the moneymaking line nor likely to possess much surplus revenue to meet the note which i had given for my place and therefore he quietly paid it himself as i discovered when after much anxiety and some sleepless nights i went to the holder to ask for an extension of credit  he was right after all said i to my wife to live cheap in the country a body must know how     trials of a housekeeper   i have a detail of very homely grievances to present but such as they are many a heart will feel them to be heavythe trials of a housekeeper  poh says one of the lords of creation taking his cigar out of his mouth and twirling it between his two first fingers what a fuss these women do make of this simple matter of managing a family i cant see for my life as there is anything so extraordinary to be done in this matter of housekeeping only three meals a day to be got and cleared offand it really seems to take up the whole of their mind from morning till night i could keep house without so much of a flurry i know  now prithee good brother listen to my story and see how much you know about it i came to this enlightened west about a year since and was duly established in a comfortable country residence within a mile and a half of the city and there commenced the enjoyment of domestic felicity i had been married about three months and had been previously in love in the most approved romantic way with all the proprieties of moonlight walks serenades sentimental billets doux and everlasting attachment  after having been allowed as i said about three months to get over this sort of thing and to prepare for realities i was located for life as aforesaid my family consisted of myself and husband a female friend as a visitor and two brothers of my good man who were engaged with him in business  i pass over the first two or three days spent in that process of hammering boxes breaking crockery knocking things down and picking them up again which is commonly called getting to housekeeping as usual carpets were sewed and stretched laid down and taken up to be sewed over things were formed and reformed transformed and conformed till at last a settled order began to appear but now came up the great point of all during our confusion we had cooked and eaten our meals in a very miscellaneous and pastoral manner eating now from the top of a barrel and now from a fireboard laid on two chairs and drinking some from teacups and some from saucers and some from tumblers and some from a pitcher big enough to be drowned in and sleeping some on sofas and some on straggling beds and mattresses thrown down here and there wherever there was room all these pleasant barbarities were now at an end the house was in order the dishes put up in their places three regular meals were to be administered in one day all in an orderly civilized form beds were to be made rooms swept and dusted dishes washed knives scoured and all the et cetera to be attended to now for getting help as mrs trollope says and where and how were we to get it we knew very few persons in the city and how were we to accomplish the matter at length the house of employment was mentioned and my husband was dispatched thither regularly every day for a week while i in the mean time was very nearly dispatched by the abundance of work at home at length one evening as i was sitting completely exhausted thinking of resorting to the last feminine expedient for supporting life viz a good fit of crying my husband made his appearance with a most triumphant air at the door there margaret i have got you a couple at lastcook and chambermaid so saying he flourished open the door and gave to my view the picture of a little dry snuffylooking old woman and a great staring dutch girl in a green bonnet with red ribbons with mouth wide open and hands and feet that would have made a greek sculptor open his mouth too i addressed forthwith a few words of encouragement to each of this cultivatedlooking couple and proceeded to ask their names and forthwith the old woman began to snuffle and to wipe her face with what was left of an old silk pockethandkerchief preparatory to speaking while the young lady opened her mouth wider and looked around with a frightened air as if meditating an escape after some preliminaries however i found out that my old woman was mrs tibbins and my hebes name was kotterin also that she knew much more dutch than english and not any too much of either the old lady was the cook i ventured a few inquiries had she ever cooked  yes maam sartain she had lived at two or three places in the city  i suspect my dear said my husband confidently that she is an experienced cook and so your troubles are over and he went to reading his newspaper i said no more but determined to wait till morning the breakfast to be sure did not do much honor to the talents of my official but it was the first time and the place was new to her after breakfast was cleared away i proceeded to give directions for dinner it was merely a plain joint of meat i said to be roasted in the tin oven the experienced cook looked at me with a stare of entire vacuity the tin oven i repeated stands there pointing to it  she walked up to it and touched it with such an appearance of suspicion as if it had been an electrical battery and then looked round at me with a look of such helpless ignorance that my soul was moved i never see one of them things before said she  never saw a tin oven i exclaimed i thought you said you had cooked in two or three families  they does not have such things as them though rejoined my old lady nothing was to be done of course but to instruct her into the philosophy of the case and having spitted the joint and given numberless directions i walked off to my room to superintend the operations of kotterin to whom i had committed the making of my bed and the sweeping of my room it never having come into my head that there could be a wrong way of making a bed and to this day it is a marvel to me how any one could arrange pillows and quilts to make such a nondescript appearance as mine now presented one glance showed me that kotterin also was just caught and that i had as much to do in her department as in that of my old lady  just then the doorbell rang oh there is the doorbell i exclaimed run kotterin and show them into the parlor  kotterin started to run as directed and then stopped and stood looking round on all the doors and on me with a wofully puzzled air the street door said i pointing towards the entry kotterin blundered into the entry and stood gazing with a look of stupid wonder at the bell ringing without hands while i went to the door and let in the company before she could be fairly made to understand the connection between the ringing and the phenomenon of admission  as dinner time approached i sent word into my kitchen to have it set on but recollecting the state of the heads of department there i soon followed my own orders i found the tin oven standing out in the middle of the kitchen and my cook seated √† la turc in front of it contemplating the roast meat with full as puzzled an air as in the morning i once more explained the mystery of taking it off and assisted her to get it on to the platter though somewhat cooled by having been so long set out for inspection i was standing holding the spit in my hands when kotterin who had heard the doorbell ring and was determined this time to be in season ran into the hall and soon returning opened the kitchen door and politely ushered in three or four fashionable looking ladies exclaiming here she is as these were strangers from the city who had come to make their first call this introduction was far from proving an eligible onethe look of thunderstruck astonishment with which i greeted their first appearance as i stood brandishing the spit and the terrified snuffling and staring of poor mrs tibbins who again had recourse to her old pockethandkerchief almost entirely vanquished their gravity and it was evident that they were on the point of a broad laugh so recovering my selfpossession i apologized and led the way to the parlor  let these few incidents be a specimen of the four mortal weeks that i spent with these helps during which time i did almost as much work with twice as much anxiety as when there was nobody there and yet everything went wrong besides the young gentlemen complained of the patches of starch grimed to their collars and the streaks of black coal ironed into their dickies while one week every pockethandkerchief in the house was starched so stiff that you might as well have carried an earthen plate in your pocket the tumblers looked muddy the plates were never washed clean or wiped dry unless i attended to each one and as to eating and drinking we experienced a variety that we had not before considered possible  at length the old woman vanished from the stage and was succeeded by a knowing active capable damsel with a temper like a steeltrap who remained with me just one week and then went off in a fit of spite to her succeeded a rosy goodnatured merry lass who broke the crockery burned the dinner tore the clothes in ironing and knocked down everything that stood in her way about the house without at all discomposing herself about the matter one night she took the stopper from a barrel of molasses and came singing off upstairs while the molasses ran soberly out into the cellar bottom all night till by morning it was in a state of universal emancipation having done this and also dispatched an entire set of tea things by letting the waiter fall she one day made her disappearance  then for a wonder there fell to my lot a tidy efficient trained english girl pretty and genteel and neat and knowing how to do everything and with the sweetest temper in the world now said i to myself i shall rest from my labors everything about the house began to go right and looked as clean and genteel as marys own pretty self but alas this period of repose was interrupted by the vision of a clever trimlooking young man who for some weeks could be heard scraping his boots at the kitchen door every sunday night and at last miss mary with some smiling and blushing gave me to understand that she must leave in two weeks  why mary said i feeling a little mischievous dont you like the place  oh yes maam  then why do you look for another  i am not going to another place  what mary are you going to learn a trade  no maam  why then what do you mean to do  i expect to keep house myself maam said she laughing and blushing  oh ho said i that is it and so in two weeks i lost the best little girl in the world peace to her memory  after this came an interregnum which put me in mind of the chapter in chronicles that i used to read with great delight when a child where basha and elah and tibni and zimri and omri one after the other came on to the throne of israel all in the compass of half a dozen verses we had one old woman who stayed a week and went away with the misery in her tooth one young woman who ran away and got married one cook who came at night and went off before light in the morning one very clever girl who stayed a month and then went away because her mother was sick
