fact that impressed itself on my memory was a scene that took placeso i was toldwhen i was eighteen years old in my fathers house the grange at woodbury  my babyhood my childhood my girlhood my schooldays were all utterly blotted out by that one strange shock of horror my past life became exactly as though it had never been i forgot my own name i forgot my mothertongue i forgot everything i had ever done or known or thought about except for the power to walk and stand and perform simple actions of everyday use i became a baby in arms again with a nurse to take care of me the doctors told me later i had fallen into what they were pleased to call a second state i was examined and reported upon as a psychological curiosity but at the time i knew nothing of all this a thunderbolt as it were destroyed at one blow every relic every trace of my previous existence and i began life all over again with that terrible scene of blood as my first birthday and practical starting point  i remember it all even now with horrible distinctness each item in it photographed itself vividly on my minds eye i saw it as in a picturejust as clearly just as visually and the effect now i look back upon it with a maturer judgment was precisely like a photograph in another way too it was wholly unrelated in time and space it stood alone by itself lighted up by a single spark without rational connection before or after it what led up to it all i hadnt the very faintest idea i only knew the event itself took place and i like a statue stood rooted in the midst of it  and this was the picture as for many long months it presented itself incessantly to my startled brain by day and by night awake or asleep in colours more distinct than words can possibly paint them  i saw myself standing in a large square rooma very handsome old room filled with bookshelves like a library on one side stood a table and on the table a box a flash of light rendered the whole scene visible but it wasnt light that came in through the window it was rather like lightning so quick it was and clear and shortlived and terrible halfway to the door i stood and looked in horror at the sight revealed before my eyes by that sudden flash a man lay dead in a little pool of blood that gurgled by short jets from a wound on his left breast i didnt even know at the moment the man was my father though slowly afterward by the concurrent testimony of others i learnt to call him so but his relationship wasnt part of the picture to me there he was only in my eyes a mana man well past middle age with a long white beard now dabbled with the thick blood that kept gurgling so hatefully from the red spot in his waistcoat he lay on his back halfcurled round toward one arm exactly as he fell and the revolver he had been shot with lay on the ground not far from him  but that wasnt all the picture the murderer was there as well as the victim besides the table and the box and the wounded man and the pistol i saw another figure behind getting out of the window it was the figure of a man i should say about twentyfive or thirty he had just raised himself to the ledge and was poising to leap for the room as i afterwards learned though on the ground floor stood raised on a basement above the garden behind i couldnt see the mans face or any part of him indeed except his stooping back and his feet and his neck and his elbows but what little i saw was printed indelibly on the very fibre of my nature i could have recognised that man anywhere if i saw him in the same attitude i could have sworn to him in any court of justice on the strength of his back alone so vividly did i picture it  he was tall and thin but he stooped like a hunchback  there were other points worth notice in that strange mental photograph the man was welldressed and had the bearing of a gentleman looking back upon the scene long after when i had learned once more what words and things meant i could feel instinctively this was no common burglar no vulgar murderer whatever might have been the mans object in shooting my father i was certain from the very first it was not mere robbery but at the time im confident i never reasoned about his motives or his actions in any way i merely took in the scene as it were passively in a great access of horror which rendered me incapable of sense or thought or speech or motion i saw the table the box the apparatus by its side the murdered man on the floor the pistol lying pointed with its muzzle towards his body the pool of blood that soaked deep into the turkey carpet beneath the ledge of the window the young mans rounded back as he paused and hesitated and i also saw like an instantaneous flash one hand pushed behind him waving me off i almost thought with the gesture of one warning  why didnt i remember the murderers face that puzzled me long after i must have seen him before i must surely have been there when the crime was committed i must have known at the moment everything about it but the blank that came over my memory came over it with the fatal shot all that went before was to me as though it were not i recollect vaguely as the first point in my life that my eyes were shut hard and darkness came over me while they were so shut i heard an explosion next moment i believe i opened them and saw this picture no sensitiveplate could have photographed it more instantaneously as by an electric spark than did my retina that evening as for months after i saw it all in another moment i shut my lids again and all was over there was darkness once more and i was alone with my horror  in years then to come i puzzled my head much as to the meaning of the picture gradually step by step i worked some of it out with the aid of my friends and of the evidence tendered at the coroners inquest but for the moment i knew nothing of all that i was a newborn baby again only with this important difference they say our minds at birth are like a sheet of white paper ready to take whatever impressions may fall upon them mine was like a sheet all covered and obscured by one hateful picture it was weeks i fancy before i knew or was conscious of anything else but that the picture and a great horror divided my life between them  recollect i didnt even remember the murdered man was my father i didnt recognise the room as one in our own old house at woodbury i didnt know anything at all except what i tell you here i saw the corpse the blood the box on the table the wires by the side the bottles and baths and plates of an amateur photographers kit without knowing what they all meant i saw even the books not as books but as visible points of colour it had something the effect on me that it might have upon anyone else to be dropped suddenly on the stage of a theatre at the very moment when a hideous crime was being committed and to believe it real or rather to know it by some vague sense as hateful and actual  here my history began i date from that picture my second babyhood was passed in the shadow of the abiding horror       chapter ii  beginning life again      wha happened after is far more vague to me compared with the vividness of that one initial picture the events of the next few months have only the blurred indistinctness of all childish memories for i was a child once more in all save stature and had to learn to remember things just like other children  i will try to tell the whole tale over again exactly as it then struck me  after the picture i told you i shut my eyes in alarm for a second when i opened them once more there was a noise a very great noise and my recollection is that people had burst wildly into the room and were lifting the dead body and bending over it in astonishment and speaking loud to me and staring at me i believe they broke the door open though thats rather inference than memory i learnt it afterwards soon some of them rushed to the open window and looked out into the garden then suddenly a man gave a shout and leaping on to the sill jumped down in pursuit as i thought of the murderer as time went on more people flocked in and some of them looked at the body and the pool of blood and some of them turned round and spoke to me but what they said or what they meant i hadnt the slightest idea the noise of the pistolshot still rang loud in my ears the ineffable horror still drowned all my senses  after a while another man came in with an air of authority and felt my pulse and my brow and lifted me on to a sofa but i didnt even remember there was such a thing as a doctor i lay there for a while quite dazed and the man who was kindlylooking and closeshaven and fatherly gave me something in a glass after which he turned round and examined the body he looked hard at the revolver too and chalked its place on the ground then i saw no more for two women lifted me in their arms and took me up to bed and with that the first scene of my childhood seemed to end entirely  i lay in bed for a day or two during which time i was dimly aware of much commotion going on here and there in the house and the doctor came night and morning and tended me carefully i suppose i may call him the doctor now though at the time i didnt call him soi knew him merely as a visible figure i dont believe i thought at all during those earliest days or gave things names in any known language they rather passed before me dreamily in long procession like a vague panorama when people spoke to me it was like the sound of a foreign tongue i attached no more importance to anything they said than to the cawing of the rooks in the trees by the rectory  at the end of five days the doctor came once more and watched me a great deal and spoke in a low voice with a woman in a white cap and a clean white apron who waited on me daily as soon as he was gone my nurse as i learned afterwards to call herits so hard not to drop into the language of everyday life when one has to describe things to other peoplemy nurse got me up with much ado and solemnity and dressed me in a new black frock very dismal and ugly and put on me a black hat with a drearylooking veil and took me downstairs with the aid of a man who wore a suit of blue clothes and a queer kind of helmet the man was of the sort i now call a policeman these pictures are far less definite in my mind than the one that begins my second life but still in a vague kind of way i pretty well remember them  on the ground floor nurse made me walk and i walked out to the door where a cab was in waiting drawn slowly by a pair of horses people were looking on on either side between the door and the cabgreat crowds of people peering eagerly forward and two more men in blue suits were holding them off by main force from surging against me and incommoding me i dont think they wanted to hurt me it was rather curiosity than anger i saw in their faces but i was afraid and shrank back they were eager to see me however and pressed forward with loud cries so that the men in blue suits had hard work to prevent them  i know now there were two reasons why they wanted to see me i was the murdered mans daughter and i was a psychological phenomenon  we drove away through green lanes in the cab nurse and i and in spite of the horror which surrounded me always and the picture which recurred every time i shut my eyes to think i enjoyed that drive very much with all the fresh vividness of childish pleasure though i learnt later i was eighteen years old at least i was in my inner self just like a baby of ten months going tata at the end of the drive we drew up sharp at a house where some more men stood about with red bands on their caps and took boxes from the cab and put them into a van while nurse and i got into a different carriage drawn quickly by a thing that went puffpuff puffpuff i didnt know it was a railway and yet in a way i did i half forgot half remembered it things that id seen in my previous state seemed to come back to me in fact as soon as i saw them or at least to be more familiar to me than things id never seen before especially afterwards but while things were remembered persons i found byandby were completely forgotten or rather while i remembered after a while generalities such as houses and men recognising them in the abstract as a house or a man or a horse or a baby i forgot entirely particulars such as the names of people and the places i had lived in words soon came back to me names and facts were lost i knew the world as a whole not my own old part in it  well not to make my story too long in these early childish stages we went on the train as it seemed to me a long way across fields to aunt emmas i didnt know she was aunt emma then for indeed i had never seen her before but i remember arriving there at her pretty little cottage and seeing a sweet old ladybarely sixty i should say but with smooth white hairwho stood on the steps of the house and cried like a child and held out her hands to me and hugged me and kissed me and it was there that i learned my first word a great many times over she spoke about una she said it so often i caught vaguely at the sound and nurse when she answered her said una also then when aunt emma called me she always said una so it came to me dimly that una meant me but i didnt exactly recollect it had been my name before though i learned in due time afterwards that id always been called so however just at first i picked up the word as a child might pick it up and when some months later i began to talk easily i spoke of myself always in the third person as una i can remember with a smile now how i went one day to aunt emmai a great girl of eighteenand held up my skirt that id muddied in the street and said to her with great gravity  una naughty girl una got her frock wet aunt emma going to scold poor una for being so naughty  not that i often smiled in those days for in spite of aunt emmas kindness my second girlhood like my first was a very unhappy one the horror and the picture pursued me too close it was months and months before i could get rid for a moment of that persistent nightmare and yet i had everything else on earth to make me happy aunt emma lived in a pretty eastcoast town with high brackenclad downs and breezy common beyond while in front stretched great sands where i loved to race about and to play cricket and tennis it was the loveliest town that ever you saw in your life with a broken chancel to the grand old church and a lighthouse on a hill with delicious views to seaward the doctor had sent me there i know now as soon as i was well enough to move in order to get me away from the terrible associations of the grange at woodbury as long as i lived in the midst of scenes which would remind me of poor father he said and of his tragical death there was no hope of my recovery the only chance for me to regain what i had lost in that moment of shock was complete change of air of life of surroundings aunt emma for her part was only too glad to take me in and as poor papa had died intestate aunt emma was now of course my legal guardian  she was my mothers sister i learned as time went on and there had been feud while he lived between her and my father why i couldnt imagine she was the sweetest old soul i ever knew indeed and what on earth he could have quarrelled with her about i never could fathom she tended me so carefully that as months went by the horror began to decrease and my soul to become calm again i grew gradually able to remain in a room alone for a few minutes at a time and to sleep at night in a bed by myself if only there was a candle and nurse was in another bed in the same room close by me  yet every now and again a fresh shivering fit came on at such times i would cover my head with the bedclothes and cower and see the picture even so floating visibly in midair like a vision before me  my second education must have been almost as much of a business as my first had been only rather less longsome i had first to relearn the english language which came back to me by degrees much quicker of course than i had picked it up in my childhood then i had to begin again with reading writing and arithmeticall new to me in a way and all old in another whatever i learned and whatever i read seemed novel while i learned it but familiar the moment i had thoroughly grasped it to put it shortly i could remember nothing of myself but i could recall many things after a time as soon as they were told me clearly the process was rather a process of reminding than of teaching properly so called but it took some years for me to recall things even when i was reminded of them  i spent four years at aunt emmas growing gradually to my own age again at the end of that time i was counted a girl of twentytwo much like any other but i was older than my age and the shadow of the horror pursued me incessantly  all that time i knew too from what i heard said in the house that my fathers murderer had never been caught and that nobody even knew who he was or anything definite about him the police gave him up as an uncaught criminal he was still at large and might always be so i knew this from vague hints and from vague hints alone for whenever i tried to ask i was hushed up at once with an air of authority  una dearest aunt emma would say in her quiet fashion you mustnt talk about that night i have dr wades strict orders that nothing must be said to you about it and above all nothing that could in any way excite or arouse you  so i was fain to keep my peace for though aunt emma was kind she ruled me still in all things like a little girl as i was when i came to her       chapter iii  an unexpected visitor      one morning after id been four whole years at aunt emmas i heard a ring at the bell and looking over the stairs saw a tall and handsome man in a semimilitary coat who asked in a most audible voice for miss callingham  maria the housemaid hesitated a moment  miss callinghams in sir she answered in a somewhat dubious tone but i dont know whether i ought to let you see her or not my mistress is out and ive strict orders that no strangers are to call on miss callingham when her aunts not here  and she held the door ajar in her hand undecidedly  the tall man smiled and seemed to me to slip a coin quietly into marias palm  so much the better he answered with unobtrusive persistence i thought miss moore was out thats just why ive come im an officer from scotland yard and i want to see miss callinghamalonemost particularly  maria drew herself up and paused  my heart stood still within me at this chance of enlightenment i guessed what he meant so i called over the stairs to her in a tremor of excitement  show the gentleman into the drawingroom maria i ll come down to him at once  for i was dying to know the explanation of the picture that haunted me so persistently and as nobody at home would ever tell me anything worth knowing about it i thought this was as good an opportunity as i could get for making a beginning towards the solution of the mystery  well i ran into my own room as quick as quick could be and set my front hair straight and slipped on a hat and jacket for i was in my morning dress and then went down to the drawingroom to see the inspector  he rose as i entered he was a gentleman i felt at once his manner was as deferential as kind and as considerate to my sensitiveness as anything its possible for you to imagine in anyone  im sorry to have to trouble you miss callingham he said with a very gentle smile but i daresay you can understand yourself the object of my visit i could have wished to come in a more authorised way but ive been in correspondence with miss moore for some time past as to the desirability of reopening the inquiry with regard to your fathers unfortunate death and i thought the time might now have arrived when it would be possible to put a few questions to you personally upon that unhappy subject miss moore objected to my plan she thought it would still perhaps be prejudicial to your healtha point in which dr wade i must say entirely agrees with her nevertheless in the interests of justice as the murderer is still at large ive ventured to ask you for this interview because what i read in the newspapers about the state of your health  i interrupted him astonished  what you read in the newspapers about the state of my health i repeated thunderstruck why surely they dont put the state of my health in the newspapers  for i didnt know then i was a psychological phenomenon  the inspector smiled blandly and pulling out his pocketbook selected a cutting from a pile that apparently all referred to me  youre mistaken he said briefly the newspapers on the contrary have treated your case at great length see heres the latest report thats clipped from last wednesdays telegraph  i remembered then that a paragraph of just that size had been carefully cut out of wednesdays paper before i was allowed by aunt emma to read it aunt emma always glanced over the paper first indeed and often cut out such offending paragraphs but i never attached much importance to their absence before because i thought it was merely a little fussy result of aunties good old english sense of maidenly modesty i supposed she merely meant to spare my blushes i knew girls were often prevented on particular days from reading the papers  but now i seized the paragraph he handed me and read it with deep interest it was the very first time i had seen my own name in a printed newspaper i didnt know then how often it had figured there  the paragraph was headed the woodbury murder and it ran something like this as well as i can remember it  there are still hopes that the miscreant who shot mr vivian callingham at the grange at woodbury some four years since may be tracked down and punished at last for his cowardly crime it will be fresh in everyones memory as one of the most romantic episodes in that extraordinary tragedy that at the precise moment of her fathers death miss callingham who was present in the room during the attack and who alone might have been a witness capable of recognising or describing the wretched assailant lost her reason on the spot owing to the appalling shock to her nervous system and remained for some months in an imbecile condition gradually as we have informed our readers from time to time miss callinghams intellect has become stronger and stronger and though she is still totally unable to remember spontaneously any events that occurred before her fathers death it is hoped it may be possible by describing vividly certain trains of previous incidents to recall them in some small degree to her imperfect memory dr thornton of welbeck street who has visited her from time to time on behalf of the treasury in conjunction with dr wade her own medical attendant went down to bartononthesea on monday and once more examined miss callinghams intellect though the doctor is judiciously reticent as to the result of his visit it is generally believed at barton that he thinks the young lady sufficiently recovered to undergo a regular interrogatory and in spite of the fact that dr wade is opposed to any such proceeding at present as prejudicial to the ladys health it is not unlikely that the treasury may act upon their own medical officials opinion and send down an inspector from scotland yard to make inquiries direct on the subject from miss callingham in person  my head swam round it was all like a dream to me i held my forehead with my hands and gazed blankly at the inspector  you understand what all this means he said interrogatively leaning forward as he spoke you remember the murder  perfectly i answered him trembling all over i remember every detail of it i could describe you exactly all the objects in the room the picture it left behind has burned itself into my brain like a flash of lightning  the inspector drew his chair nearer now miss callingham he said in a very serious voice thats a remarkable expressionlike a flash of lightning bear in mind this is a matter of life and death to somebody somewhere somebodys neck may depend upon your answers will you tell me exactly how much you remember  i told him in a few words precisely how the scene had imprinted itself on my memory i recalled the room the box the green wires the carpet the man who lay dead in his blood on the floor the man who stood poised ready to leap from the window he let me go on unchecked till id finished everything i had to say spontaneously then he took a photograph from his pocket which he didnt show me looking at it attentively he asked me questions one by one about the different things in the room at the time in very minute detail where exactly was the box how did it stand relatively to the unlighted lamp what was the position of the pistol on the floor in which direction was my fathers head lying though it brought back the horror to me in a fuller and more terrible form than ever i answered all his questions to the very best of my ability i could picture the whole scene like a photograph to myself and i didnt doubt the object he held in his hand was a photograph of the room as it appeared after the murder he checked my statements one by one as i went on by reference to the photograph murmuring half to himself now and again yes yes exactly so thats right that was so at each item i mentioned  at the end of these inquiries he paused and looked hard at me  now miss callingham he said again peering deep into my eyes i want you to concentrate your mind very much not on this picture you carry so vividly in your own brain but on the events that went immediately before and after it pause long and think try hard to remember and first you say there was a great flash of light now answer me this was it one flash alone or had there been several  i stopped and racked my brain blank blank as usual  i cant remember i faltered out longing terribly to cry i can recall just that one scene and nothing else in the world before it  he looked at me fixedly jotting down a few words in his notebook as he looked then he spoke again still more slowly  now try once more he said with an encouraging air you saw this mans back as he was getting out of the window but cant you remember having seen his face before had he a beard a moustache what eyes what nose did you see the shot fired and if so what sort of person was the man who fired it  again i searched the pigeonholes of my memory in vain as i had done a hundred times before by myself  its no use i cried helplessly letting my hands drop by my side i cant remember a thing except the picture i dont know whether i saw the shot fired or not i dont know what the murderer looked like in the face ive told you all i know i can recall nothing else its all a great blank to me  the inspector hesitated a moment as if in doubt what step to take next then he drew himself up and said still more gravely  this inability to assist us is really very singular i had hoped after dr thorntons report that we might at last count with some certainty upon arriving at fresh results as to the actual murder i can see from what you tell me youre a young lady of intelligencemuch above the averageand great strength of mind its curious your memory should fail you so pointedly just where we stand most in need of its aid recollect nobody else but you ever saw the murderers face now im going to presume youre answering me honestly and try a bold means to arouse your dormant memory look hard and hark backis that the room you recollect is that the picture that still haunts and pursues you  he handed me the photograph he held in his fingers i took it all on fire the sight almost made me turn sick with horror to my awe and amazement it was indeed the very scene i remembered so well only of course it was taken from another point of view and represented things in rather different relative positions to those i figured them in but it showed my fathers body lying dead upon the floor it showed his poor corpse weltering helpless in its blood it showed myself as a girl of eighteen standing awestruck gazing on in blank horror at the sight and in the background half blurred by the summer evening light it showed the vague outline of a mans back getting out of the window on one side was the door that formed no part of my mental picture because it was at my back but in the photograph it too was indistinct as if in the very act of being burst open the details were vague in partprobably the picture had never been properly focussedbut the main figures stood out with perfect clearness and everything in the room was allowing for the changed point of view exactly as i remembered it in my persistent mental photograph  i drew a deep breath  thats my picture i said slowly but it recalls to me nothing new ii dont understand it  the inspector stared at me hard once more  do you know he asked how that photograph was produced and how it came into our possession  i trembled violently  no i dont i answered reddening buti think it had something to do with the flash like lightning  the inspector jumped at those words like a cat upon a mouse  quite right he cried briskly as one who at last after long search finds a hopeful clue where all seemed hopeless it had to do with the flash the flash produced it this is a photograph taken by your fathers process of course you recollect your fathers process  he eyed me close the words as he spoke them seemed to call up dimly some faint memory of my prenatal daysof my first state as i had learned from the doctors to call it but his scrutiny made me shrink i shut my eyes and looked back  i think i said slowly rummaging my memory half in vain i remember something about it it had something to do with photography hadnt itno no with the electric lighti cant exactly remember which will you tell me all about it  he leaned back in his chair and eyeing me all the time with that same watchful glance began to describe to me in some detail an apparatus which he said my father had devised for taking instantaneous photographs by the electric light with a clockwork mechanism it was an apparatus that let sensitiveplates revolve one after another opposite the lens of a camera and as each was exposed the clockwork that moved it produced an electric spark so as to represent such a series of effects as the successive positions of a horse in trotting my father it seemed was of a scientific turn and had just perfected this new automatic machine before his sudden death i listened with breathless interest for up to that time i had never been allowed to hear anything about my fatheranything about the great tragedy with which my second life began it was wonderful to me even now to be allowed to speak and ask questions on it with anybody so hedged about had i been all my days with mystery  as i listened i saw the inspector could tell by the answering flash in my eye that his words recalled something to me however vaguely as he finished i leant forward and with a very flushed face that i could feel myself i cried in a burst of recollection  yes yes i remember and the box on the tablethe box thats in my mental picture and is not in the photographthat was the apparatus youve just been describing  the inspector turned upon me with a rapidity that fairly took my breath away  well where are the other ones he asked pouncing down upon me quite fiercely  the other what i repeated amazed for i didnt really understand him  why the other photographs he replied as if trying to surprise me there must have been more you know it held six plates except for this one the apparatus when we found it was empty  his manner seemed to crush out the faint spark of recollection that just flickered within me i collapsed at once i couldnt stand such brusqueness  i dont know what you mean i answered in despair i never saw the plates i know nothing about them       chapter iv  the story of the photographs      the inspector scanned me close for a few minutes in silence he seemed doubtful suspicious at last he made a new move i believe you miss callingham he said more gently i can see this train of thought distresses you too much but i can see too our best chance lies in supplying you with independent clues which you may work out for yourself you must reeducate your memory you want to know all about this murder of course well now look over these papers theyll tell you in brief what little we know about it and they may succeed in striking afresh some resonant chord in your memory  he handed me a book of pasted newspaper paragraphs interspersed here and there in red ink with little manuscript notes and comments i began to read it with profound interest it was so strange for me thus to learn for the first time the history of my own life for i was quite ignorant as yet of almost everything about my first state and my father and mother  the paragraphs told me the whole story of the crime as far as it was known to the world from the very beginning first of all in the papers came the bald announcement that a murder had been committed in a country town in staffordshire and that the victim was mr vivian callingham a gentleman of means residing in his own house the grange at woodbury mr callingham was the inventor of the acmegraphic process the servants said the telegram to the london papers had heard the sound of a pistolshot about halfpast eight at night coming from the direction of mr callinghams library aroused by the report they rushed hastily to the spot and broke open the door which was locked from within as they did so a horrible sight met their astonished eyes mr callinghams dead body lay extended on the ground shot right through the heart and weltering in its lifeblood miss callingham stood by his side transfixed with horror and mute in her agony on the floor lay the pistol that had fired the fatal shot and just as the servants entered for one second of time the murderer who was otherwise wholly unknown was seen to leap from the window into the shrubbery below the gardener rushed after him and jumped down at the same spot but the murderer had disappeared as if by magic it was conjectured he must have darted down the road at full speed vaulted the gate which was usually locked and made off at a rapid run for the open country up to date of going to press the telegraph said he was still at large and had not been apprehended  that was the earliest accountbald simple unvarnished then came mysterious messages from the central press about the absence of any clue to identify the stranger he hadnt entered the house by any regular way it seemed unless indeed mr callingham had brought him home himself and let him in with the latchkey none of the servants had opened the door that evening to any suspicious character not a soul had they seen nor did any of them know a man was with their master in the library they heard voices to be surevoices loud at times and angrybut they supposed it was mr callingham talking with his daughter till roused by the fatal pistolshot the gardener said they had no cause for alarm even the footmarks the stranger might have left as he leaped from the window were obliterated by the prints of the gardeners boots as he jumped hastily after him the only person who could cast any light upon the mystery at all was clearly miss callingham who was in the room at the moment but miss callinghams mind was completely unhinged for the present by the nervous shock she had received as her father fell dead before her they must wait a few days till she recovered consciousness and then they might confidently hope that the murderer would be identified or at least so described that the police could track him  after that i read the report of the coroners inquest the facts there elicited added nothing very new to the general view of the case only the servants remarked on examination there was a strange smell of chemicals in the room when they entered and the doctors seemed to suggest that the smell might be that of chloroform mixed with another very powerful drug known to affect the memory miss callinghams present state they thought might thus perhaps in part be accounted for  you cant imagine how curious it was for me to see myself thus impersonally discussed at such a distance of time or to learn so long after that for ten days or more i had been the central object of interest to all reading england my name was bandied about without the slightest reserve i trembled to see how cavalierly the press had treated me  as i went on i began to learn more and more about my father he had made money in australia it was said and had come to live at woodbury some fourteen years earlier where my mother had died when i was a child of four and some accounts said she was a widow of fortune my father had been interested in chemistry and photography it seemed and had lately completed a new invention the acmegraph for taking successive photographs at measured intervals of so many seconds by electric light he was a grave stern man the papers said more feared than loved by his servants and neighbours but nobody about was known to have a personal grudge against him on the contrary he lived at peace with all men the motive for the murder remained to the end a complete mystery  on the second morning of the inquest however a curious thing happened the police it appeared had sealed up the room where the murder took place and allowed nobody to enter it till the inquiry was over but after the jury came round to view the room the policeman in charge found the window at the back of the house had been recently opened and the box with the photographic apparatus had been stolen from the library till that moment nobody had attached any importance to the presence of this camera it hadnt even been opened and examined by the police who had carefully noted everything else in the library but as soon as the box was missed strange questions began to be asked and conjecturally answered the police for the first time then observed that though it was halfpast eight at night when the murder occurred and the lamp was not lighted the witnesses who burst first into the room described all they saw as if they had seen it clearly they spoke of things as they would be seen in a very bright light with absolute definiteness this set up inquiry and the result of the inquiry was to bring out the fact which in the excitement of the moment had escaped the notice of all the servants that as they entered the room and stared about at the murder the electric flash of the apparatus was actually in operation but the scene itself had diverted their attention from the minor matter of the light that showed it  the inspector had been watching me narrowly as i read these extracts when i reached that point he broke in with a word of explanation  well that put me on the track you see he said leaning forward once more i thought to myself if the light was acting then the whole apparatus must necessarily have been at work and the scene as it took place must have been photographed act by act and step by step exactly as it happened at the time the murderer whoever he was cant have known the meaning of the flashes but later he must have come to learn in some way what the electric light meant and must have realised sooner than we did that therein the box in the form of six successive negatives of the stages in the crime was the evidence that would infallibly convict him of this murder he stroked his moustache thoughtfully and to think too he went on with a somewhat sheepish air we should have had those photographs there in our power all those days and nights and have let them in the end slip like that through our fingers to think he should have found it out sooner than we to think that an amateur like the murderer should have outwitted us  but how do you know i cried there was ever more than one photograph how do you know this wasnt the only negative  because the inspector answered quickly pointing to a figure in the corner of the proof do you see that six well that tells the tale each plate of the series was numbered so in the apparatus number six could only fall into focus after numbers one and two and three and four and five had first been photographed weve only got the lastand least useful for our purpose there must have been five earlier ones showing every stage of the crime if only wed known it  i was worked up now to a strange pitch of excitement  and how did this one come into your possession i asked all breathless if you managed to lay your hands on one why not on all six of them  the inspector drew a long breath  ah thats the trouble he replied still gazing at me hard you see it was this way as soon as we found the camera was missing we came to the conclusion the murderer must have returned to the grange to fetch it but it was a large and heavy box and the only one of its kind as yet manufactured so to carry it away in his hands would no doubt have led to instant detection i concluded therefore the man would take off the box entire so as to prevent the danger of removing the plates on the spot and as soon as he reached a place of safety in the shrubbery hed fling away the camera either destroying the incriminating negatives then and there or carrying them off with him the details of the invention had already been explained to me by your fathers instrumentmaker who set up the clockwork for him from his own designs and i knew that the removal of the plates from the box was a delicate and to some extent a difficult operation so i felt sure they could only have been taken out in a place of comparative safety not far from the house and i searched the shrubbery carefully to find the camera  and you found it at last i asked unable to restrain my agitation  i found it at last he answered near the far end of the grounds just flung into the deep grass behind a clump of lilacs the camera was there intact but five plates were missing the sixth from which the positive you hold in your hand was taken had got jammed in the mechanism in the effort to remove it evidently the murderer had tried to take out the plates in a very great hurry and with trembling hands as was not unnatural he had succeeded with five when the sixth stuck fast in the groove of the clockwork just at that moment as we judged either an alarm was raised in the rear or some panic fear seized on him probably the fellow judged right that the most incriminating pictures of all had by that time been removed and that the last would only show his back if it included him at all or if he came into focus perhaps he had even been able unconsciously to count the flashes at the moment and knew that before the sixth flash arrived he was on the ledge of the window at any rate he clearly gave up the attempt to remove the sixth and flung the whole apparatus away from him in a sudden access of horror we guessed as much both from the appearance of the spot where the grass was trampled down and the way the angle of the camera was imbedded forcibly in the soft ground of the shrubbery  and he got away with the rest i exclaimed following it up like a story but a story in which i was myself an unconscious character  no doubt the inspector answered stroking his chin regretfully and whats most annoying of all weve every reason to suppose the fellow stole the things only a few minutes before we actually missed them for we saw grounds for supposing he jumped away from the spot and climbed over the wall at the back cutting his hands as he went with the bottleglass on the top to prevent intruders and what makes us think only a very short time must have elapsed between the removal of the plates and the moment we came upon his tracks is thisthe blood from his cut hands was still fresh and wet upon the wall when we found it  then you only just missed him i exclaimed he got off by the skin of his teeth its wonderful when you were so near you shouldnt have managed to overtake him one would have thought you must have been able to track him to earth somehow  one would have thought so the inspector answered rather crestfallen but policemen after all are human like the rest of us we missed the one chance that might have led to an arrest and now what i want to ask you once more is this reflecting over what youve heard and read today do you think you can recollecta very small matterwhether or not there were several distinct flashes  i shut my eyes once more and looked hard into the past slowly as i looked a sort of dream seemed to come over me i saw it vaguely now or thought i saw it flash flash flash flash then the sound of the pistol then the picture and the horror and the awful blank i opened my eyes again and told the inspector so  and once more he went on in a very insinuating voice shut your eyes again and look back upon that day cant you remember whether or not just a moment before you saw the murderers face by the light of the flashes  i shut my eyes and thought again the flashes seemed to stand out clear and distinct but no detail supervenedno face came back to me i felt it was useless  impossible i said shortly it only makes my head swim i can remember no further  i see the inspector answered its just as dr wade said suggest a fact in your past history and you may possibly remember it but ask you to recall anything not suggested or already known and all seems a mere blank to you you havent the faintest idea then who the murderer was or what he looked like  i rose up before him solemnly and stared him full in the face i was wrought up by that time to a perfect pitch of excitement and interest  i havent the faintest idea i answered feeling myself a woman at last and realising my freedom i know and remember no more of it than you do but from this moment forth i shall not rest until ive found him out and tracked him down and punished him i shall never let my head rest in peace on my pillow until ive discovered my fathers murderer  thats well the inspector said sharply shutting his notes up to go if you persevere in that mind and do as you say we shall soon get to the bottom of the woodbury mystery  and even as he spoke a key turned in the front door i knew it was aunt emma come in from her marketing       chapter v  i become a woman      aunt emma burst into the room all horror and astonishment she looked at the inspector for a few seconds in breathless indignation then she broke out in a tone of fiery remonstrance which fairly surprised me  what do you mean by this intrusion sir how dare you force your way into my house in my absence how dare you encourage my servants to disobey my orders how dare you imperil this young ladys health by coming here to talk with her  she turned round to me anxiously i suppose i was very flushed with excitement and surprise  my darling child she cried growing pale all at once maria should never have allowed him to come inside the door you should have stopped upstairs you should have refused to see him i shall have you ill again on my hands as before after this hell have undone all the good the last four years have done for you  but i was another woman now i felt it in a moment  auntie dearest i answered moving across to her and laying my hand on her shoulder to soothe her poor ruffled nerves dont be the least alarmed its i whom to blame and not maria i told her to let this gentleman in hes done me good not harm im so glad to have been allowed at last to speak freely about it  aunt emma shook all over visibly to the naked eye  youll have a relapse my child she exclaimed half crying and clinging to me in her terror youll forget all youve learned youll go back these four years againleave my house at once sir you should never have entered it  i stood between them like a statue  no stop here a little longer i said waving my hand towards him imperiously i havent yet heard all its right for me to hear auntie you mistake im a woman at last i see what everything means im beginning to remember again for four years that hateful picture has haunted me night and day i could never shut my eyes for a minute without seeing it ive longed to know what it all meant but whenever ive asked ive been repressed like a baby im a baby no longer i feel myself a woman what the inspector here has told me already half opens my eyes i must have them opened altogether now i cant stop at this point im going back to woodbury  aunt emma clung to me still harder in a perfect agony of passionate terror  to woodbury my darling she cried going back oh una itll kill you  i think not the inspector answered with a very quiet smile miss callingham has recovered i venture to say far more profoundly than you imagine this repression our medical adviser tells us has been bad for her if shes allowed to visit freely the places connected with her earlier life it may all return again to her and the ends of justice may thus at last be served for us i notice already one hopeful symptom miss callingham speaks of going back to woodbury  aunt emma looked up at him horrified all her firmness was gone now  its you whove put this into her head she exclaimed in a ferment of horror shed never thought of it herself youve made her do it  on the contrary auntie i answered feeling my ground grow surer under me every moment as i spoke this gentleman has never even by the merest hint suggested such an idea to my mind it occurred to me quite spontaneously i must find out now who was my fathers murderer all the inspector has told me seems to arouse in my brain some vague forgotten chords it brings back to me faint shadows i feel sure if i went to woodbury i should remember much more and then you must see for yourself theres another reason dear that ought to make me go nobody but i ever saw the murderers face its a duty imposed upon me from without as it were never to rest again in peace till ive recognised him  aunt emma collapsed into an easychair her face was deadly pale her ringers trembled  if you go una she cried playing nervously with her gloves i must go with you too i must take care of you i must watch over you  i took her quivering hand in mine and stroked it gently it was a soft and delicate white little hand all marked inside with curious ragged scars that id known and observed ever since i first knew her i held it in silence for a minute somehow i felt our positions were reversed today this interview had suddenly brought out what i know now to be my own natural and inherent characterselfreliant active abounding in initiative for four years i had been as a child in her hands through mere force of circumstances my true self came out now and asserted its supremacy  no dear i said soothing her cheek i shall go alone i shall try what i can discover and remember myself without any suggestion or explanation from others i want to find out how things really stand i shall set to work on my own account to unravel this mystery  but how can you manage things by yourself aunt emma exclaimed wringing her hands despondently a girl of your age without even a maid and all alone in the world i shall be afraid to let you go dr wade wont allow it  i drew myself up very straight and realised the position  aunt emma i said plainly in a decided voice im a fullgrown woman over twentyone years of age mistress of my own acts and no longer a ward of yours i can do as i like and neither dr wade nor anybody else can prevent me he may advice me not to go he has no power to order me im my fathers heiress and a person of independent means ive been a cipher too long from today i take my affairs wholly into my own hands i ll go round at once and see your lawyer your banker your agent your tradesmen and tell them that henceforth i draw my own rents i receive my own dividends i pay my own bills i keep my own banking account and tomorrow or the next day i set out for woodbury  the inspector turned to aunt emma with a demonstrative smile  there you see for yourself he said well pleased what this interview has done for her  but aunt emma only drew back wrung her hands again in impotent despair and stared at him blankly like a wounded creature  the inspector took up his hat to leave i followed him out to the door and shook hands with him cordially the burden felt lighter on my shoulders already for four long years that mystery had haunted me day and night as a thing impenetrable incomprehensible not even to be inquired about the mere sense that i might now begin to ask what it meant seemed to make it immediately less awful and less burdensome to me  when i returned to the drawingroom aunt emma sat there on the sofa crying silently the very picture of misery  una she said without even raising her eyes to mine the man may have done as he says he may have restored you your mind again but whats that to me hes lost me my child my darling my daughter  i stooped down and kissed her dear tenderhearted auntie she had always been very good to me but i knew i was right for all that in becoming a womanin asserting my years my independence my freedom my duty to have shirked it any longer would have been sheer cowardice so i just kissed her silently and went up to my own roomto put on my brown hat and go out to the bankers  from that moment forth one fierce desire in life alone possessed me the brooding mystery that enveloped my life ceased to be passive and became an active goad as it were to push me forward incessantly on my search for the runaway i was the creature of a fixed idea a fiery energy spurred me on all my time i was determined now to find out my fathers murderer i was determined to shake off the atmosphere of doubt and forgetfulness i was determined to recall those first scenes of my life that so eluded my memory  yet strange to say it was rather a burning curiosity and a deep sense of duty that urged me on than anything i could properly call affectionstill less revenge or malice i didnt remember my father as alive at all the one thing i could recollect about him was the ghastly look of that dead body stretched at full length on the library floor with its white beard all dabbled in the red blood that clotted it it was abstract zeal for the discovery of the truth that alone pushed me on this search became to me henceforth an end and aim in itself it stood out as it were visibly in the imperative mood go here go there do this try that leave no stone unturned anywhere till youve tracked down the murderer those were the voices that now incessantly though inaudibly pursued me  next day i spent in preparations for my departure i would hunt up woodbury now though fifty aunt emmas held their gentle old faces up in solemn warning against me the day after that again i set out on my task the pull was hard i had taken my own affairs entirely into my own hands by that time and had provided myself with money for a long stay at woodbury but it was the very first railway journey i could ever remember to have made alone and i confess when i found myself seated all by myself in a firstclass carriage with no friend beside me my resolution for a moment almost broke down again it was so terrible to feel oneself boxed up there for an hour or two alone with that awful picture staring one in the face all the time from every fence and field and wall and hoarding it obliterated frys cocoa it fixed itself on the yellow face of colmans mustard  i went by liverpool street and drove across to paddington i had never to my knowledge been in london before and it was all so new to me but liverpool street was even newer to me than paddington i noticed a faint sense of familiarity seemed to hang about the great western line and that was not surprising i thought as i turned it over for of course in the old days when we lived at woodbury i must often have come down from town that way with my father yet i remembered nothing of it all definitely the most i could say was that i seemed dimly to recollect having been there beforethough when or where or how i hadnt the faintest notion  i was early at paddington the refreshment room somehow failed to attract me i walked up and down the platform waiting for my train as i did so a boy pasted a poster on a board it was the contentssheet of one of the baser little society papers something strange in it caught my eye i looked again in amazement oh great heavens what was this in big flaring letters  miss una callingham and the woodbury mystery is she screening the murderer a possible explanation  the words took my breath away they were too horrible to realise i positively couldnt speak i went up to the bookstall laid down my penny without moving my lips and took the paper in my hand in tremulous silence  i dared not open it there and then i confess i waited till i was in the train and on my way to woodbury  when i did so it was worse even worse than my fears the article was short but it was very hateful it said nothing straight outthe writer had evidently the fear of the law of libel before his eyes as he wrotebut it hinted and insinuated in a detestable undertone the most vile innuendoes a treasury doctor and a police inspector it said had lately examined miss callingham again and found her intellect in every respect perfectly normal except that she couldnt remember the face of her fathers murderer now this was odd because you see miss callingham was in the room at the moment the shot was fired and alone in the world miss callingham had seen the face of the man who fired it who was that man and why was he there unknown to the servants in a room with nobody but mr callingham and his daughter a correspondent who preferred to guard his incognito had suggested in this matter some very searching questions could the young manfor it was allowed he was younghave been there with miss callingham when mr callingham entered could he have been on terms of close intimacy with the heroine of the grange mystery who was a young ladyas all the world knew from her photographsof great personal attractiveness and who was also the heiress to a considerable property could he have been there then by appointment without the fathers knowledge was this the common case of a clandestine assignation could the father have returned to the house unexpectedly at an inopportune moment and found his daughter there closeted with a strangerperhaps with a man who had already for sufficient grounds been forbidden the premises such things might be in this world that we live in he would be a bold man who would deny them categorically could an altercation have arisen on the fathers return and the fatal shot have been fired in the ensuing scuffle and could the young lady then have feigned this curious relapse into that second state we had all heard so much about for no other reason than to avoid giving evidence at a trial for murder against her guilty lover  these were suggestions that deserved the closest consideration of the authorities charged with the repression of crime was it not high time that the inquest on mr callinghams body should be formally reopened and that the young lady now restored as we gathered to her own seven senses should be closely interrogated by trained legal crossexaminers  i laid down the paper with a burning face i learned now for the first time how closely my case had been watched how eagerly my every act and word had been canvassed it was hateful to think of my photograph having been exposed in every london shopwindow and of anonymous slanderers being permitted to indite such scandal as this about an innocent woman but at any rate it had the effect of sealing my fate if i meant even before to probe this mystery to the bottom i felt now no other course was possibly open to me for the sake of my own credit for the sake of my own good fame i must find out and punish my fathers murderer       chapter vi  reliving my life      often as you walk down a street a man or woman passes you by you look up at them and say to yourself i seem to know that face but you can put no name to it attach to it no definite idea no associations of any sort that was just how woodbury struck me when i first came back to it the houses the streets the people were in a way familiar yet i could no more have found my way alone from the station to the grange than i could find my way alone from here to kamschatka  so i drove up first in search of lodgings at the station even several people had bowed or shaken hands with me respectfully as i descended from the train they came up as if they thought i must recognise them at once there was recognition in their eyes but when they met my blank stare they seemed to remember all about it and merely murmured in strange tones  goodmorning miss so youre here glad to see youve come back again at last to woodbury  this reception dazzled me it was so strange so uncanny i was glad to get away in a fly by myself and to be driven to lodgings in the clean little high street for to me it wasnt really coming back at all it was coming to a strange town where everyone knew me and i knew nobody  youd like to go to janes of course the driver said to me with a friendly nod as he reached the high street and not liking to confess my forgetfulness of jane i responded with warmth that janes would no doubt exactly suit me  we drew up at the door of a neat little house the driver rang the bell  miss unas here he said confidentially and shes looking for lodgings  it was inexpressibly strange and weird to me this onesided recognition this unfamiliar familiarity it gave me a queer thrill of the supernatural that i can hardly express to you but i didnt know what to do when a kindlyfaced middleaged english upperclass servant rushed out at me openarmed and hugging me hard to her breast exclaimed with many loud kisses  miss una miss una so its you dear so it is then youve come back at last to us  i could hardly imagine what to say or do the utmost i could assert with truth was janes face wasnt exactly and entirely in all ways unfamiliar to me yet i could see jane herself was so unfeignedly delighted to see me again that i hadnt the heart to confess id forgotten her very existence so i took her two hands in mine since friendliness begets friendlinessand holding her off a little way for fear the kisses should be repeated i said to her very gravely  you see jane since those days ive had a terrible shock and you can hardly expect me to remember anything its all like a dream to me you must forgive me if i dont recall it just at once as i ought to do  oh yes miss jane answered holding my hands in her delight and weeping volubly weve read about all that of course in the london newspapers but there im glad anyhow you remembered to come and look for my lodgings i think i should just have sat down and cried if they told me miss unad come back to woodbury and never so much as asked to see me  i dont think i ever felt so like a hypocrite in my life before but i realised at least that even if janes lodgings were discomfort embodied i must take them and stop in them while i remained there now nothing else was possible i couldnt go elsewhere  fortunately however the rooms turned out to be as neat as a new pin and as admirably kept as any woman in england could keep them i gathered from the very first of course that jane had been one of the servants at the grange in the days of my first state and while i drank my cup of tea jane herself came in and talked volubly to me disclosing to me parenthetically the further fact that she was the parlourmaid at the time of my fathers murder that gave me a clue to her identity then she was the witness greenfield who gave evidence at the inquest i made a mental note of that and determined to look up what shed said to the coroner in the book of extracts the inspector gave me as soon as i got alone in my bedroom that evening  after dinner however jane came in again with the freedom of an old servant and talked to me much about the woodbury mystery gradually as time went on that night though i remembered nothing definite of myself about her the sense of familiarity and friendliness came home to me more vividly the appropriate emotion seemed easier to rouse i observed than the intellectual memory i knew jane and i had been on very good terms some time somewhere i talked with her easily for i had a consciousness of companionship  byandby without revealing to her how little i could recollect about her own personality i confessed to jane by slow degrees that the whole past was still gone utterly from my shattered memory i told her i knew nothing except the picture and the facts it comprised and to show her just how small that knowledge really was i showed her imprudently enough the photograph the inspector had left with me  jane looked at it long and slowly with tears in her eyes then she said at last after a deep pause in a very hushed voice  why how did you get this it wasnt put in the papers  no i answered quietly it wasnt put in the papers for reasons of their own the police kept it unpublished  jane gazed at the proof still closer they oughtnt to have done that she said  they ought to have sent it out everywhere broadcastso that anybody who knew the man could tell him by his back  that seemed to me such obvious good sense that i wondered to myself the police hadnt thought long since of it but i supposed they had some good ground of their own for holding it all this time in their own possession  jane went on talking to me still for many minutes about the scene  ah yes that was just how he lay poor dear gentleman and the book on the chair too well did you ever in your life see anything so like and to think it was taken all by itself as one might say by magic but there your poor papa was a wonderful clever man such things as he used to invent such ideas and such machines we were sorry for him though we always thought to be sure he was dreadful severe with you miss una such a gentleman to have his own way too so cold and reserved like but one mustnt talk nothing but good about the dead they say and if he was a bit hard he was more than hard treated for it in the end poor gentleman  it interested me to get these half sidelights on my fathers character knowing nothing of him as i did save the solitary fact that he was the whitehaired gentleman i saw dead in my picture i naturally wanted to learn as much as i could from this old servant of ours as to the family conditions  then you thought him harsh in the servantshall i said tentatively to jane you thought him hard and unbending  well there miss jane ran on putting a cushion to my back tenderlyit was strange to be the recipient of so much delicate attention from a perfect strangernot exactly what youd call harsh to us ourselves you know he was a good master enough as long as one did what was ordered though he was a little bit fidgetty but to you we all thought he was always rather hard people said so in woodbury and yet in a way i dont know how it was he always seemed moren half afraid of you he was careful about your health and spoiled and petted you for that yet he was always pulling you up you know and looking after what you did and for one thing i remember theres many a time you were sent to bed when you were a good big girl for nothing on earth else but because he heard you talking to us in the hall about australia  talking to you about australia i cried pricking my ears why what harm was there in that why on earth didnt he want me to talk about australia  ah what harm indeed jane echoed blandly thats what we often used to say among ourselves downstairs but mr callingham he was always that way missso strict and particular he said hed forbidden you to say a word to anybody about that confounded country and you must do as you were told he seemed to have a grudge against australia though it was there he made his money and he always would have his own way your father would  while she spoke i looked hard at the white head in the photograph even as i did so a thought occurred to me that had never occurred before both in my mental picture and in looking at the photograph when i saw it first the feeling that was uppermost in my mind was not sorrow but horror i didnt think with affection and regret and a deep sense of bereavement about my fathers murder the emotional accompaniment that had stamped itself upon the very fibre of my soul was not pain but awe i think my main feeling was a feeling that a foul crime had taken place in the house not a feeling that i had lost a very dear and near relative rightly or wrongly i drew from this the inference which janes gossip confirmed that i had probably rather feared than loved my father  it was strange to be reduced to such indirect evidence on such a point as that but it was all i could get and i had to be content with it  jane leaning over my shoulder looked hard at the photograph too i could see her eyes were fixed on the back of the man who was seen disappearing through the open window he was dressed like a gentleman in knickerbockers and jacket as far as one could judge for the evening light rather blurred that part of the picture one hand was just waved palm open behind him jane regarded it hard then she gave an odd little start  why just look at that hand she cried with a tremor of surprise dont you see what it is dont you think its a womans  i gazed back at her incredulously  impossible i answered shaking my head it belongs as clear as day to the man you see in the photograph how on earth could his hand be a womans then id like to know i can see the shirtcuff  why yes jane answered with simple commonsense its dressed like a man of course and its a man to look at but the hands a womans as true as im standing here why mightnt a woman dress in a mans suit on purpose and perhaps it was just because they were so sure it was a man as did it that the police has gone wrong so long in trying to find the murderer  i looked hard at the hand myself then i shut my eyes and thought of the corresponding object in my mental picture the result fairly staggered me the impression in each case was exactly the same it was a soft and delicate hand very white and womanlike but was it really a womans i couldnt feel quite sure in my own mind about that but the very warning jane gave me seemed to me a most useful one it would be well after all to keep ones mind sedulously open to every possible explanation and to take nothing for granted as to the murderers personality       chapter vii  the grange at woodbury      i stopped for three weeks in janes lodgings and before the end of that time jane and i had got upon the most intimate footing it was partly her kindliness that endeared her to me and her constant sense of continuity with the earlier days which i had quite forgotten but it was partly too i felt sure a vague revival within my own breast of a familiarity that had long ago subsisted between us i was coming to myself again on one side of my nature day by day i grew more certain that while facts had passed away from me appropriate emotions remained vaguely present among the woodbury people that i met i recognised none to say that i knew them but i knew almost at first sight that i liked this one and disliked that one and in every case alike when i talked the matter over afterwards with jane she confirmed my suspicion that in my first state i had liked or disliked just those persons respectively my brain was upset but my heart remained precisely the same as ever  on my second morning i went up to the grange with her the house was still unlet since the day of the murder nobody cared to live in it the garden and shrubbery had been sadly neglected jane took me out of the way as we walked up the path to show me the place where the photographic apparatus had been found embedded in the grass and where the murderer had cut his hands getting over the wall in his frantic agitation the wall was pretty high and protected with bottleglass i guessed he must have been tall to scramble over it that seemed to tell against janes crude idea that a woman might have done it  but when i said so to jane she met me at once with the crushing reply perhaps it wasnt the same person that came back for the box i saw she was right again i had jumped at a conclusion in cases like this one must leave no hypothesis untried jump at no conclusions of any sort clearly that woman ought to have been made a detective  as i entered the house the weird sense of familiarity that pursued me throughout rose to a very high pitch i couldnt fairly say indeed that i remembered the different rooms all i could say with certainty was that i had seen them before to this there were three exceptionsthe three that belonged to my second statethe library my bedroom and the hall and staircase the first was indelibly printed on my memory as a component part of the picture and i found my recollection of every object in the room almost startling in its correctness only there was an alcove on one side that id quite forgotten and i saw why most clearly i stood with my back to it as i looked at the picture the other two bits i remembered as the room in which i had had my first great illness and the passage down which i had been carried or helped when i was taken to aunt emmas  i had begun to recognise now that the emotional impression made upon me by people and things was the only sure guide i still possessed as to their connection or association with my past history and the rooms at the grange had each in this way some distinctive characteristic the library of course was the chief home of the horror which had hung upon my spirit even during the days when i hardly knew in any intelligible sense the cause of it but the drawingroom and diningroom both produced upon my mind a vague consciousness of constraint i was dimly aware of being ill at ease and uncomfortable in them my own bedroom on the contrary gave me a pleasant feeling of rest and freedom and security while the servantshall and the kitchen seemed perfect paradises of liberty  ah manys the time miss jane said with a sigh looking over at the empty grate youd come down here to make cakes or puddings and laugh and joke like a child with mary an me i often used to say to emilyher as was cook here before ellen smithmiss unas never so happy as when shes down here in the kitchen and thats true what you say says emily to me many a time and often  that was exactly the impression left upon my own mind i began to conclude in a dim formless way that my father must have been a somewhat stern and unsympathetic man that i had felt constrained and uncomfortable in his presence upstairs and had often been pleased to get away from his eye to the comparative liberty and ease of my own room or of the maidservants quarters  at last in the big attic that had once been the nursery i paused and looked at jane a queer sensation came over me  jane i said slowly hardly liking to frame the words theres something strange about this room he wasnt cruel to me was he  oh no miss jane answered promptly he wasnt never what you might call exactly cruel he was a very good father and looked after you well but he was sort of stern and moodylikewould have his own way and didnt pay no attention to fads and fancies he called em when you were little manys the time he sent you up here for punishmentdisobedience and such like  i took out the photograph and tried as it were to think of my father as alive and with his eyes open i couldnt remember the eyes jane told me they were blue but i think what she said was the sort of impression the face produced upon me a man not unjust or harsh in his dealings with myself but very strong and masterful a man who would have his own way in spite of anybody a father who ruled his daughter as a vessel of his making to be done as he would with and be moulded to his fashion  still my visit to the grange resulted in the end in casting very little light upon the problem before me it pained and distressed me greatly but it brought no new elements of the case into view at best it only familiarised me with the scene of action of the tragedy the presence of the alcove was the one fresh feature nothing recalled to me as yet in any way the murderers features i racked my brain in vain no fresh image came up in it i could recollect nothing about the man or his antecedents  i almost began to doubt that i would ever succeed in reconstructing my past when even the sight of the home in which i had spent my childish days suggested so few new thoughts or ideas to me  for a day or two after that i rested at janes lest i should disturb my brain too much then i called once more on the doctor who had made the post mortem on my father and given evidence at the inquest to see if anything he could say might recall my lapsed memory  the moment he came into the rooma man about fifty closeshaven and kindlylookingi recognised him at once and held out my hand to him frankly he surveyed me from head to foot with a good medical stare and then wrung my hand in return with extraordinary warmth and effusion i could see at once he retained a most pleasing recollection of my first state and was really glad to see me  what you remember me then una he cried with quite fatherly delight you havent forgotten me my dear as youve forgotten all the rest havent you  it was startling to be called by ones christian name like that and by a complete stranger too but i was getting quite accustomed now to these little incongruities  oh yes i remember you perfectly i answered halfgrieved to distress him though i shouldnt have known your name and didnt expect to see you youre the doctor who attended me in my first great illnessthe illness with which my present life beganjust after the murder  he drew back a little crestfallen  then thats all you recollect is it he asked you dont remember me before dear not dr marten who used to take you on his knee when you were a tiny little girl and bring you lollipops from town to the great detriment of your digestion and get into rows with your poor father for indulging you and spoiling you you must surely remember me  i shook my head slowly i was sorry to disappoint him but it was necessary before all things to get at the bare truth  im afraid not i answered do please forgive me you must have read in the papers like everybody else of the very great change that has so long come over me bear in mind i cant remember anything at all that occurred before the murder that first illness is to me the earliest recollection of childhood  he gazed across at me compassionately  my poor child he said in a low voice like a very affectionate friend its much better so you have been mercifully spared a great deal of pain una when i first saw you at the grange after your fathers death i thanked heaven you had been so seized i thanked heaven the world had become suddenly a blank to you i prayed hard you might never recover your senses again or at least your memory and now that youre slowly returned to life once more against all hope or fear im heartily glad its in this peculiar way im heartily glad all the pasts blotted out for you you cant understand that my child ah no very likely not but i think its much best for you all your first life should be wholly forgotten he paused for a second then he added slowly if you remembered it all the sense of the tragedy would be far more acute and poignant even than at present  perhaps so i said resolutely but not the sense of mystery its that that appals me so id rather know the truth than be so wrapped up in the incomprehensible  he looked at me pityingly once more  my poor child he said in the same gentle and fatherly voice you dont wholly understand it doesnt all come home to you i can see clearly from what inspector wolferstan told me after his visit to you the other day  i broke in in surprise  inspector wolferstan i cried then he came down here to see you did he  it was horrible to find how all my movements were discussed and chronicled  yes he came down here to see me and talk things over dr marten went on as calmly as if it were mere matter of course and i could see from what he said you were still spared much for instance you remember it all only as an event that happened to an old man with a long white beard you dont fully realise except intellectually that it was your own father youre saved as a daughter the misery and horror of thinking and feeling it was your father who lay dead there  thats quite true i answered i admit that i cant feel it all as deeply as i ought but none the less ive come down here to make a violent effort let it cost what it may i must get at the truth i wanted to see whether the sight of the grange and of woodbury may help me to recall the lost scenes in my memory  to my immense surprise dr marten rose from his seat and standing up before me in a perfect agony of what seemed like terror half mixed with affection exclaimed in a very earnest and resolute voice  oh una my child whatever you doi beg of youi implore youdont try to recall the past at all dont attempt it dont dream of it  why not i cried astonished surely its my duty to try and find out my fathers murderer  instead of answering me he looked about him for half a minute in suspense as if doubtful what next to do or to say then he walked across with great deliberation to the door of the room and locked and doublelocked it with furtive alarm as i interpreted his action  so terrified did he seem indeed that for a moment the idea occurred to me in a very vague waywas i talking with the murderer had the man who himself committed the crime conducted the post mortem and put justice off the scent and was i now practically at the mercy of the criminal i was trying to track down the thought for a second or two made me feel terribly uncomfortable but i glanced at his back and at his hands and reassured myself that broad short man was not the slim figure of my picture and of the photograph those large red hands were not the originals of the small and delicate white palm just displayed at the back in both those strange documents of the mysterious murder  the doctor came over again and drew his chair close to mine  una my child he said slowly i love you very much as if you were my own daughter i always loved you and admired you and was sorryoh so sorryfor you youve quite forgotten who i am but ive not forgotten you take what i say as coming from an old friend from one who loves you and has your interest at heart for heavens sake i implore you my child make no more inquiries try to forgetnot to remember if you do recollect youll be sorry in the end for it  why so i asked amazed yet somehow feeling in my heart i could trust him implicitly why should the knowledge of the true circumstances of the case make me more unhappy than i am at present  he gazed harder at me than ever  because he replied in slow tones weighing each word as he spoke you may find that the murder was committed by some person or persons you love or once loved very much indeed you may find it will rend your very heartstrings to see that person or those persons punished you may find the circumstances were wholly otherwise than you imagine them to be let sleeping dogs lie my dear without your aid nothing more can be done dont trouble yourself to put the bloodhounds on the track of some unhappy creature who might otherwise escape dont rake it all up afresh bury itbury itbury it  he spoke so earnestly that he filled me with vague alarm  dr marten i said solemnly answer me just one question do you know who was the murderer  no no he exclaimed starting once more thank heaven i cant tell you that i dont know i know nothing nobody on earth knows but the two who were present on the night of the murder i feel sure and of those two ones unknown and the other has forgotten  but you suspect who he is i put in probing the secret curiously  he trembled visibly  i suspect who he is he replied after a moments hesitation but i have never communicated and will never communicate my suspicions to anybody not even to you i will only say this the person whom i suspect is one with whom you may now have forgotten all your past relations but whom you would be sorry to punish if you recovered your memory i formed a strong opinion at the time who that person was i formed it from the nature and disposition of the wound and the arrangement of the objects in the room when i was called in to see your fathers body  and you never said so at the inquest i cried indignant  he looked at me hard again then he spoke in a very slow and earnest voice  for your sake una and for the sake of your affections i held my peace he said my dear the suspicion was but a very slender one i had nothing to go upon and why should i have tried to destroy your happiness  that horrible article in the penny society paper came back to my mind once more with hideous suggestiveness i turned to him almost fiercely  so far as you know dr marten i asked was i ever in love had i ever an admirer was i ever engaged to anyone  he shrugged his shoulders and smiled a sort of smile of relief  how should i know he answered admirersyes dozens of them i was one myself loverswho can say but i advise you not to push the inquiry further  i questioned him some minutes longer but could get nothing more from him then i rose to go  dr marten i said firmly if i remember all and if it wrings my heart to remember i tell you i will give up that man to justice all the same i think i know myself well enough to know this much at least that i never never could stoop either to love or to screen a man who could commit such a foul and dastardly crime as this one  he took my hand fervently raised it with warmth to his lips and kissed it twice over  my dear he said with tears dropping down his gentle old cheeks this is a very great mysterya terrible mystery but i know you speak the truth i can see you mean it therefore all the more earnestly do i beg and beseech you go away from woodbury at once and as long as you live think no more about it       chapter viii  a vision of dead years      the interview with dr marten left me very much disquieted but it wasnt the only disquieting thing that occurred at woodbury before i left the place i happened to go one day into janes own little sittingroom jane was anxious i should see itshe wanted me to know all her house she said for the sake of old times and for the sake of those old times that i couldnt remember but when i knew shed been kind to me i went in and looked at it  there was nothing very peculiar about janes little sittingroom just the ordinary english landladys parlour you know the typesquare table in the middle bright blue vases on the mantelpiece chromolithograph from the illustrated london news on the wall rickety whatnot with glassshaded waxflowers in the recess by the window but over in one corner i chanced to observe a framed photograph of early execution which hung faded and dim there perhaps it was because my father was such a scientific amateur but photography i found out in time struck the keynote of my history in every chapter i didnt know why but this particular picture attracted me strangely it came from the grange jane told me shed hunted it out in the attic over the front bedroom after the house was shut up it belonged to a lot of my fathers early attempts that were locked in a box there hed always been trying experiments and things she said with photography poor gentleman  faded and dim as it was the picture riveted my eyes at once by some unknown power of attraction i gazed at it long and earnestly it represented a house of colonial aspect square woodbuilt and verandahgirt standing alone among strange trees whose very names and aspects were then unfamiliar to me but which i nowadays know to be australian eucalyptuses on the steps of the verandah sat a lady in deep mourning a child played by her side and a collie dog lay curled up still and sleepy in the foreground the child indeed stirred no chord of any sort in my troubled brain but my heart came up into my mouth so at sight of the lady that i said to myself all at once in my awe that must surely be my mother  the longer i looked at it the more was i convinced i must have judged aright not indeed that in any true sense i could say i remembered her face or figure i was so young when she died according to everybodys account that even if id remained in my first state i could hardly have retained any vivid recollection of her but both lady and house brought up in me once more to some vague degree that strange consciousness of familiarity i had noticed at the grange and what was odder still the sense of wont seemed even more marked in the australian cottage than in the case of the house which all probability would have inclined one beforehand to think i must have remembered better if this was indeed my earliest home then i seemed to recollect it far more readily than my later one  i turned trembling to jane hardly daring to frame the question that rose first to my lips  is thatmy mother i faltered out slowly  but there jane couldnt help me shed never seen the lady she said  when first i come to the grange miss you see your motherd been buried a year there was only you and mr callingham in family and i never saw that photograph neither till i picked it out of the box locked up in the attic the little girl might be you like enough when you look at it sideways and yet again it mightnt but the lady i dont know i never saw your mother  so i was fain to content myself with pure conjecture  all day long however the new picture haunted me almost as persistently as the old one  that night i went to sleep fast and slept for some hours heavily i woke with a start i had been dreaming very hard and my dream was peculiarly clear and lifelike never since the first night of my new lifethe night of the murderhad i dreamed such a dream or seen dead objects so vividly it came out in clear colours like the terrible picture that had haunted me so long and it affected me strangely it was a scene rather than a dreama scene as at the theatre but a scene in which i realised and recognised everything  i stood on the steps of a housea white wooden house with a greenpainted verandahthe very house i had seen that afternoon in the faded photograph in janes little sittingroom but i didnt think of it at first as the house in the old picture i thought of it as homeour own placethe cottage the steps seemed to me very high as in childish recollection a lady walked about on the verandah and called to me a lady in a white gown like the lady in the photograph only younger and prettier and dressed much more daintily but i didnt think of her as that either i called her mamma to myself i looked up into her face oh ever so much above me i must have been very small indeed when that picture first occurred to me there was a gentleman too in a white linen coat who pinched my mammas ear and talked softly and musically but i didnt think of him quite so i knew he was my papa i played about his knees a little scampering child and looked up in his face and teased him and laughed at him my papa looked down at me and called me a little kitten and rolled me over on my back and fondled me and laughed with me there were trees growing all about big trees with long grey leaves the same sort of trees as the ones in the photograph but i didnt remember that at first in my dream and in the first few minutes of my waking thought i knew them at once as the big bluegumtrees  i awoke in the midst of it and the picture persisted  then with a sudden burst of intuition the truth flashed upon me all at once my dream was no mere dream but a revelation in my sleep it was my intellect working unconsciously and spontaneously in an automatic condition for the very first time in my life since the night of the murder i had really remembered something that occurred before it  this was a scene of my first state in all probability it was my earliest true childish recollection  i sat up in bed appalled i dared not call aloud or ring for jane to come to me but if id seen a ghost it could hardly have affected me more profoundly than this ghost of my own dead life thus brought suddenly back to me gazing away across some illimitable vista of dim years i remembered this one scene as something that once occurred long ago to my very self in my own experience then came a vast gulf an unbridged abyss and after that with a vividness as of yesterday the murder  i held my ears and crouched low sitting up in my bed in the dark but the dream seemed to go on still it remained with me distinctly  the more i thought it over the more certain it appeared as part of my own experience putting two and two together i made sure in my own mind this was a genuine recollection of my life in australia i was born there i knew that i had learned from everybody but i could distinctly remember having lived there now it came back to me as memory the dream had reinstated it  and it was the sight of the photograph that had produced the dream this was curious very a weird idea came across me had i begun in all past efforts to remember at the wrong end instead of trying to recollect the circumstances that immediately preceded the murder ought i to have set out by trying to reinstate my first life chapter by chapter and verse by verse from childhood upward ought i to start by recalling as far as possible my very earliest recollections in my previous existence and then gradually work up through all my subsequent history to the date of the murder  the more i thought of it the more convinced was i that that was the right procedure  it was certainly significant that this vague childish recollection of something which might have happened when i was just about two years old should be the very first thing to recur to my my memory yet so appalled and alarmed was i by the weirdness of this sudden apparition looming up as it were all by itself in the depths of my consciousness that i hardly dared bring myself to think of trying to recall any other scenes of that dead and past existence the picture rose like an exhalation hanging unrelated in midair a mere mental mirage and it terrified me so much that i shrank unutterably from the effort of calling up another of like sort to follow it       chapter ix  hateful suspicions      the rest of that night i lay awake in my bed the scene in the verandah by the big bluegumtrees haunting me all the time much as in earlier days the picture of the murder had pursued and haunted me early in the morning i rose up and went down to jane in her little parlour i longed for society in my awe i needed human presence i couldnt bear to be left alone by myself with all these pressing and encompassing mysteries  jane i said after a few minutes careless talkfor i didnt like to tell her about my wonderful dreamwhere exactly did you find the picture of that house hanging over in the corner there  lor bless your heart miss jane answered theres a whole boxful of them at the grange nobody ever cared for them theyre up in the top attic they were locked till your papa died and then they were opened by order of the executors some of ems faded even worse than that one and none of ems very good but i picked this one out because it was better worth framing for my room than most of em the executors took no notice when they found what they was they opened the box to see if it was dockyments  well jane i said i shall go up and bring them every one away with me its possible they may help me to recollect things a bit i drew my hand across my forehead it all seems so hazy i went on yet when i see things again i sometimes feel as if i almost recognised them  so that very morning we went up together i wouldnt go alone and got the rest of the photographsvery faded positives from oldfashioned plates most of them representing persons and places i had never seen and a few of them apparently not taken in england  i didnt look them all over at once just then i thought it best not to do so i would give my memory every possible chance take a few at a time and see what effect they produced on me perhapsthough i shrank from the bare idea with horrorthey might rouse in my sleep such another stray effort of spontaneous reconstruction yet the last one had cost me much nervous wear and tearmuch mental agony  a few days after i went away from woodbury i had learned for the moment i thought all that woodbury could teach me and i longed to get free again for a while from this pervading atmosphere of mystery at aunt emmas at least all was plain and aboveboard i would go back to bartononthesea and rest there for a while among the heathery hills before proceeding any further on my voyage of discovery  but i took back jane with me i was fond of jane now in those two short weeks i had learned to cling to her though i remembered her strictly speaking no more than at first yet the affection i must have borne her in my first state seemed to revive in me very easily like all other emotions i was as much at home with jane indeed as if i had known her for years and this wasnt strange for i had known her for years in point of fact and and though id forgotton most of those years the sense of familiarity they had inspired still lived on with me unconsciously i know now that memory resides chiefly in the brain while the emotions are a wider endowment of the nervous system in general so that while a great shock may obliterate whole tracts in the memory no power on earth can ever alter altogether the sentiments and feelings  as for jane she was only too glad to come with me there were no lodgers at present she said and none expected her sister elizabeth would take care of the rooms and if any stranger came why lizzied telegraph down at once for her so i wrote to aunt emma to expect us both next day aunt emmas i knew was a home where i or mine were always welcome  jane had never seen aunt emma there had been feud between the families while my father lived so she didnt visit the grange after my mothers death aunt emma had often explained to me in part how all that happened it was the one point in our family history on which shed ever been explicit for she had a grievance there and what woman on earth can ever suppress her grievances its our feminine way to air them before the world as its a mans to bury them deep in his own breast and brood over them  my mother she told me had been a widow when my father married hera rich young widow she had gone away a mere girl to australia with her first husband a clergyman who was lost at sea two or three years after on the voyage home to england without her she had one little girl by her first husband but the child died quite young and then she married my father who met her first in australia while she waited for news of the clergymans safety her family always disapproved of the second marriage my father had no money it seemed and mamma was well off having means of her own to start with like aunt emma and having inherited also her first husbands property which was very considerable he had left it to his little girl and after her to his wife so that first my father and then i myself came in in the end to both the little estates though my mothers had been settled on the children of the first marriage aunt emma always thought my father had married for money and she said he had been hard and unkind to mamma not indeed cruel he wasnt a cruel man but severe and wilful he made her do exactly as he wished about everything in a masterful sort of way that no woman could stand against he crushed her spirit entirely aunt emma told me she had no will of her own poor thing his individuality was so strong that it overrode my mothers weak nature roughshod  not that he was rough he never scolded her he never illtreated her but he said to her plainly you are to do so and so and she obeyed like a child she never dared to question him  so aunt emma had always said my mother was badly used especially in money mattersthe money being all when one came to think of it her own or her first husbandsand as a consequence auntie was never invited to the grange during my fathers lifetime  when we reached bartononthesea jane and i on our way from woodbury aunt emma was waiting at the station to meet us to my great disappointment i could see at first sight she didnt care for jane and i could also see at first sight jane didnt care for her this was a serious blow to me for i leaned upon those two more than i leaned upon anyone and i had far too few friends in the world of my own to afford to do without any one of them  in the evening however when i went up to my own room to bed jane came up to help me as she always did at woodbury i began at once to tax her with not liking aunt emma with a little hesitation jane admitted that at first sight she hadnt felt by any means disposed to care for her i pressed her hard as to why jane held off and prevaricated that roused my curiosityyou see im a woman i insisted upon knowing  oh miss i cant tell you jane cried growing red in the face i cant bear to say it out you oughtnt to ask itll hurt you to know i even thought such a thing of her  you must tell me jane i exclaimed with a cold shudder of terror half guessing what she meant dont keep me in suspense let me know what it is im accustomed to shocks now i know i can stand them  jane answered nothing directly she only held out her coarse red hand and asked me with a face growing pale as she spoke  wheres that picture of the murder  i produced it from my box trembling inwardly all over  jane darted one finger demonstratively at a point in the photograph  whose hand is that she asked with a strange earnestness putting her nail on the murderers  the words escaped me in a cry of horror almost before i was aware of them  aunt emmas i said gasping i never noticed it before  then i drew back and stared at it in speechless awe and consternation  it was quite quite true no use in denying it the figure that escaped through the window was dressed in mans clothes to be sure and as far as one could judge from the foreshortening and the peculiar stoop had a mans form and stature but the hand was a womanssoft and white and delicate nay more the hand as i said in my haste was line for line aunt emmas  in a moment a terrible sinking came over me from head to foot i trembled like an aspenleaf could this then be the meaning of dr martens warning that i should let sleeping dogs lie lest i should be compelled to punish someone whom i loved most dearly had fate been so cruel to me that i had learned to cling most in my second state to the very criminal whose act had blotted out my first had i grown to treat like a mother my fathers murderer  aunt emmas hand aunt emmas hand that was aunt emmas hand every touch and every line of it but no where were the marks those wellknown marks on the palm i took up the big magnifyingglass with which i had often scanned that photograph close before not a sign or a trace of them i shut my eyes and called up again the mental picture of the murder i looked hard at the phantomhand in it that floated like a vision all distinct before my minds eye it was flat and smooth and white not a scarnot a sign on it i turned round to jane that too natural detective  no no i cried hastily with a quick tone of triumph aunt emmas hand is marked on the palm with great gashes and cuts this ones smooth as smooth can be and sos the one i can see in the picture within me  jane drew back with a startled air and opened her mouth all agog to let in a deep breath  the wall she said slowly the bottleglass dont you know the blood on the top whoever did it climbed over and tore his hands or her hands if it was a woman that would account for the gashes  this was more than i could endure the coincidence was too crushing i bent down my head on my arms and cried silently bitterly i hated jane in my heart for even suggesting it yet i couldnt deny to myself for a moment the strength and suggestiveness of her halfspoken argument  not that for a second i believed it true i could never believe it aunt emma so gentle so kindly so sweet incapable of hurting any living thing the tenderest old lady that breathed upon earth and my own mothers sister whom i loved as i never before loved anyone aunt emma the murderess the bare idea was preposterous i couldnt entertain it my whole nature revolted from it  and indeed how very slight after all was the mere scrap of evidence on which jane ventured to suggest so terrible a charge a manin mans clothesfairly tall and slim and apparently dark haired but stooping so much that he looked almost humpbacked how different from aunt emma with her womanly figure and her upright gait and her sweet old white head why it was clearly ridiculous  and yet the fact remained that as jane pointed to the picture and asked whose hand is that the answer came up all spontaneously to my lips without hesitation aunt emmas  i sat there long in my misery thinking it over to myself i didnt know what to do i couldnt go and confide to aunt emmas ear this new and horrible doubtwhich was no doubt after all for i knew it was impossible i hated jane for suggesting it i hated her for telling me yet i couldnt be left alone i was far too terrified  oh jane i cried looking up to her and yet despising myself for saying it you must stop here tonight and sleep with me if im left by myself in the room alone i know i shall go madi can feel itim sure of it  jane stopped with me and soothed me she was certainly very kind yet i felt in a dim underhand sort of way it was treason to aunt emma to receive her caresses at all after what she had said to me though to be sure it was i not she who spoke those hateful words it was i myself who had said the hand was aunt emmas  as i lay awake and thought the idea flashed across me suddenly could jane have any grudge of her own against aunt emma was this a deliberate plot what did she mean by her warnings that i should keep my mind open why had she said from the very first it was a womans hand did she want to set me against my aunt and was dr marten in league with her in my tortured frame of mind i felt all alone in the world i covered my head and sobbed in my misery i didnt know who were my friends and who were against me  at last after long watching i dozed off into an uneasy sleep jane had already been snoring long beside me i woke up again with a start i was cold and shuddering i had dreamed once more the same australian dream my mamma as before stood gentle beside me she stooped down and smoothed my hair i could see her face and her form distinctly and i noticed now she was like her sister aunt emma only younger and prettier and ever so much slighter and her hand too was soft and white like auntiesvery gentle and delicate  it was just there that i woke upwith the hand before my eyes oh how vividly i noted it aunt emmas hand only younger and unscarred on the palm the family hand no doubt the hand of the moores i remembered now that aunt emma had spoken more than once of that family peculiarity it ran through the house she said but my hand was quite different not the moore type at all i supposed i must have taken it as was natural from the callinghams  and then in my utter horror and loneliness a still more awful and ghastly thought presented itself to me this was my mothers hand i saw in the picture was it my mother indeed who wrought the murder was she living or dead had my father put upon her some grievous wrong had he pretended to get her out of the way had he buried her alive so to speak in some prison or madhouse had she returned in disguise from the asylum or the living grave to avenge herself and murder him in my present frame of mind no idea was too wild or too strange for me to entertain if this strain continued much longer i should go mad myself with suspense and horror       chapter x  yet another photograph      next morning my head ached after all id suffered i could hardly bear to recur to the one subject that now always occupied my thoughts and yet on the other hand i couldnt succeed in banishing it to relieve my mind a little i took out the photographs i had brought from the box at the grange and began to sort them over according to probable date and subject  they were of different periods some old some newer i put them together in series as well as i could by the nature of the surroundings the most recent of all were my fathers early attempts at instantaneous electric photographythe attempts which led up at last to his automatic machine the acmegraph that produced all unconsciously the picture of the murder some of these comparatively recent proofs represented men running and horses trotting but the best of all tied together with a bit of tape clearly belonged to a single set and must have been taken at the same time at an athletic meeting there was one of a flat race viewed from a little in front with the limbs of the runners in seemingly ridiculous attitudes so instantaneous and therefore so grotesquely rigid were they there was another of a high jump seen from one side at the very moment of clearing the pole so that the figure poised solid in midair as motionless as a statue and there was a third equally successful of a man throwing the hammer in which the hammer in the same way seemed to hang suspended of itself like mahomets coffin between earth and heaven  but the one that attracted my attention the most was a photograph of an obstaclerace in which the runners had to mount and climb over a wagon placed obtrusively sideways across the course on purpose to baffle them this picture was taken from a few yards in the rear and the athletes were seen in it in the most varied attitudes some of them were just climbing up one side of the wagon others had mounted to the top ledge of the body and one standing on the further edge was in the very act of leaping down to the ground in front of him he was bent double to spring with a stoop like a hunchback and balanced himself with one hand held tightly behind him  as my eye fell on that figure a cold thrill ran through me for a moment i only knew something important had happened next instant i realised what the thrill portended i could only see the mans back to be sure but i knew him in a second i had no doubt as to who it was this was himthe murderer  yes yes there could be no mistaking that arched round back that had haunted me so long in my waking dreams i knew him at sight it was the man i had seen on the night of the murder getting out of the window  perhaps i was overwrought perhaps my fancy ran away with me but i didnt doubt for a second i rose from my seat and in a tremulous voice called jane into the room without one word i laid both pictures down before her together jane glanced first at the one then turned quickly to the other a sharp little cry broke from her lips all unbidden she saw it as fast and as instinctively as i had done  thats him she exclaimed aghast and as pale as a sheet thats him right enough miss una thats the very same back thats the very same hand thats the man thats the murderer  and indeed this unanimity was sufficiently startling for nothing could have been more different than the dress in the two cases in the murder scene the man seemed to wear a tweed suit and knickerbockershe was indistinct as i said before against the blurred light of the window while in the athletic scene he wore just a thin jersey and runningdrawers cut short at the knee with his arms and legs bare and his muscles contracted yet for all that we both knew him for the same man at once that stooping back was unmistakable that position of the hand was characteristic and unique we were sure he was the same man i trembled with agitation i had a clue to the murderer  yet strange to say that wasnt the first thought that occurred to my mind in the relief of the moment i looked up into janes eyes and exclaimed with a sigh of profound relief  then you see how mistaken you were about the hands and aunt emma  jane looked close at the hand in the photograph once more  well its curious she said slowly thats a man sure enough but hed ought to be a moore the palms your aunts as clear as ever you could paint it  i glanced over her shoulder she was perfectly right it was a man beyond all doubt the figure on the wagon yet the hand was aunt emmas every line and every stroke of it except of course the scars those i saw at a glance were wholly wanting  and now i had really a clue to the murderer  yet how slight a clue just a photograph of mens backs what men when and where it was an athletic meeting of what club or society that was the next question now i had to answer instinctively i made up my mind to answer it myself without giving any notice to the police of my discovery  perhaps i should never have been able to answer it at all but for one of the photographs which as i thought though lying loose by itself formed part of the same series it represented the end of a hundredyard race with the winners coming in at the tape by a pavilion with a flagstaff on the staff a big flag was flying loosely in the wind the folds hid half of the words on its centre from sight but this much at least i could read  eromoyletiub  i gazed at them long and earnestly after a minute or two of thought i made out the last two words the inscription must surely be somethingorother athletic club  but what was er om oy that question staggered me gazing harder at it than ever i could come to no conclusion it was the name of a place no doubt but what place i knew not  er no ber just a suspicion of a b came round the corner of a fold if b was the first letter i might possibly identify it  i took the photograph down to aunt emma without telling her what i meant she couldnt bear to think i was ever engaged in thinking of my first state at all  can you read the inscription on that flag auntie i asked its an old photograph i picked up in the attic at the grange and id like to know if i could at what place it was taken  aunt emma gazed at it long and earnestly her colour never changed then she shook her head quietly  i dont know the place she said and i dont know the name i cant quite make it out thats e and r and o you see the letters in between might be almost anything  i wasnt going to be put off however with the port thus in sight one fact was almost certain wherever that pavilion might be the murderer was there on the day unknown when those photographs were taken and whatever that day might be my father and the murderer were there together that brought the two into connection and brought me one step nearer a solution than ever the police had been for hitherto no one had even pretended to have the slightest clue to the personality of the man who jumped out of the window  i went into the library and took down the big atlas opening the map of england and wales i began a hopeless search county by county from northumberland downward for any town or village that would fit these mysterious letters it was a wild and foolish idea in the first place not a quarter of the villages were marked in the map and in the second place my brain soon got muddled and dazed with trying to fit in the names with the letters on the flag two hours had passed away and id only got as far down as lancashire and durham and most probably even so i would never come upon it  then suddenly a bright idea broke on my brain at once the index the index presumably as no fold seemed to obscure the first words the name began with what looked like a b that was always something  a man would have thought of that at once of course but then i have the misfortune to be only a woman  i turned to the index in haste and looked down it with hurried eyes almost sooner than i could have hoped the riddle unread itself ber berb berc berd i read out berkshire berham berhampore that wont do berlin berling bernina berrywhats that oh great heavensmy brain reeledberry pomeroy  it was as clear as day how could i have missed it before there it seemed to stand out almost legible on the flagstaff i read it now with ease berry pomeroy athletic club  i looked up the map once more following the lines with my fingers till i found the very place where the name was printed a village in devonshire not far from torquay yes thats it berry pomeroy the murderer was there on the day of that athletic meeting  my heart came up into my mouth with mingled horror and triumph i felt like a bloodhound who gets on the trail of his man i would track him down now no doubtmy fathers murderer  i had no resentment against him no desire for vengeance but i had a burning wish to free myself from this environing mystery  i wouldnt tell the police or the inspector however what clue i had obtained id find it all out for myself without anyones help i remembered what dr marten had said and determined to be wise id work on my own lines till all was found out and then be it who it might i sternly resolved id let justice be done on him  so i said nothing even to jane about the discovery id just made i said nothing to anybody till we sat down at dinner then in the course of conversation i got on the subject of devonshire  auntie i ventured to ask at last in a very casual way did i ever so far as you know go anywhere near a place called berry pomeroy  aunt emma gave a start  oh darling why do you ask she cried  you dont mean to say you remember that do you what do you want to know for una you cant possibly recollect your torquay visit surely  i trembled all over then i was on the right track  was i ever at torquay i asked once more as firmly as i could and when i was there did i go over one day to berry pomeroy  aunt emma grew all at once as white as death  this is wonderful she cried in an agitated voice this is wonderfulwonderful if you can remember that my child you can remember anything  i dont remember it auntie i answered not liking to deceive her to tell you the truth i simply guessed at it but when and why was i at torquay please tell me and did i go to berry pomeroy for i stuck to my point and meant to get it out of her  aunt emma gazed at me fixedly  you went to torquay dear she said in a very slow voice in the spring of the same year your poor father was killed thats more than four years ago the willie moores live at torquay and several more of your cousins you went to stop with willies wife and you stayed five weeks i dont know whether you ever went over to berry pomeroy you may have and you maynt its within an easy driving distance minnie moore has often written to ask me whether you could go there again minnie was always fond of you and thinks youd remember her but ive been afraid to allow you for fear it should recall sad scenes shes about your own age minnie is and shes a daughter of willie moore whos my own first cousin and of course your dear mothers  i never hesitated a moment i was strung up too tightly by that time  auntie dear i said quietly i go tomorrow to torquay i must know all now i must hunt up these people  auntie knew from my tone it was no use trying to stand in my way any longer  very well dear she said resignedly i dont believe its good for you but you must do as you like you have your fathers will una you were always headstrong       chapter xi  the vision recurs      i hated asking auntie questions they seemed to worry and distress her so but that evening in view of my projected visit to torquay i was obliged to crossexamine her rather closely about many things i wanted to know about my torquay relations and as far as possible about my mothers family in the end i learned that the willie moores were cousins of ours on my mothers side who had never quarrelled with my father like aunt emma and through whom alone accordingly in the days of my first state aunt emma was able to learn anything about me they had a house at torquay and connections all around for the moores were devonshire people aunt emma was very anxious if i went down there at all i should stop with mrs moore for minnie would be so grieved she said if i went to an hotel or took private lodgings but i wouldnt hear of that myself i knew nothing of the mooresin my present conditionand i didnt like to trust myself in the hands of those who to me were perfect strangers so i decided on going to the imperial hotel and calling on the moores quietly to pursue my investigation  another question i asked in the course of the evening i had wondered about it often and now in these last straits curiosity overcame me  aunt emma i said unexpectedly after a pause without one word of introduction how ever did you get those scars on your hand youve never told me  in a moment aunt emma blushed suddenly crimson like a girl of eighteen  una she answered very gravely in a low strange tone oh dont ask me about that dear dont ask me about that you could never understand it i got them in climbing over a high stone wall a high stone wall with bits of glass stuck on top of it  in spite of her prohibition i couldnt help asking one virtual question more i gave a start of horror  not the wall at the grange i cried oh aunt emma how wonderful  she gazed at me astonished  yes the wall at the grange she said simply but i dont know how you guessed it oh una dont talk to me any more about these things i implore you you cant think how they grieve me they distress me unspeakably  much as i longed to know i couldnt ask her again after that she was trembling like an aspenleaf for some minutes we sat and looked at the fireplace in silence  then curiosity overcame me again  only one question more auntie i said when i came to you first you were at home here at barton you didnt come to woodbury to fetch me after the murder you didnt attend the inquest ive often wondered at that why didnt you bring me yourself why didnt you hurry to nurse me as soon as you heard theyd shot my father  aunt emma gazed at me again with a face like a sheet  darling she said quivering i was ill i was in bed i was obliged to stay away id hurt myself badly a little before oh una leave off if you go on like this youll drive me mad say no more i implore of you  i couldnt think what this meant but as auntie wished it i held my peace all inwardly trembling with suppressed excitement  that night when i went up to bed i lay awake long thinking to myself of the australian scene in the silence of the night it came back to me vividly rain pattered on the roof and helped me to remember it i could see the bluegum trees waving their long ribbonlike leaves in the wind i could see the cottage the verandah my mother our dog nay even i remembered now with a burst of recollection his name was carlo the effort was more truly a recollection than before it was part of myself i felt aware it was really i myself not another who had seen all this and lived and moved in it  slowly i fell asleep and passed from thinking to dreaming my dream was but a prolongation of the thoughts i had been turning over in my waking mind i was still in australia still on the verandah of our wooden house and my mamma was there and papa beside her i knew it was papa for i held his hand and played with him but he was so much altered so grave and severe though he smiled at me goodhumouredly mamma was sitting behind with baby on her lap it seemed to me quite natural she should be there with baby the scene was so distinctvery vivid and clear it persisted for many minutes perhaps even hours it burnt itself into my brain at last it woke me up by its very intensity  as i woke a great many thoughts crowded in upon me all at once this time i knew instantly it was no mere dream but a true recollection yet what a strange recollection how unexpeted how incomprehensible how much in it to settle how much to investigate and hunt up and inquire about  in the first place though i was still in my dream a little girl much time must have elapsed since the earlier vision for my papa looked far older and graver and sterner he had more hair about his face too a long brown beard and heavy moustache and when i gazed hard at him mentally i could recognise the likeness with the whitebearded man who lay dead on the floor while in my former recollection i could scarcely make out any resemblance of the features this showed that the second scene came long after the first my father must by that time have begun to resemble his later self a weird feeling stole over me was i going to relive my previous life piecemeal was the past going to unroll itself in slow but regular panorama to my sleeping vision was my first state to become known like this in successive scenes to my second  but that wasnt all there were strange questions to decide too about this new dream of dead days what could be the meaning of that mysterious baby she seemed to be so vivid so natural so real her presence there was so much a pure matter of course to me that i couldnt for a moment separate her from the rest of the picture i remembered the baby now as i remembered my mother and my father and australia there was no room for doubt as to that the baby was an integral part of my real recollection floating across the dim ocean of years i was certain that night i had once lived in such a scene with my mamma and baby  yet oh what baby i never had a brother or sister of my own except the halfsister that diedthe clergymans child mary wharton and mary from what i had learned from aunt emma and others must have died when i was only just five months old immediately before we left australia how then could i remember her even in this exalted mental state of trance or dream and above all how could i remember a far earlier scene when my papa was younger when his face was smooth and when there was no other baby  this mystery only heightened the other mysteries which surrounded my life i was surfeited with them now in very despair and listlessness i turned round on my side and dozed dreamily off again unable to grapple with it  but still that scene haunted me and still even in sleep i asked myself over and over again how on earth can this be whats the meaning of the baby  perhaps it was a little sister that died young whom i never had heard of and perhaps not in a life such as mine new surprises are always possible       chapter xii  the moores of torquay      strange to say in spite of everything my sleep refreshed me i woke up in the morning strong and vigorousthank goodness i have physically a magnificent constitutionand packed my box with janes help for my torquay expedition  i went up to london and down to torquay alone though jane offered to accompany me i was learning to be selfreliant it suited my plans better nobody could bear this burden for me but myself and the sooner i learnt to bear it my own way the happier for me  at torquay station to my great surprise a freshlooking girl of my own age rushed up to me suddenly and kissed me without one word of warning she was a very pretty girl pinkcheeked and hazeleyed and as she kissed me she seized both my hands in hers and cried out to me frankly  why there you are una dear cousin emma telegraphed us what train youd arrive by so ive driven down to meet you and now youre coming up with us this very minute in the ponycarriage  youre minnie moore i suppose i said gazing at her admiringly her sweet frank smile and appleblossom cheek somehow inspired me with confidence  she looked back at me quite distressed tears rose at once into her eyes with true celtic suddenness  oh una she cried deeply hurt and drawing back into her shell dont tell me you dont know me why im minnie minnie  my heart went out to her at once i took her hand in mine again  minnie dear i said softly quite remorseful for my mistake you must remember what has happened to me and not be angry ive forgotten everything even my own past life ive forgotten that i ever before set eyes upon you but my dear theres one thing ive not in a way forgotten and that is that i loved you and love you dearly and i ll give you a proof of it when i started i knew none of you and i told aunt emma i wouldnt go among strangers the moment i see you i know youre no stranger but a very dear cousin when ive forgotten myself how can i remember you but ill go up with you at once and ill countermand the room i ordered by telegram at the imperial  the tears stood fuller in minnies eyes than before she clasped my hand hard her pretty lips trembled  una darling she said we always were friends and we always shall be if you love me thats all youre a darling i love you  i looked at her sweet face and knew it was true and oh i was so glad to have a new friendan old friend already for somehow as always while the intellectual recollection had faded the emotion survived i felt as if id known minnie moore for years though i never remembered to have seen her in my life till that minute  well i remained at the moores for a week and felt quite at home there they were all very nice cousin willie and aunt emily she made me call her aunt she said id always done so and minnie and all of them they were really dear people and blood after all is thicker than water but i made no haste to push inquiries just at first i preferred to feel my way i wanted to find out what they knew if anything about berry pomeroy  the first time i ventured to mention the subject to minnie she gave a very queer smilea smile of maidenly badinage  well you remember that any way she said in a teasing little way looking down at me and laughing i thought youd remember that i must say you enjoyed yourself wonderfully at berry pomeroy  remember what i cried all eagerness for i saw she attached some special importance to the recollection and yet it was terrible she should jest about the clue to my fathers murderer  minnie looked arch when she looked arch she was charming  why i never saw you prettier or more engaging in your life than you were that day she said evasively as if trying to pique me and you flirted so much too and everybody admired you so everybody on the grounds especially one person  i looked up at her in surprise i was in my own room seated by the dressingtable late at night when wed gone up to bed and minnie was beside me standing up with her bedroom candle in that pretty white little hand of hers  what do you mean i exclaimed eagerly was it a danceor a picnic  oh you know very well minnie went on teasingly though you pretend you forget he was there dont you know you must remember him if youve forgotten all the rest of your previous life you say you remember the appropriate emotions well he was an emotion at least you thought so it was an athletic club meeting and dr ivor was there he went across on his bicycle  i gave a start of surprise minnie looked down at me half maliciously  there you see she said archly again at dr ivor you change colour i told you youd remember him  i grew pale with astonishment  minnie dear i said holding her hands very tight in my own it wasnt that i assure you ive forgotten him utterly if ever i knew a dr ivor if ever i flirted with him as you seem to imply hes gone clean out of my head his name stirs no chordrecalls absolutely nothing but i want to know about that athletic meeting was my poor father there that day and did he take a set of photographs  minnie clapped her hands triumphantly  i knew you remembered she cried of course cousin vivian was there we drove over in a break you must remember that and he took a whole lot of instantaneous photographs  my hand trembled violently in my cousins i felt i was now on the very eve of a great discovery  minnie i said tentatively do you think your papa would drive us over some day andand show us the place again  of course he would dear minnie answered with a gentle pressure of my hand hed be only too delighted whatever you choose you know you were always such a favourite of daddys  i knew nothing of the sort but i was glad to learn it i drew minnie out a little more about the athletics and my visit to berry pomeroy she wouldnt tell me much she was too illusive and indefinite she never could get the notion out of her head somehow that i remembered all about it and was only pretending to forgetfulness but i gathered from what she said that dr ivor and i must have flirted a great deal or at least that he must have paid me a good lot of attention my father didnt like it minnie said he thought dr ivor wasnt well enough off to marry me he was a distant cousin of ours of courseeverything was always of course with that dear bright minniewhat didnt i know that oh yes his mother was one of the moores of barnstaple cousin edwards people his name was courtenay moore ivor you knowthough i knew nothing of the sort and he was awfully clever and oh so handsome  is he at berry pomeroy still i asked trembling thinking this would be a good person to get information from about the people at the athletic sports  oh dear no minnie answered looking hard at me curiously he was never at berry pomeroy he had a practice at babbicombe hes in canada now you know he went over six months after cousin vivians death i think dearshe hesitatedhe never quite got over your entirely forgetting him even if you forgot your whole past history  this was a curious romance to me that minnie thus sprang on mea romance of my own past life of which i myself knew nothing  we sat late talking and i could see minnie was very full indeed of dr ivor over and over again she recurred to his name and always as though she thought it might rouse some latent chord in my memory but nothing came of it if ever i had cared for dr ivor at all that feeling had passed away utterly with the rest of my experiences  when minnie rose to go i took her hand once more in mine as i did so i started something about it seemed strangely familiar i looked at it close with a keen glance why this was curious it was aunt emmas hand it was my mothers hand it was the hand in my mental picture it was the hand of the murderer  its just like aunties i said with an effort seeing minnie noticed my start  she looked at it and laughed  the moore hand she said gaily we all have it except you its awfully persistent  i turned it over in front and examined the palm at sight of it my brain reeled this was surely magic minnie moores hand too was scarred over with cuts exactly like aunt emmas  why how on earth did you do that i cried thunderstruck at the discovery  but minnie only laughed again a bright girlish laugh  climbing over that beastly wall at the grange she said with a merry look oh what fun we did have we climbed it together we were dreadful tomboys in those days dear you and i but you were luckier than i was and didnt cut yourself with the bottleglass  this was too surprising to be passed over unnoticed when minnie was gone i lay awake and pondered about it had all the moores got scars on their hands i wondered and how many people i asked myself had cut themselves time and again in climbing over that barricaded gardenwall of my fathers  the moore hand might be hereditary but not surely the scars was the murderer then a moore and was that the meaning of dr martens warning       chapter xiii  dr ivor of babbicombe      two days later cousin willie drove us over to berry pomeroy the lion of the place is the castle of course but minnie had told him beforehand i wanted for reasons of my own to visit the cricketfield where the sports were held the year dr ivor won the mile race you remember so we went there straight as soon as we entered i recognised the field at once and the pavilion and the woods as being precisely the same as those presented in the photograph but i got no further than that the captain of the cricketclub was on the ground that day and i managed to get into conversation with him and strolled off in the grounds there i showed him the photograph and asked if he could identify the man climbing over the wagon but he said he couldnt recognise him somebody or other from torquay perhaps not a regular resident the figures were so small and so difficult to make sure about if id leave him the photograph perhapsbut at that i drew back for i didnt want anybody least of all at torquay to know what quest i was engaged upon  we drove back a merry party enough in spite of my failure minnie was always so jolly and her mirth was contagious she talked all the way still of dr ivor halfteasing me it was all very well my pretending not to remember she said but why did i want to see the cricketfield if it wasnt for that poor courtenay if only he knew how delighted hed be to know he wasnt forgotten for he really took it to heart my illnessshe always called it my illness and so i suppose it was from the day i lost my memory nothing seemed to go right with him and he was never content till he went and buried himself somewhere in the wilds of canada  that evening again i sat with minnie in my room i was depressed and distressed i didnt want to cry before minnie but i could have cried with good heart for sheer vexation of course i couldnt bear to go showing the photograph to all the world and letting everybody see id made myself a sort of amateur detective they would mistake my motives so and yet i didnt know how i was ever to find out my man any other way it was that or nothing i made up my mind i would ask cousin willie  i took out the photograph as if unintentionally when i went to my box and laid it down with my curlingtongs on the table close by minnie minnie took it up abstractedly and looked at it with an indefinite gaze  why this is the cricketfield she cried as soon as she collected her senses one of your fathers experiments the earliest acmegraphs how splendidly they come out see thats sir everard at the bottom and theres little jack hillier above and this on one sides captain brooks and there in front of allwell you know him anyhow una now dont pretend you forget thats courtenay ivor  her finger was on the man who stood poised ready to jump with an awful recoil i drew back and suppressed a scream it was on the tip of my tongue to cry out why thats my fathers murderer  but happily with a great effort of will i restrained myself i saw it all at a glance that then was the meaning of dr martens warning no wonder i thought the shock had disorganised my whole brain if minnie was right i was in love once with that man and i must have seen my lover murder my father  for i didnt doubt from what minnie said i had really once loved dr ivor horrible and ghastly as it might be to realise it i didnt doubt it was the truth i had once loved the very man i was now bent on pursuing as a criminal and a murderer  youre sure thats him minnie i cried trying to conceal my agitation youre sure thats courtenay ivor the man stooping on the wagontop  minnie looked at me smiling she thought i was asking for a very different reason  yes thats him right enough dear she said i could tell him among a thousand why the moore hand alone would be quite enough to know him by its just like my own weve all of us got itexcept yourself i always said you werent one of us youre a regular born callingham  i gazed at her fixedly i could hardly speak  oh minnie i cried once more have you  have you any photograph of him  no we havent dear minnie answered  that was a fad of courtenays you know wherever he went hed never be photographed he was annoyed that day that your father should have taken him unawares he hated being done he said hes so handsome and so nice but hes not a bit conceited and he was such a splendid bicyclist he rode over and back on his bicycle that day and then ran in all the races as if it were nothing  a light burst over me at once this was circumstantial evidence the murderer who disappeared as if by magic the moment his crime was committed must have come and gone all unseen no doubt on his bicycle he must have left it under the window till his vile deed was done and then leapt out upon it in a second and dashed off whence he came like a flash of lightning  it was a premeditated crime in that case not the mere casual result of a sudden quarrel  i must find out this man now were it only to relieve my own sense of mystery  minnie i said once more screwing up my courage to ask wheres dr ivor now i meanthat is to sayin what part of canada  minnie looked at me and laughed  there i told you so she said merrily its not the least bit of use your pretending youre not in love with him una why just look how you tremble youre as white as a ghost and then you say you dont care for poor courtenay i forget the exact name of the place where he lives but ive got it in my desk and i can tell you tomorrowoh yes its palmyra on the canada pacific i suppose you want to write to him or perhaps you mean to go out and offer yourself bodily  it was awful having to bottle up the truth in ones own heart and to laugh and jest like this but i endured it somehow  no its not that i said gravely ive other reasons of my own for asking his address minnie i want to go out there its true but not because i cherish the faintest pleasing recollection of dr ivor in any way  minnie scanned me over in surprise  well how you are altered una she cried i love you dear and like you every bit as much as ever but youve changed so much i dont think youre at all what you used to be youre so grave and sombre  no wonder minnie i exclaimed bursting gladly into tearsthe excuse was such a reliefno wonder when you think how much ive passed through  minnie flung her arms around my neck and kissed me over and over again  oh dear she cried melting what have i done what have i said i ought never to have spoken so it was cruel of mecruel una dear i shall stop here tonight and sleep with you  oh thank you darling i cried minnie that is good of you im so awfully glad for tomorrow i must be thinking of getting ready for canada  canada minnie exclaimed alarmed youre not really going to canada oh una youre joking you dont mean to say youre going out there to find him  i took her hand in mine and held it up in the air above her head solemnly  dear cousin i said i love you but you must promise me this one thing whatever may happen give me your sacred word of honour youll never tell anybody what weve said here tonight youll kill me if you do i dont want any living soul on earth to know of it  i spoke so seriously minnie felt it was important  i promise you she answered growing suddenly far graver than her wont oh una i havent the faintest idea what you mean but no torture on earth shall ever wring a word of it from me  so i went to bed in her arms and cried myself to sleep thinking with my latest breath in a tremor of horror that id found it at last courtenay ivor was the name of my fathers murderer       chapter xiv  my welcome to canada      the voyage across the atlantic was long and uneventful no whales no icebergs no excitement of any sort my fellowpassengers said it was as dull as it was calm but as for me i had plenty to occupy my mind meanwhile strange things had happened in the interval and were happening to me on the way strange things in part of my own internal history  for before i left england as i sat with aunt emma in her little drawingroom at bartononthesea discussing my plans and devising routes westward she made me quite suddenly an unexpected confession  una she said after a long pause you havent told me my dear why youre going to canada and i dont want to ask you i know pretty well we neednt touch upon that youre going to hunt up some supposed clue to the murderer  perhaps so auntie i said oracularly and perhaps not  for i didnt want it to get talked about and be put into all the newspapers and i knew now if i wanted to keep it out i must first be silent  aunt emma drew nearer and took my hand in hers at the same time she held up the other scarred and lacerated palm  do you know when i got that una she asked with a sudden burst well ill tell you my child it was the night of your fathers death and i got it climbing over the wall at the grange to escape detection  my blood ran cold once more what on earth could this mean had auntie but no i had the evidence of my own senses that it was courtenay ivor id tracked him down now there was no room for doubt the man on the wagon was the man who fired the shot i could have sworn to that bent back of my own knowledge among a thousand  i hadnt long to wait however auntie went on after a short pause  i was there she said by accident trying for once to see you  i looked at her fixedly still and still i said nothing  i was stopping with friends at the time ten miles off from woodbury aunt emma went on smoothing my hand with hers and i longed so to see you i came over by train that day and stopped late about the town in hopes i might meet you in the street but i was disappointed towards evening i ventured even to go into the grounds of the grange and look about everywhere on the chance that i might see you perhaps your father might be out i went round towards the window which i now know to be the library as i went i saw a bicycle leaning up against the wall by the window i thought that must be some visitor but still i went on but just as i reached the window i saw a flash of electric light and by the light i could make out your fathers head and beard he looked as if he were talking angrily and loudly to somebody the window was open i was afraid to stop longer in a sudden access of fear i ran across the shrubbery towards the gardenwall to tell you the truth i was horribly frightened why i dont know for nothing had happened as yet i suppose it was just the dusk and the mean sense of intrusion  she paused and wiped her brow i sat still and listened eagerly  presently she went on very low as i ran and ran i heard behind me a loud crasha sound as of a pistolshot that terrified me still more i thought i was being pursued perhaps they took me for a burglar in the agony of my terror i rushed at the wall in mad haste and climbed over it anyhow in climbing i tore my hand as you see and made myself bleed oh terribly however i persevered and got down on the other side with my clothes very little the worse for the scramble and fortunately i was carrying a small light dustcloak i put it on at once and it covered up everything then i began to walk along the road as fast as i could in the direction of the station as i did so a bicycle shot out from the gate in the opposite direction going as hard as it could spin simply flying towards whittingham three minutes later a man came up to me breathless it was the gardener at the grange i believe  have you seen anybody go this way he asked a young man running hard a young man in knickerbockers  nno i answered trembling for i was afraid to confess not a soul has gone past  of course i didnt know of the murder as yet and i only wanted to get off unperceived to the station  id bound up my hand in my handkerchief by that time and held it tight under my cloak i went back by train unnoticed and returned to my friends house i hadnt even told them i was going to woodbury at all i pretended id been spending the day at whittingham next morning i read in the paper of your fathers murder  i stared hard at aunt emma  why didnt you tell me this long ago i cried in an agony of suspense why didnt you give evidence and say so at the inquest  how could i aunt emma answered looking back at me appealingly the circumstances were too suspicious as it was everybody was running after the young man in knickerbockers nobody took any notice of a little old lady in a long grey dustcloak but if once id confessed and shown my wounded hand who would ever have believed id nothing to do with the murderexcept you perhaps una oh no i came back here to my own home as fast as ever i could for i was really ill i took to my bed at once and as nobody called me to give evidence at the inquest i said nothing to anybody  but the bicycle i cried the bicycle you ought to have mentioned that you were the only one who saw it it was a clue to the murderer  if id told aunt emma answered i should never have been allowed to take charge of you at all i thought my one clear duty was to my sisters child it was to take care of your health in your shattered condition and even now una i tell you only for this if you find out anything new in canada or here try not to drag me into it i couldnt stand the strain crossexamination would kill me  ill remember it auntie i said wearied out with excitement but i think you did wrong all the same in a case like this its everybodys first duty to tell all he knows in the interests of justice  however this confession of aunt emmas rendered one thing more certain to me than ever before i was sure i was on the right track now after courtenay ivor the bicycle clinched the proof  but i said nothing as yet to the police or to my friendly inspector i was determined to hunt the whole thing up on my own account first and then deliver my criminal when fully secured to the laws of my country  not that i was vindictive not that i wanted to punish the man no i shrank terribly from the task but to relieve myself from this persistent sense of surrounding mystery and to free others from suspicion i felt compelled to discover him it seemed to me like a duty laid upon me from without i dared not shirk it  on the way out to quebec the sea seemed to revive strange memories i had never crossed it before except long long ago on my way home from australia and now that i sat on deck in a wickerchair and looked at the deep dark waves by myself i began once more in vague snatches to recall that earlier voyage it came back to me all of itself and that was quite in keeping with my previous recollections my past life i felt sure was unfolding itself slowly to me in regular succession from childhood onward  sitting there on the quarterdeck gazing hard at the waves i remembered how i had played on a similar ship years and years before a little girl in short frocks with my mamma in a long foldingchair beside me i could see my mamma with a sort of frightened smile on her poor pale face and she looked so unhappy my papa was there too somewhat older and greyervery unlike the papa of my first australian picture his face was so much hairier mamma cried a good deal at times and papa tried to comfort her besides what struck me most there was no more baby i wasnt even allowed to speak about baby that subject was tabooedperhaps because it always made mamma cry so much and press me hard to her bosom at any rate i remembered how once i spoke of baby to some fellowpassenger in the saloon and papa was very angry and caught me up in his arms and took me down to my berth and there i had to stop all day by myself though it was rolling hard and could have no fruit for dinner because id been naughty i was strictly enjoined never to mention baby to anyone again either then or at any time i was to forget all about her  day after day as we sailed on reminiscences of the same sort crowded thicker and thicker upon me never reminiscences of my later life but always early scenes brought up by distinct suggestion of that australian voyage when we passed a ship it burst upon me how wed passed such ships before when there was firedrill on deck i remembered having assisted years earlier at just such firedrill the whole past came back like a dream so that i could reconstruct now the first five or six years of my life almost entirely and yet even so there was a gap a puzzle a difficulty somehow i couldnt make the chronology of this slowreturning memory fit in as it ought with the chronology of the facts given to me by aunt emma and the moores of torquay there was a constant discrepancy it seemed to me that i must be a year or two older at least than they made me out i remembered the voyage home far too well for my age i fancied i went back further in my australian recollections than would be possible from the dates aunt emma assigned me  slowly as i compared these mental pictures of my first childhood one with the other a strange fact seemed to loom forth incomprehensible incredible when first it struck me all unnerved as i was my reason staggered before it but it was true none the less quite true i felt certain had i had two papas thenfor the pictures differed so was one cleanshaven trim and in a linen coat the same as the other older graver and sterner with much hair on his face and a rough sort of look whom i saw more persistently in my later childish memories i could hardly believe it one man couldnt alter so greatly in a few short years yet i thought of them both alike quite unquestioningly as papa i thought of them too i fancied in a dim sort of way as one and the same person  these fresh mysteries occupied my mind for the greater part of that uneventful voyage to throw them off i laughed and talked as much as possible with the rest of the passengers indeed i gained the reputation of being an awfully jolly girl so heartily did i throw myself into all the games and amusements to escape from the burden of my pressing thoughts and i believe many old ladies on board were thoroughly scandalised that a woman whose father had been brutally murdered should ever be able to seem so bright and lively again how little they knew and what a world of mystery seemed to oppress and surround me  at last early one morning we reached the gulf and took in our pilot off the straits of belleisle i was on deck at the time playing a game called shovelboard as the pilot reached the ship he took the captains hand and to my immense surprise said in an audible voice  so youve the famous miss callingham for a passenger i hear this voyage theres the latest quebec papers youll see youre looked for our people are expecting her  i rushed forward fiery hot and with a trembling hand took one of the papers he was distributing all round right and left to the people on deck it was unendurable that the memory of that one event should thus dog me through life with such ubiquitous persistence i tore open the sheet there with horrified eyes i read this hateful paragraph in the atrociously vulgar style of transatlantic journalism  the sarmatian expected off belleisle tomorrow morning brings among her passengers as we learn by telegram the famous una callingham whose connection with the socalled woodbury mystery is now a matter of historical interest the mysterious twosouled lady possesses at present all her faculties intact as before the murder and is indeed people say a remarkably spry and intelligent young person but she has most conveniently forgotten all the events of her past life and more particularly the circumstances of her fathers death which is commonly conjectured to have been due to the pistol of some unknown lover such freaks of memory are common we all know in the matter of small debts and of newspaper subscriptions but they seldom extend quite so far as the violent death of a near relation however una knows her own business best the sarmatian is due alongside the bonsecours quay at 10 am on wednesday the 10th and all quebec will no doubt be assembled at the landingstage to say goodmorning to the twosouled lady  the paper dropped from my hand this was too horrible for anything how i was ever to go through the ordeal of the landing at quebec after that i hadnt the faintest conception and was i to be dogged and annoyed like this through all my canadian trip by anonymous scribblers had these people no hearts no consideration for the sensitiveness of an english lady  i looked over the side of the ship at the darkblue water oh how i longed to plunge into it and be released for ever from this abiding nightmare       chapter xv  a new acquaintance      the moment we reached the quay at quebec some two days later a dozen young men with little notebooks in their hands jumped on board all at once  miss callingham they cried with one accord making a dash for the quarterdeck which is she oh thisif you please miss callingham i should like to have ten minutes of your time to interview you  i clapped my hands to my ears and stood back all horrified what i should have done i dont know but for a very kind man in a big rough overcoat who had jumped on board at the same time and made over to me like the reporters he stepped up to me at once pushed aside the young men and said in a most friendly tone  miss callingham i think youd better come with me then these people are all sharks everybody in quebecs agog to see the two souled lady answer no questions at all take not the least notice of them just follow me to the custom house let them rave but dont speak to them  who are you i asked blindly clinging to his arm in my terror  im a policeman in plain clothes my new friend answered and ive been specially detailed by order for this duty im here to look after you youve friends in canada though you may have quite forgotten them theyve sent me to help you those are two of my chums there standing aside by the gangway well walk you off between us dont be afraidhere you sir there make wayno one shall come near you  i was so nervous and so ashamed that i accepted my strange escort without inquiry or remonstrance he helped me with remarkable politeness for a common policeman across to the custom house where i sat waiting for my luggage reporters and sightseers meanwhile pressed obtrusively around me my protector held them back i was half wild with embarrassment im naturally a reserved and somewhat sensitive girl and this american publicity made me crimson with bashfulness  as i sat there waiting however the two other policemen to whom my champion had beckoned sat one on each side of me keeping off the idle crowd while my first friend looked after the luggage and saw it safely through the customs for me he must be an inspector i fancied or some other superior officer the officials were so deferential to him i gave him my keys and he looked after everything himself i had nothing for my part to do but to sit and wait patiently for him  as soon as he had finished he called a porter to his side  vite he cried in a tone of authority to the man un fiacre  and the porter called one  i started to find that i knew what he meant till that moment in my second state i had learned no french and didnt know i could speak any but i recognised the words quite well as soon as he uttered them my lost knowledge reasserted itself  they bundled on my boxes the crowd still stood around and gaped at me openmouthed i got into the cab more dead than alive  allez my policeman cried to the frenchcanadian driver seating himself by my side  a la gare du chemin de fer pacific aussi vite que possible  i understood every word this was wonderful my memory was coming back again  the man tore along the streets to the pacific railway station by the time we reached it we had distanced the sightseers though some of them gave chase my policeman got out  the trains just going he said sharply dont take a ticket for palmyra if you dont want to be followed and tracked out all the way theyll telegraph on your destination book to kingston instead and then change at sharbot lake and take a second ticket on from there to palmyra  i listened half dazed palmyra was the place where dr ivor lived yet even in the hurry of the moment i wondered much to myself how the policeman knew i wanted to go to palmyra  there was no time to ask questions however or to deliberate on my plans i took my ticket as desired in a turmoil of feelings and jumped on to the train i trusted by this time i had eluded detection i ought to have come i saw now under a feigned name this horrid publicity was more than i could endure my policeman helped me in with his persistent politeness and saw my boxes checked as far as sharbot lake for me then he handed me the checks  go in the pullman he said quietly its a long journey you know fourandtwenty hours youve only just caught it but if youd stopped in quebec youd never have been able to give the sightseers the slip youd have been pestered all through i think youre safe now it was this or nothing  oh thank you so much i cried with heartfelt gratitude leaning out of the window as the train was on the point of starting i pulled out my purse and drew timidly forth a sovereign ive only english money i said hesitating for i didnt know whether hed be offended or not at the offer of a tiphe seemed such a perfect gentleman but if thats any use to you  he smiled a broad smile and shook his head much amused  oh thank you he said half laughing with a very curious air im a policeman as i told you but i dont need tips im the chief constable of quebectheres my card major taschereland im glad to be of use im sure to any friend of dr ivors  he lifted his hat with the inborn grace of a highborn gentleman i coloured and bowed the train steamed out of the station as it went i fell back half fainting in the comfortable armchair of the pullman car hardly able to speak with surprise and horror it was all so strange so puzzling so bewildering then i owed my escape from the stenographic myrmidons of the canadian press to the polite care and attention of my fathers murderer  major tascherel was a friend he said of dr ivors  then dr ivor knew i had come he knew i was going to palmyra to find him and yet he had written to quebec apparently expecting this crush and asking his friend the chief constable to protect and befriend me had he murdered my father and was he in love with me still did he think id come out not to track him down but to look for him strange horrible questions my heart stood still within me at this extraordinary revelation yet i was so frightened at the moment alone in a strange land that i felt almost grateful to the murderer himself for his kindness in thinking of me and providing for my reception  as i settled in my seat and had time to realise what these things meant it dawned upon me by degrees that all this was less remarkable after all than i first thought it for they had telegraphed from england that i sailed on the sarmatian and dr ivor like everybody else must have read the telegram he might naturally conclude i would be halfmobbed by reporters and as it was clear he had once been fond of mehateful as i felt it even to admit the fact to myselfhe might really have desired to save me annoyance and trouble it was degrading to be sure even to think i owed anything of any sort to such a wretch as that murderer yet in a certain corner of my heart i couldnt help being thankful to him but how strange to feel i had come there on purpose to hunt him down how horrible that i must so repay good with evil  then a still more ghastly thought surged up suddenly in my mind why on earth did he think i was going to palmyra was it possible he fancied i loved him stillthat i wanted to marry him could he imagine id come out just to fling myself at his feet and ask him to take me could he suppose id forgotten all the rest of my past life and his vile act as well and yet remembered alone what little love if any i ever had borne him it was incredible that any man however wicked however conceited should think such folly as thatthat a girl would marry her fathers murderer and yet what might not one expect from a man who after having shot my father had still the inconceivable and unbelievable audacity to take deliberate steps for securing my own comfort and happiness from such a wretch as that one might look for almost anything  for ten minutes or more as we whirled along the line in the pullman car i was too dazed and confused to notice anything around me my brain swam vaguely filled full with wild whirling thoughts the strange drama of my life always teeming with mysteries seemed to culminate in this reception in an unknown land by people who appeared almost to know more about my business than i myself did i gazed out of the window blankly in some vague dim way i saw we were passing between rocky hills pineclad and beautiful with deep glimpses now and then into the riven gorge of a noble river but i didnt even realise to myself that these were canadian hillsthose were the heights of abrahamthat was the silver st lawrence it all passed by like a living dream i sat still in my chair as one stunned and faint i gazed out more dead than alive on the unfamiliar scene that unrolled itself in exquisite panorama before me quebec and the laurentian hills were to me half unreal the inner senses alone were awake and conscious  presently a gentle voice at my side broke not at all unpleasantly the current of my reflections it was a ladys voice very sweet and musical  im afraid it said kindly with an air of tender solicitude you only just caught the train and were hurried and worried and flurried at the last at the station you look so white and tired how your breath comes and goes and i think youre new to our canadian ways i saw you didnt understand about the checks for the baggage let me take away this bag and put it up in the rack for you heres a footstool for your feet thatll make you more comfortable  at the first sound of her sweet voice i turned to look at the speaker she was a girl perhaps a year or two younger than myself very slender and graceful and with eyes like a mothers she wasnt exactly pretty but her face was so full of intelligence and expression that it was worth a great deal more than any dolllike prettiness  perhaps it was pleasure at being spoken to kindly at all in this land of strangers perhaps it was revulsion from the agony of shame and modesty i had endured at quebec but at any rate i felt drawn at first sight to my sweetvoiced fellowtraveller besides she reminded me somewhat of minnie moore and that resemblance alone was enough to attract me i looked up at her gratefully  oh thank you so much i cried putting my bag in her hand ive only just come out from england and id hardly time at quebec to catch the train and the people crowded around so that i was flustered at landing and everything somehow seems to be going against me  and with that my poor overwrought nerves gave way all at once and without any more ado i just burst out crying  the lady by my side leant over me tenderly  therecry dear she said as if shed known me for years stooping down and almost caressing me jackand she turned to a tall gentleman at her sidequick youve got my black bag get me out the sal volatile shes quite faint poor thing we must look after her instantly  the person to whom she spoke and who was apparently her husband or her brother took down the black bag from the rack hastily and got out the sal volatile as my friend directed him he poured a little into a tumbler and held it quietly to my lips i liked his manner as id liked the ladys he was so very brotherly besides there was something extremely soothing about his quick noiseless way he did it all so fast yet without the faintest sign of agitation i couldnt help thinking what a good nurse he would make he was so rapid and effective yet so gentle and so quiet he seemed perfectly accustomed to the ways of nervous women  i dried my eyes after a while and looked up in his face he was very goodlooking and had a charming soft smile how lucky i should have tumbled upon such pleasant travelling companions in my present mental state i had need of sympathy and indeed they took as much care of me and coddled me up as tenderly as if theyd known me for years i was almost tempted to make a clean breast of my personality to them and tell them why it was i had been so worried and upset by my reception at quebec but i shrank from confessing it i hated my own name almost it seemed to bring me such very unpleasant notoriety  in a very few minutes i felt quite at home with my new friends i explained to them that when i landed i had no intention of going on west by train at once but that news which i received on the way had compelled me to push forward by the very first chance and that i had to change my ticket at a place called sharbot lake whose very position or distance i hadnt had time to discover the lady smiled sweetly and calmed my fears by telling me we wouldnt reach sharbot lake till midday tomorrow and that i would have plenty of time there to book on to my destination  thus encouraged i went on to tell them i had no canadian money having brought out what i needed for travelling expenses and hotels in bank of england 20 pound notes the lady smiled again and said in the friendliest way  oh my brotherll get them changed for you at montreal as we pass wont you jack or at least as much as you need till you get toshe checked herselfthe end of your journey  i noticed how she pulled herself up though at the moment i attached no particular importance to it  so he was her brother not her husband then well he was a very nice fellow either way and nobody could be kinder or more sympathetic than hed been to me so far  we fell into conversation which soon by degrees grew quite intimate  how far west are you going the man she called jack asked after a little time tentatively  and i answered all unsuspiciously  to a place called palmyra  why we live not far from palmyra the sister replied with a smile were going that way now our stations adolphus town the very next village  i hadnt yet learned to join the wisdom of the serpent to the innocence of the dove im afraid remember though in some ways i was a woman full grown in others i was little more than a four yearold baby  do you know a dr ivor there i asked eagerly leaning forward  oh yes quite well the lady answered arranging my footstool more comfortably as she spoke hes got a farm out there now and hardly practises at all how queer it is one always finds one knows people in common is dr ivor a friend of yours  i recoiled at the stray question almost as if id been shot  oh no i cried horrified at the bare idea of such treason hes anything but a friend ii only wanted to know about him  the lady looked at jack and jack looked at the lady were they telegraphing signs i fancied somehow they gave one another very meaning glances jack was the first to speak breaking an awkward silence  you cant expect everyone to know your own friends or to like them either elsie he said slowly with his eyes fixed hard on her as if he expected her to flare up  my heart misgave me a hateful idea arose in it could my sweet travelling companion be engagedto my fathers murderer  but hes a dear good fellow for all that jack elsie said stoutly and strange as it sounds to say so i admired her for sticking up for her friend dr ivor if she really liked him i wont hear him run down by anybody not even by you if this lady knew him better im sure shed like him as we all do  jack turned the conversation abruptly  but if youre going to palmyra he asked where do you mean to stop have you thought about lodgings you mustnt imagine its a place like an english town with an inn or hotel or good private apartments theres nowhere you can put up at in these brandnew villages are you going to friends or did you expect to find quarters as easily as in england  this was a difficulty which indeed had never even occurred to me till that moment i stammered and hesitated  well i said slowly to tell you the truth i havent thought about that the landing at quebec was such a dreadful surprise to me andtears came into my eyes againi had a great shock thereand i had to come on so quick i didnt ask about anything but catching the train i meant to stop a night or two either at quebec or in montreal and to make all inquiries but circumstances you see have prevented that so i really dont know what id better do when i get to palmyra  i do my new friend answered quickly her soft sweet voice having quite a decisive ring in it youd better not go on to palmyra at all theres no sort of accommodation there except a horrid drinkingsaloon youd better stop short at adolphus town and spend the night with us and then you can look about you next day if you like and see what chance there may be of finding decent quarters old mrs wilkins might take her in jack or the blacks at the tannery  i smiled and felt touched  oh how good of you i cried but i really couldnt think of it thank you ever so much though for your kind thought all the same its so good and sweet of you but you dont even know who i am i have no introduction  youre your own best introduction elsie said with a pretty nod i thought of her somehow from the very first moment i heard her name as elsie and as to your not knowing us never mind about that we know you at first sight its the canadian way to entertain angels unawares out here you know hospitalitys the rule of the country  well i demurred for a long time i fought off their invitation as well as i could i couldnt bear thus to quarter myself upon utter strangers but they both were so pressing and brought up so many cogent arguments why i couldnt go alone to the one village saloona mere whiskydrinking publichouse they said of very bad characterthat in the long run i was fain almost to acquiesce in their kind plan for my temporary housing besides after my horrid experience at quebec it was such a positive relief to me to meet anybody nice and delicate that i couldnt find it in my heart to refuse these dear people and then perhaps it was best not to go quite on to palmyra at once for fear of unexpectedly running against my fathers murderer if i met him in the street and he recognised me and spoke to me what on earth could i do my head was all in a whirl indeed as to what he might intend or expect for i felt sure he expected me i made one last despairing effort  if i stop at your house though i said half ashamed of myself for venturing to make conditions theres one promise you must make methat i shant see dr ivor unless you let me know and get my consent beforehand  jack as i called him to myself answered gaily back with a rather curious smile  if you like you need see nobody but our own two selves well promise not to introduce anybody to you without due leave and to let you do as you like in that and in everything  so i yielded at last  well i must know your name i said tentatively  and jack looking queerly at me with an inquiring air said  my sisters names elsie mines john cheriton  and yours elsie asked glancing timidly down at me  my heart beat hard i was face to face with a dilemma these were friends of courtenay ivors and i had given myself away to them i was going to their house to accept their hospitalityand to betray their friend never in my life did i feel so guilty before oh what on earth was i to do i had told them too much i had gone to work foolishly if i said my real name i should let out my whole secret i must brazen it out now with tremulous lips and flushed cheek i answered quickly julia marsden  elsie drew back all abashed in a moment her cheek grew still redder i felt sure than my own  oh marsden she cried eyeing me close why i thought you were miss callingham  how on earth did you know that i exclaimed terrified almost out of my life was i never for one moment to escape my own personality  why they put it in the papers that you were coming elsie answered looking tenderly at me more in sympathy than in anger and its written on your bag you know that jack put up in the rack there thats why we were so sorry for you and so grieved at the way you must have been hustled on the quay and thats also why we wanted you to come to us but dont be a bit afraid we quite understand you want to travel incognita after the sort of reception you got at quebec no wonder youre afraid of these hateful sightseers very well dear she took my hand with the air of an old friend your disguise shall be respected while you stop at our house miss marsden let it be you can make any inquiries you like about dr ivor we will be secrecy itself well say nothing to anyone and my brotherll take your ticket at sharbot lake for adolphus town  i broke down once more i fairly cried at such kindness  oh how good you are i said how very very good this is more than one could ever have expected from strangers  she held my hand and stroked it  were not strangers she answered were english ourselves we sympathise deeply with you in this new strange country you must treat us exactly like a brother and sister we liked you at first sight and were sure well get on with you  i lifted her hand to my lips and kissed it  and i liked you also i said and your brother too youre both so good and kind how can i ever sufficiently thank you       chapter xvi  my plans alter      the rest of that day we spent chatting very amicably in our pullman armchairs i couldnt understand it myselfwhen i had a moment to think i was shocked and horrified at it i was so terribly at home with them these were friends of dr ivorsfriends of my fathers murderer i had come out to canada to track him to deliver him over if i could to the strong hand of justice and yet there i was talking away with his neighbours and friends as if i had known them all my life and loved them dearly nay what was more i couldnt in my heart of hearts help liking them they were really sweet peopleso kind and sympathetic so perceptive of my sensitiveness they asked no questions that could hurt me in any way they showed no curiosity about the object of my visit or my relation to dr ivor they were kindness and courtesy itself i could see mr cheriton was a gentleman in fibre and elsie was as sweet as any woman on earth could be  byandby the time came for the pullman saloon to be transformed for the night into a regular sleepingcar all this was new to me and i watched it with interest as soon as the beds were made up i crept into my berth and my new friend elsie took her place on the sofa below me i lay awake long and thought over the situation the more i thought of it the stranger it all seemed i tried hard to persuade myself i was running some great danger in accepting the cheritons invitation certainly i had behaved with consummate imprudence canada is a country i said to myself where they kidnap and murder welltodo young englishmen how much easier then to kidnap and murder a poor weak stray english girl i was entirely at the mercy of the cheritons that was clear and the cheritons were dr ivors friends as i thought all the circumstances over the full folly of my own conduct came home to me more and more i had let these people suppose i was travelling under an assumed name i had let them know my ticket was not for palmyra but for kingston where i didnt mean to go i had told them i meant to change it at sharbot lake so they were aware that no one on earth but themselves had any idea where i had gone and i had further divulged to them the important fact that i had plenty of ready money in bank of england notes i stood aghast at my own silliness but still i did not distrust them  no i did not distrust them i felt i ought to be distrustful i felt it might be expected of me but they were so gentlemannered and so sweetnatured that i couldnt distrust them i tried very hard but distrust wouldnt come to me that kind fellow jacki thought of him just so as jack alreadycouldnt hurt a fly much less kill a woman it grieved me to think i would have to hurt his feelings  for now that i came to look things squarely in the face in my berth by myself i began to see how utterly impossible it would be for me after all to go and stop with the cheritons how i could ever have dreamt it feasible i could hardly conceive i ought to have refused at once i ought to have been braver i ought to have said outright ill have nothing to do or say with anyone who is a friend or an acquaintance of courtenay ivors and yet to have said so would have been to give up the game for lost it would have been to proclaim that i had come out to canada as courtenay ivors enemy  i wasnt fit that was the fact for my selfimposed task of private detective  a good part of that night i lay awake in my berth bitterly reproaching myself for having come on this wildgoose chase without the aid of a manan experienced officer next morning i rose and breakfasted in the car the cheritons breakfasted with me and sad to say seemed more charming than ever that good fellow jack was so attentive and kind i almost felt ashamed to have to refuse his hospitality and as for elsie she couldnt have treated me more nicely or cordially if shed been my own sister it wasnt what they said that touched my heart it was what they didnt say or dotheir sweet generous reticence  after breakfast i steeled myself for the task and broke it to them gently that thinking it over in the night id come to the conclusion i couldnt consistently accept their proffered welcome  i dont know how to say no to you i cried after youve been so wonderfully kind and nice but reasons which i cant fully explain just now make me feel it would be wrong of me to think of stopping with you it would hamper my independence of action to be in anybody elses house i must shift for myself and try if i cant find board and lodging somewhere  find it with us then elsie put in eagerly if thats all thats the matter im sure were not proudare we jacknot a bit sooner than you should go elsewhere and be uncomfortable in your rooms id take you in myself and board you and look after you you could pay what you like and then youd retain your independence you see as much as ever you wanted  but her brother interrupted her with a somewhat graver air  it goes deeper than that im afraid elsie he said turning his eye full upon her if miss callingham feels she couldnt be happy in stopping with us shed better try elsewhere though where on earth we can put her i havent just now the very slightest idea but well turn it over in our own minds before we reach adolphus town  there was a sweet reasonableness about jack that attracted me greatly i could see he entered vaguely into the real nature of my feelings but he wouldnt crossquestion me he was too much of a gentleman  miss callingham knows her own motives best he said more than once when elsie tried to return to the charge if she feels she cant come to us we must be content to do the best we can for her with our neighbours perhaps mrs walters would take her in shes our clergymans wife miss callingham and you mightnt feel the same awkwardness with her as with my sister  does she knowdr ivor i faltered out unable to conceal my real reasons entirely  not so intimately as we do jack answered with a quick glance at his sister we might ask her at any rate there are so few houses in palmyra or the neighbourhood where you could live as youre accustomed that we mustnt be particular but at least youll spend one night with us and then we can arrange all the other things afterward  my mind was made up  no not even one night i said i couldnt accept hospitality from dr ivors friends between his faction and mine there could be nothing now but the bitterest enmity how dare i even parley with people who were friends of my fathers murderer  yet i was sorry to disappoint that good fellow jack all the same did he want me to sleep one night at his house on purpose to rob me and murder me girl as i was and rendered timorous in some ways by the terrible shocks i had received i couldnt for one moment believe it i knew he was good i knew he was honourable gentle a gentleman  so journeying on all morning we reached sharbot lake still with nothing decided at the little junction station jack got me my ticket that was the turning point in my career the die was cast there i lost my identity a crowd lounged around the platform and surged about the pullman car calling to see una callingham but no una callingham appeared on the scene i went on in the same train without a word to anyone all unknown save to the two cheritons and as an unrecognised unit of common humanity i had cast that horrid identity clean behind me  the afternoon was pleasant in spite of my uncertainty it gave me a sense of pleased confidence to be in the cheritons company i had taken to them at once and the more i talked with them the better i liked them especially jack that nice brotherly jack who seemed almost like an old friend to me you get to know people so well on a long railway journey i was quite sorry to think that by five oclock that afternoon we should reach adolphus town and so part company  about ten minutes to five we were collecting our scattered things and putting our fronthair straight by the mirror in the ladies compartment  well miss cheriton i said warmly longing to kiss her as i spoke i shall never forget how kind you two have been to me i do wish so much i hadnt to leave you like this but its quite inevitable i dont see really how i could ever endure  i said no more for just at that moment as the words trembled on my lips a terrible jar thrilled suddenly through the length and breadth of the carriage something in front seemed to rush into us with a deep thud there was a crash a fierce grating a dull hiss a clatter broken glass was flying about the very earth beneath the wheels seemed to give way under us next instant all was blank i just knew i was lying bruised and stunned and bleeding on a bare dry bank with my limbs aching painfully  i guessed what it all meant a collision no doubt but i lay faint and ill and knew nothing for the moment as to what had become of my fellowpassengers       chapter xvii  a strange recognition      gradually i was aware of somebody moistening my temples a soft palm held my hand elsie was leaning over me i opened my eyes with a start  oh elsie i cried how kind of you  it seemed to me quite natural to call her elsie  even as i spoke somebody else raised my head and poured something down my throat i swallowed it with a gulp then i opened my eyes again  and jack too i murmured  it seemed as if hed been jack to me for years and years already  she knows us elsie cried clasping her hands shes much bettermuch better quick jack more brandy and make haste therea stretcher  there was a noise close by unseen hands lifted me up and jack laid me on the stretcher halfanhour at least must have elapsed i felt since the first shock of the accident i had been unconscious meanwhile the actual crash came and went like lightning and my memory of all else was blotted out for the moment  next as i lay still two men took the stretcher and carried me off at a slow pace under jacks direction they walked singlefile along the line and turned down a rough road that led off near a river i didnt ask where they were going i was too weak and feeble at last they came to a house a small white wooden cottage very colonial and simple but neat and pretty there was a garden in front full of oldfashioned flowering shrubs and a verandah ran round the house about whose posts clambered sweet english creepers  they carried me in and laid me down on a bed in a sweet little room very plain but dainty it was panelled with polished pitchpine and roses peeped in at the open window everything about the cottage bore the impress of native good taste i knew it was jacks home it was just such a room as i should have expected from elsie  the bed on which they placed me was neat and soft i lay there dozing with pain elsie sat by my side her own arm in a sling byandby an irish maid came in and undressed me carefully under elsies direction then elsie said to me half shrinking  now you must see the doctor  not dr ivor i cried waking up to a full sense of this new threatened horror whatever i do dear i wont see dr ivor  jack had come in while she spoke and was standing by the bed i saw now the servant had gone out he lifted my arm and held my wrist in his hand  im a doctor myself miss callingham he said softly with that quiet reassuring voice of his dont be alarmed at that nobody but myself and elsie need come near you in any way  i smiled at his words well pleased  oh im so glad youre a doctor i cried much relieved at the news for im not the least little bit in the world afraid of you i dont mind your attending me i like to have you with me for i had always a great fancy for doctors somehow  thats well he said smiling at me such a sweet sympathetic smile as he felt my pulse with his finger confidence is the first great requisite in a patient its half the battle youre not seriously hurt i hope but youre very much shaken whether you like it or not youll have to stop here now for some days at least till youre thoroughly recovered  im ashamed to write it down but i was really pleased to hear it nothing would have induced me to go voluntarily to their house with the intention of stopping therefor they were friends of dr ivors but when youre carried on a stretcher to the nearest convenient house youre not responsible for your own actions and they were both so nice and kind it was a pleasure to be near them so i was almost thankful for that horrid accident which had cut the gordian knot of my perplexity as to a house to lodge in  it was a fortnight before i was well enough to get out of bed and lie comfortably on the sofa all that time jack and elsie tended me with unsparing devotion elsie had a little bed made up in my room and jack came to see me two or three times a day and sat for whole hours with me it was so nice he was a doctor a doctor you know isnt a manin some ways and it soothed me so to have him sitting there with elsie by my bedside  they were jack and elsie to me to their faces before three days were out and i was plain una to them it sounded so sweet and sisterly elsie slipped it out the second morning as naturally as could be  unad like a cup of tea jack then as red as fire all at once she corrected herself and added i mean miss callingham  oh do call me una i cried its so much nicer and more natural but how did you come to know my name was una at all for she slipped it out as glibly as if shed always called me so  why everybody knows that elsie answered amused the whole world speaks of you always as una callingham you forget youre a celebrity doctors have read memoirs about you at medical congresses youve been discussed in every paper in europe and america  i paused and sighed this was very humiliating it was unpleasant to rank in the public mind somewhere between constance kent and laura bridgman but i had to put up with it  very well i said with a deep breath if those i dont care for call me so behind my back let me at least have the pleasure of hearing myself called so by those i love like you elsie  she leant over me and kissed my forehead with a burst of genuine delight  then you love me una she exclaimed  how can i help it i answered i love you dearly already and i might have added with truth and your brother also  for jack was really without any exception the most lovable man i ever met in my lifeat once so strong and manly and yet so womanly and so gentle every day i stopped there i liked him better and better i was glad when he came into my room and sorry when he went away again to work on the farm for he worked very hard his hand was all horny with common agricultural labour it was sad to think of such a man having to do such work and yet he was so clever and such a capital doctor i wondered he hadnt done well and stayed in england but elsie told me hed had great disappointments and failed in his profession through no fault of his own i could never understand that he had such a delightful manner though perhaps i was prejudiced for in point of fact i began to feel i was really in love with jack cheriton  and jack was in love with me too this was a curious result of my voyage to canada in search of dr ivor instead of hunting up the criminal i had stopped to fall in love with one of his friends and neighbours and i found it so delicious i wont pretend to deny it i was absolutely happy when jack sat by my bedside and held my hand in his i didnt know what it would lead to or whether it would ever lead to anything at all but i was happy meanwhile just to love and be loved by him i think when youre really in love thats quite enough jack never proposed to me he never asked me to marry him he just sat by my bedside and held my hand and once when elsie went out to fetch my beeftea he stooped hastily down and kissed me oh so tenderly i dont know why but i wasnt the least surprised it seemed to me quite natural that jack should kiss me  so i went idly on for a fortnight in a sort of lazy lotusland never thinking of the future but as happy and as much at home as if id lived all my life with jack and elsie i hated even to think i would soon be well for then id have to go and look out for courtenay ivor  at last one afternoon i was sufficiently strong to be lifted out of bed and dressed in a morning robe and laid out on the sofa in the little drawingroom it looked out upon the verandah which was high above the ground and jack came in and sat with me alone without elsie my heart throbbed high at that i liked to be alone for halfanhour with jack perhaps but who knows well at any rate even if he didnt it was nice to have the chance of a good long quiet chat with him i loved elsie dearly but at a moment like this why i liked to have jack all to myself without even elsie  so i was pleased when jack told me elsie was going into palmyra with the buggy to get the english letters then shed be gone a good long time oh how lovely how beautiful  is there anything youd like from the town he asked as elsie drove past the window anything elsie could get for you if so please say so  i hesitated a moment  do you think i asked at last for i didnt want to be troublesome she could get me a lemon  oh certainly jack answered there she goes in the buggy here wait a moment una ill run after her to the gate this minute and tell her  he sprang lightly on to the parapet of the verandah then with one hand held behind him to poise himself palm open backward he leapt with a bound to the road and darted after her hurriedly  my heart stood still within me that action revealed him the back the open hand the gesture the bendi would have known them anywhere with a horrible revulsion i recognised the truth this was my fathers murderer this was courtenay ivor       chapter xviii  murder will out      he was gone but for three minutes meanwhile i buried my face in my burning hands and cried to myself in unspeakable misery  for horrible as it sounds to say so i knew perfectly well now that jack was dr ivor yet in spite of that knowledge i loved him still he was my fathers murderer and i couldnt help loving him  it was that that filled up the cup of my misery to overflowing i loved the man well and i must turn to denounce him  he came back flushed and hot expecting thanks for his pains  well shell get you the lemon una he said panting i overtook her by the big tuliptree  i gazed at him fixedly taking my hands from my face with the tears still wet on my burning cheek  youve deceived me i cried sternly jack youve given me a false name i know who you are now youre no jack at all youre courtenay ivor  he drew back quite amazed yet he didnt seem thunderstruck not fear but surprise was the leading note on his features  so youve found that out at last una he exclaimed staring hard at me then you remember me after all darling you know who i am you havent quite forgotten me and you recall what has gone do you  i rose from the sofa ill as i was in my horror  you dare to speak to me like that sir i cried you whom ive tracked out to your hidingplace and discovered you whom ive come across the ocean to hunt down you whom i mean to give up this very day to justice let me go from your house at once how dare you ever bring me here how dare you stand unabashed before the daughter of the man you so cruelly murdered  he drew back like one stung  the daughter of the man i murdered he faltered out slowly as in a turmoil of astonishment the man i murdered oh una is it possible youve forgotten so much and yet remember me myself i cant believe it darling sit down my child and think surely surely the rest will come back to you gradually  his calmness unnerved me what could he mean by these words no actor on earth could dissemble like this his whole manner was utterly unlike the manner of a man just detected in a terrible crime he seemed rather to reproach me indeed than to crouch to be shocked and indignant  explain yourself i said coldly in a very chilly voice courtenay ivor i give you three minutes to explain at the end of that time if you cant exonerate yourself i walk out of this house to give you up as i ought to the arm of justice  he looked at me all pity yet inexpressibly reproachful  oh una he cried clasping his handsthose small white hands of hisaunt emmas handsthe murderers handshow had i never before noticed themand i who have suffered so much for you i who have wrecked my whole life for you ungrudgingly willingly i who have sacrificed even elsies happiness and elsies future for you this is too too hard una una spare me  a strange trembling seized me it was in my heart to rush forward and clasp him to my breast murderer or no murderer his look his voice cut me sharply to the heart words trembled on the tip of my tongue oh jack i love you but with a violent effort i repressed them sternly this horrible revulsion seemed to tear me in two i loved him so much though till the moment of the discovery i never quite realised how deeply i loved him  courtenay ivor i said slowly steeling myself once more for a hard effort i knew who you were at once when i saw you poise yourself on the parapet once before in my life i saw you like that and the picture it produced has burned itself into the very fibre and marrow of my being as long as i live i can never get rid of it it was when you leapt from the window at the grange at woodbury after murdering my father  he started once more  una he said solemnly in a very clear voice theres some terrible error somewhere youre utterly mistaken about what took place that night but oh great heavens how am i ever to explain the misconception to you if you still think thus it would be cruel to undeceive you i darent tell you the whole truth it would kill you it would kill you  i drew myself up like a pillar of ice  go on i said in a hard voice for i saw he had something to say dont mind for my heart tell me the truth i can stand it  he hesitated for a minute or two  i cant he cried huskily dear una dont ask me wont you trust me without wont you believe me when i tell you i never did it  no i cant i answered with sullen resolution though my eyes belied my words i cant disbelieve the evidence of my own senses i saw you escape that night i see you still ive seen you for years i know it was you and you only who did it  he flung himself down in a chair and let his arms drop listlessly  oh what can i ever do to disillusion you he cried in despair oh what can i ever do this is too too terrible  i moved towards the door  im going i said with a gulp youve deceived me jack youve lied to me you have given me feigned names you have decoyed me to your house under false pretences and i recognise you now i know you in all your baseness youre my fathers murderer dont hope to escape by playing on my feelings id deserve to be murdered myself if i could act like that im on my way to the policeoffice to give you in custody on the charge of murdering vivian callingham at woodbury  he jumped up again all anxiety  oh no you mustnt walk he cried laying his hand upon my arm give me up if you like but wait till the buggy comes back and elsiell drive you round with me youre not fit to go a step as you are at present oh what shall i ever do though youre so weak and ill elsiell never allow it  elsiell never allow what i asked though i felt it was rather more grotesque than undignified and inconsistent thus to parley and make terms with my fathers murderer though to be sure it was jack and i couldnt bear to refuse him  he kept his hand on my arm with an air of authority  una my child he said thrusting me backand even at that moment of supreme horror a thrill ran all through my body at his touch and his wordsyou mustnt go out of this house as you are this minute i refuse to allow it im your doctor and i forbid it youre under my charge and i wont let you stir if i did id be responsible  he pushed me gently into a chair  i gave you but one false name he said slowlythe name of cheriton to be sure i was never christened john but im jack to my intimates it was my nickname from a baby jacks what ive always been called at homejacks what in the dear old days at torquay you always called me but i saw if i let you know who i was at once thered be no chance of recalling the past and so saving you from yourself to save you i consented to that one mild deception it succeeded in bringing you here and in keeping you here till elsie and i were once more what wed always been to you i meant to tell you all in the end when the right time came now youve forced my hand and i dont know how i can any longer refrain from telling you  telling me what i said icily what do you mean by your words why all these dark hints if youve anything to say why not say it like a man  for i loved him so much that in my heart of hearts i half hoped there might still be some excuse some explanation  he looked at me solemnly then he leant back in his chair and drew his hand across his brow i could see now why i hadnt recognised that delicate hand before white as it was by nature hard work on the farm had long bronzed and distorted it but i saw also for the first time that the palm was scarred with cuts and rentsexactly like minnie moores exactly like aunt emmas  una he began slowly in a very puzzled tone if i could id give myself up and be tried and be found guilty and executed for your sake sooner than cause you any further distress or expose you to the shock of any more disclosures but i cant do that on elsies account even if i decided to put elsie to that shame and disgracewhich would hardly be just which would hardly be manly of meelsie knows all and elsied never consent to it shed never let her brother be hanged for a crime of which as she knows hes entirely innocent and shed tell out all in full courtevery fact every detailwhich would be worse for you ten thousand times in the end than learning it here quietly  tell me all i said growing stony yet trembling from head to foot oh jacki seized his handi dont know what you mean but i somehow trust you i want to know all i can bear anythinganythingbetter than this suspense you must tell me you must explain to me  i will he said slowly looking hard into my eyes and feeling my pulse half unconsciously with his finger as he spoke una darling you must make up your mind now for a terrible shock i wont tell you in words for youd never believe it ill show you who it was that fired the shot at mr callingham  he moved over to the other side of the room and unlocking drawer after drawer took a bundle of photographs from the inmost secret cabinet of a desk in the corner  there una he said selecting one of them and holding it up before my eyes prepare yourself darling thats the person who pulled the trigger that night in the library  i looked at it and fell back with a deadly shriek of horror it was an instantaneous photograph it represented a scene just before the one the inspector gave me and there in its midst i saw myself as a girl with a pistol in my hand the muzzle flashed and smoked i knew the whole truth it was i myself who held the pistol and fired at my father       chapter xix  the real murderer      for some seconds i sat there leaning back in my chair and gazing close at that incredible that accusing document i knew it couldnt lie i knew it must be the very handiwork of unerring nature then slowly a recollection began to grow up in my mind i knew of my own memory it was really true i remembered it so now as in a glass darkly i remembered having stood with the pistol in my hand pointing it straight at the breast of the man with the long white beard whom they called my father a new mental picture rose up before me like a vision i remembered it all as something that once really occurred to me  yet i remembered it as i had long remembered the next scene in the series merely as so much isolated and unrelated fact without connection of any sort to link it to the events that preceded or followed it it was i who shot my father i realised that now with a horrid gulp but what on earth did i ever shoot him for  and i had hunted down jack for the crime i had committed myself i had threatened to give him up for my own dreadful parricide  after a minute i rose and staggered feebly to the door i saw the path of duty clear as daylight before me  where are you going jack faltered out watching me close with anxious eyes lest i should stumble or faint  and i answered aloud in a hollow voice  to the policestation of courseto give myself into custody for the murder of my father  when i thought it was jack though i loved him better than i loved my own life i would have given him up to justice as a sacred duty now i knew it was myself how could i possibly do otherwise how could i love my own life better than i loved dear jacks who had given up everything to save me and protect me  with a wild bound of horror jack sprang upon me at once he seized me bodily in his arms he carried me back into the room with irresistible strength i fought against him in vain he laid me on the sofa he bent over me like a whirlwind and smothered me with hot kisses  my darling he cried my darling then this shock hasnt killed you it hasnt stunned you like the last youre still your own dear self youve still strength to think and plan exactly what one would expect from you oh una my una you must wait and hear all when youve learned how it happened you wont wish to act so rashly  i struggled to free myself though his arms were hard and close like a strong mans around me  let me go jack i cried feebly trying to tear myself from his grasp i love you better than i love my own life if i would have given you up how much more must i give up myself now i know it was i who really did it  he held me down by main force he pinned me to the sofa i suppose its because im a woman and weak and all thatbut i liked even then to feel how strong and how big he was and how feeble i was myself like a child in his arms and i resisted on purpose just to feel him hold me somehow i couldnt realize after all that i was indeed a murderess it didnt seem possible i couldnt believe it was in me  jack i said slowly giving way at last and letting him hold me down with his small strong hands and slender iron wrist tell me if you will how i came to do it ill sit here quite still if only youll tell me am i really a murderess  jack recoiled like one shot  you a murderess my spotless una he exclaimed all aghast if anyone else on earth but you had just asked such a thing in my presence id have leapt at the fellows throat and held him down till i choked him  but i did it i cried wildly i remember now i did it it all comes back to me at last i fired at him just so i aimed the loaded pistol pointblank at his heart i can hear the din in my ears i can see the flash at the muzzle and then i flung down the pistollike thisat my feet and darkness came on and i forgot everything why dr marten knew that much i remember now he told me hed formed a very strong impression from the nature of the wound and the position of the various objects on the floor of the room who it was that did it he must have seen it was i who flung down the pistol  jack gazed at me in suspense  hes a very good friend of yours then he murmured that dr marten for he never said a word of all that at the inquest  but i must give myself up i cried in a fever of penitence for what that other woman who once was me had done oh jack do let me its hateful to know im a murderess and to go unpunished its hateful to draw back from the fate id have imposed on another id like to be hanged for it i want to be hanged its the only possible way to appease ones conscience  and yet though i said it i felt all the time it wasnt really i but that other strange girl who once lived at the grange and looked exactly like me i remember it to be sure but it was in my other state and so far as my moral responsibility was concerned my other state and i were two different people  for i knew in my heart i couldnt commit a murder  jack rose without a word and fetched me in some brandy  drink this he said calmly in his authoritative medical tone drink this before you say another sentence  and obedient to his order i took it up and drank it  then he sat down beside me and took my hand in his and with very gentle words began to reason and argue with me  he was glad id struggled he said because that broke the first force of the terrible shock for me action was always good for one in any great crisis it gave an outlet for the pentup emotions too suddenly let loose with explosive force and kept them from turning inward and doing serious harm as mine had done on that horrible night of the accident he called it always the accident i noticed and never the murder that gave me fresh hope could i really after all have fired unintentionally but no when i came to look inwardto look backward on my past statei was conscious all the time of some strong and fierce resentment smouldering deep in my heart at the exact moment of firing however it might have happened i was angry with the man with the long white beard i fired at him hastily it is true but with malice prepense and deliberate intent to wound and hurt him  jack went on however undeterred in a low and quiet voice soothing my hand with his as he spoke and very kind and gentle my spirit rebelled at the thought that i could ever for one moment have imagined him a murderer i said so in one wild burst jack held my hand and still reasoned with me i like a mans reasoning its so calm and impartial it seems to overcome one by its mere display of strength if id changed my mind once jack said i might change it again when further evidence on the point was again forthcoming i mustnt give myself up to the police till i understood much more if i did i would commit a very grave mistake there were reasons that had led to the firing of the shot very grave reasons too couldnt i restore and reconstruct them now i knew the last stage of the terrible history if possible hed rather i should arrive at them by myself than that he should tell me  i cast my mind back all in vain  no jack i said trustfully i cant remember anything one bit like that i can remember forward sometimes but never backwards i can remember now how i flung down the pistol and how the servants burst in but not a word not an item of what went before thats all a pure blank to me  and then i went on to tell him in very brief outline how the first thing i could recollect in all my life was the australian scene with the big bluegumtrees and how that had been recalled to me by the picture at janes and how one scene in that way had gradually suggested another and how i could often think ahead from a given fact but never go back behind it and discover what led up to it  jack drew his hand over his chin and reflected silently  thats odd he said after a pause yet very comprehensible i might almost have thought of that before might have arrived at it on general principles psychologically and physiologically its exactly what one would have expected from the nature of memory and yet it never occurred to me set up the train of thought in the order in which it originally presented itself and the links may readily restore themselves in successive series try to trace it backward in the inverse order and the process is very much more difficult and involvedwell well try things just so with you una well begin by reconstructing your first life as far as we can from the very outset with the aid of these stray hints of yours and then well see whether we can get you to remember all your past up to the day of the accident more easily  i gazed up at him with gratitude  oh jack i said trembling in spite of this shock i believe i can do it now i believe i can remember the scales are falling from my eyes im becoming myself again what youve said and what youve shown me seems to have broken down a veil i feel as if i could reconstruct all now when once the keys suggested to me  he smiled at me encouragingly oh how could i ever have doubted him  thats right darling he answered i should have expected as much indeed for now for the very first time since the accident youve got really at the other side of the great blank in your memory  i felt so happy though i knew i was a murderess i didnt mind now whether i was hanged or not to love jack and be loved by him was quite enough for me when he called me darling i was in the seventh heavens it sounded so familiar i knew he must have called me so often and often before in the dim dead past that was just beginning to recur to me       chapter xx  the stranger from the sea      i held his hand tight it was so pleasant to know i could love him now with a clear conscience even if i had to give myself up to the police tomorrow and indeed being a woman i didnt really much care whether they took me or not if only i could love jack and know jack loved me  you must tell me everythingthis minutejack i said clinging to him like a child i cant bear this suspense begin telling me at once youll do me more harm than good if you keep me waiting any longer  jack took instinctively a medical view of the situation  so i think my child he said looking lovingly at me your nerves are on the rack and will be the better for unstringing oh una its such a comfort that you know at last who i am its such a comfort that im able to talk to you today just as we two used to talk four years ago in devonshire  did i love you then jack i whispered nestling still closer to him in spite of my horror or rather my very horror made me feel more acutely than ever the need for protection i was no longer alone in the world i had a man to support me  you told me so darling he answered smoothing my hair with his hand have you forgotten all about it doesnt even that come back cant you remember it now when ive told you who i am and how it all happened  i shook my head  all cloudy still i replied vaguely some dim sense of familiarity perhapsas when people say they have a feeling of having lived all this over somewhere else beforebut nothing more certain nothing more definite  then i must begin at the beginning jack answered bracing himself for his hard task and reconstruct your whole life for you as far as i know it from your very childhood im particularly anxious you should not merely be told what took place but should remember the past there are gaps in my own knowledge i want you to eke out there are places i want you to help me myself over and besides itll be more satisfactory to yourself to remember than to be told it  i leaned back almost exhausted incredible as it may seem to you in spite of that awful photograph i couldnt really believe even so i had killed my father and yet i knew very well now that jack at least hadnt done it that was almost enough but not quite my head swam round in terror i waited and longed for jack to explain the whole thing to me  you remember he said watching me close that when you lived as a very little girl in australia you had a papa who seems different to you still from the papa in your later childish memories  i remember it very well i replied it came back to me on the sarmatian i think of him always now as the papa in the loose white linen coat the more i dwell on him the more does he come out to me as a different man from the other onethe fatheri shot at the grange at woodbury the father that lives with me in that ineffaceable picture  he was a different man jack answered with a sudden burst as if he knew all my story una i may as well relieve your mind all at once on that formidable point you shot that manhe pointed to the whitebearded person in the photographbut it was not parricide it was not even murder it was under grave provocationin more than selfdefenceand he was not your father  not my father i cried clasping my hands and leaning forward in my profound suspense but i killed him all the same oh jack how terrible  you must quiet yourself my child he said still soothing me automatically i want your aid in this matter you must listen to me calmly and bring your mind to bear on all i say to you  then he began with a regular history of my early life which came back to me as fast as he spoke scene by scene and year by year in long and familiar succession i remembered everything sometimes only when he suggested it but sometimes also before he said the words my memory outran his tongue and i put in a recollection or two with my own tongue as they recurred to me under the stimulus of this new birth of my dead nature i recalled my early days in the far bush in australia my journey home to england on the big steamer with mamma the way we travelled about for years from place to place on the continent i remembered how i had been strictly enjoined too never to speak of baby and how my father used to watch my mother just as closely as he watched me always afraid as it appeared to me she should make some verbal slip or let out some great secret in an unguarded moment he seemed relieved i recollected now when my poor mother died he grew less strict with me then but as far as i could judge though he was careful of my health he never really loved me  then jack reminded me further of other scenes that came much later in my forgotten life he reminded me of my trip to torquay where i first met him and all at once the whole history of my old visits to the moores came back like a flood to me the memory seemed to inundate and overwhelm my brain they were the happiest time of all life those delightful visits when i met jack and fell in love with him and half confided my love to my cousin minnie strange to say though at torquay itself id forgotten it all in that little canadian house with jack by my side to recall it it rushed back like a wave upon me id fallen in love with jack without my fathers knowledge or consent and i knew very well my father would never allow me to marry him he had ideas of his own my father about the sort of person i ought to marry and i half suspected in my heart of hearts he meant if possible always to keep me at home single to take care of him and look after him i didnt know as yet he had sufficient reasons of his own for desiring me to remain for ever unmarried  i remembered too that i never really loved my father his nature was hard cold reserved unsympathetic i only feared and obeyed him at times my own strong character came out i remembered and i defied him to his face defied him openly then there were scenes in the house dreadful scenes too hateful to dwell upon and the servants came up to my room at the end and comforted me  so step by step jack reminded me of everything in my own past life up to the very night of the murder from which my second state dated id come back from torquay a week or two before very full indeed of jack and determined at all costs sooner or later to marry him but though i had kept all quiet papa had suspected my liking on the day of the berry pomeroy athletics and had forbidden me to see jack or to write to him or to have anything further to say to him he was determined he told me whoever i married i shouldnt at least marry a beggarly doctor all that i remembered and also how in spite of the prohibition i wrote letters to jack but could receive none in returnlest my father should see them  and still the central mystery of the murder was no nearer solution i held my breath in terror had i really any sort of justification in killing him  dimly and instinctively as jack went on a faint sense of resentment and righteous indignation against the man with the white beard rose up vaguely in my mind by slow degrees i knew i had been angry with him i knew i had defied him but how or why as yet i knew not  then jack suddenly paused and began in a different voice a new part of his tale it was nothing i remembered or could possibly remember he said but it was necessary to the comprehension of what came after and would help me to recall it about a week after i left torquay it seemed jack was in his consultingroom at babbicombe one day having just returned from a very long bicycle ridefor he was a firstrate cyclistwhen the servant announced a new patient and a very wornout old man came in to visit him  the man had a ragged grey beard and scanty white hair he was clad in poor clothes and had tramped on foot all the way from london to babbicombe where jack used to practice but jack saw at once under this rough exterior he had the voice and address of a cultivated gentleman though he was so broken down by want and long suffering and exposure and illness that he looked like a beggar just let loose from the workhouse  i held my breath as jack showed me the poor old mans photograph it was a portrait taken after deathfor jack attended him to the end through a fatal illnessand it showed a face thin and worn and much lined by unspeakable hardships but i burst out crying at once the very moment i looked at it for a second or two i couldnt say why i suppose it was instinct blood is thicker than water they tell us and i have the intuition of kindred very strong in me i believe but at any rate i cried silently with big hot tears while i looked at that dead face of silent suffering as i never had cried over the photograph of the respectablelooking man who lay dead on the floor of the library and whom i was always taught to consider my father then it came back to me why i gazed at it and grew faint i clutched jacks arm for support i knew what it meant now the poor worn old man who lay dead on the bed with that look of mute agony on his featureswas my first papa the papa in the loose white linen coat the one i remembered with childlike love and trustfulness in my earliest babyish australian recollections  i couldnt mistake the face it was burnt into my brain now this was he though much older and sadder and more scarred and lined by age and weather it was my very first papa my own papa i cried silently still i couldnt bear to look at it then the real truth broke upon me once more this and this alone was in very deed my one real father  i seized the faded photograph and pressed it to my lips  oh i know him i cried wildly its my father my father  some minutes passed before jack could go on with his story this rush of emotions was too much for me for a while i could hardly hear him or attend to him so deeply did it stir me  at last i calmed down still holding that pathetic photograph on the table before me  tell me all about him i murmured sobbing for jack i remember now he was so good and kind and i loved himi loved him  jack went on with his story trying to soothe me and reassure me the old man introduced himself by very cautious degrees as a person in want not so much of money though of that to be sure he had none as of kindness and sympathy in a very great sorrow he was a shipwrecked mariner in a sense shipwrecked on the sea of life and on the open pacific as well but once he had been a clergyman and a man of education position reputation fortune  gradually as he went on jack began to grasp at the truth of this curious tale the worn and battered stranger had but lately landed in london from a sailing vessel which had brought him over from a remote pacific islet not a tropical islet of the kind with whose palms and parrots we are all so familiar but a cold and snowy rock away off far south among the frosts and icebergs near the antarctic continent there for twenty long years that unhappy man had lived by himself a solitary life  i started at the sound  for twenty years i exclaimed oh jack you must be wrong for how could that be i was only eighteen when all this happened how could my real father have been twenty years away from me when i was only eighteen and i remember him so perfectly  jack looked at me and shook his head  youve much to learn yet una he answered the storys a long one you were not eighteen but twentytwo at the time youve been deliberately misled as to your own age all along you developed late and were always short for your real years not tall and precocious as we all of us imagined but you were four years older than mr callingham pretended youre twentysix now not twentytwo as you think wait and in time youll hear all about it  he went on with his story i listened spellbound the unhappy man explained to jack how he had been wrecked on the voyage and escaped on a raft with one other passenger how they had drifted far south before waves and current till they were cast at last on this wretched island how they remained there for a month or two picking up a precarious living on roots and berries and eggs of seabirds and how at last one day he had come back from hunting limpets and seaurchins on the shore of a lonely bayto find to his amazement his companion gone and himself left alone on that desolate island his fellowcastaway he knew then had deceived and deserted him  there was no room indeed to doubt the treachery of the wretched being who had so basely treated him as he looked a ship under full sail stood away to northward in vain the unhappy man made wild signals from the shore with his tattered garments no notice was taken of them his companion must deliberately have suppressed the others existence and pretended to be alone by himself on the island  and his name jack asked of the poor old man horrified  the stranger answered without a moments pause  his name if you want itwas vivian callingham  and yours jack continued as soon as he could recover from his first shock of horror  and mine the poor castaway replied is richard wharton  as jack told me those words another strange thrill ran through me  richard wharton was the name of mammas first husband then im not a callingham at all i cried unable to take it all in at first in its full complexity im really a wharton  jack nodded his head in assent  yes youre really a wharton he said youre the baby that died as we all were told your true christian names mary but una you were always una to all of us in england and though the real una callingham died when you were a little girl of three or four years old youll be una always now to elsie and me we cant think of you as other than weve always called you  then he went on to explain to me how the stranger had landed in london alone and friendless twenty years later from a passing australian merchant vessel which had picked him up on the island all those years he had waited and fed himself on eggs of penguins he landed by himself the crew having given him a suit of old clothes and subscribed to find him in immediate necessaries he began to inquire cautiously in london about his wife and family at first he could learn little or nothing for nobody remembered him and he feared to ask too openly a sort of enoch arden terror restraining him from proclaiming his personality till he knew exactly what had happened in his long absence but bit by bit he found out at last that his wife had married again and was now long dead and that the man she had married was vivian callingham his own treacherous companion on the crozet islands as soon as he learned that the full depth of the mans guilt burst upon him like a thunderbolt richard wharton understood now why vivian callingham had left him alone on those desert rocks and sailed away in the ship without telling the captain of his fellowcastaways plight he saw the whole vile plot the man had concocted at once and the steps he had taken to carry it into execution  vivian callingham whom i falsely thought my father had gone back to australia with pretended news of richard whartons death he had sought my widowed mother in her own home up country and told her a lying tale of his devotion to her husband in his dying moments on that remote ocean speck in the far southern pacific by this story he ingratiated himself he knew she was rich he knew she was worth marrying and to marry her he had left my own real father richard wharton to starve and languish for twenty years among rocks and seafowl on a lonely island  my blood ran cold at such a tale of deadly treachery i remembered now to have heard some small part of it before but much of it as jack told it to me was quite new and unexpected no wonder i had turned in horror that night from the man i long believed to be my own father when i learned by what vile and cruelly treacherous means he had succeeded in imposing his supposed relationship upon me but still all this brought me no nearer the real question of questionswhy did i shoot him       chapter xxi  the plot unravels itself      as jack went on unfolding that strange tale of fraud and heartless wrong my interest every moment grew more and more absorbing but i cant recall it now exactly as jack told me it i can only give you the substance of that terrible story  when richard wharton first learned of his wifes second marriage during his own lifetime to that wicked wretch who had ousted and supplanted him he believed also on the strength of vivian callinghams pretences that his own daughter had died in her babyhood in australia he fancied therefore that no person of his kin remained alive at all and that he might proceed to denounce and punish vivian callingham with that object in view he tramped down all the way from london to torquay to make himself known to his wifes relations the moores and to their cousin courtenay ivor of babbicombemy jack as i called him for various reasons of his own he called first on jack and proceeded to detail to him this terrible family story  at first hearing jack could hardly believe such a tale was trueof his unas father as he still thought vivian callingham but a strange chance happened to reveal a still further complication it came out in this way i had given jack a recent photograph of myself in fancy dress which hung up over his mantelpiece as the weatherworn visitors eye fell on the picture he started and grew pale  why thats her he cried with a sudden gasp thats my daughtermary wharton  well naturally enough jack thought to begin with this was a mere mistake on his strange visitors part  thats her halfsister he said una callinghamyour wifes child by her second marriage she may be like her no doubt as halfsisters often are but mary wharton i know died some eighteen years ago or so when una was quite a baby i believe ive heard all about it because dont you see im engaged to una  the poor wreck of a clergyman however shook his head with profound conviction he knew better than that  oh no he said decisively thats my child mary wharton even after all these years i couldnt possibly be mistaken blood is thicker than water id know her among ten thousand shed be just that age now too i see the creatures vile plot his daughter died young and hes palmed off my mary as his own child to keep her money in his hands but never mind the money thank heaven shes alive thats her thats my mary  the plot seemed too diabolical and too improbable for anybody to believe jack could hardly think it possible when his new friend told him but the stranger persisted soits hard for me even to think of him as quite really my fatherthat jack at last brought out two or three earlier photographs id given him some time before and his visitor recognised them at once in all their stages as his own daughter this roused jacks curiosity he determined to hunt the matter up with his unknown connection and he hunted it up thenceforward with deliberate care till he proved every word of it  meanwhile the poor brokendown man worn out with his long tramp and his terrible emotions fell ill almost at once in jacks own house and became rapidly so feeble that jack dared not question him further the return to civilisation was more fatal than his long solitary banishment at the end of a week he died leaving on jacks mind a profound conviction that all he had said was true and that i was really richard whartons daughter not vivian callinghams  for a week or two i made inquiries una jack said to me as we sat thereinquiries which i wont detail to you in full just now but which gradually showed me the truth of the poor souls belief what you yourself told me just now chimes in exactly with what i discovered elsewhere by inquiry and by letters from australia the baby that died was the real una callingham shortly after its death your stepfather and your mother left the colony all your real fathers money had been bequeathed to his child and your mothers also was settled on you mr callingham saw that if your mother died and you lived and married he himself would be deprived of the fortune for which he had so wickedly plotted so he made up another plot even more extraordinary and more diabolical still than the first he decided to pretend it was mary wharton that died and to palm you off on the world as his own child una callingham for if mary wharton died the property at once became absolutely your mothers and she could will it away to her husband or anyone else she chose to  but baby was so much younger than i i cried going back on my recollections once more how could he ever manage to make the dates come right again  quite true jack answered the baby was younger than you but your stepfatherive no other name by which i can call himmade a clever plan to set that straight he concealed from the people in australia which child had been ill and he entered her death as mary wharton then to cover the falsification he left melbourne at once and travelled about for some years on the continent in outoftheway places till all had been forgotten you went forth upon the world as una callingham with your true personality as mary wharton all obscured even in your own memory fortunately for your false fathers plot you were small for your age and developed slowly he gave out on the contrary that you were big for your years and had outgrown yourself australianwise both in wisdom and stature  but my mother i exclaimed appalled how could she ever consent to such a wicked deception  mr callingham had your mother completely under his thumb jack answered with promptitude she couldnt call her soul her own your poor motherso ive heard he cajoled her and terrified her till she didnt dare to oppose him poor shrinking creature she was afraid of her life to do anything except as he bade her he must have persuaded her first to acquiesce passively in this hateful plot and then must have terrified her afterwards into full compliance by threats of exposure  he was a very unhappy man himself i put in casting back his money did him no good i can remember now how gloomy and moody he was often at the grange  quite true jack replied he lived in perpetual fear of your real fathers return or of some other breakdown to his complicated system of successive deceptions he never had a happy minute in his whole life i believe blind terrors surrounded him he was afraid of everything and afraid of everybody only his scientific work seemed ever to give him any relief there he became a free man he threw himself into that heart and soul on purpose i fancy because it absorbed him while he was at it and prevented him for the time being from thinking of his position  and how did you find it all out i asked eagerly anxious to get on to the end  well thats long to tell jack replied too long for one sitting i wont trouble you with it now discrepancies in facts and dates and inquiries among servants both in england and in victoria first put me upon the track but i said nothing at the time of my suspicions to anyone i waited till i could appeal to the mans own conscience with success as i hoped and then besides i hardly knew how to act for the best i wanted to marry you and therefore as far as was consistent with justice and honour i wished to spare your supposed father a complete exposure  but why didnt you tell the police i asked  because i had really nothing definite in any way to go upon realise the position to yourself and youll see how difficult it was for me mr callingham suspected i was paying you attentions clearly under those circumstances it was to my obvious interest that you should get possession of all his property any claims i might make for you would therefore be naturally regarded with suspicion the shipwrecked man had told nobody but myself i hadnt even an affidavit a deathbed statement all rested upon his word and upon mine as retailing it he was dead and there was nothing but my narrative for what he told me the story itself was too improbable to be believed by the police on such dubious evidence i didnt even care to try i wanted to make your stepfather confess and i waited for that till i could compel confession       chapter xxii  my memory returns      at last my chance came jack went on id found out almost everything not of course exactly by way of legal proof but to my own entire satisfaction and i determined to lay the matter definitely at once before mr callingham so i took a holiday for a fortnight to go bicycling in the midlands i told my patients and i fixed my headquarters at wrode which as you probably remember is twenty miles off from woodbury  it was important for my scheme i should catch mr callingham alone i had no idea of entrapping him i wanted to work upon his conscience and induce him to confess my object was rather to move him to remorse and restitution than to terrify or surprise him  so on the day of the accidentcall it murder if you willi rode over on my machine unannounced to the grange to see him you knew where i was staying you recollect  at the words a burst of memory came suddenly over me  oh yes i cried i remember it was at the wilsons at wrode i wrote over there to tell you we were going to dine alone at six that evening as papa had got his electric apparatus home from his instrumentmaker and was anxious to try his experiments early youd written to me privatelya boy brought the notethat you wanted to have an hours talk alone with papa i thought it was about me and i was oh ever so nervous  for it all came back to me now as clear as yesterday  jack looked at me hard  im glad you remember that dear he said now una do try to remember all you can as i go along with my story well i rode over alone never telling anybody at wrode where i was going nor giving your stepfather any reason of any sort to expect me i trusted entirely to finding him busy with his new invention when i reached the grange i came up the drive unperceived and looking in at the library window saw your father alone there he was pottering over his chemicals that gave me the clue i left my bicycle under the window tilted up against the wall and walked in without ringing going straight to the library nobody saw me come nobody saw me return except one old lady on the road who seemed to have forgotten all about it by the time of the inquest  i nodded and gave a start i knew that must have been aunt emma  except yourself una no human soul on earth ever seemed to suspect me and that wasnt odd for you and your father and perhaps minnie moore were the only people in the world who ever knew i was in love with you or cared for you in any way  go on i said breathless and you went into the library  i went into the library jack continued where i found your father just returned from enjoying his cigar on the lawn he was alone in the room  no no i cried eagerly putting in my share now for i had a part in the history he wasnt alone jack though you thought him so at the time i remember all at last it comes back to me like a flash oh heavens how it comes back to me jack jack i remember today every word every syllable of it  he gazed at me in surprise  then tell me yourself una he exclaimed how did you come to be there for i knew you were there at last but till you fired the pistol i hadnt the faintest idea you had heard or seen anything tell me all about it quick there comes in my mystery  in one wild rush of thought the whole picture rose up like a vision before me  why jack i cried there was a screen a little screen in the alcove you remember the alcove at the west end of the room it was so small a screen youd hardly have thought it could hide me but it didit didand all too by accident id gone in there after dinner not much thinking where i went and was seated on the floor by the little alcove window reading a book by the twilight it was a book papa told me i wasnt to read and i took it trembling from the shelves and was afraid hed scold mefor you know how stern he was and i never was allowed to go alone into the library but i got interested in my book and went on reading so when he came in i went on sitting there very still with the book hidden under my skirt for fear he should scold me i thought perhaps before long papad go out for a second to get some plates for his photography or something and then i could slip away and never be noticed the big window towards the garden was open you remember and i meant to jump out of itas you did afterwards it wasnt very high and though the book was only the vicar of wakefield hed forbidden me to read it and i was dreadfully afraid of him  then you were there all the time jack cried interrogatively and you heard our conversationour whole conversation  i was there all the time jack i cried in a fever of exaltation and i heard every word of it it comes back to me now with a vividness like yesterday i see the room before my eyes i remember every syllable i could repeat every sentence of it  jack drew a deep sigh of intense relief  thank god for that he exclaimed with profound gratitude then im saved and youre saved we can both understand one another in that case we know how it all happened  perfectly i answered i know all now as i sat there and cowered i heard a knock at the door and before papa could answer you entered hastily papa looked round i could hear and saw who it was in a second  oh its you he said coldly its you dr ivor and pray sir what do you want here this evening  go on jack cried intensely relieved i could feel let me see how much more you can remember una  so you shut the door softly and said  yes its i mr callingham i continued all aglow and looking into his eyes for confirmation and ive come to tell you a fact that may surprise you prepare for strange news richard wharton has returned to england  i knew richard wharton was mammas first husband who was dead before i was born as id always been told and i sat there aghast at the news it was so sudden so crushing id heard hed been wrecked and i thought hed come to life again but as yet i didnt suspect what was all the real meaning of it  but papa drew back i could hear in a perfect frenzy of rage astonishment and terror  richard wharton he hissed out between his teeth springing away like one stung richard wharton come back you liar you sneak hes dead this twenty years youre trying to frighten me  i never meant to overhear your conversation but at that it was so strange i drew back and cowered even closer i was afraid of papas voice i was afraid of his rage he spoke just like a man who was ready to murder you  then you began to talk with papa about strange things that astonished mestrange things that i only half understood just then but that by the light of what youve told me today i quite understand nowthe history of my real father  im no liar you answered richard wharton has come back and by the aid of what hes disclosed i know the whole truth the girl you call your daughter and whose money youve stolen is not yours at all shes richard whartons daughter mary  papa staggered back a pace or two and came quite close to the screen i cowered behind it in alarm i could see he was terrified for a minute or two you talked with him and urged him to confess bit by bit as you went on he recovered his nerve and began to bluster he didnt deny what you said he saw it was no use he just sneered and prevaricated  as i listened to his words i saw he admitted it all a great horror came over me then my life was one long lie he was never my father he had concocted a vile plot he had held me in this slavery so many years to suit his own purposes he had crushed my mother to death and robbed me of my birthright even before that night i never loved him i thought it very wicked of me but i never could love him as he spoke to you and grew cynical i began to loathe and despise him i cant tell you how great a comfort it was to me to knowto hear from his own lips i was not that mans daughter  at last after many recriminations he looked across at you and said half laughing for he was quite himself again by that time  this is all very fine courtenay ivorall very fine in its way but how are you going to prove it thats the real question do you think any jury in england will believe on your unsupported oath such a cockandbull story do you think even if richard whartons come back and youve got him on your side i cant crossexamine all the life out of his body  at that you said gravelywanting to touch his conscience i suppose  richard whartons come back but you cant crossexamine him for richard wharton died some six or eight weeks since at my cottage at babbicombe after revealing to me all this vile plot against himself and his daughter  then papa drew back with a loud laugha hateful laugh like a demons i cant help calling him papa still though it pains me even to think of him that loud laugh rings still in my ears to this day it was horrible diabolical like a wild beasts in triumph  you fool he said with a sneer and you come here to tell me that you infernal idiot you come here to put yourself in my power like this courtenay ivor i always knew you were an ass but i didnt ever know you were quite such a born idiot of a fellow as that hold back there you image with a rapid dart before you could see what he was doing he passed a wire round your body and thrust two knobs into your hands youre in my power now he exclaimed you cant move or stir  i saw at once what hed done hed pinned you to the spot with the handles of his powerful electric apparatus it was so strong that it would hold one riveted to the spot in pain you couldnt let go you could hardly even speak or cry aloud for help he had pinned you down irresistibly i thought he meant to murder you  yet i was too terrified even so to scream aloud for the servants i only crouched there rooted and wondered what next would happen  he went across to the door and turned the key in it then he opened the cabinet and took out some things there it was growing quite dusk and i could hardly see them he returned with them where you stood struggling in vain to set yourself free his voice was as hard as adamant now he spoke slowly and distinctly in a voice like a fiends oh jack no wonder that scene took away my reason  and you can remember what he said next una jack asked following me eagerly  yes i can remember what he said next i went on he stood over you threateningly i could see then the thing he held in his right hand was a loaded revolver in his left was a bottle a small medical phial  if you stir ill shoot you he said ill shoot you like a dog you fool youve sealed your own fate what an idiot to let me know richard whartons dead now hear your fate nobody saw you come into this house tonight nobody shall see you leave look here sir at this bottle its chloroform do you understand chloroformchloroformchloroform i shall hold it to your noseso i shall stifle you quietlyno blood no fuss no nasty mess of any sort and when im donedo you see these flasksi can reduce your damned carcase to a pound of ashes with chemicals in halfanhour youve found out too much but youve mistaken your man courtenay ivor say your prayers and commend your soul to the devil youve driven me to bay and i give you no quarter       chapter xxiii  the fatal shot      thank god una jack cried you remember it now even better than i do  remember it i answered holding my brow with my hands to keep the flood of thought from bursting it to fragments remember it why it comes back to me like waves of fire and burns me i remember every word every act every gesture i lifted my head slowly jack and looked over the screen at him in the twilight i saw him therethe man i called my fatherholding the bottle to your face that wicked bottle of chloroform with his revolver in one hand and a calm smile like a fiends playing hatefully and cruelly round that gravelooking mouth of his i never saw any man look so ghastly in my life i was rooted to the spot with awe and terror i dared hardly cry out or move yet i knew this was murder he would kill you he would kill you he was trying to poison you before my very eyes oh heaven how i hated him he was no father of mine he had never been my father and he was murdering the man i loved best in the world for i loved you better than life jack oh the strain of it was terrible i see it all now i live it all over again with one wild bound i leapt forward and hardly knowing what i did i pressed the button turned off the current from the battery and rushed wildly upon him i suppose the knob i pressed not only released you but set the photographic machine at work automatically but i didnt know it then at any rate i remember now in the seconds that followed flash came fast after flash there was a sudden illumination the room was lighter than day it grew alternately bright as noon and then dark as pitch again by contrast and by the light of the flashes i saw you halfdazed with the chloroform standing helpless there  i rushed up and caught the mans arm he was never my father he dropped the bottle and struggled hard for possession of the pistol first he pointed it at you then at me then at you again he meant to shoot you i was afraid it would go off with a terrible effort i twisted his wrist awry in the mad force of passion and wrenched the revolver away from him he jumped at my throat still silent but fierce like a tiger at bay i eluded him and sprang back then i remember no more except that i stood with the pistol pointed at him next came a flash a loud roar and then in a moment the picture he lay dead on the floor in his blood and my second state began and from that day for months i was like a little child again  jack looked at me as i paused  and then he went on in a very low voice half prompting me  and then all i can remember i said is how you got out of the window but i didnt know when i saw you it was you or anyone else that was my second state then the shot seemed to end all what comes next is quite different it belongs to the new world there my life stopped dead short and began all over again  there was a moments silence jack was the first to break it  and now will you give yourself up to the police una he asked me quietly  the question brought me back to the present again with a bound  oh what ought i to do i cried wringing my hands i dont quite know all yet jack why did you run away that last moment and leave me  jack took my hand very seriously  una my child he said fixing his eyes on mine i hardly know whether i can ever make you understand all that i must ask you at first at least just simply to believe me i must ask you to trust me and to accept my account when you rushed upon me as i stood there all entangled in that hateful apparatus and unable to move i didnt know where you had been i didnt know how youd come there but i felt sure you must have heard at least your false fathers last wordsthat hed stifle me with the chloroform and burn my body up afterwards to ashes with his chemicals you seized the pistol before i could quite recover from the effects of the fumes he lay dead at my feet before i realised what was happening  then in a moment as i looked at you i took it all in like a flash of lightning i saw how impossible it would be ever to convince anybody else of the truth of our story i saw if we both told the truth no one would ever believe us there was no time then to reflect no time to hesitate i had to make up my mind at once to a plan of action and to carry it out without a seconds delay in one burst of inspiration i saw that to stop would be to seal both our fates i didnt mind so much for myself that was nothing nothing but for your sake i felt i must dare and risk everything then i turned round and looked at you i saw at one glance the horror of the moment had rendered you speechless and almost senseless the right plan came to me at once as if by magic una i cried stand back wait till the servants come for i knew the report of the revolver would soon bring them up to the library then i waited myself as they reached the door and forced it open i jumped up to the window just outside my bicycle stood propped against the wall i let them purposely catch just a glimpse of my backan unfamiliar figure they saw the pistol on the floormr callingham deadyou startled and horrifieda man unknown escaping in hot haste from the window i risked my own life so as to save your name and honour i let them see me escape so as to exonerate you from suspicion if they hanged me what matter then i leapt down in a hurry jumped lightly on my machine and rode off like the wind down the avenue to the highroad for a second or two they waited to look at you and your father that second or two saved us by the time theyd come out to look i was away down the grounds past the turn of the avenue and well on for the highroad theyd seen a glimpse of the murderer escaping by the window they would never suspect you you were saved and i was happy  and for the same reason even now i said you wouldnt tell the police  let sleeping dogs lie jack answered in the same words as dr marten why rake up this whole matter its finished for ever now and nobody but yourself is ever likely to reopen it if we both told our tale we might run a great risk of being seriously misinterpreted you know its true so do i but who else would believe us no mans bound to criminate himself you shot him to save my life at the very moment when you first learned all his cruelty and his vileness the rest of the world could never be made to understand all that theyd say to the end as it looks on the surface she shot her father to save her lover  youre right i said slowly i shall let this thing rest but the photographs jackthe apparatusthe affair of the inquest  that was all very simple jack answered for a day or two of course i was in a frantic state of mind for fear you should be suspected or the revolver should betray you but though i saw the electric sparks of course i knew nothing about the photographs i wasnt even aware that the apparatus took negatives automatically and i was so full of the terrible reports in the newspapers about your sudden loss of health that i could think of nothing elseleast of all my own safety as good luck would have it however the clergyman at wrode who knew the wilsons happened to speak to me of the murderall england called it the murder and talked of nothing else for at least a fortnightand in the course of conversation he mentioned this apparatus of mr callinghams construction what a pity he said there didnt happen to be one of them in the library at the time if it was focussed towards the persons and had been set on by the victim it would have photographed the whole scene the murder the murderer  that hint revealed much to me as he spoke i remembered suddenly about those mysterious flashes when you burst all at once on my sight from behind the screen till that moment i thought of them only as some result of your too suddenly turning off the electric current but then it came home to me in a second that mr callingham must have set out his apparatus all ready for experimentingthat the electric apparatus was there to put it in working order the button you turned must not only have stopped the current that nailed me writhing to the spot it must also have set working the automatic photographic camera  that thought as you may imagine filled me with speechless alarm for i remembered then that one of the flashes broke upon us at the exact moment when you fired the pistol such a possibility was horrible to contemplate the photographs by themselves could give no clue to our conversation or to the events that compelled you almost against your own will to fire that fatal shot if they were found by the police all would be up with both of us they might hang me if they liked except for elsies sake i didnt mind much about that but for your safety come what might i felt i must manage to get hold of them or to destroy them  were the negatives already in the hands of the police that was now the great question i read the reports diligently with all their descriptions of the room and noticed that while the table the alcove the screen the box the electrical apparatus were all carefully mentioned not a word was said anywhere about the possession of the negatives reasoning further upon the description of the supposed murderer as given by the servants and placarded broadcast in every town in england i came to the conclusion that the police couldnt yet have discovered the existence of these negatives for some of them must surely have photographed my face however little in focus while the printed descriptions mentioned only the mans back as the servants saw him escaping from the window the papers said the room was being kept closed till the inquest for inspection in due time by the coroners jury i made up my mind at once when the room was opened for the jurors to view it i must get in there and carry them off if they caught me in the attempt  it was no use trying before the jury had seen the room but as soon as that was all over i judged the strictness of the watch upon the premises would be relaxed and the windows would probably be opened a little to air the place so on the morning of the inquest i told the wilsons casually id met you at torquay and had therefore a sort of interest in learning the result of the coroners deliberation then i took my bicycle and rode across to woodbury leaning up my machine against the garden wall i walked carelessly in at the gate and up the walk to the library window as if the place belonged to me oh how my heart beat as i looked in and wondered the folding halves were open and the box stood on the table still connected with the wires that conducted the electrical current i stood and hesitated in alarm were the negatives still there or had the police discovered them if they were gone all was up with you the game was lost no jury on earth i felt sure would believe my story  i vaulted up to the sill thank heaven i was athletic not a soul was about but i heard a noise of muffled voices in the other rooms behind treading catlike across the floor i turned the key in the lock a chalk mark still showed the position of the pistol on the ground exactly as you flung it the box was on the table and i saw at a glance the wires which connected it with the battery had never been disconnected i was afraid of receiving a shock if i touched them with my hands and i had no time to waste in discovering electrical attachments so i pulled out my knife and you can fancy with what trembling hands i cut that wire on either side and released the box from its dangerous connections i knew only too well the force of that current then i took the thing under my arm leaped from the window once more and ran across the shrubbery towards the spot where id left my bicycle  on the way the thought struck me that if i carried along the camera all would be up with me should i happen to be challenged it was the only one of the sort in existence at the time and the wires at the side would at once suffice to identify it and to arouse the suspicion even of an english policeman i paused for a moment behind a thick clump of lilacs and tried to pull out the incriminating negatives oh una i did it for your sake but there terrified and trembling in hiding behind the bushes and in danger of my life with that still more unspeakable danger for yours haunting me always like a nightmare can you wonder that for the moment i almost felt myself a murderer the very breezes in the trees made my heart give a jump and then stand still within me i got out the first two or three plates with some trifling difficulty for i didnt understand the automatic apparatus then as i understand it now but the fourth stuck hard for a minute the fifth broke in two and the sixthwell the sixth plate baffled me entirely by getting jammed in the clockwork and refusing to move either backward or forward  at that moment i either heard or fancied i heard a loud noise of pursuit a hue and cry behind me zeal for your safety had made me preternaturally nervous i looked about me hurriedly thrust the negatives id recovered into my breastpocket as fast as ever i could flung the apparatus away from me with the sixth plate jammed hard in the groove and made off at the top of my speed for the wall behind me for there at that critical point it occurred to me suddenly that the sixth and last flash of the machine had come and gone just as i stood poising myself on the ledge of the windowsill and i thought to myselfrightly as it turned outthis additional evidence would only strengthen the belief in the public mind that mr callingham had been murdered by the man whom the servants saw escaping from the window  the rest my child you know pretty well already in a panic on your account i scrambled over the wall tearing my hands as i went with that nastybottle glass reached my bicycle outside and made off not for the country but for the inn where they were holding the coroners inquest my left hand i had to hold tied up in my handkerchief to stop the bleeding in the pocket of my jacket but i thought this the best way all the same to escape detection and indeed instead of being as i feared the only man there in bicycling dress and knickerbockers i found the occasion had positively attracted all the cyclists of the neighbourhood each man went there to show his own innocence of fear or suspicion a good dozen or two of bicyclists stood gathered already in the body of the room in the same incriminating costume so i found safety in numbers even the servants who had seen me disappear through the window though their eyes lighted upon me more than once never for a moment seemed to suspect me and i know very well why when i stand up im the straightest and most perpendicular man that ever walked erect but when i poise to jump i bend my spine so much that i produce the impression of being almost humpbacked it was that attitude you recognised in me when i jumped from the window just now  why jack i cried clinging to him in a perfect whirlwind of wonder one can hardly believe itthat was only an hour ago  that was only an hour ago jack answered smiling but as for you i suppose youve lived half a lifetime again in it and now you know the whole secret of the woodbury mystery and you wont want to give yourself up to the police any longer       chapter xxiv  alls well that ends well      but why didnt you explain it all to me at the very first i exclaimed all tremulous when you met me at quebec i meanwhy didnt you tell me then did you and elsie come there on purpose to meet me  yes we came there to meet you jack answered but we were afraid to make ourselves known to you all at once just at first because you see una i more than half suspected then what i know now to be the truth that you were coming out to canada on purpose to hunt me up not as your friend and future husband but in enmity and suspicion as your fathers murderer and in any case we were uncertain which attitude you might adopt towards me but i see i must explain a little more even now i havent told you yet why i came at all to canada  tell me now i answered i must know everything today i can never rest now till ive heard the whole story  well jack went on more calmly after the first excitement wore off in the public mind there came after a bit a lull of languid interest the papers began to forget the supposed facts of the murder and to dwell far more upon your own new role as a pyschological curiosity they talked much about your strange new life and its analogies elsewhere i was anxious to see you of course to satisfy myself of your condition but the doctors who had charge of you refused to let you mix for a while with anyone you had known in your first state and i now think wisely it was best you should recover your general health and faculties by slow degrees without being puzzled and distracted by constant upsetting recollections and suggestions of your past history  but for me of course at the time the separation was terrible each morning i read with feverish interest the reports of your health and longed day after day to hear of some distinct improvement and yet at the same time i was terrified at every approach to complete convalescence i feared that if you got better at all you might remember too quick and that then the sudden rush of recollection might kill you or upset your reason but byandby it became clear to me you could remember nothing of the actual shot itself and i saw plainly why it was the firing of the pistol that obliterated as it were every trace of your past life in your disorganised brain and it obliterated itself too your new life began just one moment later with the picture of the dead man stretched before you in his blood on the floor and a figure in the background disappearing through the window  how clever he was to be sure i saw in a moment jack had interpreted my whole frame of mind correctly and wonderfully  well i went back to babbicombe jack continued and lest my heart should break for want of human sympathy i confided every word of my terrible story to elsie elsie can trust me and elsie believed me gradually as you began to recover i realised the soundness of your doctors idea that you should be allowed to come back to yourself by reeducation from the very beginning without any too early intrusion of reminiscences from your previous life to confuse and disturb you but i couldnt go on with my profession all the same while i waited i couldnt attend as i ought to my patients wants and ailments i was too concentrated upon you the strain was too great upon me so i threw up my practice came out to canada bought a bit of land and began farming here and seeing a few patients now and again locally just to fill up my time with i felt confident in the end you would recover and remember me i felt confident you would come to yourself and marry me but still it was very long work waiting every month elsie got news indirectly from minnie moore or someone of your state of health and i intended to go back and try to see you as soon as ever you were in a condition to bear the shock of reliving your previous life again  unfortunately however the police got hold of you before i could carry my plan into execution as soon as i heard that i made up my mind at once to go home by the first mail and break it all gently to you so elsie and i started for quebec meaning to sail by the dominion steamer for england but at the hotel at quebec we saw the telegrams announcing that you were then on your way out to canada well of course we didnt feel sure whether you came as a friend or an enemy we were certain it was to seek me out you were coming to america but whether you remembered me still and still loved me or whether youd found out some stray clue to the missing man and were anxious to hunt me down as your fathers murderer we hadnt the slightest conception so under those circumstances we thought it best not to meet you ourselves at the steamer or to reveal our identity too soon for fear of a catastrophe i knew it would be better to wait and watchto gain your confidence if possiblein any case to find out how you were affected on first seeing us and talking with us  well then as the time came on for the sarmatian to arrive it began to strike me by degrees that all quebec was agog with curiosity to see you i dared not go down to meet you at the quay myself but the chief constable of quebec major tascherel was an old friend and fellowofficer of my fathers and when i explained to him my fears that you might be mobbed by sightseers on your arrival at the harbour and told him how afraid i was of the shock it might give you to meet an old friend unexpectedly at the steamers side he very kindly consented to go down and see you safe through the custom house it was so lucky i knew him if it hadnt been for that you might have been horribly inconvenienced  as you may imagine when we first saw you get into the pullman car both elsie and i felt our hearts come up into our months with suspense and anxiety wed arranged it all so on purpose for we felt sure you were on your way to palmyra to find us but when it came to the actual crisis we wondered most nervously what effect the sight of us might have upon your system but in a moment i saw you didnt remember us at all or only vaguely attached to us some faint sense of friendliness that was well because it enabled us to gain your confidence easily as we spoke with you the sense of friendly interest deepened i knew that all unconsciously to yourself you loved me still and that in a very short time if only i could see you and be with you i might bring all back to you  jack paused and looked at me as he paused i felt my old self revive again more completely than ever with a rush  oh jack i cried so you have done so you have brought all back to me my second states over im the same girl you used to know at torquay once more i remember everythingeverythingsuch a worldsuch a lifetime i feel as if my head would burst with all the things i remember i dont know what to do with it im so tired so weary  lay it here jack said simply  and i laid it on his shoulder just as i used to do years ago and cried so long in silence and was ever so much comforted for ive admitted all along that im only a woman  there we sat hand in hand for many minutes more saying never another word but sympathising silently till elsie returned from palmyra  when she burst into the room she called out lightly as she entered  well ive got you your lemon una and i do hope then she broke short suddenly oh jack she cried faltering and half guessing the truth whats the meaning of this why unas been crying you bad boy youve been frightening her i oughtnt to have left her ten minutes alone with you  jack rose and held up his hand in warning  dont talk to her at present elsie he said you neednt be afraid unas found out everything she remembers all now and she knows how everything happened and shes borne it so bravely without any more shock to her health and strength than was absolutely inevitablelet her sleep if she can itll do her so much goodbut elsie theres one thing i want to say to you both before i hand her over to you after all thats happened i dont think unall want to hear that hateful name of callingham any more it never was really hers and it never shall be well let bygones be bygones in every other respect and not rake up any details of that hateful story but shes been una to us always and she shall be una still its a very good name for her for theres only one of her but next week i propose she shall be una ivor  i threw myself on his neck and cried again like a child  i accept jack i said sobbing let it be ivor if you will next week then ill be your wife at last my darling
