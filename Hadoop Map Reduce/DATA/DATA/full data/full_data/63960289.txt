63960289	danger and other stories   by arthur conan doyle  author of the white company sir nigel rodney stone etc  london john murray albemarle street w 1918  all rights reserved     preface   the title story of this volume was written about eighteen months before the outbreak of the war and was intended to direct public attention to the great danger which threatened this country  it is a matter of history how fully this warning has been justified and how even down to the smallest details the prediction has been fulfilled  the writer must however most thankfully admit that what he did not foresee was the energy and ingenuity with which the navy has found means to meet the new conditions  the great silent battle which has been fought beneath the waves has ended in the repulse of an armada far more dangerous than that of spain  it may be objected that the writer feeling the danger so strongly should have taken other means than fiction to put his views before the authorities  the answer to this criticism is that he did indeed adopt every possible method that he personally approached leading naval men and powerful editors that he sent three separate minutes upon the danger to various public bodies notably to the committee for national defence and that he touched upon the matter in an article in the fortnightly review  in some unfortunate way subjects of national welfare are in this country continually subordinated to party politics so that a self evident proposition such as the danger of a nation being fed from without is waved aside and ignored because it will not fit in with some general political shibboleth  it is against this tendency that we have to guard in the future and we have to bear in mind that the danger may recur and that the remedies in the text the only remedies ever proposed have still to be adopted  they are the sufficient encouragement of agriculture the making of adequate channel tunnels and the provision of submarine merchantmen which on the estimate of mr lake the american designer could be made up to 7000 ton burden at an increased cost of about 25 per cent  it is true that in this war the channel tunnels would not have helped us much in the matter of food but were france a neutral and supplies at liberty to come via marseilles from the east the difference would have been enormous  apart from food however when one considers the transports we have needed their convoys the double handling of cargo the interruptions of traffic from submarines or bad weather the danger and suffering of the wounded and all else that we owe to the insane opposition to the channel tunnels one questions whether there has ever been an example of national stupidity being so rapidly and heavily punished  it is as clear as daylight even now that it will take years to recover all our men and material from france and that if the tunnel one will suffice for the time were at once set in hand it might be ready to help in this task and so free shipping for the return of the americans  one thing however is clear  it is far too big and responsible and lucrative an undertaking for a private company and it should be carried out and controlled by government the proceeds being used towards the war debt  arthur conan doyle  august 24th crowborough     i  danger 1 being the log of captain john sirius   it is an amazing thing that the english who have the reputation of being a practical nation never saw the danger to which they were exposed  for many years they had been spending nearly a hundred millions a year upon their army and their fleet  squadrons of dreadnoughts costing two millions each had been launched  they had spent enormous sums upon cruisers and both their torpedo and their submarine squadrons were exceptionally strong  they were also by no means weak in their aerial power especially in the matter of seaplanes  besides all this their army was very efficient in spite of its limited numbers and it was the most expensive in europe  yet when the day of trial came all this imposing force was of no use whatever and might as well have not existed  their ruin could not have been more complete or more rapid if they had not possessed an ironclad or a regiment  and all this was accomplished by me captain john sirius belonging to the navy of one of the smallest powers in europe and having under my command a flotilla of eight vessels the collective cost of which was eighteen hundred thousand pounds  no one has a better right to tell the story than i  i will not trouble you about the dispute concerning the colonial frontier embittered as it was by the subsequent death of the two missionaries  a naval officer has nothing to do with politics  i only came upon the scene after the ultimatum had been actually received admiral horli had been summoned to the presence and he asked that i should be allowed to accompany him because he happened to know that i had some clear ideas as to the weak points of england and also some schemes as to how to take advantage of them  there were only four of us present at this meetingthe king the foreign secretary admiral horli and myself  the time allowed by the ultimatum expired in fortyeight hours  i am not breaking any confidence when i say that both the king and the minister were in favour of a surrender  they saw no possibility of standing up against the colossal power of great britain  the minister had drawn up an acceptance of the british terms and the king sat with it before him on the table  i saw the tears of anger and humiliation run down his cheeks as he looked at it  i fear that there is no possible alternative sire said the minister our envoy in london has just sent this report which shows that the public and the press are more united than he has ever known them  the feeling is intense especially since the rash act of malort in desecrating the flag  we must give way  the king looked sadly at admiral horli  what is your effective fleet admiral he asked  two battleships four cruisers twenty torpedoboats and eight submarines said the admiral  the king shook his head  it would be madness to resist said he  and yet sire said the admiral before you come to a decision i should wish you to hear captain sirius who has a very definite plan of campaign against the english  absurd said the king impatiently  what is the use  do you imagine that you could defeat their vast armada  sire i answered i will stake my life that if you will follow my advice you will within a month or six weeks at the utmost bring proud england to her knees  there was an assurance in my voice which arrested the attention of the king  you seem selfconfident captain sirius  i have no doubt at all sire  what then would you advise  i would advise sire that the whole fleet be gathered under the forts of blankenberg and be protected from attack by booms and piles  there they can stay till the war is over  the eight submarines however you will leave in my charge to use as i think fit  ah you would attack the english battleships with submarines  sire i would never go near an english battleship  and why not  because they might injure me sire  what a sailor and afraid  my life belongs to the country sire  it is nothing  but these eight shipseverything depends upon them  i could not risk them  nothing would induce me to fight  then what will you do  i will tell you sire  and i did so  for half an hour i spoke  i was clear and strong and definite for many an hour on a lonely watch i had spent in thinking out every detail  i held them enthralled  the king never took his eyes from my face  the minister sat as if turned to stone  are you sure of all this  perfectly sire  the king rose from the table  send no answer to the ultimatum said he  announce in both houses that we stand firm in the face of menace  admiral horli you will in all respects carry out that which captain sirius may demand in furtherance of his plan  captain sirius the field is clear  go forth and do as you have said  a grateful king will know how to reward you  i need not trouble you by telling you the measures which were taken at blankenberg since as you are aware the fortress and the entire fleet were destroyed by the british within a week of the declaration of war  i will confine myself to my own plans which had so glorious and final a result  the fame of my eight submarines alpha beta gamma theta delta epsilon iota and kappa have spread through the world to such an extent that people have begun to think that there was something peculiar in their form and capabilities  this is not so  four of them the delta epsilon iota and kappa were it is true of the very latest model but had their equals though not their superiors in the navies of all the great powers  as to alpha beta gamma and theta they were by no means modern vessels and found their prototypes in the old f class of british boats having a submerged displacement of eight hundred tons with heavy oil engines of sixteen hundred horsepower giving them a speed of eighteen knots on the surface and of twelve knots submerged  their length was one hundred and eightysix and their breadth twentyfour feet  they had a radius of action of four thousand miles and a submerged endurance of nine hours  these were considered the latest word in 1915 but the four new boats exceeded them in all respects  without troubling you with precise figures i may say that they represented roughly a twentyfive per cent advance up on the older boats and were fitted with several auxiliary engines which were wanting in the others  at my suggestion instead of carrying eight of the very large bakdorf torpedoes which are nineteen feet long weigh half a ton and are charged with two hundred pounds of wet guncotton we had tubes designed for eighteen of less than half the size  it was my design to make myself independent of my base  and yet it was clear that i must have a base so i made arrangements at once with that object  blankenberg was the last place i would have chosen  why should i have a port of any kind  ports would be watched or occupied  any place would do for me  i finally chose a small villa standing alone nearly five miles from any village and thirty miles from any port  to this i ordered them to convey secretly by night oil spare parts extra torpedoes storage batteries reserve periscopes and everything that i could need for refitting  the little whitewashed villa of a retired confectionerthat was the base from which i operated against england  the boats lay at blankenberg and thither i went  they were working frantically at the defences and they had only to look seawards to be spurred to fresh exertions  the british fleet was assembling  the ultimatum had not yet expired but it was evident that a blow would be struck the instant that it did  four of their aeroplanes circling at an immense height were surveying our defences  from the top of the lighthouse i counted thirty battleships and cruisers in the offing with a number of the trawlers with which in the british service they break through the minefields  the approaches were actually sown with two hundred mines half contact and half observation but the result showed that they were insufficient to hold off the enemy since three days later both town and fleet were speedily destroyed  however i am not here to tell you the incidents of the war but to explain my own part in it which had such a decisive effect upon the result  my first action was to send my four secondclass boats away instantly to the point which i had chosen for my base  there they were to wait submerged lying with negative buoyancy upon the sands in twenty foot of water and rising only at night  my strict orders were that they were to attempt nothing upon the enemy however tempting the opportunity all they had to do was to remain intact and unseen until they received further orders  having made this clear to commander panza who had charge of this reserve flotilla i shook him by the hand and bade him farewell leaving with him a sheet of notepaper upon which i had explained the tactics to be used and given him certain general principles which he could apply as circumstances demanded  my whole attention was now given to my own flotilla which i divided into two divisions keeping iota and kappa under my own command while captain miriam had delta and epsilon  he was to operate separately in the british channel while my station was the straits of dover  i made the whole plan of campaign clear to him  then i saw that each ship was provided with all it could carry  each had forty tons of heavy oil for surface propulsion and charging the dynamo which supplied the electric engines under water  each had also eighteen torpedoes as explained and five hundred rounds for the collapsible quickfiring twelve pounder which we carried on deck and which of course disappeared into a watertight tank when we were submerged  we carried spare periscopes and a wireless mast which could be elevated above the conningtower when necessary  there were provisions for sixteen days for the ten men who manned each craft  such was the equipment of the four boats which were destined to bring to naught all the navies and armies of britain  at sundown that dayit was april 10thwe set forth upon our historic voyage  miriam had got away in the afternoon since he had so much farther to go to reach his station  stephan of the kappa started with me but of course we realized that we must work independently and that from that moment when we shut the sliding hatches of our conningtowers on the still waters of blankenberg harbour it was unlikely that we should ever see each other again though consorts in the same waters  i waved to stephan from the side of my conningtower and he to me  then i called through the tube to my engineer our watertanks were already filled and all kingstons and vents closed to put her full speed ahead  just as we came abreast of the end of the pier and saw the whitecapped waves rolling in upon us i put the horizontal rudder hard down and she slid under water  through my glass portholes i saw its light green change to a dark blue while the manometer in front of me indicated twenty feet  i let her go to forty because i should then be under the warships of the english though i took the chance of fouling the moorings of our own floating contact mines  then i brought her on an even keel and it was music to my ear to hear the gentle even ticking of my electric engines and to know that i was speeding at twelve miles an hour on my great task  at that moment as i stood controlling my levers in my tower i could have seen had my cupola been of glass the vast shadows of the british blockaders hovering above me  i held my course due westward for ninety minutes and then by shutting off the electric engine without blowing out the watertanks i brought her to the surface  there was a rolling sea and the wind was freshening so i did not think it safe to keep my hatch open long for so small is the margin of buoyancy that one must run no risks  but from the crests of the rollers i had a look backwards at blankenberg and saw the black funnels and upper works of the enemys fleet with the lighthouse and the castle behind them all flushed with the pink glow of the setting sun  even as i looked there was the boom of a great gun and then another  i glanced at my watch  it was six oclock  the time of the ultimatum had expired  we were at war  there was no craft near us and our surface speed is nearly twice that of our submerged so i blew out the tanks and our whaleback came over the surface  all night we were steering southwest making an average of eighteen knots  at about five in the morning as i stood alone upon my tiny bridge i saw low down in the west the scattered lights of the norfolk coast  ah johnny johnny bull i said as i looked at them you are going to have your lesson and i am to be your master  it is i who have been chosen to teach you that one cannot live under artificial conditions and yet act as if they were natural ones  more foresight johnny and less party politicsthat is my lesson to you  and then i had a wave of pity too when i thought of those vast droves of helpless people yorkshire miners lancashire spinners birmingham metalworkers the dockers and workers of london over whose little homes i would bring the shadow of starvation  i seemed to see all those wasted eager hands held out for food and i john sirius dashing it aside  ah well war is war and if one is foolish one must pay the price  just before daybreak i saw the lights of a considerable town which must have been yarmouth bearing about ten miles westsouthwest on our starboard bow  i took her farther out for it is a sandy dangerous coast with many shoals  at fivethirty we were abreast of the lowestoft lightship  a coastguard was sending up flash signals which faded into a pale twinkle as the white dawn crept over the water  there was a good deal of shipping about mostly fishingboats and small coasting craft with one large steamer hulldown to the west and a torpedo destroyer between us and the land  it could not harm us and yet i thought it as well that there should be no word of our presence so i filled my tanks again and went down to ten feet  i was pleased to find that we got under in one hundred and fifty seconds  the life of ones boat may depend on this when a swift craft comes suddenly upon you  we were now within a few hours of our cruising ground so i determined to snatch a rest leaving vornal in charge  when he woke me at ten oclock we were running on the surface and had reached the essex coast off the maplin sands  with that charming frankness which is one of their characteristics our friends of england had informed us by their press that they had put a cordon of torpedoboats across the straits of dover to prevent the passage of submarines which is about as sensible as to lay a wooden plank across a stream to keep the eels from passing  i knew that stephan whose station lay at the western end of the solent would have no difficulty in reaching it  my own cruising ground was to be at the mouth of the thames and here i was at the very spot with my tiny iota my eighteen torpedoes my quickfiring gun and above all a brain that knew what should be done and how to do it  when i resumed my place in the conningtower i saw in the periscope for we had dived that a lightship was within a few hundred yards of us upon the port bow  two men were sitting on her bulwarks but neither of them cast an eye upon the little rod that clove the water so close to them  it was an ideal day for submarine action with enough ripple upon the surface to make us difficult to detect and yet smooth enough to give me a clear view  each of my three periscopes had an angle of sixty degrees so that between them i commanded a complete semicircle of the horizon two british cruisers were steaming north from the thames within half a mile of me  i could easily have cut them off and attacked them had i allowed myself to be diverted from my great plan  farther south a destroyer was passing westwards to sheerness  a dozen small steamers were moving about  none of these were worthy of my notice  great countries are not provisioned by small steamers  i kept the engines running at the lowest pace which would hold our position under water and moving slowly across the estuary i waited for what must assuredly come  i had not long to wait  shortly after one oclock i perceived in the periscope a cloud of smoke to the south  half an hour later a large steamer raised her hull making for the mouth of the thames  i ordered vornal to stand by the starboard torpedotube having the other also loaded in case of a miss  then i advanced slowly for though the steamer was going very swiftly we could easily cut her off  presently i laid the iota in a position near which she must pass and would very gladly have lain to but could not for fear of rising to the surface  i therefore steered out in the direction from which she was coming  she was a very large ship fifteen thousand tons at the least painted black above and red below with two creamcoloured funnels  she lay so low in the water that it was clear she had a full cargo  at her bows were a cluster of men some of them looking i dare say for the first time at the mother country  how little could they have guessed the welcome that was awaiting them  on she came with the great plumes of smoke floating from her funnels and two white waves foaming from her cutwater  she was within a quarter of a mile  my moment had arrived  i signalled full speed ahead and steered straight for her course  my timing was exact  at a hundred yards i gave the signal and heard the clank and swish of the discharge  at the same instant i put the helm hard down and flew off at an angle  there was a terrific lurch which came from the distant explosion  for a moment we were almost upon our side  then after staggering and trembling the iota came on an even keel  i stopped the engines brought her to the surface and opened the conningtower while all my excited crew came crowding to the hatch to know what had happened  the ship lay within two hundred yards of us and it was easy to see that she had her deathblow  she was already settling down by the stern there was a sound of shouting and people were running wildly about her decks  her name was visible the adela of london bound as we afterwards learned from new zealand with frozen mutton  strange as it may seem to you the notion of a submarine had never even now occurred to her people and all were convinced that they had struck a floating mine the starboard quarter had been blown in by the explosion and the ship was sinking rapidly  their discipline was admirable  we saw boat after boat slip down crowded with people as swiftly and quietly as if it were part of their daily drill  and suddenly as one of the boats lay off waiting for the others they caught a glimpse for the first time of my conningtower so close to them  i saw them shouting and pointing while the men in the other boats got up to have a better look at us  for my part i cared nothing for i took it for granted that they already knew that a submarine had destroyed them  one of them clambered back into the sinking ship  i was sure that he was about to send a wireless message as to our presence  it mattered nothing since in any case it must be known otherwise i could easily have brought him down with a rifle  as it was i waved my hand to them and they waved back to me  war is too big a thing to leave room for personal illfeeling but it must be remorseless all the same  i was still looking at the sinking adela when vornal who was beside me gave a sudden cry of warning and surprise gripping me by the shoulder and turning my head  there behind us coming up the fairway was a huge black vessel with black funnels flying the wellknown house flag of the p and o company  she was not a mile distant and i calculated in an instant that even if she had seen us she would not have time to turn and get away before we could reach her  we went straight for her therefore keeping awash just as we were  they saw the sinking vessel in front of them and that little dark speck moving over the surface and they suddenly understood their danger  i saw a number of men rush to the bows and there was a rattle of riflefire  two bullets were flattened upon our fourinch armour  you might as well try to stop a charging bull with paper pellets as the iota with riflefire  i had learned my lesson from the adela and this time i had the torpedo discharged at a safer distancetwo hundred and fifty yards  we caught her amidships and the explosion was tremendous but we were well outside its area  she sank almost instantaneously  i am sorry for her people of whom i hear that more than two hundred including seventy lascars and forty passengers were drowned  yes i am sorry for them  but when i think of the huge floating granary that went to the bottom i rejoice as a man does who has carried out that which he plans  it was a bad afternoon that for the p and o company  the second ship which we destroyed was as we have since learned the moldavia of fifteen thousand tons one of their finest vessels but about halfpast three we blew up the cusco of eight thousand of the same line also from eastern ports and laden with corn  why she came on in face of the wireless messages which must have warned her of danger i cannot imagine the other two steamers which we blew up that day the maid of athens robson line and the cormorant were neither of them provided with apparatus and came blindly to their destruction  both were small boats of from five thousand to seven thousand tons  in the case of the second i had to rise to the surface and fire six twelvepound shells under her waterline before she would sink  in each case the crew took to the boats and so far as i know no casualties occurred  after that no more steamers came along nor did i expect them  warnings must by this time have been flying in all directions  but we had no reason to be dissatisfied with our first day  between the maplin sands and the nore we had sunk five ships of a total tonnage of about fifty thousand tons  already the london markets would begin to feel the pinch and lloydspoor old lloydswhat a demented state it would be in  i could imagine the london evening papers and the howling in fleet street we saw the result of our actions for it was quite laughable to see the torpedoboats buzzing like angry wasps out of sheerness in the evening they were darting in every direction across the estuary and the aeroplanes and hydroplanes were like flights of crows black dots against the red western sky  they quartered the whole river mouth until they discovered us at last  some sharpsighted fellow with a telescope on board of a destroyer got a sight of our periscope and came for us full speed  no doubt he would very gladly have rammed us even if it had meant his own destruction but that was not part of our programme at all i sank her and ran her eastsoutheast with an occasional rise  finally we brought her to not very far from the kentish coast and the search lights of our pursuers were far on the western skyline  there we lay quietly all night for a submarine at night is nothing more than a very thirdrate surface torpedoboat  besides we were all weary and needed rest  do not forget you captains of men when you grease and trim your pumps and compressors and rotators that the human machine needs some tending also  i had put up the wireless mast above the conningtower and had no difficulty in calling up captain stephan  he was lying he said off ventnor and had been unable to reach his station on account of engine trouble which he had now set right  next morning he proposed to block the southampton approach  he had destroyed one large indian boat on his way down channel  we exchanged good wishes  like myself he needed rest  i was up at four in the morning however and called all hands to overhaul the boat  she was somewhat up by the head owing to the forward torpedoes having been used so we trimmed her by opening the forward compensating tank admitting as much water as the torpedoes had weighed we also overhauled the starboard aircompressor and one of the periscope motors which had been jarred by the shock of the first explosion  we had hardly got ourselves shipshape when the morning dawned  i have no doubt that a good many ships which had taken refuge in the french ports at the first alarm had run across and got safely up the river in the night  of course i could have attacked them but i do not care to take risksand there are always risks for a submarine at night but one had miscalculated his time and there she was just abreast of warden point when the daylight disclosed her to us  in an instant we were after her  it was a near thing for she was a flier and could do two miles to our one but we just reached her as she went swashing by she saw us at the last moment for i attacked her awash since otherwise we could not have had the pace to reach her  she swung away and the first torpedo missed but the second took her full under the counter heavens what a smash  the whole stern seemed to go aloft  i drew off and watched her sink  she went down in seven minutes leaving her masts and funnels over the water and a cluster of her people holding on to them  she was the virginia of the bibby linetwelve thousand tonsand laden like the others with foodstuffs from the east  the whole surface of the sea was covered with the floating grain  john bull will have to take up a hole or two of his belt if this goes on said vornal as we watched the scene  and it was at that moment that the very worst danger occurred that could befall us  i tremble now when i think how our glorious voyage might have been nipped in the bud  i had freed the hatch of my tower and was looking at the boats of the virginia with vornal near me when there was a swish and a terrific splash in the water beside us which covered us both with spray  we looked up and you can imagine our feelings when we saw an aeroplane hovering a few hundred feet above us like a hawk with its silencer it was perfectly noiseless and had its bomb not fallen into the sea we should never have known what had destroyed us  she was circling round in the hope of dropping a second one but we shoved on all speed ahead crammed down the rudders and vanished into the side of a roller  i kept the deflection indicator falling until i had put fifty good feet of water between the aeroplane and ourselves for i knew well how deeply they can see under the surface  however we soon threw her off our track and when we came to the surface near margate there was no sign of her unless she was one of several which we saw hovering over herne bay  there was not a ship in the offing save a few small coasters and little thousandton steamers which were beneath my notice  for several hours i lay submerged with a blank periscope  then i had an inspiration  orders had been marconied to every foodship to lie in french waters and dash across after dark  i was as sure of it as if they had been recorded in our own receiver  well if they were there that was where i should be also  i blew out the tanks and rose for there was no sign of any warship near  they had some good system of signalling from the shore however for i had not got to the north foreland before three destroyers came foaming after me all converging from different directions  they had about as good a chance of catching me as three spaniels would have of overtaking a porpoise  out of pure bravadoi know it was very wrongi waited until they were actually within gunshot  then i sank and we saw each other no more  it is as i have said a shallow sandy coast and submarine navigation is very difficult  the worst mishap that can befall a boat is to bury its nose in the side of a sanddrift and be held there  such an accident might have been the end of our boat though with our fleuss cylinders and electric lamps we should have found no difficulty in getting out at the airlock and in walking ashore across the bed of the ocean  as it was however i was able thanks to our excellent charts to keep the channel and so to gain the open straits  there we rose about midday but observing a hydroplane at no great distance we sank again for half an hour  when we came up for the second time all was peaceful around us and the english coast was lining the whole western horizon  we kept outside the goodwins and straight down channel until we saw a line of black dots in front of us which i knew to be the dovercalais torpedo boat cordon  when two miles distant we dived and came up again seven miles to the southwest without one of them dreaming that we had been within thirty feet of their keels  when we rose a large steamer flying the german flag was within half a mile of us  it was the north german lloyd altona from new york to bremen  i raised our whole hull and dipped our flag to her  it was amusing to see the amazement of her people at what they must have regarded as our unparalleled impudence in those englishswept waters they cheered us heartily and the tricolour flag was dipped in greeting as they went roaring past us  then i stood in to the french coast  it was exactly as i had expected  there were three great british steamers lying at anchor in boulogne outer harbour  they were the caesar the king of the east and the pathfinder none less than ten thousand tons  i suppose they thought they were safe in french waters but what did i care about threemile limits and international law  the view of my government was that england was blockaded food contraband and vessels carrying it to be destroyed  the lawyers could argue about it afterwards  my business was to starve the enemy any way i could  within an hour the three ships were under the waves and the iota was streaming down the picardy coast looking for fresh victims the channel was covered with english torpedoboats buzzing and whirling like a cloud of midges  how they thought they could hurt me i cannot imagine unless by accident i were to come up underneath one of them more dangerous were the aeroplanes which circled here and there  the water being calm i had several times to descend as deep as a hundred feet before i was sure that i was out of their sight  after i had blown up the three ships at boulogne i saw two aeroplanes flying down channel and i knew that they would head off any vessels which were coming up there was one very large white steamer lying off havre but she steamed west before i could reach her  i dare say stephan or one of the others would get her before long  but those infernal aeroplanes spoiled our sport for that day  not another steamer did i see save the neverending torpedoboats  i consoled myself with the reflection however that no food was passing me on its way to london  that was what i was there for after all  if i could do it without spending my torpedoes all the better  up to date i had fired ten of them and sunk nine steamers so i had not wasted my weapons  that night i came back to the kent coast and lay upon the bottom in shallow water near dungeness  we were all trimmed and ready at the first break of day for i expected to catch some ships which had tried to make the thames in the darkness and had miscalculated their time  sure enough there was a great steamer coming up channel and flying the american flag  it was all the same to me what flag she flew so long as she was engaged in conveying contraband of war to the british isles  there were no torpedoboats about at the moment so i ran out on the surface and fired a shot across her bows  she seemed inclined to go on so i put a second one just above her waterline on her port bow  she stopped then and a very angry man began to gesticulate from the bridge  i ran the iota almost alongside  are you the captain i asked  what the i wont attempt to reproduce his language  you have foodstuffs on board i said  its an american ship you blind beetle he cried  cant you see the flag  its the vermondia of boston  sorry captain i answered  i have really no time for words  those shots of mine will bring the torpedoboats and i dare say at this very moment your wireless is making trouble for me  get your people into the boats  i had to show him i was not bluffing so i drew off and began putting shells into him just on the waterline  when i had knocked six holes in it he was very busy on his boats  i fired twenty shots altogether and no torpedo was needed for she was lying over with a terrible list to port and presently came right on to her side  there she lay for two or three minutes before she foundered  there were eight boats crammed with people lying round her when she went down  i believe everybody was saved but i could not wait to inquire  from all quarters the poor old panting useless warvessels were hurrying  i filled my tanks ran her bows under and came up fifteen miles to the south  of course i knew there would be a big row afterwardsas there wasbut that did not help the starving crowds round the london bakers who only saved their skins poor devils by explaining to the mob that they had nothing to bake  by this time i was becoming rather anxious as you can imagine to know what was going on in the world and what england was thinking about it all  i ran alongside a fishingboat therefore and ordered them to give up their papers  unfortunately they had none except a rag of an evening paper which was full of nothing but betting news  in a second attempt i came alongside a small yachting party from eastbourne who were frightened to death at our sudden appearance out of the depths  from them we were lucky enough to get the london courier of that very morning  it was interesting readingso interesting that i had to announce it all to the crew  of course you know the british style of headline which gives you all the news at a glance  it seemed to me that the whole paper was headlines it was in such a state of excitement  hardly a word about me and my flotilla  we were on the second page  the first one began something like this     capture of blankenberg              destruction of enemys fleet              burning of town              trawlers destroy mine field    loss of two battleships              is it the end  of course what i had foreseen had occurred  the town was actually occupied by the british  and they thought it was the end  we would see about that  on the roundthecorner page at the back of the glorious resonant leaders there was a little column which read like this     hostile submarines     several of the enemys submarines are at sea and have inflicted some    appreciable damage upon our merchant ships  the dangerspots upon    monday and the greater part of tuesday appear to have been the mouth    of the thames and the western entrance to the solent  on monday    between the nore and margate there were sunk five large steamers the    adela moldavia cusco cormorant and maid of athens    particulars of which will be found below  near ventnor on the same    day was sunk the verulam from bombay  on tuesday the virginia    caesar king of the east and pathfinder were destroyed between    the foreland and boulogne  the latter three were actually lying in    french waters and the most energetic representations have been made    by the government of the republic  on the same day the queen of    sheba orontes diana and atalanta were destroyed near the    needles  wireless messages have stopped all ingoing cargoships from    coming up channel but unfortunately there is evidence that at least    two of the enemys submarines are in the west  four cattleships from    dublin to liverpool were sunk yesterday evening while three bristol    bound steamers the hilda mercury and maria toser were blown    up in the neighbourhood of lundy island  commerce has so far as    possible been diverted into safer channels but in the meantime    however vexatious these incidents may be and however grievous the    loss both to the owners and to lloyds we may console ourselves by    the reflection that since a submarine cannot keep the sea for more    than ten days without refitting and since the base has been captured    there must come a speedy term to these depredations  so much for the couriers account of our proceedings  another small paragraph was however more eloquent     the price of wheat which stood at thirtyfive shillings a week    before the declaration of war was quoted yesterday on the baltic at    fiftytwo  maize has gone from twentyone to thirtyseven barley    from nineteen to thirtyfive sugar foreign granulated from eleven    shillings and threepence to nineteen shillings and sixpence  good my lads said i when i read it to the crew  i can assure you that those few lines will prove to mean more than the whole page about the fall of blankenberg  now let us get down channel and send those prices up a little higher  all traffic had stopped for londonnot so bad for the little iotaand we did not see a steamer that was worth a torpedo between dungeness and the isle of wight  there i called stephan up by wireless and by seven oclock we were actually lying side by side in a smooth rolling seahengistbury head bearing nnw and about five miles distant  the two crews clustered on the whalebacks and shouted their joy at seeing friendly faces once more  stephan had done extraordinarily well  i had of course read in the london paper of his four ships on tuesday but he had sunk no fewer than seven since for many of those which should have come to the thames had tried to make southampton  of the seven one was of twenty thousand tons a grainship from america a second was a grain ship from the black sea and two others were great liners from south africa  i congratulated stephan with all my heart upon his splendid achievement  then as we had been seen by a destroyer which was approaching at a great pace we both dived coming up again off the needles where we spent the night in company  we could not visit each other since we had no boat but we lay so nearly alongside that we were able stephan and i to talk from hatch to hatch and so make our plans  he had shot away more than half his torpedoes and so had i and yet we were very averse from returning to our base so long as our oil held out i told him of my experience with the boston steamer and we mutually agreed to sink the ships by gunfire in future so far as possible  i remember old horli saying what use is a gun aboard a submarine  we were about to show  i read the english paper to stephan by the light of my electric torch and we both agreed that few ships would now come up the channel  that sentence about diverting commerce to safer routes could only mean that the ships would go round the north of ireland and unload at glasgow  oh for two more ships to stop that entrance heavens what would england have done against a foe with thirty or forty submarines since we only needed six instead of four to complete her destruction  after much talk we decided that the best plan would be that i should dispatch a cipher telegram next morning from a french port to tell them to send the four secondrate boats to cruise off the north of ireland and west of scotland  then when i had done this i should move down channel with stephan and operate at the mouth while the other two boats could work in the irish sea  having made these plans i set off across the channel in the early morning reaching the small village of etretat in brittany  there i got off my telegram and then laid my course for falmouth passing under the keels of two british cruisers which were making eagerly for etretat having heard by wireless that we were there  halfway down channel we had trouble with a short circuit in our electric engines and were compelled to run on the surface for several hours while we replaced one of the camshafts and renewed some washers  it was a ticklish time for had a torpedoboat come upon us we could not have dived  the perfect submarine of the future will surely have some alternative engines for such an emergency  however by the skill of engineer morro we got things going once more  all the time we lay there i saw a hydroplane floating between us and the british coast  i can understand how a mouse feels when it is in a tuft of grass and sees a hawk high up in the heavens  however all went well the mouse became a waterrat it wagged its tail in derision at the poor blind old hawk and it dived down into a nice safe green quiet world where there was nothing to injure it  it was on the wednesday night that the iota crossed to etretat  it was friday afternoon before we had reached our new cruising ground  only one large steamer did i see upon our way  the terror we had caused had cleared the channel  this big boat had a clever captain on board  his tactics were excellent and took him in safety to the thames  he came zigzagging up channel at twentyfive knots shooting off from his course at all sorts of unexpected angles  with our slow pace we could not catch him nor could we calculate his line so as to cut him off  of course he had never seen us but he judged and judged rightly that wherever we were those were the tactics by which he had the best chance of getting past  he deserved his success  but of course it is only in a wide channel that such things can be done  had i met him in the mouth of the thames there would have been a different story to tell  as i approached falmouth i destroyed a three thousandton boat from cork laden with butter and cheese  it was my only success for three days  that night friday april 16th i called up stephan but received no reply  as i was within a few miles of our rendezvous and as he would not be cruising after dark i was puzzled to account for his silence  i could only imagine that his wireless was deranged  but alas  i was soon to find the true reason from a copy of the western morning news which i obtained from a brixham trawler  the kappa with her gallant commander and crew were at the bottom of the english channel  it appeared from this account that after i had parted from him he had met and sunk no fewer than five vessels  i gathered these to be his work since all of them were by gunfire and all were on the south coast of dorset or devon  how he met his fate was stated in a short telegram which was headed sinking of a hostile submarine  it was marked falmouth and ran thus     the p and o mail steamer macedonia came into this port last night    with five shell holes between wind and water  she reports having been    attacked by a hostile submarine ten miles to the southeast of the    lizard  instead of using her torpedoes the submarine for some reason    approached from the surface and fired five shots from a semiautomatic    twelvepounder gun  she was evidently under the impression that the    macedonia was unarmed  as a matter of fact being warned of the    presence of submarines in the channel the macedonia had mounted her    armament as an auxiliary cruiser  she opened fire with two    quickfirers and blew away the conningtower of the submarine  it is    probable that the shells went right through her as she sank at once    with her hatches open  the macedonia was only kept afloat by her    pumps  such was the end of the kappa and my gallant friend commander stephan  his best epitaph was in a corner of the same paper and was headed mark lane  it ran     wheat average 66 maize 48 barley 50  well if stephan was gone there was the more need for me to show energy my plans were quickly taken but they were comprehensive  all that day saturday i passed down the cornish coast and round lands end getting two steamers on the way  i had learned from stephans fate that it was better to torpedo the large craft but i was aware that the auxiliary cruisers of the british government were all over ten thousand tons so that for all ships under that size it was safe to use my gun  both these craft the yelland and the playboythe latter an american shipwere perfectly harmless so i came up within a hundred yards of them and speedily sank them after allowing their people to get into boats  some other steamers lay farther out but i was so eager to make my new arrangements that i did not go out of my course to molest them  just before sunset however so magnificent a prey came within my radius of action that i could not possibly refuse her  no sailor could fail to recognize that glorious monarch of the sea with her four cream funnels tipped with black her huge black sides her red bilges and her high white tophamper roaring up channel at twentythree knots and carrying her fortyfive thousand tons as lightly as if she were a fiveton motor boat  it was the queenly olympic of the white staronce the largest and still the comeliest of liners  what a picture she made with the blue cornish sea creaming round her giant forefoot and the pink western sky with one evening star forming the background to her noble lines  she was about five miles off when we dived to cut her off  my calculation was exact  as we came abreast we loosed our torpedo and struck her fair  we swirled round with the concussion of the water  i saw her in my periscope list over on her side and i knew that she had her deathblow  she settled down slowly and there was plenty of time to save her people  the sea was dotted with her boats  when i got about three miles off i rose to the surface and the whole crew clustered up to see the wonderful sight  she dived bows foremost and there was a terrific explosion which sent one of the funnels into the air  i suppose we should have cheeredsomehow none of us felt like cheering we were all keen sailors and it went to our hearts to see such a ship go down like a broken eggshell  i gave a gruff order and all were at their posts again while we headed northwest  once round the lands end i called up my two consorts and we met next day at hartland point the south end of bideford bay  for the moment the channel was clear but the english could not know it and i reckoned that the loss of the olympic would stop all ships for a day or two at least  having assembled the delta and epsilon one on each side of me i received the report from miriam and var the respective commanders  each had expended twelve torpedoes and between them they had sunk twentytwo steamers  one man had been killed by the machinery on board of the delta and two had been burned by the ignition of some oil on the epsilon  i took these injured men on board and i gave each of the boats one of my crew  i also divided my spare oil my provisions and my torpedoes among them though we had the greatest possible difficulty in those crank vessels in transferring them from one to the other  however by ten oclock it was done and the two vessels were in condition to keep the sea for another ten days  for my part with only two torpedoes left i headed north up the irish sea  one of my torpedoes i expended that evening upon a cattleship making for milford haven  late at night being abreast of holyhead i called upon my four northern boats but without reply  their marconi range is very limited  about three in the afternoon of the next day i had a feeble answer  it was a great relief to me to find that my telegraphic instructions had reached them and that they were on their station  before evening we all assembled in the lee of sanda island in the mull of kintyre  i felt an admiral indeed when i saw my five whalebacks all in a row  panzas report was excellent  they had come round by the pentland firth and reached their cruising ground on the fourth day  already they had destroyed twenty vessels without any mishap  i ordered the beta to divide her oil and torpedoes among the other three so that they were in good condition to continue their cruise  then the beta and i headed for home reaching our base upon sunday april 25th  off cape wrath i picked up a paper from a small schooner  wheat 84 maize 60 barley 62  what were battles and bombardments compared to that  the whole coast of norland was closely blockaded by cordon within cordon and every port even the smallest held by the british  but why should they suspect my modest confectioners villa more than any other of the ten thousand houses that face the sea  i was glad when i picked up its homely white front in my periscope  that night i landed and found my stores intact  before morning the beta reported itself for we had the windows lit as a guide  it is not for me to recount the messages which i found waiting for me at my humble headquarters  they shall ever remain as the patents of nobility of my family  among others was that nevertobeforgotten salutation from my king  he desired me to present myself at hauptville but for once i took it upon myself to disobey his commands  it took me two daysor rather two nights for we sank ourselves during the daylight hoursto get all our stores on board but my presence was needful every minute of the time  on the third morning at four oclock the beta and my own little flagship were at sea once more bound for our original station off the mouth of the thames  i had no time to read our papers whilst i was refitting but i gathered the news after we got under way  the british occupied all our ports but otherwise we had not suffered at all since we have excellent railway communications with europe  prices had altered little and our industries continued as before  there was talk of a british invasion but this i knew to be absolute nonsense for the british must have learned by this time that it would be sheer murder to send transports full of soldiers to sea in the face of submarines  when they have a tunnel they can use their fine expeditionary force upon the continent but until then it might just as well not exist so far as europe is concerned  my own country therefore was in good case and had nothing to fear  great britain however was already feeling my grip upon her throat  as in normal times fourfifths of her food is imported prices were rising by leaps and bounds  the supplies in the country were beginning to show signs of depletion while little was coming in to replace it  the insurances at lloyds had risen to a figure which made the price of the food prohibitive to the mass of the people by the time it had reached the market  the loaf which under ordinary circumstances stood at fivepence was already at one and twopence  beef was three shillings and fourpence a pound and mutton two shillings and ninepence everything else was in proportion  the government had acted with energy and offered a big bounty for corn to be planted at once  it could only be reaped five months hence however and long before then as the papers pointed out half the island would be dead from starvation  strong appeals had been made to the patriotism of the people and they were assured that the interference with trade was temporary and that with a little patience all would be well  but already there was a marked rise in the deathrate especially among children who suffered from want of milk the cattle being slaughtered for food  there was serious rioting in the lanarkshire coalfields and in the midlands together with a socialistic upheaval in the east of london which had assumed the proportions of a civil war  already there were responsible papers which declared that england was in an impossible position and that an immediate peace was necessary to prevent one of the greatest tragedies in history  it was my task now to prove to them that they were right  it was may 2nd when i found myself back at the maplin sands to the north of the estuary of the thames  the beta was sent on to the solent to block it and take the place of the lamented kappa  and now i was throttling britain indeedlondon southampton the bristol channel liverpool the north channel the glasgow approaches each was guarded by my boats  great liners were as we learned afterwards pouring their supplies into galway and the west of ireland where provisions were cheaper than has ever been known  tens of thousands were embarking from britain for ireland in order to save themselves from starvation  but you cannot transplant a whole dense population  the main body of the people by the middle of may were actually starving  at that date wheat was at a hundred maize and barley at eighty  even the most obstinate had begun to see that the situation could not possibly continue  in the great towns starving crowds clamoured for bread before the municipal offices and public officials everywhere were attacked and often murdered by frantic mobs composed largely of desperate women who had seen their infants perish before their eyes  in the country roots bark and weeds of every sort were used as food  in london the private mansions of ministers were guarded by strong pickets of soldiers while a battalion of guards was camped permanently round the houses of parliament  the lives of the prime minister and of the foreign secretary were continually threatened and occasionally attempted  yet the government had entered upon the war with the full assent of every party in the state  the true culprits were those be they politicians or journalists who had not the foresight to understand that unless britain grew her own supplies or unless by means of a tunnel she had some way of conveying them into the island all her mighty expenditure upon her army and her fleet was a mere waste of money so long as her antagonists had a few submarines and men who could use them  england has often been stupid but has got off scotfree  this time she was stupid and had to pay the price  you cant expect luck to be your saviour always  it would be a mere repetition of what i have already described if i were to recount all our proceedings during that first ten days after i resumed my station  during my absence the ships had taken heart and had begun to come up again  in the first day i got four  after that i had to go farther afield and again i picked up several in french waters  once i had a narrow escape through one of my kingston valves getting some grit into it and refusing to act when i was below the surface  our margin of buoyancy just carried us through  by the end of that week the channel was clear again and both beta and my own boat were down west once more  there we had encouraging messages from our bristol consort who in turn had heard from delta at liverpool  our task was completely done we could not prevent all food from passing into the british islands but at least we had raised what did get in to a price which put it far beyond the means of the penniless workless multitudes  in vain government commandeered it all and doled it out as a general feeds the garrison of a fortress  the task was too greatthe responsibility too horrible  even the proud and stubborn english could not face it any longer  i remember well how the news came to me  i was lying at the time off selsey bill when i saw a small warvessel coming down channel  it had never been my policy to attack any vessel coming down  my torpedoes and even my shells were too precious for that  i could not help being attracted however by the movements of this ship which came slowly zigzagging in my direction  looking for me thought i  what on earth does the foolish thing hope to do if she could find me  i was lying awash at the time and got ready to go below in case she should come for me  but at that momentshe was about half a mile awayshe turned her quarter and there to my amazement was the red flag with the blue circle our own beloved flag flying from her peak  for a moment i thought that this was some clever dodge of the enemy to tempt me within range  i snatched up my glasses and called on vornal  then we both recognized the vessel  it was the juno the only one left intact of our own cruisers  what could she be doing flying the flag in the enemys waters  then i understood it and turning to vornal we threw ourselves into each others arms  it could only mean an armisticeor peace  and it was peace  we learned the glad news when we had risen alongside the juno and the ringing cheers which greeted us had at last died away  our orders were to report ourselves at once at blankenberg  then she passed on down channel to collect the others  we returned to port upon the surface steaming through the whole british fleet as we passed up the north sea  the crews clustered thick along the sides of the vessels to watch us  i can see now their sullen angry faces  many shook their fists and cursed us as we went by  it was not that we had damaged themi will do them the justice to say that the english as the old boer war has proved bear no resentment against a brave enemybut that they thought us cowardly to attack merchant ships and avoid the warships  it is like the arabs who think that a flank attack is a mean unmanly device  war is not a big game my english friends  it is a desperate business to gain the upper hand and one must use ones brain in order to find the weak spot of ones enemy  it is not fair to blame me if i have found yours  it was my duty  perhaps those officers and sailors who scowled at the little iota that may morning have by this time done me justice when the first bitterness of undeserved defeat was passed  let others describe my entrance into blankenberg the mad enthusiasm of the crowds and the magnificent public reception of each successive boat as it arrived  surely the men deserved the grant made them by the state which has enabled each of them to be independent for life  as a feat of endurance that long residence in such a state of mental tension in cramped quarters breathing an unnatural atmosphere will long remain as a record  the country may well be proud of such sailors  the terms of peace were not made onerous for we were in no condition to make great britain our permanent enemy  we knew well that we had won the war by circumstances which would never be allowed to occur again and that in a few years the island power would be as strong as everstronger perhapsfor the lesson that she had learned  it would be madness to provoke such an antagonist  a mutual salute of flags was arranged the colonial boundary was adjusted by arbitration and we claimed no indemnity beyond an undertaking on the part of britain that she would pay any damages which an international court might award to france or to the united states for injury received through the operations of our submarines  so ended the war  of course england will not be caught napping in such a fashion again her foolish blindness is partly explained by her delusion that her enemy would not torpedo merchant vessels  common sense should have told her that her enemy will play the game that suits them bestthat they will not inquire what they may do but they will do it first and talk about it afterwards  the opinion of the whole world now is that if a blockade were proclaimed one may do what one can with those who try to break it and that it was as reasonable to prevent food from reaching england in war time as it is for a besieger to prevent the victualling of a beleaguered fortress  i cannot end this account better than by quoting the first few paragraphs of a leader in the times which appeared shortly after the declaration of peace  it may be taken to epitomize the saner public opinion of england upon the meaning and lessons of the episode     in all this miserable business said the writer which has cost us    the loss of a considerable portion of our merchant fleet and more than    fifty thousand civilian lives there is just one consolation to be    found  it lies in the fact that our temporary conqueror is a power    which is not strong enough to reap the fruits of her victory  had we    endured this humiliation at the hands of any of the firstclass powers    it would certainly have entailed the loss of all our crown colonies    and tropical possessions besides the payment of a huge indemnity  we    were absolutely at the feet of our conqueror and had no possible    alternative but to submit to her terms however onerous  norland has    had the good sense to understand that she must not abuse her temporary    advantage and has been generous in her dealings  in the grip of any    other power we should have ceased to exist as an empire     even now we are not out of the wood  some one may maliciously pick a    quarrel with us before we get our house in order and use the easy    weapon which has been demonstrated  it is to meet such a contingency    that the government has rushed enormous stores of food at the public    expense into the country  in a very few months the new harvest will    have appeared  on the whole we can face the immediate future without    undue depression though there remain some causes for anxiety  these    will no doubt be energetically handled by this new and efficient    government which has taken the place of those discredited politicians    who led us into a war without having foreseen how helpless we were    against an obvious form of attack     already the lines of our reconstruction are evident  the first and    most important is that our party men realize that there is something    more vital than their academic disputes about free trade or    protection and that all theory must give way to the fact that a    country is in an artificial and dangerous condition if she does not    produce within her own borders sufficient food to at least keep life    in her population  whether this should be brought about by a tax upon    foreign foodstuffs or by a bounty upon home products or by a    combination of the two is now under discussion  but all parties are    combined upon the principle and though it will undoubtedly entail    either a rise in prices or a deterioration in quality in the food of    the workingclasses they will at least be insured against so terrible    a visitation as that which is fresh in our memories  at any rate we    have got past the stage of argument  it must be so  the increased    prosperity of the farming interest and as we will hope the    cessation of agricultural emigration will be benefits to be counted    against the obvious disadvantages     the second lesson is the immediate construction of not one but two    doublelined railways under the channel  we stand in a white sheet    over the matter since the project has always been discouraged in    these columns but we are prepared to admit that had such railway    communication been combined with adequate arrangements for forwarding    supplies from marseilles we should have avoided our recent surrender    we still insist that we cannot trust entirely to a tunnel since our    enemy might have allies in the mediterranean but in a single contest    with any power of the north of europe it would certainly be of    inestimable benefit  there may be dangers attendant upon the    existence of a tunnel but it must now be admitted that they are    trivial compared to those which come from its absence  as to the    building of large fleets of merchant submarines for the carriage of    food that is a new departure which will be an additional insurance    against the danger which has left so dark a page in the history of our    country     ii  one crowded hour   the place was the eastbournetunbridge road not very far from the cross in handa lonely stretch with a heath running upon either side  the time was halfpast eleven upon a sunday night in the late summer  a motor was passing slowly down the road  it was a long lean rollsroyce running smoothly with a gentle purring of the engine  through the two vivid circles cast by the electric head lights the waving grass fringes and clumps of heather streamed swiftly like some golden cinematograph leaving a blacker darkness behind and around them  one rubyred spot shone upon the road but no numberplate was visible within the dim ruddy halo of the taillamp which cast it  the car was open and of a tourist type but even in that obscure light for the night was moonless an observer could hardly fail to have noticed a curious indefiniteness in its lines  as it slid into and across the broad stream of light from an open cottage door the reason could be seen the body was hung with a singular loose arrangement of brown holland even the long black bonnet was banded with some closedrawn drapery  the solitary man who drove this curious car was broad and burly  he sat hunched up over his steeringwheel with the brim of a tyrolean hat drawn down over his eyes  the red end of a cigarette smouldered under the black shadow thrown by the headgear  a dark ulster of some friezelike material was turned up in the collar until it covered his ears  his neck was pushed forward from his rounded shoulders and he seemed as the car now slid noiselessly down the long sloping road with the clutch disengaged and the engine running free to be peering ahead of him through the darkness in search of some eagerlyexpected object  the distant toot of a motorhorn came faintly from some point far to the south of him  on such a night at such a place all traffic must be from south to north when the current of london weekenders sweeps back from the wateringplace to the capitalfrom pleasure to duty  the man sat straight and listened intently  yes there it was again and certainly to the south of him  his face was over the wheel and his eyes strained through the darkness  then suddenly he spat out his cigarette and gave a sharp intake of the breath  far away down the road two little yellow points had rounded a curve  they vanished into a dip shot upwards once more and then vanished again  the inert man in the draped car woke suddenly into intense life  from his pocket he pulled a mask of dark cloth which he fastened securely across his face adjusting it carefully that his sight might be unimpeded  for an instant he uncovered an acetylene handlantern took a hasty glance at his own preparations and laid it beside a mauser pistol upon the seat alongside him  then twitching his hat down lower than ever he released his clutch and slid downward his gearlever  with a chuckle and shudder the long black machine sprang forward and shot with a soft sigh from her powerful engines down the sloping gradient  the driver stooped and switched off his electric headlights  only a dim grey swathe cut through the black heath indicated the line of his road  from in front there came presently a confused puffing and rattling and clanging as the oncoming car breasted the slope  it coughed and spluttered on a powerful oldfashioned low gear while its engine throbbed like a weary heart  the yellow glaring lights dipped for the last time into a switchback curve  when they reappeared over the crest the two cars were within thirty yards of each other  the dark one darted across the road and barred the others passage while a warning acetylene lamp was waved in the air  with a jarring of brakes the noisy newcomer was brought to a halt  i say cried an aggrieved voice pon my soul you know we might have had an accident  why the devil dont you keep your headlights on  i never saw you till i nearly burst my radiators on you  the acetylene lamp held forward discovered a very angry young man blue eyed yellowmoustached and florid sitting alone at the wheel of an antiquated twelvehorse wolseley  suddenly the aggrieved look upon his flushed face changed to one of absolute bewilderment  the driver in the dark car had sprung out of the seat a black longbarrelled wickedlooking pistol was poked in the travellers face and behind the further sights of it was a circle of black cloth with two deadly eyes looking from as many slits  hands up said a quick stern voice  hands up or by the lord  the young man was as brave as his neighbours but the hands went up all the same  get down said his assailant curtly  the young man stepped forth into the road followed closely by the covering lantern and pistol  once he made as if he would drop his hands but a short stern word jerked them up again  i say look here this is rather out o date aint it said the traveller  i expect youre jokingwhat  your watch said the man behind the mauser pistol  you cant really mean it  your watch i say  well take it if you must  its only plated anyhow  youre two centuries out in time or a few thousand miles longitude  the bush is your markor america  you dont seem in the picture on a sussex road  purse said the man  there was something very compelling in his voice and methods  the purse was handed over  any rings  dont wear em  stand there  dont move  the highwayman passed his victim and threw open the bonnet of the wolseley  his hand with a pair of steel pliers was thrust deep into the works  there was the snap of a parting wire  hang it all dont crock my car cried the traveller  he turned but quick as a flash the pistol was at his head once more  and yet even in that flash whilst the robber whisked round from the broken circuit something had caught the young mans eye which made him gasp and start  he opened his mouth as if about to shout some words  then with an evident effort he restrained himself  get in said the highwayman  the traveller climbed back to his seat  what is your name  ronald barker  whats yours  the masked man ignored the impertinence  where do you live he asked  my cards are in my purse  take one  the highwayman sprang into his car the engine of which had hissed and whispered in gentle accompaniment to the interview  with a clash he threw back his sidebrake flung in his gears twirled the wheel hard round and cleared the motionless wolseley  a minute later he was gliding swiftly with all his lights gleaming some halfmile southward on the road while mr ronald barker a sidelamp in his hand was rummaging furiously among the odds and ends of his repairbox for a strand of wire which would connect up his electricity and set him on his way once more  when he had placed a safe distance between himself and his victim the adventurer eased up took his booty from his pocket replaced the watch opened the purse and counted out the money  seven shillings constituted the miserable spoil  the poor result of his efforts seemed to amuse rather than annoy him for he chuckled as he held the two halfcrowns and the florin in the glare of his lantern  then suddenly his manner changed  he thrust the thin purse back into his pocket released his brake and shot onwards with the same tense bearing with which he had started upon his adventure  the lights of another car were coming down the road  on this occasion the methods of the highwayman were less furtive experience had clearly given him confidence  with lights still blazing he ran towards the newcomers and halting in the middle of the road summoned them to stop  from the point of view of the astonished travellers the result was sufficiently impressive  they saw in the glare of their own headlights two glowing discs on either side of the long blackmuzzled snout of a highpower car and above the masked face and menacing figure of its solitary driver  in the golden circle thrown by the rover there stood an elegant opentopped twentyhorse humber with an undersized and very astonished chauffeur blinking from under his peaked cap  from behind the windscreen the veilbound hats and wondering faces of two very pretty young women protruded one upon either side and a little crescendo of frightened squeaks announced the acute emotion of one of them  the other was cooler and more critical  dont give it away hilda she whispered  do shut up and dont be such a silly  its bertie or one of the boys playing it on us  no no  its the real thing flossie  its a robber sure enough  oh my goodness whatever shall we do  what an ad cried the other  oh what a glorious ad  too late now for the mornings but theyll have it in every evening paper sure  whats it going to cost groaned the other  oh flossie flossie im sure im going to faint  dont you think if we both screamed together we could do some good  isnt he too awful with that black thing over his face  oh dear oh dear  hes killing poor little alf  the proceedings of the robber were indeed somewhat alarming  springing down from his car he had pulled the chauffeur out of his seat by the scruff of his neck  the sight of the mauser had cut short all remonstrance and under its compulsion the little man had pulled open the bonnet and extracted the sparking plugs  having thus secured the immobility of his capture the masked man walked forward lantern in hand to the side of the car  he had laid aside the gruff sternness with which he had treated mr ronald barker and his voice and manner were gentle though determined  he even raised his hat as a prelude to his address  i am sorry to inconvenience you ladies said he and his voice had gone up several notes since the previous interview  may i ask who you are  miss hilda was beyond coherent speech but miss flossie was of a sterner mould  this is a pretty business said she  what right have you to stop us on the public road i should like to know  my time is short said the robber in a sterner voice  i must ask you to answer my question  tell him flossie  for goodness sake be nice to him cried hilda  well were from the gaiety theatre london if you want to know said the young lady  perhaps youve heard of miss flossie thornton and miss hilda mannering  weve been playing a week at the royal at eastbourne and took a sunday off to ourselves  so now you know  i must ask you for your purses and for your jewellery  both ladies set up shrill expostulations but they found as mr ronald barker had done that there was something quietly compelling in this mans methods  in a very few minutes they had handed over their purses and a pile of glittering rings bangles brooches and chains was lying upon the front seat of the car  the diamonds glowed and shimmered like little electric points in the light of the lantern  he picked up the glittering tangle and weighed it in his hand  anything you particularly value he asked the ladies but miss flossie was in no humour for concessions  dont come the claude duval over us said she  take the lot or leave the lot  we dont want bits of our own given back to us  except just billys necklace cried hilda and snatched at a little rope of pearls  the robber bowed and released his hold of it  anything else  the valiant flossie began suddenly to cry  hilda did the same  the effect upon the robber was surprising  he threw the whole heap of jewellery into the nearest lap  there there  take it he said  its trumpery stuff anyhow  its worth something to you and nothing to me  tears changed in a moment to smiles  youre welcome to the purses  the ad is worth ten times the money but what a funny way of getting a living nowadays  arent you afraid of being caught  its all so wonderful like a scene from a comedy  it may be a tragedy said the robber  oh i hope notim sure i hope not cried the two ladies of the drama  but the robber was in no mood for further conversation  far away down the road tiny points of light had appeared  fresh business was coming to him and he must not mix his cases  disengaging his machine he raised his hat and slipped off to meet this new arrival while miss flossie and miss hilda leaned out of their derelict car still palpitating from their adventure and watched the red gleam of the taillight until it merged into the darkness  this time there was every sign of a rich prize  behind its four grand lamps set in a broad frame of glittering brasswork the magnificent sixty horse daimler breasted the slope with the low deep even snore which proclaimed its enormous latent strength  like some richladen highpooped spanish galleon she kept her course until the prowling craft ahead of her swept across her bows and brought her to a sudden halt  an angry face red blotched and evil shot out of the open window of the closed limousine  the robber was aware of a high bald forehead gross pendulous cheeks and two little crafty eyes which gleamed between creases of fat  out of my way sir  out of my way this instant cried a rasping voice drive over him hearn  get down and pull him off the seat  the fellows drunkhes drunk i say  up to this point the proceedings of the modern highwayman might have passed as gentle  now they turned in an instant to savagery  the chauffeur a burly capable fellow incited by that raucous voice behind him sprang from the car and seized the advancing robber by the throat the latter hit out with the buttend of his pistol and the man dropped groaning on the road  stepping over his prostrate body the adventurer pulled open the door seized the stout occupant savagely by the ear and dragged him bellowing on to the highway  then very deliberately he struck him twice across the face with his open hand  the blows rang out like pistolshots in the silence of the night  the fat traveller turned a ghastly colour and fell back half senseless against the side of the limousine  the robber dragged open his coat wrenched away the heavy gold watchchain with all that it held plucked out the great diamond pin that sparkled in the black satin tie dragged off four ringsnot one of which could have cost less than three figures and finally tore from his inner pocket a bulky leather notebook  all this property he transferred to his own black overcoat and added to it the mans pearl cufflinks and even the golden stud which held his collar  having made sure that there was nothing else to take the robber flashed his lantern upon the prostrate chauffeur and satisfied himself that he was stunned and not dead  then returning to the master he proceeded very deliberately to tear all his clothes from his body with a ferocious energy which set his victim whimpering and writhing in imminent expectation of murder  whatever his tormentors intention may have been it was very effectually frustrated  a sound made him turn his head and there no very great distance off were the lights of a car coming swiftly from the north such a car must have already passed the wreckage which this pirate had left behind him  it was following his track with a deliberate purpose and might be crammed with every county constable of the district  the adventurer had no time to lose  he darted from his bedraggled victim sprang into his own seat and with his foot on the accelerator shot swiftly off down the road  some way down there was a narrow side lane and into this the fugitive turned cracking on his high speed and leaving a good five miles between him and any pursuer before he ventured to stop  then in a quiet corner he counted over his booty of the eveningthe paltry plunder of mr ronald barker the rather betterfurnished purses of the actresses which contained four pounds between them and finally the gorgeous jewellery and wellfilled note book of the plutocrat upon the daimler  five notes of fifty pounds four of ten fifteen sovereigns and a number of valuable papers made up a most noble haul  it was clearly enough for one nights work  the adventurer replaced all his illgotten gains in his pocket and lighting a cigarette set forth upon his way with the air of a man who has no further care upon his mind        it was on the monday morning following upon this eventful evening that sir henry hailworthy of walcot old place having finished his breakfast in a leisurely fashion strolled down to his study with the intention of writing a few letters before setting forth to take his place upon the county bench  sir henry was a deputylieutenant of the county he was a baronet of ancient blood he was a magistrate of ten years standing and he was famous above all as the breeder of many a good horse and the most desperate rider in all the weald country  a tall upstanding man with a strong cleanshaven face heavy black eyebrows and a square resolute jaw he was one whom it was better to call friend than foe  though nearly fifty years of age he bore no sign of having passed his youth save that nature in one of her freakish moods had planted one little feather of white hair above his right ear making the rest of his thick black curls the darker by contrast  he was in thoughtful mood this morning for having lit his pipe he sat at his desk with his blank note paper in front of him lost in a deep reverie  suddenly his thoughts were brought back to the present  from behind the laurels of the curving drive there came a low clanking sound which swelled into the clatter and jingle of an ancient car  then from round the corner there swung an oldfashioned wolseley with a freshcomplexioned yellowmoustached young man at the wheel  sir henry sprang to his feet at the sight and then sat down once more  he rose again as a minute later the footman announced mr ronald barker  it was an early visit but barker was sir henrys intimate friend  as each was a fine shot horseman and billiardplayer there was much in common between the two men and the younger and poorer was in the habit of spending at least two evenings a week at walcot old place  therefore sir henry advanced cordially with outstretched hand to welcome him  youre an early bird this morning said he  whats up  if you are going over to lewes we could motor together  but the younger mans demeanour was peculiar and ungracious  he disregarded the hand which was held out to him and he stood pulling at his own long moustache and staring with troubled questioning eyes at the county magistrate  well whats the matter asked the latter  still the young man did not speak  he was clearly on the edge of an interview which he found it most difficult to open  his host grew impatient  you dont seem yourself this morning  what on earth is the matter anything upset you  yes said ronald barker with emphasis  what has  you have  sir henry smiled  sit down my dear fellow  if you have any grievance against me let me hear it  barker sat down  he seemed to be gathering himself for a reproach  when it did come it was like a bullet from a gun  why did you rob me last night  the magistrate was a man of iron nerve  he showed neither surprise nor resentment  not a muscle twitched upon his calm set face  why do you say that i robbed you last night  a big tall fellow in a motorcar stopped me on the mayfield road  he poked a pistol in my face and took my purse and my watch  sir henry that man was you  the magistrate smiled  am i the only big tall man in the district  am i the only man with a motorcar  do you think i couldnt tell a rollsroyce when i see iti who spend half my life on a car and the other half under it  who has a rollsroyce about here except you  my dear barker dont you think that such a modern highwayman as you describe would be more likely to operate outside his own district  how many hundred rollsroyces are there in the south of england  no it wont do sir henryit wont do  even your voice though you sunk it a few notes was familiar enough to me  but hang it man  what did you do it for  thats what gets over me  that you should stick up me one of your closest friends a man that worked himself to the bone when you stood for the divisionand all for the sake of a brummagem watch and a few shillingsis simply incredible  simply incredible repeated the magistrate with a smile  and then those actresses poor little devils who have to earn all they get  i followed you down the road you see  that was a dirty trick if ever i heard one  the city shark was different  if a chap must go a robbing that sort of fellow is fair game  but your friend and then the girlswell i say again i couldnt have believed it  then why believe it  because it is so  well you seem to have persuaded yourself to that effect  you dont seem to have much evidence to lay before any one else  i could swear to you in a policecourt  what put the lid on it was that when you were cutting my wireand an infernal liberty it wasi saw that white tuft of yours sticking out from behind your mask  for the first time an acute observer might have seen some slight sign of emotion upon the face of the baronet  you seem to have a fairly vivid imagination said he  his visitor flushed with anger  see here hailworthy said he opening his hand and showing a small jagged triangle of black cloth  do you see that  it was on the ground near the car of the young women  you must have ripped it off as you jumped out from your seat  now send for that heavy black drivingcoat of yours  if you dont ring the bell ill ring it myself and we shall have it in  im going to see this thing through and dont you make any mistake about that  the baronets answer was a surprising one  he rose passed barkers chair and walking over to the door he locked it and placed the key in his pocket  you are going to see it through said he  ill lock you in until you do  now we must have a straight talk barker as man to man and whether it ends in tragedy or not depends on you  he had halfopened one of the drawers in his desk as he spoke  his visitor frowned in anger  you wont make matters any better by threatening me hailworthy  i am going to do my duty and you wont bluff me out of it  i have no wish to bluff you  when i spoke of a tragedy i did not mean to you  what i meant was that there are some turns which this affair cannot be allowed to take  i have neither kith nor kin but there is the family honour and some things are impossible  it is late to talk like that  well perhaps it is but not too late  and now i have a good deal to say to you  first of all you are quite right and it was i who held you up last night on the mayfield road  but why on earth  all right  let me tell it my own way  first i want you to look at these  he unlocked a drawer and he took out two small packages  these were to be posted in london tonight  this one is addressed to you and i may as well hand it over to you at once  it contains your watch and your purse  so you see bar your cut wire you would have been none the worse for your adventure  this other packet is addressed to the young ladies of the gaiety theatre and their properties are enclosed  i hope i have convinced you that i had intended full reparation in each case before you came to accuse me  well asked barker  well we will now deal with sir george wilde who is as you may not know the senior partner of wilde and guggendorf the founders of the ludgate bank of infamous memory  his chauffeur is a case apart  you may take it from me upon my word of honour that i had plans for the chauffeur  but it is the master that i want to speak of  you know that i am not a rich man myself  i expect all the county knows that  when black tulip lost the derby i was hard hit  and other things as well then i had a legacy of a thousand  this infernal bank was paying 7 per cent on deposits  i knew wilde  i saw him  i asked him if it was safe  he said it was  i paid it in and within fortyeight hours the whole thing went to bits  it came out before the official receiver that wilde had known for three months that nothing could save him  and yet he took all my cargo aboard his sinking vessel  he was all rightconfound him  he had plenty besides  but i had lost all my money and no law could help me  yet he had robbed me as clearly as one man could rob another  i saw him and he laughed in my face  told me to stick to consols and that the lesson was cheap at the price  so i just swore that by hook or by crook i would get level with him  i knew his habits for i had made it my business to do so  i knew that he came back from eastbourne on sunday nights  i knew that he carried a good sum with him in his pocketbook  well its my pocketbook now  do you mean to tell me that im not morally justified in what i have done  by the lord id have left the devil as bare as he left many a widow and orphan if id had the time  thats all very well  but what about me  what about the girls  have some common sense barker  do you suppose that i could go and stick up this one personal enemy of mine and escape detection  it was impossible  i was bound to make myself out to be just a common robber who had run up against him by accident  so i turned myself loose on the high road and took my chance  as the devil would have it the first man i met was yourself  i was a fool not to recognise that old ironmongers store of yours by the row it made coming up the hill  when i saw you i could hardly speak for laughing  but i was bound to carry it through the same with the actresses  im afraid i gave myself away for i couldnt take their little fallals but i had to keep up a show  then came my man himself  there was no bluff about that  i was out to skin him and i did  now barker what do you think of it all  i had a pistol at your head last night and by george whether you believe it or not you have one at mine this morning  the young man rose slowly and with a broad smile he wrung the magistrate by the hand  dont do it again  its too risky said he  the swine would score heavily if you were taken  youre a good chap barker said the magistrate  no i wont do it again  whos the fellow who talks of one crowded hour of glorious life  by george its too fascinating  i had the time of my life  talk of foxhunting  no ill never touch it again for it might get a grip of me  a telephone rang sharply upon the table and the baronet put the receiver to his ear  as he listened he smiled across at his companion  im rather late this morning said he and they are waiting for me to try some petty larcenies on the county bench     iii  a point of view   it was an american journalist who was writing up englandor writing her down as the mood seized him  sometimes he blamed and sometimes he praised and the casehardened old country actually went its way all the time quite oblivious of his approval or of his disfavourbeing ready at all times through some queer mental twist to say more bitter things and more unjust ones about herself than any critic could ever venture upon however in the course of his many columns in the new york clarion our journalist did at last get through somebodys skin in the way that is here narrated  it was a kindly enough article upon english countryhouse life in which he had described a visit paid for a weekend to sir henry trustalls there was only a single critical passage in it and it was one which he had written with a sense both of journalistic and of democratic satisfaction  in it he had sketched off the lofty obsequiousness of the flunkey who had ministered to his needs  he seemed to take a smug satisfaction in his own degradation said he  surely the last spark of manhood must have gone from the man who has so entirely lost his own individuality  he revelled in humility  he was an instrument of servicenothing more  some months had passed and our american pressman had recorded impressions from st petersburg to madrid  he was on his homeward way when once again he found himself the guest of sir henry  he had returned from an afternoons shooting and had finished dressing when there was a knock at the door and the footman entered  he was a large cleanlybuilt man as is proper to a class who are chosen with a keener eye to physique than any crack regiment  the american supposed that the man had entered to perform some menial service but to his surprise he softly closed the door behind him  might i have a word with you sir if you can kindly give me a moment he said in the velvety voice which always got upon the visitors republican nerves  well what is it the journalist asked sharply  its this sir  the footman drew from his breastpocket the copy of the clarion  a friend over the water chanced to see this sir and he thought it would be of interest to me  so he sent it  well  you wrote it sir i fancy  what if i did  and this ere footman is your idea of me  the american glanced at the passage and approved his own phrases  yes thats you he admitted  the footman folded up his document once more and replaced it in his pocket  id like to ave a word or two with you over that sir he said in the same suave imperturbable voice  i dont think sir that you quite see the thing from our point of view  id like to put it to you as i see it myself  maybe it would strike you different then  the american became interested  there was copy in the air  sit down said he  no sir begging your pardon sir id very much rather stand  well do as you please  if youve got anything to say get ahead with it  you see sir its like this theres a traditionwhat you might call a standardamong the best servants and its anded down from one to the other  when i joined i was a third and my chief and the butler were both old men who had been trained by the best  i took after them just as they took after those that went before them  it goes back away further than you can tell  i can understand that  but what perhaps you dont so well understand sir is the spirit thats lying behind it  theres a mans own private selfrespect to which you allude sir in this ere article  thats his own  but he cant keep it so far as i can see unless he returns good service for the good money that he takes  well he can do that withoutwithoutcrawling  the footmans florid face paled a little at the word  apparently he was not quite the automatic machine that he appeared  by your leave sir well come to that later said he  but i want you to understand what we are trying to do even when you dont approve of our way of doing it  we are trying to make life smooth and easy for our master and for our masters guests  we do it in the way thats been anded down to us as the best way  if our master could suggest any better way then it would be our place either to leave his service if we disapproved it or else to try and do it as he wanted  it would hurt the selfrespect of any good servant to take a mans money and not give him the very best he can in return for it  well said the american its not quite as we see it in america  thats right sir  i was over there last year with sir henryin new york sir and i saw something of the menservants and their ways  they were paid for service sir and they did not give what they were paid for  you talk about selfrespect sir in this article  well now my selfrespect wouldnt let me treat a master as ive seen them do over there  we dont even like the word master said the american  well thats neither ere nor there sir if i may be so bold as to say so  if youre serving a gentleman hes your master for the time being and any name you may choose to call it by dont make no difference  but you cant eat your cake and ave it sir  you cant sell your independence and ave it too  maybe not said the american  all the same the fact remains that your manhood is the worse for it  there i dont old with you sir  if it were not you wouldnt be standing there arguing so quietly  youd speak to me in another tone i guess  you must remember sir that you are my masters guest and that i am paid to wait upon you and make your visit a pleasant one  so long as you are ere sir that is ow i regard it  now in london  well what about london  well in london if you would have the goodness to let me have a word with you i could make you understand a little clearer what i am trying to explain to you  arding is my name sir  if you get a call from enery arding youll know that i ave a word to say to you        so it happened about three days later that our american journalist in his london hotel received a letter that a mr henry harding desired to speak with him  the man was waiting in the hall dressed in quiet tweeds  he had cast his manner with his uniform and was firmly deliberate in all he said and did  the professional silkiness was gone and his bearing was all that the most democratic could desire  its courteous of you to see me sir said he  theres that matter of the article still open between us and i would like to have a word or two more about it  well i can give you just ten minutes said the american journalist  i understand that you are a busy man sir so ill cut it as short as i can  theres a public garden opposite if you would be so good as talk it over in the open air  the pressman took his hat and accompanied the footman  they walked together down the winding gravelled path among the rhododendron bushes  its like this sir said the footman halting when they had arrived at a quiet nook  i was hoping that you would see it in our light and understand me when i told you that the servant who was trying to give honest service for his masters money and the man who is free born and as good as his neighbour are two separate folk  theres the duty man and theres the natural man and they are different men  to say that i have no life of my own or selfrespect of my own because there are days when i give myself to the service of another is not fair treatment  i was hoping sir that when i made this clear to you you would have met me like a man and taken it back  well you have not convinced me said the american  a mans a man and hes responsible for all his actions  then you wont take back what you said of methe degradation and the rest  no i dont see why i should  the mans comely face darkened  you will take it back said he  ill smash your blasted head if you dont  the american was suddenly aware that he was in the presence of a very ugly proposition  the man was large strong and evidently most earnest and determined  his brows were knotted his eyes flashing and his fists clenched  on neutral ground he struck the journalist as really being a very different person to the obsequious and silken footman of trustall old manor  the american had all the courage both of his race and of his profession but he realised suddenly that he was very much in the wrong he was man enough to say so  well sir this once said the footman as they shook hands  i dont approve of the mixin of classesnone of the best servants do  but im on my own today so well let it pass  but i wish youd set it right with your people sir  i wish you would make them understand that an english servant can give good and proper service and yet that hes a human bein i after all     iv  the fall of lord barrymore   these are few social historians of those days who have not told of the long and fierce struggle between those two famous bucks sir charles tregellis and lord barrymore for the lordship of the kingdom of st james a struggle which divided the whole of fashionable london into two opposing camps  it has been chronicled also how the peer retired suddenly and the commoner resumed his great career without a rival  only here however one can read the real and remarkable reason for this sudden eclipse of a star  it was one morning in the days of this famous struggle that sir charles tregellis was performing his very complicated toilet and ambrose his valet was helping him to attain that pitch of perfection which had long gained him the reputation of being the bestdressed man in town  suddenly sir charles paused his coup darchet halfexecuted the final beauty of his neckcloth halfachieved while he listened with surprise and indignation upon his large comely freshcomplexioned face  below the decorous hum of jermyn street had been broken by the sharp staccato metallic beating of a doorknocker  i begin to think that this uproar must be at our door said sir charles as one who thinks aloud  for five minutes it has come and gone yet perkins has his orders  at a gesture from his master ambrose stepped out upon the balcony and craned his discreet head over it  from the street below came a voice drawling but clear  you would oblige me vastly fellow if you would do me the favour to open this door said the voice  who is it  what is it asked the scandalised sir charles with his arrested elbow still pointing upwards  ambrose had returned with as much surprise upon his dark face as the etiquette of his position would allow him to show  it is a young gentleman sir charles  a young gentleman  there is no one in london who is not aware that i do not show before midday  do you know the person  have you seen him before  i have not seen him sir but he is very like some one i could name  like some one  like whom  with all respect sir charles i could for a moment have believed that it was yourself when i looked down  a smaller man sir and a youth but the voice the face the bearing  it must be that young cub vereker my brothers neerdoweel muttered sir charles continuing his toilet  i have heard that there are points in which he resembles me  he wrote from oxford that he would come and i answered that i would not see him  yet he ventures to insist  the fellow needs a lesson  ambrose ring for perkins  a large footman entered with an outraged expression upon his face  i cannot have this uproar at the door perkins  if you please the young gentleman wont go away sir  wont go away  it is your duty to see that he goes away  have you not your orders  didnt you tell him that i am not seen before midday  i said so sir  he would have pushed his way in for all i could say so i slammed the door in his face  very right perkins  but now sir he is making such a din that all the folk are at the windows  there is a crowd gathering in the street sir  from below came the crackcrackcrack of the knocker ever rising in insistence with a chorus of laughter and encouraging comments from the spectators  sir charles flushed with anger  there must be some limit to such impertinence  my clouded amber cane is in the corner said he  take it with you perkins  i give you a free hand  a stripe or two may bring the young rascal to reason  the large perkins smiled and departed  the door was heard to open below and the knocker was at rest  a few moments later there followed a prolonged howl and a noise as of a beaten carpet  sir charles listened with a smile which gradually faded from his goodhumoured face  the fellow must not overdo it he muttered  i would not do the lad an injury whatever his deserts may be  ambrose run out on the balcony and call him off  this has gone far enough  but before the valet could move there came the swift patter of agile feet upon the stairs and a handsome youth dressed in the height of fashion was standing framed in the open doorway  the pose the face above all the curious mischievous dancing light in the large blue eyes all spoke of the famous tregellis blood  even such was sir charles when twenty years before he had by virtue of his spirit and audacity in one short season taken a place in london from which brummell himself had afterwards vainly struggled to depose him  the youth faced the angry features of his uncle with an air of debonair amusement and he held towards him upon his outstretched palms the broken fragments of an amber cane  i much fear sir said he that in correcting your fellow i have had the misfortune to injure what can only have been your property  i am vastly concerned that it should have occurred  sir charles stared with intolerant eyes at this impertinent apparition the other looked back in a laughable parody of his seniors manner  as ambrose had remarked after his inspection from the balcony the two were very alike save that the younger was smaller finer cut and the more nervously alive of the two  you are my nephew vereker tregellis asked sir charles  yours to command sir  i hear bad reports of you from oxford  yes sir i understand that the reports are bad  nothing could be worse  so i have been told  why are you here sir  that i might see my famous uncle  so you made a tumult in his street forced his door and beat his footman  yes sir  you had my letter  yes sir  you were told that i was not receiving  yes sir  i can remember no such exhibition of impertinence  the young man smiled and rubbed his hands in satisfaction  there is an impertinence which is redeemed by wit said sir charles severely  there is another which is the mere boorishness of the clodhopper  as you grow older and wiser you may discern the difference  you are very right sir said the young man warmly  the finer shades of impertinence are infinitely subtle and only experience and the society of one who is a recognised masterhere he bowed to his unclecan enable one to excel  sir charles was notoriously touchy in temper for the first hour after his morning chocolate  he allowed himself to show it  i cannot congratulate my brother upon his son said he  i had hoped for something more worthy of our traditions  perhaps sir upon a longer acquaintance  the chance is too small to justify the very irksome experience  i must ask you sir to bring to a close a visit which never should have been made  the young man smiled affably but gave no sign of departure  may i ask sir said he in an easy conversational fashion whether you can recall principal munro of my college  no sir i cannot his uncle answered sharply  naturally you would not burden your memory to such an extent but he still remembers you  in some conversation with him yesterday he did me the honour to say that i brought you back to his recollection by what he was pleased to call the mingled levity and obstinacy of my character  the levity seems to have already impressed you  i am now reduced to showing you the obstinacy  he sat down in a chair near the door and folded his arms still beaming pleasantly at his uncle  oh you wont go asked sir charles grimly  no sir i will stay  ambrose step down and call a couple of chairmen  i should not advise it sir  they will be hurt  i will put you out with my own hands  that sir you can always do  as my uncle i could scarce resist you but short of throwing me down the stair i do not see how you can avoid giving me half an hour of your attention  sir charles smiled  he could not help it  there was so much that was reminiscent of his own arrogant and eventful youth in the bearing of this youngster  he was mollified too by the defiance of menials and quick submission to himself  he turned to the glass and signed to ambrose to continue his duties  i must ask you to await the conclusion of my toilet said he  then we shall see how far you can justify such an intrusion  when the valet had at last left the room sir charles turned his attention once more to his scapegrace nephew who had viewed the details of the famous bucks toilet with the face of an acolyte assisting at a mystery  now sir said the older man speak and speak to the point for i can assure you that i have many more important matters which claim my attention  the prince is waiting for me at the present instant at carlton house  be as brief as you can  what is it that you want  a thousand pounds  really  nothing more sir charles had turned acid again  yes sir an introduction to mr brinsley sheridan whom i know to be your friend  and why to him  because i am told that he controls drury lane theatre and i have a fancy to be an actor  my friends assure me that i have a pretty talent that way  i can see you clearly sir in charles surface or any other part where a foppish insolence is the essential  the less you acted the better you would be  but it is absurd to suppose that i could help you to such a career  i could not justify it to your father  return to oxford at once and continue your studies  impossible  and pray sir what is the impediment  i think i may have mentioned to you that i had an interview yesterday with the principal  he ended it by remarking that the authorities of the university could tolerate me no more  sent down  yes sir  and this is the fruit no doubt of a long series of rascalities  something of the sort sir i admit  in spite of himself sir charles began once more to relax in his severity towards this handsome young scapegrace  his absolute frankness disarmed criticism  it was in a more gracious voice that the older man continued the conversation  why do you want this large sum of money he asked  to pay my college debts before i go sir  your father is not a rich man  no sir  i could not apply to him for that reason  so you come to me who am a stranger  no sir no  you are my uncle and if i may say so my ideal and my model  you flatter me my good vereker  but if you think you can flatter me out of a thousand pounds you mistake your man  i will give you no money  of course sir if you cant  i did not say i cant  i say i wont  if you can sir i think you will  sir charles smiled and flicked his sleeve with his lace handkerchief  i find you vastly entertaining said he  pray continue your conversation  why do you think that i will give you so large a sum of money  the reason that i think so continued the younger man is that i can do you a service which will seem to you worth a thousand pounds  sir charles raised his eyebrows in surprise  is this blackmail he inquired  vereker tregellis flushed  sir said he with a pleasing sternness you surprise me  you should know the blood of which i come too well to suppose that i would attempt such a thing  i am relieved to hear that there are limits to what you consider to be justifiable  i must confess that i had seen none in your conduct up to now  but you say that you can do me a service which will be worth a thousand pounds to me  yes sir  and pray sir what may this service be  to make lord barrymore the laughingstock of the town  sir charles in spite of himself lost for an instant the absolute serenity of his selfcontrol  he started and his face expressed his surprise  by what devilish instinct did this raw undergraduate find the one chink in his armour  deep in his heart unacknowledged to any one there was the will to pay many a thousand pounds to the man who would bring ridicule upon this his most dangerous rival who was challenging his supremacy in fashionable london  did you come from oxford with this precious project he asked after a pause  no sir  i chanced to see the man himself last night and i conceived an illwill to him and would do him a mischief  where did you see him  i spent the evening sir at the vauxhall gardens  no doubt you would interpolated his uncle  my lord barrymore was there  he was attended by one who was dressed as a clergyman but who was as i am told none other than hooper the tinman who acts as his bully and thrashes all who may offend him together they passed down the central path insulting the women and browbeating the men  they actually hustled me  i was offended sirso much so that i nearly took the matter in hand then and there  it is as well that you did not  the prizefighter would have beaten you  perhaps so sirand also perhaps not  ah you add pugilism to your elegant accomplishments  the young man laughed pleasantly  william ball is the only professor of my alma mater who has ever had occasion to compliment me sir  he is better known as the oxford pet  i think with all modesty that i could hold him for a dozen rounds  but last night i suffered the annoyance without protest for since it is said that the same scene is enacted every evening there is always time to act  and how would you act may i ask  that sir i should prefer to keep to myself but my aim as i say would be to make lord barrymore a laughingstock to all london  sir charles cogitated for a moment  pray sir said he why did you imagine that any humiliation to lord barrymore would be pleasing to me  even in the provinces we know something of what passes in polite circles  your antagonism to this man is to be found in every column of fashionable gossip  the town is divided between you  it is impossible that any public slight upon him should be unpleasing to you  sir charles smiled  you are a shrewd reasoner said he  we will suppose for the instant that you are right  can you give me no hint what means you would adopt to attain this very desirable end  i would merely make the remark sir that many women have been wronged by this fellow  that is a matter of common knowledge  if one of these damsels were to upbraid him in public in such a fashion that the sympathy of the bystanders should be with her then i can imagine if she were sufficiently persistent that his lordships position might become an unenviable one  and you know such a woman  i think sir that i do  well my good vereker if any such attempt is in your mind i see no reason why i should stand between lord barrymore and the angry fair  as to whether the result is worth a thousand pounds i can make no promise  you shall yourself be the judge sir  i will be an exacting judge nephew  very good sir i should not desire otherwise  if things go as i hope his lordship will not show face in st jamess street for a year to come i will now if i may give you your instructions  my instructions  what do you mean  i have nothing to do with the matter  you are the judge sir and therefore must be present  i can play no part  no sir  i would not ask you to do more than be a witness  what then are my instructions as you are pleased to call them  you will come to the gardens tonight uncle at nine oclock precisely you will walk down the centre path and you will seat yourself upon one of the rustic seats which are beside the statue of aphrodite  you will wait and you will observe  very good i will do so  i begin to perceive nephew that the breed of tregellis has not yet lost some of the points which have made it famous  it was at the stroke of nine that night when sir charles throwing his reins to the groom descended from his high yellow phaeton which forthwith turned to take its place in the long line of fashionable carriages waiting for their owners  as he entered the gate of the gardens the centre at that time of the dissipation and revelry of london he turned up the collar of his drivingcape and drew his hat over his eyes for he had no desire to be personally associated with what might well prove to be a public scandal  in spite of his attempted disguise however there was that in his walk and his carriage which caused many an eye to be turned after him as he passed and many a hand to be raised in salute  sir charles walked on and seating himself upon the rustic bench in front of the famous statue which was in the very middle of the gardens he waited in amused suspense to see the next act in this comedy  from the pavilion whence the paths radiated there came the strains of the band of the foot guards and by the manycoloured lamps twinkling from every tree sir charles could see the confused whirl of the dancers suddenly the music stopped  the quadrilles were at an end  an instant afterwards the central path by which he sat was thronged by the revellers  in a manycoloured crowd stocked and cravated with all the bravery of buff and plumcolour and blue the bucks of the town passed and repassed with their highwaisted straightskirted bebonneted ladies upon their arms  it was not a decorous assembly  many of the men flushed and noisy had come straight from their potations  the women too were loud and aggressive  now and then with a rush and a swirl amid a chorus of screams from the girls and goodhumoured laughter from their escorts some band of highblooded noisy youths would break their way across the moving throng  it was no place for the prim or demure and there was a spirit of goodnature and merriment among the crowd which condoned the wildest liberty  and yet there were some limits to what could be tolerated even by so bohemian an assembly  a murmur of anger followed in the wake of two roisterers who were making their way down the path  it would perhaps be fairer to say one roisterer for of the two it was only the first who carried himself with such insolence although it was the second who ensured that he could do it with impunity  the leader was a very tall hatchetfaced man dressed in the very height of fashion whose evil handsome features were flushed with wine and arrogance  he shouldered his way roughly through the crowd peering with an abominable smile into the faces of the women and occasionally where the weakness of the escort invited an insult stretching out his hand and caressing the cheek or neck of some passing girl laughing loudly as she winced away from his touch  close at his heels walked his hired attendant whom out of insolent caprice and with a desire to show his contempt for the prejudices of others he had dressed as a rough country clergyman  this fellow slouched along with frowning brows and surly challenging eyes like some faithful hideous human bulldog his knotted hands protruding from his rusty cassock his great underhung jaw turning slowly from right to left as he menaced the crowd with his sinister gaze  already a close observer might have marked upon his face a heaviness and looseness of feature the first signs of that physical decay which in a very few years was to stretch him a helpless wreck too weak to utter his own name upon the causeway of the london streets  at present however he was still an unbeaten man the terror of the ring and as his illomened face was seen behind his infamous master many a halfraised cane was lowered and many a hot word was checked while the whisper of hooper  ware bully hooper warned all who were aggrieved that it might be best to pocket their injuries lest some even worse thing should befall them  many a maimed and disfigured man had carried away from vauxhall the handiwork of the tinman and his patron  moving in insolent slowness through the crowd the bully and his master had just come opposite to the bench upon which sat sir charles tregellis at this place the path opened up into a circular space brilliantly illuminated and surrounded by rustic seats  from one of these an elderly ringleted woman deeply veiled rose suddenly and barred the path of the swaggering nobleman  her voice sounded clear and strident above the babel of tongues which hushed suddenly that their owners might hear it  marry her my lord  i entreat you to marry her  oh surely you will marry my poor amelia said the voice  lord barrymore stood aghast  from all sides folk were closing in and heads were peering over shoulders  he tried to push on but the lady barred his way and two palms pressed upon his beruffled front  surely surely you would not desert her  take the advice of that good kind clergyman behind you wailed the voice  oh be a man of honour and marry her  the elderly lady thrust out her hand and drew forward a lumpishlooking young woman who sobbed and mopped her eyes with her handkerchief  the plague take you roared his lordship in a fury  who is the wench  i vow that i never clapped eyes on either of you in my life  it is my niece amelia cried the lady your own loving amelia  oh my lord can you pretend that you have forgotten poor trusting amelia of woodbine cottage at lichfield  i never set foot in lichfield in my life cried the peer  you are two impostors who should be whipped at the carts tail  oh wicked  oh amelia screamed the lady in a voice that resounded through the gardens  oh my darling try to soften his hard heart pray him that he make an honest woman of you at last  with a lurch the stout young woman fell forward and embraced lord barrymore with the hug of a bear  he would have raised his cane but his arms were pinned to his sides  hooper  hooper screamed the furious peer craning his neck in horror for the girl seemed to be trying to kiss him  but the bruiser as he ran forward found himself entangled with the old lady  out o the way marm he cried  out o the way i say and pushed her violently aside  oh you rude rude man she shrieked springing back in front of him he hustled me good people you saw him hustle me  a clergyman but no gentleman  what you would treat a lady soyou would do it again  oh i could slap slap slap you  and with each repetition of the word with extraordinary swiftness her open palm rang upon the prizefighters cheek  the crowd buzzed with amazement and delight  hooper  hooper cried lord barrymore once more for he was still struggling in the evercloser embrace of the unwieldy and amorous amelia  the bully again pushed forward to the aid of his patron but again the elderly lady confronted him her head back her left arm extended her whole attitude to his amazement that of an expert boxer  the prizefighters brutal nature was roused  woman or no woman he would show the murmuring crowd what it meant to cross the path of the tinman she had struck him  she must take the consequence  no one should square up to him with impunity  he swung his right with a curse  the bonnet instantly ducked under his arm and a line of razorlike knuckles left an open cut under his eye  amid wild cries of delight and encouragement from the dense circle of spectators the lady danced round the sham clergyman dodging his ponderous blows slipping under his arms and smacking back at him most successfully  once she tripped and fell over her own skirt but was up and at him again in an instant  you vulgar fellow she shrieked  would you strike a helpless woman take that  oh you rude and illbred man  bully hooper was cowed for the first time in his life by the extraordinary thing that he was fighting  the creature was as elusive as a shadow and yet the blood was dripping down his chin from the effects of the blows  he shrank back with an amazed face from so uncanny an antagonist  and in the moment that he did so his spell was for ever broken  only success could hold it  a check was fatal  in all the crowd there was scarce one who was not nursing some grievance against master or man and waiting for that moment of weakness in which to revenge it  with a growl of rage the circle closed in  there was an eddy of furious struggling men with lord barrymores thin flushed face and hoopers bulldog jowl in the centre of it  a moment after they were both upon the ground and a dozen sticks were rising and falling above them  let me up  youre killing me  for gods sake let me up cried a crackling voice  hooper fought mute like the bulldog he was till his senses were beaten out of him  bruised kicked and mauled never did their worst victim come so badly from the gardens as the bully and his patron that night  but worse than the ache of wounds for lord barrymore was the smart of the mind as he thought how every club and drawingroom in london would laugh for a week to come at the tale of his amelia and her aunt  sir charles had stood rocking with laughter upon the bench which overlooked the scene  when at last he made his way back through the crowds to his yellow phaeton he was not entirely surprised to find that the back seat was already occupied by two giggling females who were exchanging most unladylike repartees with the attendant grooms  you young rascals he remarked over his shoulder as he gathered up his reins  the two females tittered loudly  uncle charles cried the elder may i present mr jack jarvis of brasenose college  i think uncle you should take us somewhere to sup for it has been a vastly fatiguing performance  tomorrow i will do myself the honour to call at your convenience and will venture to bring with me the receipt for one thousand pounds     v  the horror of the heights which includes the manuscript known as the joycearmstrong fragment   the idea that the extraordinary narrative which has been called the joyce armstrong fragment is an elaborate practical joke evolved by some unknown person cursed by a perverted and sinister sense of humour has now been abandoned by all who have examined the matter  the most macabre and imaginative of plotters would hesitate before linking his morbid fancies with the unquestioned and tragic facts which reinforce the statement though the assertions contained in it are amazing and even monstrous it is none the less forcing itself upon the general intelligence that they are true and that we must readjust our ideas to the new situation  this world of ours appears to be separated by a slight and precarious margin of safety from a most singular and unexpected danger  i will endeavour in this narrative which reproduces the original document in its necessarily somewhat fragmentary form to lay before the reader the whole of the facts up to date prefacing my statement by saying that if there be any who doubt the narrative of joycearmstrong there can be no question at all as to the facts concerning lieutenant myrtle rn and mr hay connor who undoubtedly met their end in the manner described  the joycearmstrong fragment was found in the field which is called lower haycock lying one mile to the westward of the village of withyham upon the kent and sussex border  it was on the fifteenth of september last that an agricultural labourer james flynn in the employment of mathew dodd farmer of the chauntry farm withyham perceived a briar pipe lying near the footpath which skirts the hedge in lower haycock  a few paces farther on he picked up a pair of broken binocular glasses finally among some nettles in the ditch he caught sight of a flat canvasbacked book which proved to be a notebook with detachable leaves some of which had come loose and were fluttering along the base of the hedge  these he collected but some including the first were never recovered and leave a deplorable hiatus in this allimportant statement  the notebook was taken by the labourer to his master who in turn showed it to dr j h atherton of hartfield  this gentleman at once recognised the need for an expert examination and the manuscript was forwarded to the aero club in london where it now lies  the first two pages of the manuscript are missing  there is also one torn away at the end of the narrative though none of these affect the general coherence of the story  it is conjectured that the missing opening is concerned with the record of mr joycearmstrongs qualifications as an aeronaut which can be gathered from other sources and are admitted to be unsurpassed among the airpilots of england  for many years he has been looked upon as among the most daring and the most intellectual of flying men a combination which has enabled him to both invent and test several new devices including the common gyroscopic attachment which is known by his name  the main body of the manuscript is written neatly in ink but the last few lines are in pencil and are so ragged as to be hardly legibleexactly in fact as they might be expected to appear if they were scribbled off hurriedly from the seat of a moving aeroplane  there are it may be added several stains both on the last page and on the outside cover which have been pronounced by the home office experts to be bloodprobably human and certainly mammalian the fact that something closely resembling the organism of malaria was discovered in this blood and that joycearmstrong is known to have suffered from intermittent fever is a remarkable example of the new weapons which modern science has placed in the hands of our detectives  and now a word as to the personality of the author of this epochmaking statement  joycearmstrong according to the few friends who really knew something of the man was a poet and a dreamer as well as a mechanic and an inventor  he was a man of considerable wealth much of which he had spent in the pursuit of his aeronautical hobby  he had four private aeroplanes in his hangars near devizes and is said to have made no fewer than one hundred and seventy ascents in the course of last year  he was a retiring man with dark moods in which he would avoid the society of his fellows  captain dangerfield who knew him better than any one says that there were times when his eccentricity threatened to develop into something more serious  his habit of carrying a shotgun with him in his aeroplane was one manifestation of it  another was the morbid effect which the fall of lieutenant myrtle had upon his mind  myrtle who was attempting the height record fell from an altitude of something over thirty thousand feet  horrible to narrate his head was entirely obliterated though his body and limbs preserved their configuration  at every gathering of airmen joycearmstrong according to dangerfield would ask with an enigmatic smile and where pray is myrtles head  on another occasion after dinner at the mess of the flying school on salisbury plain he started a debate as to what will be the most permanent danger which airmen will have to encounter  having listened to successive opinions as to airpockets faulty construction and overbanking he ended by shrugging his shoulders and refusing to put forward his own views though he gave the impression that they differed from any advanced by his companions  it is worth remarking that after his own complete disappearance it was found that his private affairs were arranged with a precision which may show that he had a strong premonition of disaster  with these essential explanations i will now give the narrative exactly as it stands beginning at page three of the bloodsoaked notebook  nevertheless when i dined at rheims with coselli and gustav raymond i found that neither of them was aware of any particular danger in the higher layers of the atmosphere  i did not actually say what was in my thoughts but i got so near to it that if they had any corresponding idea they could not have failed to express it  but then they are two empty vainglorious fellows with no thought beyond seeing their silly names in the newspaper  it is interesting to note that neither of them had ever been much beyond the twentythousandfoot level  of course men have been higher than this both in balloons and in the ascent of mountains  it must be well above that point that the aeroplane enters the danger zonealways presuming that my premonitions are correct  aeroplaning has been with us now for more than twenty years and one might well ask why should this peril be only revealing itself in our day  the answer is obvious  in the old days of weak engines when a hundred horsepower gnome or green was considered ample for every need the flights were very restricted  now that three hundred horsepower is the rule rather than the exception visits to the upper layers have become easier and more common  some of us can remember how in our youth garros made a worldwide reputation by attaining nineteen thousand feet and it was considered a remarkable achievement to fly over the alps  our standard now has been immeasurably raised and there are twenty high flights for one in former years  many of them have been undertaken with impunity  the thirtythousandfoot level has been reached time after time with no discomfort beyond cold and asthma  what does this prove  a visitor might descend upon this planet a thousand times and never see a tiger  yet tigers exist and if he chanced to come down into a jungle he might be devoured  there are jungles of the upper air and there are worse things than tigers which inhabit them  i believe in time they will map these jungles accurately out  even at the present moment i could name two of them  one of them lies over the pau biarritz district of france  another is just over my head as i write here in my house in wiltshire  i rather think there is a third in the homburgwiesbaden district  it was the disappearance of the airmen that first set me thinking  of course every one said that they had fallen into the sea but that did not satisfy me at all  first there was verrier in france his machine was found near bayonne but they never got his body  there was the case of baxter also who vanished though his engine and some of the iron fixings were found in a wood in leicestershire  in that case dr middleton of amesbury who was watching the flight with a telescope declares that just before the clouds obscured the view he saw the machine which was at an enormous height suddenly rise perpendicularly upwards in a succession of jerks in a manner that he would have thought to be impossible  that was the last seen of baxter  there was a correspondence in the papers but it never led to anything  there were several other similar cases and then there was the death of hay connor what a cackle there was about an unsolved mystery of the air and what columns in the halfpenny papers and yet how little was ever done to get to the bottom of the business  he came down in a tremendous volplane from an unknown height  he never got off his machine and died in his pilots seat  died of what  heart disease said the doctors  rubbish hay connors heart was as sound as mine is  what did venables say venables was the only man who was at his side when he died  he said that he was shivering and looked like a man who had been badly scared  died of fright said venables but could not imagine what he was frightened about  only said one word to venables which sounded like monstrous they could make nothing of that at the inquest  but i could make something of it  monsters  that was the last word of poor harry hay connor  and he did die of fright just as venables thought  and then there was myrtles head  do you really believedoes anybody really believethat a mans head could be driven clean into his body by the force of a fall  well perhaps it may be possible but i for one have never believed that it was so with myrtle  and the grease upon his clothesall slimy with grease said somebody at the inquest  queer that nobody got thinking after that  i didbut then i had been thinking for a good long time  ive made three ascentshow dangerfield used to chaff me about my shotgunbut ive never been high enough now with this new light paul veroner machine and its one hundred and seventyfive robur i should easily touch the thirty thousand tomorrow ill have a shot at the record  maybe i shall have a shot at something else as well  of course its dangerous  if a fellow wants to avoid danger he had best keep out of flying altogether and subside finally into flannel slippers and a dressinggown  but ill visit the airjungle to morrowand if theres anything there i shall know it  if i return ill find myself a bit of a celebrity  if i dont this notebook may explain what i am trying to do and how i lost my life in doing it  but no drivel about accidents or mysteries if you please  i chose my paul veroner monoplane for the job  theres nothing like a monoplane when real work is to be done  beaumont found that out in very early days  for one thing it doesnt mind damp and the weather looks as if we should be in the clouds all the time  its a bonny little model and answers my hand like a tendermouthed horse  the engine is a ten cylinder rotary robur working up to one hundred and seventyfive  it has all the modern improvementsenclosed fuselage highcurved landing skids brakes gyroscopic steadiers and three speeds worked by an alteration of the angle of the planes upon the venetianblind principle i took a shotgun with me and a dozen cartridges filled with buckshot you should have seen the face of perkins my old mechanic when i directed him to put them in  i was dressed like an arctic explorer with two jerseys under my overalls thick socks inside my padded boots a stormcap with flaps and my talc goggles  it was stifling outside the hangars but i was going for the summit of the himalayas and had to dress for the part  perkins knew there was something on and implored me to take him with me  perhaps i should if i were using the biplane but a monoplane is a oneman showif you want to get the last foot of lift out of it  of course i took an oxygen bag the man who goes for the altitude record without one will either be frozen or smotheredor both  i had a good look at the planes the rudderbar and the elevating lever before i got in  everything was in order so far as i could see  then i switched on my engine and found that she was running sweetly  when they let her go she rose almost at once upon the lowest speed  i circled my home field once or twice just to warm her up and then with a wave to perkins and the others i flattened out my planes and put her on her highest  she skimmed like a swallow down wind for eight or ten miles until i turned her nose up a little and she began to climb in a great spiral for the cloudbank above me  its allimportant to rise slowly and adapt yourself to the pressure as you go  it was a close warm day for an english september and there was the hush and heaviness of impending rain  now and then there came sudden puffs of wind from the southwestone of them so gusty and unexpected that it caught me napping and turned me halfround for an instant  i remember the time when gusts and whirls and airpockets used to be things of dangerbefore we learned to put an overmastering power into our engines  just as i reached the cloudbanks with the altimeter marking three thousand down came the rain  my word how it poured  it drummed upon my wings and lashed against my face blurring my glasses so that i could hardly see  i got down on to a low speed for it was painful to travel against it  as i got higher it became hail and i had to turn tail to it  one of my cylinders was out of actiona dirty plug i should imagine but still i was rising steadily with plenty of power after a bit the trouble passed whatever it was and i heard the full deepthroated purrthe ten singing as one  thats where the beauty of our modern silencers comes in  we can at last control our engines by ear  how they squeal and squeak and sob when they are in trouble  all those cries for help were wasted in the old days when every sound was swallowed up by the monstrous racket of the machine  if only the early aviators could come back to see the beauty and perfection of the mechanism which have been bought at the cost of their lives  about ninethirty i was nearing the clouds  down below me all blurred and shadowed with rain lay the vast expanse of salisbury plain  halfa dozen flying machines were doing hackwork at the thousandfoot level looking like little black swallows against the green background  i dare say they were wondering what i was doing up in cloudland  suddenly a grey curtain drew across beneath me and the wet folds of vapour were swirling round my face  it was clammily cold and miserable  but i was above the hailstorm and that was something gained  the cloud was as dark and thick as a london fog  in my anxiety to get clear i cocked her nose up until the automatic alarmbell rang and i actually began to slide backwards  my sopped and dripping wings had made me heavier than i thought but presently i was in lighter cloud and soon had cleared the first layer  there was a secondopalcoloured and fleecyat a great height above my head a white unbroken ceiling above and a dark unbroken floor below with the monoplane labouring upwards upon a vast spiral between them  it is deadly lonely in these cloudspaces  once a great flight of some small waterbirds went past me flying very fast to the westwards  the quick whirr of their wings and their musical cry were cheery to my ear  i fancy that they were teal but i am a wretched zoologist  now that we humans have become birds we must really learn to know our brethren by sight  the wind down beneath me whirled and swayed the broad cloudplain  once a great eddy formed in it a whirlpool of vapour and through it as down a funnel i caught sight of the distant world  a large white biplane was passing at a vast depth beneath me  i fancy it was the morning mail service betwixt bristol and london  then the drift swirled inwards again and the great solitude was unbroken  just after ten i touched the lower edge of the upper cloudstratum  it consisted of fine diaphanous vapour drifting swiftly from the westward the wind had been steadily rising all this time and it was now blowing a sharp breezetwentyeight an hour by my gauge  already it was very cold though my altimeter only marked nine thousand  the engines were working beautifully and we went droning steadily upwards  the cloud bank was thicker than i had expected but at last it thinned out into a golden mist before me and then in an instant i had shot out from it and there was an unclouded sky and a brilliant sun above my headall blue and gold above all shining silver below one vast glimmering plain as far as my eyes could reach  it was a quarter past ten oclock and the barograph needle pointed to twelve thousand eight hundred  up i went and up my ears concentrated upon the deep purring of my motor my eyes busy always with the watch the revolution indicator the petrol lever and the oil pump  no wonder aviators are said to be a fearless race  with so many things to think of there is no time to trouble about oneself about this time i noted how unreliable is the compass when above a certain height from earth  at fifteen thousand feet mine was pointing east and a point south  the sun and the wind gave me my true bearings  i had hoped to reach an eternal stillness in these high altitudes but with every thousand feet of ascent the gale grew stronger  my machine groaned and trembled in every joint and rivet as she faced it and swept away like a sheet of paper when i banked her on the turn skimming down wind at a greater pace perhaps than ever mortal man has moved  yet i had always to turn again and tack up in the winds eye for it was not merely a height record that i was after  by all my calculations it was above little wiltshire that my airjungle lay and all my labour might be lost if i struck the outer layers at some farther point  when i reached the nineteenthousandfoot level which was about midday the wind was so severe that i looked with some anxiety to the stays of my wings expecting momentarily to see them snap or slacken  i even cast loose the parachute behind me and fastened its hook into the ring of my leathern belt so as to be ready for the worst  now was the time when a bit of scamped work by the mechanic is paid for by the life of the aeronaut  but she held together bravely  every cord and strut was humming and vibrating like so many harpstrings but it was glorious to see how for all the beating and the buffeting she was still the conqueror of nature and the mistress of the sky  there is surely something divine in man himself that he should rise so superior to the limitations which creation seemed to imposerise too by such unselfish heroic devotion as this airconquest has shown  talk of human degeneration  when has such a story as this been written in the annals of our race  these were the thoughts in my head as i climbed that monstrous inclined plane with the wind sometimes beating in my face and sometimes whistling behind my ears while the cloudland beneath me fell away to such a distance that the folds and hummocks of silver had all smoothed out into one flat shining plain  but suddenly i had a horrible and unprecedented experience  i have known before what it is to be in what our neighbours have called a tourbillon but never on such a scale as this  that huge sweeping river of wind of which i have spoken had as it appears whirlpools within it which were as monstrous as itself  without a moments warning i was dragged suddenly into the heart of one  i spun round for a minute or two with such velocity that i almost lost my senses and then fell suddenly left wing foremost down the vacuum funnel in the centre  i dropped like a stone and lost nearly a thousand feet  it was only my belt that kept me in my seat and the shock and breathlessness left me hanging halfinsensible over the side of the fuselage  but i am always capable of a supreme effortit is my one great merit as an aviator  i was conscious that the descent was slower the whirlpool was a cone rather than a funnel and i had come to the apex  with a terrific wrench throwing my weight all to one side i levelled my planes and brought her head away from the wind  in an instant i had shot out of the eddies and was skimming down the sky  then shaken but victorious i turned her nose up and began once more my steady grind on the upward spiral  i took a large sweep to avoid the danger spot of the whirlpool and soon i was safely above it  just after one oclock i was twentyone thousand feet above the sealevel  to my great joy i had topped the gale and with every hundred feet of ascent the air grew stiller  on the other hand it was very cold and i was conscious of that peculiar nausea which goes with rarefaction of the air  for the first time i unscrewed the mouth of my oxygen bag and took an occasional whiff of the glorious gas  i could feel it running like a cordial through my veins and i was exhilarated almost to the point of drunkenness  i shouted and sang as i soared upwards into the cold still outer world  it is very clear to me that the insensibility which came upon glaisher and in a lesser degree upon coxwell when in 1862 they ascended in a balloon to the height of thirty thousand feet was due to the extreme speed with which a perpendicular ascent is made  doing it at an easy gradient and accustoming oneself to the lessened barometric pressure by slow degrees there are no such dreadful symptoms  at the same great height i found that even without my oxygen inhaler i could breathe without undue distress  it was bitterly cold however and my thermometer was at zero fahrenheit  at onethirty i was nearly seven miles above the surface of the earth and still ascending steadily  i found however that the rarefied air was giving markedly less support to my planes and that my angle of ascent had to be considerably lowered in consequence  it was already clear that even with my light weight and strong enginepower there was a point in front of me where i should be held  to make matters worse one of my sparkingplugs was in trouble again and there was intermittent missfiring in the engine  my heart was heavy with the fear of failure  it was about that time that i had a most extraordinary experience something whizzed past me in a trail of smoke and exploded with a loud hissing sound sending forth a cloud of steam  for the instant i could not imagine what had happened  then i remembered that the earth is for ever being bombarded by meteor stones and would be hardly inhabitable were they not in nearly every case turned to vapour in the outer layers of the atmosphere  here is a new danger for the highaltitude man for two others passed me when i was nearing the fortythousandfoot mark  i cannot doubt that at the edge of the earths envelope the risk would be a very real one  my barograph needle marked fortyone thousand three hundred when i became aware that i could go no farther  physically the strain was not as yet greater than i could bear but my machine had reached its limit the attenuated air gave no firm support to the wings and the least tilt developed into sideslip while she seemed sluggish on her controls possibly had the engine been at its best another thousand feet might have been within our capacity but it was still missfiring and two out of the ten cylinders appeared to be out of action  if i had not already reached the zone for which i was searching then i should never see it upon this journey  but was it not possible that i had attained it soaring in circles like a monstrous hawk upon the fortythousandfoot level i let the monoplane guide herself and with my mannheim glass i made a careful observation of my surroundings  the heavens were perfectly clear there was no indication of those dangers which i had imagined  i have said that i was soaring in circles  it struck me suddenly that i would do well to take a wider sweep and open up a new airtract  if the hunter entered an earthjungle he would drive through it if he wished to find his game  my reasoning had led me to believe that the airjungle which i had imagined lay somewhere over wiltshire  this should be to the south and west of me  i took my bearings from the sun for the compass was hopeless and no trace of earth was to be seennothing but the distant silver cloudplain  however i got my direction as best i might and kept her head straight to the mark  i reckoned that my petrol supply would not last for more than another hour or so but i could afford to use it to the last drop since a single magnificent volplane could at any time take me to the earth  suddenly i was aware of something new  the air in front of me had lost its crystal clearness  it was full of long ragged wisps of something which i can only compare to very fine cigarettesmoke  it hung about in wreaths and coils turning and twisting slowly in the sunlight  as the monoplane shot through it i was aware of a faint taste of oil upon my lips and there was a greasy scum upon the woodwork of the machine  some infinitely fine organic matter appeared to be suspended in the atmosphere  there was no life there  it was inchoate and diffuse extending for many square acres and then fringing off into the void  no it was not life  but might it not be the remains of life  above all might it not be the food of life of monstrous life even as the humble grease of the ocean is the food for the mighty whale  the thought was in my mind when my eyes looked upwards and i saw the most wonderful vision that ever man has seen  can i hope to convey it to you even as i saw it myself last thursday  conceive a jellyfish such as sails in our summer seas bellshaped and of enormous sizefar larger i should judge than the dome of st pauls  it was of a light pink colour veined with a delicate green but the whole huge fabric so tenuous that it was but a fairy outline against the dark blue sky  it pulsated with a delicate and regular rhythm  from it there depended two long drooping green tentacles which swayed slowly backwards and forwards  this gorgeous vision passed gently with noiseless dignity over my head as light and fragile as a soapbubble and drifted upon its stately way  i had halfturned my monoplane that i might look after this beautiful creature when in a moment i found myself amidst a perfect fleet of them of all sizes but none so large as the first  some were quite small but the majority about as big as an average balloon and with much the same curvature at the top  there was in them a delicacy of texture and colouring which reminded me of the finest venetian glass  pale shades of pink and green were the prevailing tints but all had a lovely iridescence where the sun shimmered through their dainty forms  some hundreds of them drifted past me a wonderful fairy squadron of strange unknown argosies of the skycreatures whose forms and substance were so attuned to these pure heights that one could not conceive anything so delicate within actual sight or sound of earth  but soon my attention was drawn to a new phenomenonthe serpents of the outer air  these were long thin fantastic coils of vapourlike material which turned and twisted with great speed flying round and round at such a pace that the eyes could hardly follow them  some of these ghostlike creatures were twenty or thirty feet long but it was difficult to tell their girth for their outline was so hazy that it seemed to fade away into the air around them  these airsnakes were of a very light grey or smoke colour with some darker lines within which gave the impression of a definite organism  one of them whisked past my very face and i was conscious of a cold clammy contact but their composition was so unsubstantial that i could not connect them with any thought of physical danger any more than the beautiful belllike creatures which had preceded them  there was no more solidity in their frames than in the floating spume from a broken wave  but a more terrible experience was in store for me  floating downwards from a great height there came a purplish patch of vapour small as i saw it first but rapidly enlarging as it approached me until it appeared to be hundreds of square feet in size  though fashioned of some transparent jellylike substance it was none the less of much more definite outline and solid consistence than anything which i had seen before  there were more traces too of a physical organization especially two vast shadowy circular plates upon either side which may have been eyes and a perfectly solid white projection between them which was as curved and cruel as the beak of a vulture  the whole aspect of this monster was formidable and threatening and it kept changing its colour from a very light mauve to a dark angry purple so thick that it cast a shadow as it drifted between my monoplane and the sun  on the upper curve of its huge body there were three great projections which i can only describe as enormous bubbles and i was convinced as i looked at them that they were charged with some extremely light gas which served to buoyup the misshapen and semisolid mass in the rarefied air  the creature moved swiftly along keeping pace easily with the monoplane and for twenty miles or more it formed my horrible escort hovering over me like a bird of prey which is waiting to pounce its method of progressiondone so swiftly that it was not easy to followwas to throw out a long glutinous streamer in front of it which in turn seemed to draw forward the rest of the writhing body  so elastic and gelatinous was it that never for two successive minutes was it the same shape and yet each change made it more threatening and loathsome than the last  i knew that it meant mischief  every purple flush of its hideous body told me so  the vague goggling eyes which were turned always upon me were cold and merciless in their viscid hatred  i dipped the nose of my monoplane downwards to escape it  as i did so as quick as a flash there shot out a long tentacle from this mass of floating blubber and it fell as light and sinuous as a whiplash across the front of my machine  there was a loud hiss as it lay for a moment across the hot engine and it whisked itself into the air again while the huge flat body drew itself together as if in sudden pain  i dipped to a volpique but again a tentacle fell over the monoplane and was shorn off by the propeller as easily as it might have cut through a smoke wreath  a long gliding sticky serpentlike coil came from behind and caught me round the waist dragging me out of the fuselage  i tore at it my fingers sinking into the smooth gluelike surface and for an instant i disengaged myself but only to be caught round the boot by another coil which gave me a jerk that tilted me almost on to my back  as i fell over i blazed off both barrels of my gun though indeed it was like attacking an elephant with a peashooter to imagine that any human weapon could cripple that mighty bulk  and yet i aimed better than i knew for with a loud report one of the great blisters upon the creatures back exploded with the puncture of the buckshot  it was very clear that my conjecture was right and that these vast clear bladders were distended with some lifting gas for in an instant the huge cloud like body turned sideways writhing desperately to find its balance while the white beak snapped and gaped in horrible fury  but already i had shot away on the steepest glide that i dared to attempt my engine still full on the flying propeller and the force of gravity shooting me downwards like an aerolite  far behind me i saw a dull purplish smudge growing swiftly smaller and merging into the blue sky behind it  i was safe out of the deadly jungle of the outer air  once out of danger i throttled my engine for nothing tears a machine to pieces quicker than running on full power from a height  it was a glorious spiral volplane from nearly eight miles of altitudefirst to the level of the silver cloudbank then to that of the stormcloud beneath it and finally in beating rain to the surface of the earth  i saw the bristol channel beneath me as i broke from the clouds but having still some petrol in my tank i got twenty miles inland before i found myself stranded in a field half a mile from the village of ashcombe  there i got three tins of petrol from a passing motorcar and at ten minutes past six that evening i alighted gently in my own home meadow at devizes after such a journey as no mortal upon earth has ever yet taken and lived to tell the tale  i have seen the beauty and i have seen the horror of the heightsand greater beauty or greater horror than that is not within the ken of man  and now it is my plan to go once again before i give my results to the world  my reason for this is that i must surely have something to show by way of proof before i lay such a tale before my fellowmen  it is true that others will soon follow and will confirm what i have said and yet i should wish to carry conviction from the first  those lovely iridescent bubbles of the air should not be hard to capture  they drift slowly upon their way and the swift monoplane could intercept their leisurely course  it is likely enough that they would dissolve in the heavier layers of the atmosphere and that some small heap of amorphous jelly might be all that i should bring to earth with me  and yet something there would surely be by which i could substantiate my story yes i will go even if i run a risk by doing so  these purple horrors would not seem to be numerous  it is probable that i shall not see one if i do i shall dive at once  at the worst there is always the shotgun and my knowledge of     here a page of the manuscript is unfortunately missing  on the next page is written in large straggling writing  fortythree thousand feet  i shall never see earth again  they are beneath me three of them  god help me it is a dreadful death to die  such in its entirety is the joycearmstrong statement  of the man nothing has since been seen  pieces of his shattered monoplane have been picked up in the preserves of mr buddlushington upon the borders of kent and sussex within a few miles of the spot where the notebook was discovered  if the unfortunate aviators theory is correct that this air jungle as he called it existed only over the southwest of england then it would seem that he had fled from it at the full speed of his monoplane but had been overtaken and devoured by these horrible creatures at some spot in the outer atmosphere above the place where the grim relics were found  the picture of that monoplane skimming down the sky with the nameless terrors flying as swiftly beneath it and cutting it off always from the earth while they gradually closed in upon their victim is one upon which a man who valued his sanity would prefer not to dwell  there are many as i am aware who still jeer at the facts which i have here set down but even they must admit that joycearmstrong has disappeared and i would commend to them his own words this notebook may explain what i am trying to do and how i lost my life in doing it but no drivel about accidents or mysteries if you please     vi  borrowed scenes      it cannot be done  people really would not stand it  i know because    i have triedextract from an unpublished paper upon george borrow    and his writings  yes i tried and my experience may interest other people  you must imagine then that i am soaked in george borrow especially in his lavengro and his romany rye that i have modelled both my thoughts my speech and my style very carefully upon those of the master and that finally i set forth one summer day actually to lead the life of which i had read  behold me then upon the country road which leads from the railwaystation to the sussex village of swinehurst  as i walked i entertained myself by recollections of the founders of sussex of cerdic that mighty searover and of ella his son said by the bard to be taller by the length of a spearhead than the tallest of his fellows  i mentioned the matter twice to peasants whom i met upon the road  one a tallish man with a freckled face sidled past me and ran swiftly towards the station  the other a smaller and older man stood entranced while i recited to him that passage of the saxon chronicle which begins then came leija with longships fortyfour and the fyrd went out against him  i was pointing out to him that the chronicle had been written partly by the monks of saint albans and afterwards by those of peterborough but the fellow sprang suddenly over a gate and disappeared  the village of swinehurst is a straggling line of halftimbered houses of the early english pattern  one of these houses stood as i observed somewhat taller than the rest and seeing by its appearance and by the sign which hung before it that it was the village inn i approached it for indeed i had not broken my fast since i had left london  a stoutish man five foot eight perhaps in height with black coat and trousers of a greyish shade stood outside and to him i talked in the fashion of the master  why a rose and why a crown i asked as i pointed upwards  he looked at me in a strange manner  the mans whole appearance was strange  why not he answered and shrank a little backwards  the sign of a king said i  surely said he  what else should we understand from a crown  and which king i asked  you will excuse me said he and tried to pass  which king i repeated  how should i know he asked  you should know by the rose said i which is the symbol of that tudor aptudor who coming from the mountains of wales yet seated his posterity upon the english throne  tudor i continued getting between the stranger and the door of the inn through which he appeared to be desirous of passing was of the same blood as owen glendower the famous chieftain who is by no means to be confused with owen gwynedd the father of madoc of the sea of whom the bard made the famous cnylyn which runs in the welsh as follows  i was about to repeat the famous stanza of dafyddapgwilyn when the man who had looked very fixedly and strangely at me as i spoke pushed past me and entered the inn  truly said i aloud it is surely swinehurst to which i have come since the same means the grove of the hogs  so saying i followed the fellow into the bar parlour where i perceived him seated in a corner with a large chair in front of him  four persons of various degrees were drinking beer at a central table whilst a small man of active build in a black shiny suit which seemed to have seen much service stood before the empty fireplace  him i took to be the landlord and i asked him what i should have for my dinner  he smiled and said that he could not tell  but surely my friend said i you can tell me what is ready  even that i cannot do he answered but i doubt not that the landlord can inform us  on this he rang the bell and a fellow answered to whom i put the same question  what would you have he asked  i thought of the master and i ordered a cold leg of pork to be washed down with tea and beer  did you say tea and beer asked the landlord  i did  for twentyfive years have i been in business said the landlord and never before have i been asked for tea and beer  the gentleman is joking said the man with the shining coat  or else said the elderly man in the corner  or what sir i asked  nothing said henothing  there was something very strange in this man in the cornerhim to whom i had spoken of dafyddapgwilyn  then you are joking said the landlord  i asked him if he had read the works of my master george borrow  he said that he had not  i told him that in those five volumes he would not from cover to cover find one trace of any sort of a joke  he would also find that my master drank tea and beer together  now it happens that about tea i have read nothing either in the sagas or in the bardic cnylynions but whilst the landlord had departed to prepare my meal i recited to the company those icelandic stanzas which praise the beer of gunnar the longhaired son of harold the bear  then lest the language should be unknown to some of them i recited my own translation ending with the line     if the beer be small then let the mug be large  i then asked the company whether they went to church or to chapel  the question surprised them and especially the strange man in the corner upon whom i now fixed my eye  i had read his secret and as i looked at him he tried to shrink behind the clockcase  the church or the chapel i asked him  the church he gasped  which church i asked  he shrank farther behind the clock  i have never been so questioned he cried  i showed him that i knew his secret rome was not built in a day said i  he he he cried  then as i turned away he put his head from behind the clockcase and tapped his forehead with his forefinger  so also did the man with the shiny coat who stood before the empty fireplace  having eaten the cold leg of porkwhere is there a better dish save only boiled mutton with capersand having drunk both the tea and the beer i told the company that such a meal had been called to box harry by the master who had observed it to be in great favour with commercial gentlemen out of liverpool  with this information and a stanza or two from lopez de vega i left the inn of the rose and crown behind me having first paid my reckoning  at the door the landlord asked me for my name and address  and why i asked  lest there should be inquiry for you said the landlord  but why should they inquire for me  ah who knows said the landlord musing  and so i left him at the door of the inn of the rose and crown whence came i observed a great tumult of laughter  assuredly thought i rome was not built in a day  having walked down the main street of swinehurst which as i have observed consists of halftimbered buildings in the ancient style i came out upon the country road and proceeded to look for those wayside adventures which are according to the master as thick as blackberries for those who seek them upon an english highway  i had already received some boxing lessons before leaving london so it seemed to me that if i should chance to meet some traveller whose size and age seemed such as to encourage the venture i would ask him to strip off his coat and settle any differences which we could find in the old english fashion  i waited therefore by a stile for any one who should chance to pass and it was while i stood there that the screaming horror came upon me even as it came upon the master in the dingle  i gripped the bar of the stile which was of good british oak  oh who can tell the terrors of the screaming horror  that was what i thought as i grasped the oaken bar of the stile  was it the beeror was it the tea  or was it that the landlord was right and that other the man with the black shiny coat he who had answered the sign of the strange man in the corner  but the master drank tea with beer  yes but the master also had the screaming horror  all this i thought as i grasped the bar of british oak which was the top of the stile  for half an hour the horror was upon me  then it passed and i was left feeling very weak and still grasping the oaken bar  i had not moved from the stile where i had been seized by the screaming horror when i heard the sound of steps behind me and turning round i perceived that a pathway led across the field upon the farther side of the stile  a woman was coming towards me along this pathway and it was evident to me that she was one of those gipsy rias of whom the master has said so much  looking beyond her i could see the smoke of a fire from a small dingle which showed where her tribe were camping  the woman herself was of a moderate height neither tall nor short with a face which was much sunburned and freckled  i must confess that she was not beautiful but i do not think that anyone save the master has found very beautiful women walking about upon the highroads of england  such as she was i must make the best of her and well i knew how to address her for many times had i admired the mixture of politeness and audacity which should be used in such a case  therefore when the woman had come to the stile i held out my hand and helped her over  what says the spanish poet calderon said i  i doubt not that you have read the couplet which has been thus englished     oh maiden may i humbly pray    that i may help you on your way  the woman blushed but said nothing  where i asked are the romany chals and the romany chis  she turned her head away and was silent  though i am a gorgio said i i know something of the romany lil and to prove it i sang the stanza     coliko coliko saulo wer    apopli to the farming ker    will wel and mang him mullo    will wel and mang his truppo  the girl laughed but said nothing  it appeared to me from her appearance that she might be one of those who make a living at telling fortunes or dukkering as the master calls it at racecourses and other gatherings of the sort  do you dukker i asked  she slapped me on the arm  well you are a pot of ginger said she  i was pleased at the slap for it put me in mind of the peerless belle you can use long melford said i an expression which with the master meant fighting  get along with your sauce said she and struck me again  you are a very fine young woman said i and remind me of grunelda the daughter of hjalmar who stole the golden bowl from the king of the islands  she seemed annoyed at this  you keep a civil tongue young man said she  i meant no harm belle  i was but comparing you to one of whom the saga says her eyes were like the shine of sun upon icebergs  this seemed to please her for she smiled  my name aint belle she said at last  what is your name  henrietta  the name of a queen i said aloud  go on said the girl  of charless queen said i of whom waller the poet for the english also have their poets though in this respect far inferior to the basquesof whom i say waller the poet said     that she was queen was the creators act    belated man could but endorse the fact  i say cried the girl  how you do go on  so now said i since i have shown you that you are a queen you will surely give me a choomerthis being a kiss in romany talk  ill give you one on the earhole she cried  then i will wrestle with you said i  if you should chance to put me down i will do penance by teaching you the armenian alphabetthe very word alphabet as you will perceive shows us that our letters came from greece  if on the other hand i should chance to put you down you will give me a choomer  i had got so far and she was climbing the stile with some pretence of getting away from me when there came a van along the road belonging as i discovered to a baker in swinehurst  the horse which was of a brown colour was such as is bred in the new forest being somewhat under fifteen hands and of a hairy illkempt variety  as i know less than the master about horses i will say no more of this horse save to repeat that its colour was brownnor indeed had the horse or the horses colour anything to do with my narrative  i might add however that it could either be taken as a small horse or as a large pony being somewhat tall for the one but undersized for the other  i have now said enough about this horse which has nothing to do with my story and i will turn my attention to the driver  this was a man with a broad florid face and brown sidewhiskers  he was of a stout build and had rounded shoulders with a small mole of a reddish colour over his left eyebrow  his jacket was of velveteen and he had large ironshod boots which were perched upon the splashboard in front of him  he pulled up the van as he came up to the stile near which i was standing with the maiden who had come from the dingle and in a civil fashion he asked me if i could oblige him with a light for his pipe  then as i drew a matchbox from my pocket he threw his reins over the splashboard and removing his large ironshod boots he descended on to the road  he was a burly man but inclined to fat and scant of breath  it seemed to me that it was a chance for one of those wayside boxing adventures which were so common in the olden times  it was my intention that i should fight the man and that the maiden from the dingle standing by me should tell me when to use my right or my left as the case might be picking me up also in case i should be so unfortunate as to be knocked down by the man with the ironshod boots and the small mole of a reddish colour over his left eyebrow  do you use long melford i asked  he looked at me in some surprise and said that any mixture was good enough for him  by long melford said i i do not mean as you seem to think some form of tobacco but i mean that art and science of boxing which was held in such high esteem by our ancestors that some famous professors of it such as the great gully have been elected to the highest offices of the state  there were men of the highest character amongst the bruisers of england of whom i would particularly mention tom of hereford better known as tom spring though his fathers name as i have been given to understand was winter  this however has nothing to do with the matter in hand which is that you must fight me  the man with the florid face seemed very much surprised at my words so that i cannot think that adventures of this sort were as common as i had been led by the master to expect  fight said he  what about  it is a good old english custom said i by which we may determine which is the better man  ive nothing against you said he  nor i against you i answered  so that we will fight for love which was an expression much used in olden days  it is narrated by harold sygvynson that among the danes it was usual to do so even with battle axes as is told in his second set of runes  therefore you will take off your coat and fight  as i spoke i stripped off my own  the mans face was less florid than before  im not going to fight said he  indeed you are i answered and this young woman will doubtless do you the service to hold your coat  youre clean balmy said henrietta  besides said i if you will not fight me for love perhaps you will fight me for this and i held out a sovereign  will you hold his coat i said to henrietta  ill hold the thick un said she  no you dont said the man and put the sovereign into the pocket of his trousers which were of a corduroy material  now said he what am i to do to earn this  fight said i  how do you do it he asked  put up your hands i answered  he put them up as i had said and stood there in a sheepish manner with no idea of anything further  it seemed to me that if i could make him angry he would do better so i knocked off his hat which was black and hard of the kind which is called billycock  heh guvnor he cried what are you up to  that was to make you angry said i  well i am angry said he  then here is your hat said i and afterwards we shall fight  i turned as i spoke to pick up his hat which had rolled behind where i was standing  as i stooped to reach it i received such a blow that i could neither rise erect nor yet sit down  this blow which i received as i stooped for his billycock hat was not from his fist but from his iron shod boot the same which i had observed upon the splashboard  being unable either to rise erect or yet to sit down i leaned upon the oaken bar of the stile and groaned loudly on account of the pain of the blow which i had received  even the screaming horror had given me less pain than this blow from the ironshod boot  when at last i was able to stand erect i found that the floridfaced man had driven away with his cart which could no longer be seen  the maiden from the dingle was standing at the other side of the stile and a ragged man was running across the field from the direction of the fire  why did you not warn me henrietta i asked  i hadnt time said she  why were you such a chump as to turn your back on him like that  the ragged man had reached us where i stood talking to henrietta by the stile  i will not try to write his conversation as he said it because i have observed that the master never condescends to dialect but prefers by a word introduced here and there to show the fashion of a mans speech  i will only say that the man from the dingle spoke as did the anglosaxons who were wont as is clearly shown by the venerable bede to call their leaders enjist and orsa two words which in their proper meaning signify a horse and a mare  what did he hit you for asked the man from the dingle  he was exceedingly ragged with a powerful frame a lean brown face and an oaken cudgel in his hand  his voice was very hoarse and rough as is the case with those who live in the open air  the bloke hit you said he what did the bloke hit you for  he asked him to said henrietta  asked him toasked him what  why he asked him to hit him  gave him a thick un to do it  the ragged man seemed surprised  see here govnor said he  if youre collectin i could let you have one halfprice  he took me unawares said i  what else would the bloke do when you bashed his hat said the maiden from the dingle  by this time i was able to straighten myself up by the aid of the oaken bar which formed the top of the stile  having quoted a few lines of the chinese poet lotunan to the effect that however hard a knock might be it might always conceivably be harder i looked about for my coat but could by no means find it  henrietta i said what have you done with my coat  look here govnor said the man from the dingle not so much henrietta if its the same to you  this womans my wife  who are you to call her henrietta  i assured the man from the dingle that i had meant no disrespect to his wife  i had thought she was a mort said i but the ria of a romany chal is always sacred to me  clean balmy said the woman  some other day said i i may visit you in your camp in the dingle and read you the masters book about the romanys  whats romanys asked the man  myself  romanys are gipsies  the man  we aint gipsies  myself  what are you then  the man  we are hoppers  myself to henrietta  then how did you understand all i have said to you about gipsies  henrietta  i didnt  i again asked for my coat but it was clear now that before offering to fight the floridfaced man with the mole over his left eyebrow i must have hung my coat upon the splashboard of his van  i therefore recited a verse from ferideddinatar the persian poet which signifies that it is more important to preserve your skin than your clothes and bidding farewell to the man from the dingle and his wife i returned into the old english village of swinehurst where i was able to buy a secondhand coat which enabled me to make my way to the station where i should start for london  i could not but remark with some surprise that i was followed to the station by many of the villagers together with the man with the shiny coat and that other the strange man he who had slunk behind the clockcase  from time to time i turned and approached them hoping to fall into conversation with them but as i did so they would break and hasten down the road  only the village constable came on and he walked by my side and listened while i told him the history of hunyadi janos and the events which occurred during the wars between that hero known also as corvinus or the crowlike and mahommed the second he who captured constantinople better known as byzantium before the christian epoch  together with the constable i entered the station and seating myself in a carriage i took paper from my pocket and i began to write upon the paper all that had occurred to me in order that i might show that it was not easy in these days to follow the example of the master as i wrote i heard the constable talk to the stationmaster a stout middlesized man with a red necktie and tell him of my own adventures in the old english village of swinehurst  he is a gentleman too said the constable and i doubt not that he lives in a big house in london town  a very big house if every man had his rights said the stationmaster and waving his hand he signalled that the train should proceed     vii  the surgeon of gaster fell   ihow the woman came to kirkbymalhouse   bleak and windswept is the little town of kirkbymalhouse harsh and forbidding are the fells upon which it stands  it stretches in a single line of greystone slateroofed houses dotted down the furzeclad slope of the rolling moor  in this lonely and secluded village i james upperton found myself in the summer of 85  little as the hamlet had to offer it contained that for which i yearned above all thingsseclusion and freedom from all which might distract my mind from the high and weighty subjects which engaged it  but the inquisitiveness of my landlady made my lodgings undesirable and i determined to seek new quarters  as it chanced i had in one of my rambles come upon an isolated dwelling in the very heart of these lonely moors which i at once determined should be my own  it was a tworoomed cottage which had once belonged to some shepherd but had long been deserted and was crumbling rapidly to ruin  in the winter floods the gaster beck which runs down gaster fell where the little dwelling stood had overswept its banks and torn away a part of the wall  the roof was in ill case and the scattered slates lay thick amongst the grass  yet the main shell of the house stood firm and true and it was no great task for me to have all that was amiss set right  the two rooms i laid out in a widely different mannermy own tastes are of a spartan turn and the outer chamber was so planned as to accord with them  an oilstove by rippingille of birmingham furnished me with the means of cooking while two great bags the one of flour and the other of potatoes made me independent of all supplies from without  in diet i had long been a pythagorean so that the scraggy longlimbed sheep which browsed upon the wiry grass by the gaster beck had little to fear from their new companion  a ninegallon cask of oil served me as a sideboard while a square table a deal chair and a trucklebed completed the list of my domestic fittings  at the head of my couch hung two unpainted shelvesthe lower for my dishes and cooking utensils the upper for the few portraits which took me back to the little that was pleasant in the long wearisome toiling for wealth and for pleasure which had marked the life i had left behind  if this dwellingroom of mine were plain even to squalor its poverty was more than atoned for by the luxury of the chamber which was destined to serve me as my study  i had ever held that it was best for my mind to be surrounded by such objects as would be in harmony with the studies which occupied it and that the loftiest and most ethereal conditions of thought are only possible amid surroundings which please the eye and gratify the senses  the room which i had set apart for my mystic studies was set forth in a style as gloomy and majestic as the thoughts and aspirations with which it was to harmonise  both walls and ceilings were covered with a paper of the richest and glossiest black on which was traced a lurid and arabesque pattern of dead gold  a black velvet curtain covered the single diamondpaned window while a thick yielding carpet of the same material prevented the sound of my own footfalls as i paced backward and forward from breaking the current of my thought along the cornices ran gold rods from which depended six pictures all of the sombre and imaginative caste which chimed best with my fancy  and yet it was destined that ere ever i reached this quiet harbour i should learn that i was still one of humankind and that it is an ill thing to strive to break the bond which binds us to our fellows  it was but two nights before the date i had fixed upon for my change of dwelling when i was conscious of a bustle in the house beneath with the bearing of heavy burdens up the creaking stair and the harsh voice of my landlady loud in welcome and protestations of joy  from time to time amid the whirl of words i could hear a gentle and softly modulated voice which struck pleasantly upon my ear after the long weeks during which i had listened only to the rude dialect of the dalesmen  for an hour i could hear the dialogue beneaththe high voice and the low with clatter of cup and clink of spoon until at last a light quick step passed my study door and i knew that my new fellow lodger had sought her room  on the morning after this incident i was up betimes as is my wont but i was surprised on glancing from my window to see that our new inmate was earlier still  she was walking down the narrow pathway which zigzags over the fella tall woman slender her head sunk upon her breast her arms filled with a bristle of wild flowers which she had gathered in her morning rambles  the white and pink of her dress and the touch of deep red ribbon in her broad drooping hat formed a pleasant dash of colour against the duntinted landscape  she was some distance off when i first set eyes upon her yet i knew that this wandering woman could be none other than our arrival of last night for there was a grace and refinement in her bearing which marked her from the dwellers of the fells  even as i watched she passed swiftly and lightly down the pathway and turning through the wicket gate at the further end of our cottage garden she seated herself upon the green bank which faced my window and strewing her flowers in front of her set herself to arrange them  as she sat there with the rising sun at her back and the glow of the morning spreading like an aureole around her stately and wellpoised head i could see that she was a woman of extraordinary personal beauty her face was spanish rather than english in its typeoval olive with black sparkling eyes and a sweetly sensitive mouth  from under the broad straw hat two thick coils of blueblack hair curved down on either side of her graceful queenly neck  i was surprised as i watched her to see that her shoes and skirt bore witness to a journey rather than to a mere morning ramble  her light dress was stained wet and bedraggled while her boots were thick with the yellow soil of the fells  her face too wore a weary expression and her young beauty seemed to be clouded over by the shadow of inward trouble  even as i watched her she burst suddenly into wild weeping and throwing down her bundle of flowers ran swiftly into the house  distrait as i was and weary of the ways of the world i was conscious of a sudden pang of sympathy and grief as i looked upon the spasm of despair which seemed to convulse this strange and beautiful woman  i bent to my books and yet my thoughts would ever turn to her proud clearcut face her weatherstained dress her drooping head and the sorrow which lay in each line and feature of her pensive face  mrs adams my landlady was wont to carry up my frugal breakfast yet it was very rarely that i allowed her to break the current of my thoughts or to draw my mind by her idle chatter from weightier things  this morning however for once she found me in a listening mood and with little prompting proceeded to pour into my ears all that she knew of our beautiful visitor  miss eva cameron be her name sir she said but who she be or where she came fra i know little more than yoursel  maybe it was the same reason that brought her to kirkbymalhouse as fetched you there yoursel sir  possibly said i ignoring the covert question but i should hardly have thought that kirkbymalhouse was a place which offered any great attractions to a young lady  heh sir she cried theres the wonder of it  the leddy has just come fra france and how her folk come to learn of me is just a wonder  a week ago up comes a man to my doora fine man sir and a gentleman as one could see with half an eye  you are mrs adams says he  i engage your rooms for miss cameron says he  she will be here in a week says he and then off without a word of terms  last night there comes the young leddy herselsoftspoken and downcast with a touch of the french in her speech  but my sakes sir  i must away and mak her some tea for shell feel lonesomelike poor lamb when she wakes under a strange roof    iihow i went forth to gaster fell   i was still engaged upon my breakfast when i heard the clatter of dishes and the landladys footfall as she passed toward her new lodgers room an instant afterward she had rushed down the passage and burst in upon me with uplifted hand and startled eyes  lord a mercy sir she cried and asking your pardon for troubling you but im feared o the young leddy sir she is not in her room  why there she is said i standing up and glancing through the casement  she has gone back for the flowers she left upon the bank  oh sir see her boots and her dress cried the landlady wildly  i wish her mother was here siri do  where she has been is more than i ken but her bed has not been lain on this night  she has felt restless doubtless and went for a walk though the hour was certainly a strange one  mrs adams pursed her lip and shook her head  but then as she stood at the casement the girl beneath looked smilingly up at her and beckoned to her with a merry gesture to open the window  have you my tea there she asked in a rich clear voice with a touch of the mincing french accent  it is in your room miss  look at my boots mrs adams she cried thrusting them out from under her skirt  these fells of yours are dreadful placeseffroyableone inch two inch never have i seen such mud  my dress toovoila  eh miss but you are in a pickle cried the landlady as she gazed down at the bedraggled gown  but you must be main weary and heavy for sleep  no no she answered laughingly i care not for sleep  what is sleep it is a little deathvoila tout  but for me to walk to run to beathe the airthat is to live  i was not tired and so all night i have explored these fells of yorkshire  lord a mercy miss and where did you go asked mrs adams  she waved her hand round in a sweeping gesture which included the whole western horizon  there she cried  o comme elles sont tristes et sauvages ces collines  but i have flowers here  you will give me water will you not  they will wither else  she gathered her treasures in her lap and a moment later we heard her light springy footfall upon the stair  so she had been out all night this strange woman  what motive could have taken her from her snug room on to the bleak windswept hills could it be merely the restlessness the love of adventure of a young girl  or was there possibly some deeper meaning in this nocturnal journey  deep as were the mysteries which my studies had taught me to solve here was a human problem which for the moment at least was beyond my comprehension  i had walked out on the moor in the forenoon and on my return as i topped the brow that overlooks the little town i saw my fellowlodger some little distance off among the gorse  she had raised a light easel in front of her and with papered board laid across it was preparing to paint the magnificent landscape of rock and moor which stretched away in front of her  as i watched her i saw that she was looking anxiously to right and left  close by me a pool of water had formed in a hollow  dipping the cup of my pocketflask into it i carried it across to her  miss cameron i believe said i  i am your fellowlodger  upperton is my name  we must introduce ourselves in these wilds if we are not to be for ever strangers  oh then you live also with mrs adams she cried  i had thought that there were none but peasants in this strange place  i am a visitor like yourself i answered  i am a student and have come for quiet and repose which my studies demand  quiet indeed said she glancing round at the vast circle of silent moors with the one tiny line of grey cottages which sloped down beneath us  and yet not quiet enough i answered laughing for i have been forced to move further into the fells for the absolute peace which i require  have you then built a house upon the fells she asked arching her eyebrows  i have and hope within a few days to occupy it  ah but that is triste she cried  and where is it then this house which you have built  it is over yonder i answered  see that stream which lies like a silver band upon the distant moor  it is the gaster beck and it runs through gaster fell  she started and turned upon me her great dark questioning eyes with a look in which surprise incredulity and something akin to horror seemed to be struggling for mastery  and you will live on the gaster fell she cried  so i have planned  but what do you know of gaster fell miss cameron i asked  i had thought that you were a stranger in these parts  indeed i have never been here before she answered  but i have heard my brother talk of these yorkshire moors and if i mistake not i have heard him name this very one as the wildest and most savage of them all  very likely said i carelessly  it is indeed a dreary place  then why live there she cried eagerly  consider the loneliness the barrenness the want of all comfort and of all aid should aid be needed  aid  what aid should be needed on gaster fell  she looked down and shrugged her shoulders  sickness may come in all places said she  if i were a man i do not think i would live alone on gaster fell  i have braved worse dangers than that said i laughing but i fear that your picture will be spoiled for the clouds are banking up and already i feel a few raindrops  indeed it was high time we were on our way to shelter for even as i spoke there came the sudden steady swish of the shower  laughing merrily my companion threw her light shawl over her head and seizing picture and easel ran with the lithe grace of a young fawn down the furzeclad slope while i followed after with campstool and paintbox        it was the eve of my departure from kirkbymalhouse that we sat upon the green bank in the garden she with dark dreamy eyes looking sadly out over the sombre fells while i with a book upon my knee glanced covertly at her lovely profile and marvelled to myself how twenty years of life could have stamped so sad and wistful an expression upon it  you have read much i remarked at last  women have opportunities now such as their mothers never knew  have you ever thought of going furtheror seeking a course of college or even a learned profession  she smiled wearily at the thought  i have no aim no ambition she said  my future is blackconfuseda chaos  my life is like to one of these paths upon the fells  you have seen them monsieur upperton  they are smooth and straight and clear where they begin but soon they wind to left and wind to right and so mid rocks and crags until they lose themselves in some quagmire  at brussels my path was straight but now mon dieu who is there can tell me where it leads  it might take no prophet to do that miss cameron quoth i with the fatherly manner which twoscore years may show toward one  if i may read your life i would venture to say that you were destined to fulfil the lot of womento make some good man happy and to shed around in some wider circle the pleasure which your society has given me since first i knew you  i will never marry said she with a sharp decision which surprised and somewhat amused me  not marryand why  a strange look passed over her sensitive features and she plucked nervously at the grass on the bank beside her  i dare not said she in a voice that quivered with emotion  dare not  it is not for me  i have other things to do  that path of which i spoke is one which i must tread alone  but this is morbid said i  why should your lot miss cameron be separate from that of my own sisters or the thousand other young ladies whom every season brings out into the world  but perhaps it is that you have a fear and distrust of mankind  marriage brings a risk as well as a happiness  the risk would be with the man who married me she cried  and then in an instant as though she had said too much she sprang to her feet and drew her mantle round her  the night air is chill mr upperton said she and so swept swiftly away leaving me to muse over the strange words which had fallen from her lips  clearly it was time that i should go  i set my teeth and vowed that another day should not have passed before i should have snapped this newly formed tie and sought the lonely retreat which awaited me upon the moors  breakfast was hardly over in the morning before a peasant dragged up to the door the rude handcart which was to convey my few personal belongings to my new dwelling  my fellowlodger had kept her room and steeled as my mind was against her influence i was yet conscious of a little throb of disappointment that she should allow me to depart without a word of farewell  my handcart with its load of books had already started and i having shaken hands with mrs adams was about to follow it when there was a quick scurry of feet on the stair and there she was beside me all panting with her own haste  then you goyou really go said she  my studies call me  and to gaster fell she asked  yes to the cottage which i have built there  and you will live alone there  with my hundred companions who lie in that cart  ah books she cried with a pretty shrug of her graceful shoulders but you will make me a promise  what is it i asked in surprise  it is a small thing  you will not refuse me  you have but to ask it  she bent forward her beautiful face with an expression of the most intense earnestness  you will bolt your door at night said she and was gone ere i could say a word in answer to her extraordinary request  it was a strange thing for me to find myself at last duly installed in my lonely dwelling  for me now the horizon was bounded by the barren circle of wiry unprofitable grass patched over with furze bushes and scarred by the profusion of natures gaunt and granite ribs  a duller wearier waste i have never seen but its dullness was its very charm  and yet the very first night which i spent at gaster fell there came a strange incident to lead my thoughts back once more to the world which i had left behind me  it had been a sullen and sultry evening with great livid cloudbanks mustering in the west  as the night wore on the air within my little cabin became closer and more oppressive  a weight seemed to rest upon my brow and my chest  from far away the low rumble of thunder came moaning over the moor  unable to sleep i dressed and standing at my cottage door looked on the black solitude which surrounded me  taking the narrow sheep path which ran by this stream i strolled along it for some hundred yards and had turned to retrace my steps when the moon was finally buried beneath an inkblack cloud and the darkness deepened so suddenly that i could see neither the path at my feet the stream upon my right nor the rocks upon my left  i was standing groping about in the thick gloom when there came a crash of thunder with a flash of lightning which lighted up the whole vast fell so that every bush and rock stood out clear and hard in the vivid light  it was but for an instant and yet that momentary view struck a thrill of fear and astonishment through me for in my very path not twenty yards before me there stood a woman the livid light beating upon her face and showing up every detail of her dress and features  there was no mistaking those dark eyes that tall graceful figure  it was sheeva cameron the woman whom i thought i had for ever left  for an instant i stood petrified marvelling whether this could indeed be she or whether it was some figment conjured up by my excited brain  then i ran swiftly forward in the direction where i had seen her calling loudly upon her but without reply  again i called and again no answer came back save the melancholy wail of the owl  a second flash illuminated the landscape and the moon burst out from behind its cloud but i could not though i climbed upon a knoll which overlooked the whole moor see any sign of this strange midnight wanderer  for an hour or more i traversed the fell and at last found myself back at my little cabin still uncertain as to whether it had been a woman or a shadow upon which i gazed    iiiof the grey cottage in the glen   it was either on the fourth or the fifth day after i had taken possession of my cottage that i was astonished to hear footsteps upon the grass outside quickly followed by a crack as from a stick upon the door  the explosion of an infernal machine would hardly have surprised or discomfited me more  i had hoped to have shaken off all intrusion for ever yet here was somebody beating at my door with as little ceremony as if it had been a village alehouse  hot with anger i flung down my book and withdrew the bolt just as my visitor had raised his stick to renew his rough application for admittance  he was a tall powerful man tawny bearded and deepchested clad in a loosefitting suit of tweed cut for comfort rather than elegance  as he stood in the shimmering sunlight i took in every feature of his face  the large fleshy nose the steady blue eyes with their thick thatch of overhanging brows the broad forehead all knitted and lined with furrows which were strangely at variance with his youthful bearing  in spite of his weatherstained felt hat and the coloured handkerchief slung round his muscular brown neck i could see at a glance he was a man of breeding and education  i had been prepared for some wandering shepherd or uncouth tramp but this apparition fairly disconcerted me  you look astonished said he with a smile  did you think then that you were the only man in the world with a taste for solitude  you see that there are other hermits in the wilderness besides yourself  do you mean to say that you live here i asked in no conciliatory voice  up yonder he answered tossing his head backward  i thought as we were neighbours mr upperton that i could not do less than look in and see if i could assist you in any way  thank you i said coldly standing with my hand upon the latch of the door  i am a man of simple tastes and you can do nothing for me  you have the advantage of me in knowing my name  he appeared to be chilled by my ungracious manner  i learned it from the masons who were at work here he said  as for me i am a surgeon the surgeon of gaster fell  that is the name i have gone by in these parts and it serves as well as another  not much room for practice here i observed  not a soul except yourself for miles on either side  you appear to have had need of some assistance yourself i remarked glancing at a broad white splash as from the recent action of some powerful acid upon his sunburnt cheek  that is nothing he answered curtly turning his face half round to hide the mark  i must get back for i have a companion who is waiting for me  if i can ever do anything for you pray let me know  you have only to follow the beck upward for a mile or so to find my place  have you a bolt on the inside of your door  yes i answered rather startled at this question  keep it bolted then he said  the fell is a strange place  you never know who may be about  it is as well to be on the safe side goodbye  he raised his hat turned on his heel and lounged away along the bank of the little stream  i was still standing with my hand upon the latch gazing after my unexpected visitor when i became aware of yet another dweller in the wilderness  some distance along the path which the stranger was taking there lay a great grey boulder and leaning against this was a small wizened man who stood erect as the other approached and advanced to meet him  the two talked for a minute or more the taller man nodding his head frequently in my direction as though describing what had passed between us  then they walked on together and disappeared in a dip of the fell  presently i saw them ascending once more some rising ground farther on  my acquaintance had thrown his arm round his elderly friend either from affection or from a desire to aid him up the steep incline the square burly figure and its shrivelled meagre companion stood out against the skyline and turning their faces they looked back at me  at the sight i slammed the door lest they should be encouraged to return but when i peeped from the window some minutes afterward i perceived that they were gone  all day i bent over the egyptian papyrus upon which i was engaged but neither the subtle reasonings of the ancient philosopher of memphis nor the mystic meaning which lay in his pages could raise my mind from the things of earth  evening was drawing in before i threw my work aside in despair  my heart was bitter against this man for his intrusion standing by the beck which purled past the door of my cabin i cooled my heated brow and thought the matter over  clearly it was the small mystery hanging over these neighbours of mine which had caused my mind to run so persistently on them  that cleared up they would no longer cause an obstacle to my studies  what was to hinder me then from walking in the direction of their dwelling and observing for myself without permitting them to suspect my presence what manner of men they might be doubtless their mode of life would be found to admit of some simple and prosaic explanation  in any case the evening was fine and a walk would be bracing for mind and body  lighting my pipe i set off over the moors in the direction which they had taken  about halfway down a wild glen there stood a small clump of gnarled and stunted oak trees  from behind these a thin dark column of smoke rose into the still evening air  clearly this marked the position of my neighbours house  trending away to the left i was able to gain the shelter of a line of rocks and so reach a spot from which i could command a view of the building without exposing myself to any risk of being observed  it was a small slatecovered cottage hardly larger than the boulders among which it lay  like my own cabin it showed signs of having been constructed for the use of some shepherd but unlike mine no pains had been taken by the tenants to improve and enlarge it two little peeping windows a cracked and weatherbeaten door and a discoloured barrel for catching the rain water were the only external objects from which i might draw deductions as to the dwellers within  yet even in these there was food for thought for as i drew nearer still concealing myself behind the ridge i saw that thick bars of iron covered the windows while the old door was slashed and plated with the same metal  these strange precautions together with the wild surroundings and unbroken solitude gave an indescribably ill omen and fearsome character to the solitary building  thrusting my pipe into my pocket i crawled upon my hands and knees through the gorse and ferns until i was within a hundred yards of my neighbours door  there finding that i could not approach nearer without fear of detection i crouched down and set myself to watch  i had hardly settled into my hiding place when the door of the cottage swung open and the man who had introduced himself to me as the surgeon of gaster fell came out bareheaded with a spade in his hands  in front of the door there was a small cultivated patch containing potatoes peas and other forms of green stuff and here he proceeded to busy himself trimming weeding and arranging singing the while in a powerful though not very musical voice  he was all engrossed in his work with his back to the cottage when there emerged from the halfopen door the same attenuated creature whom i had seen in the morning  i could perceive now that he was a man of sixty wrinkled bent and feeble with sparse grizzled hair and long colourless face  with a cringing sidelong gait he shuffled toward his companion who was unconscious of his approach until he was close upon him  his light footfall or his breathing may have finally given notice of his proximity for the worker sprang round and faced him  each made a quick step toward the other as though in greeting and theneven now i feel the horror of the instantthe tall man rushed upon and knocked his companion to the earth then whipping up his body ran with great speed over the intervening ground and disappeared with his burden into the house  case hardened as i was by my varied life the suddenness and violence of the thing made me shudder  the mans age his feeble frame his humble and deprecating manner all cried shame against the deed  so hot was my anger that i was on the point of striding up to the cabin unarmed as i was when the sound of voices from within showed me that the victim had recovered  the sun had sunk beneath the horizon and all was grey save a red feather in the cap of pennigent  secure in the failing light i approached near and strained my ears to catch what was passing  i could hear the high querulous voice of the elder man and the deep rough monotone of his assailant mixed with a strange metallic jangling and clanking  presently the surgeon came out locked the door behind him and stamped up and down in the twilight pulling at his hair and brandishing his arms like a man demented  then he set off walking rapidly up the valley and i soon lost sight of him among the rocks  when his footsteps had died away in the distance i drew nearer to the cottage  the prisoner within was still pouring forth a stream of words and moaning from time to time like a man in pain  these words resolved themselves as i approached into prayersshrill voluble prayers pattered forth with the intense earnestness of one who sees impending an imminent danger  there was to me something inexpressibly awesome in this gush of solemn entreaty from the lonely sufferer meant for no human ear and jarring upon the silence of the night  i was still pondering whether i should mix myself in the affair or not when i heard in the distance the sound of the surgeons returning footfall  at that i drew myself up quickly by the iron bars and glanced in through the diamondpaned window the interior of the cottage was lighted up by a lurid glow coming from what i afterward discovered to be a chemical furnace  by its rich light i could distinguish a great litter of retorts test tubes and condensers which sparkled over the table and threw strange grotesque shadows on the wall  on the further side of the room was a wooden framework resembling a hencoop and in this still absorbed in prayer knelt the man whose voice i heard  the red glow beating upon his upturned face made it stand out from the shadow like a painting from rembrandt showing up every wrinkle upon the parchmentlike skin  i had but time for a fleeting glance then dropping from the window i made off through the rocks and the heather nor slackened my pace until i found myself back in my cabin once more  there i threw myself upon my couch more disturbed and shaken than i had ever thought to feel again  such doubts as i might have had as to whether i had indeed seen my former fellowlodger upon the night of the thunderstorm were resolved the next morning  strolling along down the path which led to the fell i saw in one spot where the ground was soft the impressions of a footthe small dainty foot of a wellbooted woman  that tiny heel and high instep could have belonged to none other than my companion of kirkbymalhouse  i followed her trail for some distance till it still pointed as far as i could discern it to the lonely and illomened cottage  what power could there be to draw this tender girl through wind and rain and darkness across the fearsome moors to that strange rendezvous  i have said that a little beck flowed down the valley and past my very door  a week or so after the doings which i have described i was seated by my window when i perceived something white drifting slowly down the stream  my first thought was that it was a drowning sheep but picking up my stick i strolled to the bank and hooked it ashore  on examination it proved to be a large sheet torn and tattered with the initials j c in the corner  what gave it its sinister significance however was that from hem to hem it was all dabbled and discoloured  shutting the door of my cabin i set off up the glen in the direction of the surgeons cabin  i had not gone far before i perceived the very man himself  he was walking rapidly along the hillside beating the furze bushes with a cudgel and bellowing like a madman  indeed at the sight of him the doubts as to his sanity which had arisen in my mind were strengthened and confirmed  as he approached i noticed that his left arm was suspended in a sling  on perceiving me he stood irresolute as though uncertain whether to come over to me or not  i had no desire for an interview with him however so i hurried past him on which he continued on his way still shouting and striking about with his club  when he had disappeared over the fells i made my way down to his cottage determined to find some clue to what had occurred  i was surprised on reaching it to find the iron plated door flung wide open  the ground immediately outside it was marked with the signs of a struggle  the chemical apparatus within and the furniture were all dashed about and shattered  most suggestive of all the sinister wooden cage was stained with bloodmarks and its unfortunate occupant had disappeared  my heart was heavy for the little man for i was assured i should never see him in this world more  there was nothing in the cabin to throw any light upon the identity of my neighbours  the room was stuffed with chemical instruments  in one corner a small bookcase contained a choice selection of works of science in another was a pile of geological specimens collected from the limestone  i caught no glimpse of the surgeon upon my homeward journey but when i reached my cottage i was astonished and indignant to find that somebody had entered it in my absence  boxes had been pulled out from under the bed the curtains disarranged the chairs drawn out from the wall  even my study had not been safe from this rough intruder for the prints of a heavy boot were plainly visible on the ebonyblack carpet    ivof the man who came in the night   the night set in gusty and tempestuous and the moon was all girt with ragged clouds  the wind blew in melancholy gusts sobbing and sighing over the moor and setting all the gorse bushes agroaning  from time to time a little sputter of rain pattered up against the windowpane  i sat until near midnight glancing over the fragment on immortality by iamblichus the alexandrian platonist of whom the emperor julian said that he was posterior to plato in time but not in genius  at last shutting up my book i opened my door and took a last look at the dreary fell and still more dreary sky  as i protruded my head a swoop of wind caught me and sent the red ashes of my pipe sparkling and dancing through the darkness  at the same moment the moon shone brilliantly out from between two clouds and i saw sitting on the hillside not two hundred yards from my door the man who called himself the surgeon of gaster fell  he was squatted among the heather his elbows upon his knees and his chin resting upon his hands as motionless as a stone with his gaze fixed steadily upon the door of my dwelling  at the sight of this illomened sentinel a chill of horror and of fear shot through me for his gloomy and mysterious associations had cast a glamour round the man and the hour and place were in keeping with his sinister presence  in a moment however a manly glow of resentment and selfconfidence drove this petty emotion from my mind and i strode fearlessly in his direction  he rose as i approached and faced me with the moon shining on his grave bearded face and glittering on his eyeballs  what is the meaning of this i cried as i came upon him what right have you to play the spy on me  i could see the flush of anger rise on his face  your stay in the country has made you forget your manners he said  the moor is free to all  you will say next that my house is free to all i said hotly  you have had the impertience to ransack it in my absence this afternoon  he started and his features showed the most intense excitement  i swear to you that i had no hand in it he cried  i have never set foot in your house in my life  oh sir sir if you will but believe me there is a danger hanging over you and you would do well to be careful  i have had enough of you i said  i saw that cowardly blow you struck when you thought no human eye rested upon you  i have been to your cottage too and know all that it has to tell  if there is a law in england you shall hang for what you have done  as to me i am an old soldier sir and i am armed  i shall not fasten my door  but if you or any other villain attempt to cross my threshold it shall be at your own risk  with these words i swung round upon my heel and strode into my cabin  for two days the wind freshened and increased with constant squalls of rain until on the third night the most furious storm was raging which i can ever recollect in england  i felt that it was positively useless to go to bed nor could i concentrate my mind sufficiently to read a book  i turned my lamp half down to moderate the glare and leaning back in my chair i gave myself up to reverie  i must have lost all perception of time for i have no recollection how long i sat there on the borderland betwixt thought and slumber  at last about 3 or possibly 4 oclock i came to myself with a startnot only came to myself but with every sense and nerve upon the strain  looking round my chamber in the dim light i could not see anything to justify my sudden trepidation  the homely room the rainblurred window and the rude wooden door were all as they had been  i had begun to persuade myself that some halfformed dream had sent that vague thrill through my nerves when in a moment i became conscious of what it was  it was a soundthe sound of a human step outside my solitary cottage  amid the thunder and the rain and the wind i could hear ita dull stealthy footfall now on the grass now on the stonesoccasionally stopping entirely then resumed and ever drawing nearer  i sat breathlessly listening to the eerie sound  it had stopped now at my very door and was replaced by a panting and gasping as of one who has travelled fast and far  by the flickering light of the expiring lamp i could see that the latch of my door was twitching as though a gentle pressure was exerted on it from without  slowly slowly it rose until it was free of the catch and then there was a pause of a quarter minute or more while i still eat silent with dilated eyes and drawn sabre  then very slowly the door began to revolve upon its hinges and the keen air of the night came whistling through the slit  very cautiously it was pushed open so that never a sound came from the rusty hinges  as the aperture enlarged i became aware of a dark shadowy figure upon my threshold and of a pale face that looked in at me  the features were human but the eyes were not  they seemed to burn through the darkness with a greenish brilliancy of their own and in their baleful shifty glare i was conscious of the very spirit of murder  springing from my chair i had raised my naked sword when with a wild shouting a second figure dashed up to my door at its approach my shadowy visitant uttered a shrill cry and fled away across the fells yelping like a beaten hound  tingling with my recent fear i stood at my door peering through the night with the discordant cry of the fugitives still ringing in my ears at that moment a vivid flash of lightning illuminated the whole landscape and made it as clear as day  by its light i saw far away upon the hillside two dark figures pursuing each other with extreme rapidity across the fells  even at that distance the contrast between them forbid all doubt as to their identity  the first was the small elderly man whom i had supposed to be dead the second was my neighbour the surgeon for an instant they stood out clear and hard in the unearthly light in the next the darkness had closed over them and they were gone  as i turned to reenter my chamber my foot rattled against something on my threshold  stooping i found it was a straight knife fashioned entirely of lead and so soft and brittle that it was a strange choice for a weapon  to render it more harmless the top had been cut square off  the edge however had been assiduously sharpened against a stone as was evident from the markings upon it so that it was still a dangerous implement in the grasp of a determined man  and what was the meaning of it all you ask  many a drama which i have come across in my wandering life some as strange and as striking as this one has lacked the ultimate explanation which you demand  fate is a grand weaver of tales but she ends them as a rule in defiance of all artistic laws and with an unbecoming want of regard for literary propriety  as it happens however i have a letter before me as i write which i may add without comment and which will clear all that may remain dark     kirkby lunatic asylum    september 4th 1885     siri am deeply conscious that some apology and explanation is due    to you for the very startling and in your eyes mysterious events    which have recently occurred and which have so seriously interfered    with the retired existence which you desire to lead  i should have    called upon you on the morning after the recapture of my father but    my knowledge of your dislike to visitors and also ofyou will excuse    my saying ityour very violent temper led me to think that it was    better to communicate with you by letter     my poor father was a hardworking general practitioner in birmingham    where his name is still remembered and respected  about ten years ago    he began to show signs of mental aberration which we were inclined to    put down to overwork and the effects of a sunstroke  feeling my own    incompetence to pronounce upon a case of such importance i at once    sought the highest advice in birmingham and london  among others we    consulted the eminent alienist mr fraser brown who pronounced my    fathers case to be intermittent in its nature but dangerous during    the paroxysms  it may take a homicidal or it may take a religious    turn he said or it may prove to be a mixture of both  for months    he may be as well as you or me and then in a moment he may break out    you will incur a great responsibility if you leave him without    supervision     i need say no more sir  you will understand the terrible task which    has fallen upon my poor sister and me in endeavouring to save my    father from the asylum which in his sane moments filled him with    horror  i can only regret that your peace has been disturbed by our    misfortunes and i offer you in my sisters name and my own our    apologies     yours truly    j cameron     viii  how it happened   she was a writing medium  this is what she wrote  i can remember some things upon that evening most distinctly and others are like some vague broken dreams  that is what makes it so difficult to tell a connected story  i have no idea now what it was that had taken me to london and brought me back so late  it just merges into all my other visits to london  but from the time that i got out at the little country station everything is extraordinarily clear  i can live it againevery instant of it  i remember so well walking down the platform and looking at the illuminated clock at the end which told me that it was halfpast eleven i remember also my wondering whether i could get home before midnight then i remember the big motor with its glaring headlights and glitter of polished brass waiting for me outside  it was my new thirtyhorse power robur which had only been delivered that day  i remember also asking perkins my chauffeur how she had gone and his saying that he thought she was excellent  ill try her myself said i and i climbed into the drivers seat  the gears are not the same said he  perhaps sir i had better drive  no i should like to try her said i  and so we started on the fivemile drive for home  my old car had the gears as they used always to be in notches on a bar in this car you passed the gearlever through a gate to get on the higher ones  it was not difficult to master and soon i thought that i understood it  it was foolish no doubt to begin to learn a new system in the dark but one often does foolish things and one has not always to pay the full price for them  i got along very well until i came to claystall hill  it is one of the worst hills in england a mile and a half long and one in six in places with three fairly sharp curves  my park gates stand at the very foot of it upon the main london road  we were just over the brow of this hill where the grade is steepest when the trouble began  i had been on the top speed and wanted to get her on the free but she stuck between gears and i had to get her back on the top again  by this time she was going at a great rate so i clapped on both brakes and one after the other they gave way  i didnt mind so much when i felt my footbrake snap but when i put all my weight on my sidebrake and the lever clanged to its full limit without a catch it brought a cold sweat out of me  by this time we were fairly tearing down the slope  the lights were brilliant and i brought her round the first curve all right  then we did the second one though it was a close shave for the ditch  there was a mile of straight then with the third curve beneath it and after that the gate of the park  if i could shoot into that harbour all would be well for the slope up to the house would bring her to a stand  perkins behaved splendidly  i should like that to be known  he was perfectly cool and alert  i had thought at the very beginning of taking the bank and he read my intention  i wouldnt do it sir said he  at this pace it must go over and we should have it on the top of us  of course he was right  he got to the electric switch and had it off so we were in the free but we were still running at a fearful pace  he laid his hands on the wheel  ill keep her steady said he if you care to jump and chance it  we can never get round that curve  better jump sir  no said i ill stick it out  you can jump if you like  ill stick it with you sir said he  if it had been the old car i should have jammed the gearlever into the reverse and seen what would happen  i expect she would have stripped her gears or smashed up somehow but it would have been a chance  as it was i was helpless  perkins tried to climb across but you couldnt do it going at that pace  the wheels were whirring like a high wind and the big body creaking and groaning with the strain  but the lights were brilliant and one could steer to an inch  i remember thinking what an awful and yet majestic sight we should appear to any one who met us  it was a narrow road and we were just a great roaring golden death to any one who came in our path  we got round the corner with one wheel three feet high upon the bank  i thought we were surely over but after staggering for a moment she righted and darted onwards  that was the third corner and the last one there was only the park gate now  it was facing us but as luck would have it not facing us directly  it was about twenty yards to the left up the main road into which we ran  perhaps i could have done it but i expect that the steeringgear had been jarred when we ran on the bank the wheel did not turn easily  we shot out of the lane  i saw the open gate on the left  i whirled round my wheel with all the strength of my wrists  perkins and i threw our bodies across and then the next instant going at fifty miles an hour my right front wheel struck full on the righthand pillar of my own gate  i heard the crash  i was conscious of flying through the air and thenand then        when i became aware of my own existence once more i was among some brushwood in the shadow of the oaks upon the lodge side of the drive  a man was standing beside me  i imagined at first that it was perkins but when i looked again i saw that it was stanley a man whom i had known at college some years before and for whom i had a really genuine affection there was always something peculiarly sympathetic to me in stanleys personality and i was proud to think that i had some similar influence upon him  at the present moment i was surprised to see him but i was like a man in a dream giddy and shaken and quite prepared to take things as i found them without questioning them  what a smash i said  good lord what an awful smash  he nodded his head and even in the gloom i could see that he was smiling the gentle wistful smile which i connected with him  i was quite unable to move  indeed i had not any desire to try to move but my senses were exceedingly alert  i saw the wreck of the motor lit up by the moving lanterns  i saw the little group of people and heard the hushed voices  there were the lodgekeeper and his wife and one or two more  they were taking no notice of me but were very busy round the car  then suddenly i heard a cry of pain  the weight is on him  lift it easy cried a voice  its only my leg said another one which i recognized as perkinss wheres master he cried  here i am i answered but they did not seem to hear me  they were all bending over something which lay in front of the car  stanley laid his hand upon my shoulder and his touch was inexpressibly soothing  i felt light and happy in spite of all  no pain of course said he  none said i  there never is said he  and then suddenly a wave of amazement passed over me  stanley  stanley why stanley had surely died of enteric at bloemfontein in the boer war  stanley i cried and the words seemed to choke my throatstanley you are dead  he looked at me with the same old gentle wistful smile  so are you he answered     ix  the prisoners defence   the circumstances so far as they were known to the public concerning the death of the beautiful miss ena garnier and the fact that captain john fowler the accused officer had refused to defend himself on the occasion of the proceedings at the policecourt had roused very general interest  this was increased by the statement that though he withheld his defence it would be found to be of a very novel and convincing character  the assertion of the prisoners lawyer at the policecourt to the effect that the answer to the charge was such that it could not yet be given but would be available before the assizes also caused much speculation  a final touch was given to the curiosity of the public when it was learned that the prisoner had refused all offers of legal assistance from counsel and was determined to conduct his own defence the case for the crown was ably presented and was generally considered to be a very damning one since it showed very clearly that the accused was subject to fits of jealousy and that he had already been guilty of some violence owing to this cause  the prisoner listened to the evidence without emotion and neither interrupted nor crossquestioned the witnesses  finally on being informed that the time had come when he might address the jury he stepped to the front of the dock  he was a man of striking appearance swarthy blackmoustached nervous and virile with a quietly confident manner  taking a paper from his pocket he read the following statement which made the deepest impression upon the crowded court  i would wish to say in the first place gentlemen of the jury that owing to the generosity of my brother officersfor my own means are limitedi might have been defended today by the first talent of the bar  the reason i have declined their assistance and have determined to fight my own case is not that i have any confidence in my own abilities or eloquence but it is because i am convinced that a plain straightforward tale coming direct from the man who has been the tragic actor in this dreadful affair will impress you more than any indirect statement could do  if i had felt that i were guilty i should have asked for help  since in my own heart i believe that i am innocent i am pleading my own cause feeling that my plain words of truth and reason will have more weight with you than the most learned and eloquent advocate  by the indulgence of the court i have been permitted to put my remarks upon paper so that i may reproduce certain conversations and be assured of saying neither more nor less than i mean  it will be remembered that at the trial at the policecourt two months ago i refused to defend myself  this has been referred to today as a proof of my guilt  i said that it would be some days before i could open my mouth  this was taken at the time as a subterfuge  well the days are over and i am now able to make clear to you not only what took place but also why it was impossible for me to give any explanation  i will tell you now exactly what i did and why it was that i did it  if you my fellowcountrymen think that i did wrong i will make no complaint but will suffer in silence any penalty which you may impose upon me  i am a soldier of fifteen years standing a captain in the second breconshire battalion  i have served in the south african campaign and was mentioned in despatches after the battle of diamond hill  when the war broke out with germany i was seconded from my regiment and i was appointed as adjutant to the first scottish scouts newly raised  the regiment was quartered at radchurch in essex where the men were placed partly in huts and were partly billeted upon the inhabitants  all the officers were billeted out and my quarters were with mr murreyfield the local squire  it was there that i first met miss ena garnier  it may not seem proper at such a time and place as this that i should describe that lady  and yet her personality is the very essence of my case  let me only say that i cannot believe that nature ever put into female form a more exquisite combination of beauty and intelligence  she was twentyfive years of age blonde and tall with a peculiar delicacy of features and of expression  i have read of people falling in love at first sight and had always looked upon it as an expression of the novelist  and yet from the moment that i saw ena garnier life held for me but the one ambitionthat she should be mine  i had never dreamed before of the possibilities of passion that were within me  i will not enlarge upon the subject but to make you understand my actionfor i wish you to comprehend it however much you may condemn ityou must realize that i was in the grip of a frantic elementary passion which made for a time the world and all that was in it seem a small thing if i could but gain the love of this one girl  and yet in justice to myself i will say that there was always one thing which i placed above her  that was my honour as a soldier and a gentleman  you will find it hard to believe this when i tell you what occurred and yetthough for one moment i forgot myselfmy whole legal offence consists in my desperate endeavour to retrieve what i had done  i soon found that the lady was not insensible to the advances which i made to her  her position in the household was a curious one  she had come a year before from montpellier in the south of france in answer to an advertisement from the murreyfields in order to teach french to their three young children  she was however unpaid so that she was rather a friendly guest than an employee  she had always as i gathered been fond of the english and desirous to live in england but the outbreak of the war had quickened her feelings into passionate attachment for the ruling emotion of her soul was her hatred of the germans  her grandfather as she told me had been killed under very tragic circumstances in the campaign of 1870 and her two brothers were both in the french army  her voice vibrated with passion when she spoke of the infamies of belgium and more than once i have seen her kissing my sword and my revolver because she hoped they would be used upon the enemy  with such feelings in her heart it can be imagined that my wooing was not a difficult one  i should have been glad to marry her at once but to this she would not consent  everything was to come after the war for it was necessary she said that i should go to montpellier and meet her people so that the french proprieties should be properly observed  she had one accomplishment which was rare for a lady she was a skilled motorcyclist  she had been fond of long solitary rides but after our engagement i was occasionally allowed to accompany her  she was a woman however of strange moods and fancies which added in my feelings to the charm of her character  she could be tenderness itself and she could be aloof and even harsh in her manner  more than once she had refused my company with no reason given and with a quick angry flash of her eyes when i asked for one  then perhaps her mood would change and she would make up for this unkindness by some exquisite attention which would in an instant soothe all my ruffled feelings  it was the same in the house  my military duties were so exacting that it was only in the evenings that i could hope to see her and yet very often she remained in the little study which was used during the day for the childrens lessons and would tell me plainly that she wished to be alone  then when she saw that i was hurt by her caprice she would laugh and apologize so sweetly for her rudeness that i was more her slave than ever  mention has been made of my jealous disposition and it has been asserted at the trial that there were scenes owing to my jealousy and that once mrs murreyfield had to interfere  i admit that i was jealous  when a man loves with the whole strength of his soul it is impossible i think that he should be clear of jealousy  the girl was of a very independent spirit  i found that she knew many officers at chelmsford and colchester  she would disappear for hours together upon her motorcycle there were questions about her past life which she would only answer with a smile unless they were closely pressed  then the smile would become a frown  is it any wonder that i with my whole nature vibrating with passionate wholehearted love was often torn by jealousy when i came upon those closed doors of her life which she was so determined not to open  reason came at times and whispered how foolish it was that i should stake my whole life and soul upon one of whom i really knew nothing  then came a wave of passion once more and reason was submerged  i have spoken of the closed doors of her life  i was aware that a young unmarried frenchwoman has usually less liberty than her english sister and yet in the case of this lady it continually came out in her conversation that she had seen and known much of the world  it was the more distressing to me as whenever she had made an observation which pointed to this she would afterwards as i could plainly see be annoyed by her own indiscretion and endeavour to remove the impression by every means in her power  we had several small quarrels on this account when i asked questions to which i could get no answers but they have been exaggerated in the address for the prosecution  too much has been made also of the intervention of mrs murreyfield though i admit that the quarrel was more serious upon that occasion  it arose from my finding the photograph of a man upon her table and her evident confusion when i asked her for some particulars about him  the name h vardin was written underneathevidently an autograph  i was worried by the fact that this photograph had the frayed appearance of one which has been carried secretly about as a girl might conceal the picture of her lover in her dress  she absolutely refused to give me any information about him save to make a statement which i found incredible that it was a man whom she had never seen in her life  it was then that i forgot myself  i raised my voice and declared that i should know more about her life or that i should break with her even if my own heart should be broken in the parting  i was not violent but mrs murreyfield heard me from the passage and came into the room to remonstrate  she was a kind motherly person who took a sympathetic interest in our romance and i remember that on this occasion she reproved me for my jealousy and finally persuaded me that i had been unreasonable so that we became reconciled once more  ena was so madly fascinating and i so hopelessly her slave that she could always draw me back however much prudence and reason warned me to escape from her control  i tried again and again to find out about this man vardin but was always met by the same assurance which she repeated with every kind of solemn oath that she had never seen the man in her life  why she should carry about the photograph of a mana young somewhat sinister man for i had observed him closely before she snatched the picture from my handwas what she either could not or would not explain  then came the time for my leaving radchurch  i had been appointed to a junior but very responsible post at the war office which of course entailed my living in london  even my weekends found me engrossed with my work but at last i had a few days leave of absence  it is those few days which have ruined my life which have brought me the most horrible experience that ever a man had to undergo and have finally placed me here in the dock pleading as i plead today for my life and my honour  it is nearly five miles from the station to radchurch  she was there to meet me  it was the first time that we had been reunited since i had put all my heart and my soul upon her  i cannot enlarge upon these matters gentlemen  you will either be able to sympathize with and understand the emotions which overbalance a man at such a time or you will not  if you have imagination you will  if you have not i can never hope to make you see more than the bare fact  that bare fact placed in the baldest language is that during this drive from radchurch junction to the village i was led into the greatest indiscretionthe greatest dishonour if you willof my life  i told the woman a secret an enormously important secret which might affect the fate of the war and the lives of many thousands of men  it was done before i knew itbefore i grasped the way in which her quick brain could place various scattered hints together and weave them into one idea  she was wailing almost weeping over the fact that the allied armies were held up by the iron line of the germans  i explained that it was more correct to say that our iron line was holding them up since they were the invaders  but is france is belgium never to be rid of them she cried  are we simply to sit in front of their trenches and be content to let them do what they will with ten provinces of france oh jack jack for gods sake say something to bring a little hope to my heart for sometimes i think that it is breaking  you english are stolid  you can bear these things  but we others we have more nerve more soul  it is death to us  tell me  do tell me that there is hope and yet it is foolish of me to ask for of course you are only a subordinate at the war office and how should you know what is in the mind of your chiefs  well as it happens i know a good deal i answered  dont fret for we shall certainly get a move on soon  soon  next year may seem soon to some people  its not next year  must we wait another month  not even that  she squeezed my hand in hers  oh my darling boy you have brought such joy to my heart  what suspense i shall live in now  i think a week of it would kill me  well perhaps it wont even be a week  and tell me she went on in her coaxing voice tell me just one thing jack  just one and i will trouble you no more  is it our brave french soldiers who advance  or is it your splendid tommies  with whom will the honour lie  with both  glorious she cried  i see it all  the attack will be at the point where the french and british lines join  together they will rush forward in one glorious advance  no i said  they will not be together  but i understood you to sayof course women know nothing of such matters but i understood you to say that it would be a joint advance  well if the french advanced we will say at verdun and the british advanced at ypres even if they were hundreds of miles apart it would still be a joint advance  ah i see she cried clapping her hands with delight  they would advance at both ends of the line so that the boches would not know which way to send their reserves  that is exactly the ideaa real advance at verdun and an enormous feint at ypres  then suddenly a chill of doubt seized me  i can remember how i sprang back from her and looked hard into her face  ive told you too much i cried  can i trust you  i have been mad to say so much  she was bitterly hurt by my words  that i should for a moment doubt her was more than she could bear  i would cut my tongue out jack before i would tell any human being one word of what you have said  so earnest was she that my fears died away  i felt that i could trust her utterly before we had reached radchurch i had put the matter from my mind and we were lost in our joy of the present and in our plans for the future  i had a business message to deliver to colonel worral who commanded a small camp at pedleywoodrow  i went there and was away for about two hours  when i returned i inquired for miss garnier and was told by the maid that she had gone to her bedroom and that she had asked the groom to bring her motorbicycle to the door  it seemed to me strange that she should arrange to go out alone when my visit was such a short one  i had gone into her little study to seek her and here it was that i waited for it opened on to the hall passage and she could not pass without my seeing her  there was a small table in the window of this room at which she used to write  i had seated myself beside this when my eyes fell upon a name written in her large bold handwriting  it was a reversed impression upon the blottingpaper which she had used but there could be no difficulty in reading it  the name was hubert vardin  apparently it was part of the address of an envelope for underneath i was able to distinguish the initials sw referring to a postal division of london though the actual name of the street had not been clearly reproduced  then i knew for the first time that she was actually corresponding with this man whose vile voluptuous face i had seen in the photograph with the frayed edges  she had clearly lied to me too for was it conceivable that she should correspond with a man whom she had never seen  i dont desire to condone my conduct  put yourself in my place imagine that you had my desperately fervid and jealous nature  you would have done what i did for you could have done nothing else  a wave of fury passed over me  i laid my hands upon the wooden writingdesk  if it had been an iron safe i should have opened it  as it was it literally flew to pieces before me  there lay the letter itself placed under lock and key for safety while the writer prepared to take it from the house  i had no hesitation or scruple i tore it open dishonourable you will say but when a man is frenzied with jealousy he hardly knows what he does  this woman for whom i was ready to give everything was either faithful to me or she was not  at any cost i would know which  a thrill of joy passed through me as my eyes fell upon the first words  i had wronged her  cher monsieur vardin  so the letter began  it was clearly a business letter nothing else  i was about to replace it in the envelope with a thousand regrets in my mind for my want of faith when a single word at the bottom of the page caught my eyes and i started as if i had been stung by an adder  verdunthat was the word  i looked again  ypres was immediately below it  i sat down horrorstricken by the broken desk and i read this letter a translation of which i have in my hand     murreyfield house radchurch     dear m vardinstringer has told me that he has kept you    sufficiently informed as to chelmsford and colchester so i have not    troubled to write  they have moved the midland territorial brigade    and the heavy guns towards the coast near cromer but only for a time    it is for training not embarkation     and now for my great news which i have straight from the war office    itself  within a week there is to be a very severe attack from    verdun which is to be supported by a holding attack at ypres  it is    all on a very large scale and you must send off a special dutch    messenger to von starmer by the first boat  i hope to get the exact    date and some further particulars from my informant tonight but    meanwhile you must act with energy     i dare not post this hereyou know what village postmasters are so i    am taking it into colchester where stringer will include it with his    own report which goes by handyours faithfully sophia heffner  i was stunned at first as i read this letter and then a kind of cold concentrated rage came over me  so this woman was a german and a spy  i thought of her hypocrisy and her treachery towards me but above all i thought of the danger to the army and the state  a great defeat the death of thousands of men might spring from my misplaced confidence there was still time by judgment and energy to stop this frightful evil  i heard her step upon the stairs outside and an instant later she had come through the doorway  she started and her face was bloodless as she saw me seated there with the open letter in my hand  how did you get that she gasped  how dared you break my desk and steal my letter  i said nothing  i simply sat and looked at her and pondered what i should do  she suddenly sprang forward and tried to snatch the letter  i caught her wrist and pushed her down on to the sofa where she lay collapsed  then i rang the bell and told the maid that i must see mr murreyfield at once  he was a genial elderly man who had treated this woman with as much kindness as if she were his daughter  he was horrified at what i said  i could not show him the letter on account of the secret that it contained but i made him understand that it was of desperate importance  what are we to do he asked  i never could have imagined anything so dreadful  what would you advise us to do  there is only one thing that we can do i answered  this woman must be arrested and in the meanwhile we must so arrange matters that she cannot possibly communicate with any one  for all we know she has confederates in this very village  can you undertake to hold her securely while i go to colonel worral at pedley and get a warrant and a guard  we can lock her in her bedroom  you need not trouble said she  i give you my word that i will stay where i am  i advise you to be careful captain fowler  youve shown once before that you are liable to do things before you have thought of the consequence  if i am arrested all the world will know that you have given away the secrets that were confided to you  there is an end of your career my friend  you can punish me no doubt  what about yourself  i think said i you had best take her to her bedroom  very good if you wish it said she and followed us to the door  when we reached the hall she suddenly broke away dashed through the entrance and made for her motorbicycle which was standing there  before she could start we had both seized her  she stooped and made her teeth meet in murreyfields hand  with flashing eyes and tearing fingers she was as fierce as a wild cat at bay  it was with some difficulty that we mastered her and dragged heralmost carried herup the stairs  we thrust her into her room and turned the key while she screamed out abuse and beat upon the door inside  its a fortyfoot drop into the garden said murreyfield tying up his bleeding hand  ill wait here till you come back  i think we have the lady fairly safe  i have a revolver here said i  you should be armed  i slipped a couple of cartridges into it and held it out to him  we cant afford to take chances  how do you know what friends she may have  thank you said he  i have a stick here and the gardener is within call  do you hurry off for the guard and i will answer for the prisoner  having taken as it seemed to me every possible precaution i ran to give the alarm  it was two miles to pedley and the colonel was out which occasioned some delay  then there were formalities and a magistrates signature to be obtained  a policeman was to serve the warrant but a military escort was to be sent in to bring back the prisoner  i was so filled with anxiety and impatience that i could not wait but i hurried back alone with the promise that they would follow  the pedleywoodrow road opens into the highroad to colchester at a point about half a mile from the village of radchurch  it was evening now and the light was such that one could not see more than twenty or thirty yards ahead  i had proceeded only a very short way from the point of junction when i heard coming towards me the roar of a motorcycle being ridden at a furious pace  it was without lights and close upon me  i sprang aside in order to avoid being ridden down and in that instant as the machine flashed by i saw clearly the face of the rider  it was shethe woman whom i had loved  she was hatless her hair streaming in the wind her face glimmering white in the twilight flying through the night like one of the valkyries of her native land  she was past me like a flash and tore on down the colchester road  in that instant i saw all that it would mean if she could reach the town  if she once was allowed to see her agent we might arrest him or her but it would be too late the news would have been passed on  the victory of the allies and the lives of thousands of our soldiers were at stake  next instant i had pulled out the loaded revolver and fired two shots after the vanishing figure already only a dark blur in the dusk  i heard a scream the crashing of the breaking cycle and all was still  i need not tell you more gentlemen  you know the rest  when i ran forward i found her lying in the ditch  both of my bullets had struck her  one of them had penetrated her brain  i was still standing beside her body when murreyfield arrived running breathlessly down the road she had it seemed with great courage and activity scrambled down the ivy of the wall only when he heard the whirr of the cycle did he realize what had occurred  he was explaining it to my dazed brain when the police and soldiers arrived to arrest her  by the irony of fate it was me whom they arrested instead  it was urged at the trial in the policecourt that jealousy was the cause of the crime  i did not deny it nor did i put forward any witnesses to deny it  it was my desire that they should believe it  the hour of the french advance had not yet come and i could not defend myself without producing the letter which would reveal it  but now it is overgloriously overand so my lips are unsealed at last  i confess my faultmy very grievous fault  but it is not that for which you are trying me  it is for murder  i should have thought myself the murderer of my own countrymen if i had let the woman pass  these are the facts gentlemen  i leave my future in your hands  if you should absolve me i may say that i have hopes of serving my country in a fashion which will atone for this one great indiscretion and will also as i hope end for ever those terrible recollections which weigh me down  if you condemn me i am ready to face whatever you may think fit to inflict     x  three of them   ia chat about children snakes and zebus   these little sketches are called three of them but there are really five on and off the stage  there is daddy a lumpish person with some gift for playing indian games when he is in the mood  he is then known as the great chief of the leatherskin tribe  then there is my lady sunshine  these are the grownups and dont really count  there remain the three who need some differentiating upon paper though their little spirits are as different in reality as spirits could beall beautiful and all quite different  the eldest is a boy of eight whom we shall call laddie  if ever there was a little cavalier sent down readymade it is he  his soul is the most gallant unselfish innocent thing that ever god sent out to get an extra polish upon earth  it dwells in a tall slight wellformed body graceful and agile with a head and face as cleancut as if an old greek cameo had come to life and a pair of innocent and yet wise grey eyes that read and win the heart  he is shy and does not shine before strangers  i have said that he is unselfish and brave  when there is the usual wrangle about going to bed up he gets in his sedate way  i will go first says he and off he goes the eldest that the others may have the few extra minutes while he is in his bath  as to his courage he is absolutely lionhearted where he can help or defend any one else  on one occasion daddy lost his temper with dimples boy number 2 and not without very good provocation gave him a tap on the side of the head  next instant he felt a butt down somewhere in the region of his waistbelt and there was an angry little red face looking up at him which turned suddenly to a brown mop of hair as the butt was repeated  no one not even daddy should hit his little brother  such was laddie the gentle and the fearless  then there is dimples  dimples is nearly seven and you never saw a rounder softer dimplier face with two great roguish mischievous eyes of woodpigeon grey which are sparkling with fun for the most part though they can look sad and solemn enough at times  dimples has the making of a big man in him  he has depth and reserves in his tiny soul but on the surface he is a boy of boys always in innocent mischief  i will now do mischuff he occasionally announces and is usually as good as his word  he has a love and understanding of all living creatures the uglier and more slimy the better treating them all in a tender fairylike fashion which seems to come from some inner knowledge  he has been found holding a buttercup under the mouth of a slug to see if he likes butter  he finds creatures in an astonishing way  put him in the fairest garden and presently he will approach you with a newt a toad or a huge snail in his custody  nothing would ever induce him to hurt them but he gives them what he imagines to be a little treat and then restores them to their homes  he has been known to speak bitterly to the lady when she has given orders that caterpillars be killed if found upon the cabbages and even the explanation that the caterpillars were doing the work of what he calls the jarmans did not reconcile him to their fate  he has an advantage over laddie in that he suffers from no trace of shyness and is perfectly friendly in an instant with any one of every class of life plunging straight into conversation with some such remark as can your daddy give a warwhoop or were you ever chased by a bear  he is a sunny creature but combative sometimes when he draws down his brows sets his eyes his chubby cheeks flush and his lips go back from his almondwhite teeth  i am swankie the berserker says he quoting out of his favourite erling the bold which daddy reads aloud at bedtime  when he is in this fighting mood he can even drive back laddie chiefly because the elder is far too chivalrous to hurt him  if you want to see what laddie can really do put the small gloves on him and let him go for daddy  some of those hurricane rallies of his would stop daddy grinning if they could get home and he has to fall back off his stool in order to get away from them  if that latent power of dimples should ever come out how will it be manifest  surely in his imagination  tell him a story and the boy is lost  he sits with his little round rosy face immovable and fixed while his eyes never budge from those of the speaker  he sucks in everything that is weird or adventurous or wild  laddie is a rather restless soul eager to be up and doing but dimples is absorbed in the present if there be something worth hearing to be heard  in height he is half a head shorter than his brother but rather more sturdy in build the power of his voice is one of his noticeable characteristics  if dimples is coming you know it well in advance  with that physical gift upon the top of his audacity and his loquacity he fairly takes command of any place in which he may find himself while laddie his soul too noble for jealousy becomes one of the laughing and admiring audience  then there is baby a dainty elfin dresdenchina little creature of five as fair as an angel and as deep as a well  the boys are but shallow sparkling pools compared with this little girl with her selfrepression and dainty aloofness  you know the boys you never feel that you quite know the girl  something very strong and forceful seems to be at the back of that wee body  her will is tremendous  nothing can break or even bend it  only kind guidance and friendly reasoning can mould it the boys are helpless if she has really made up her mind  but this is only when she asserts herself and those are rare occasions  as a rule she sits quiet aloof affable keenly alive to all that passes and yet taking no part in it save for some subtle smile or glance  and then suddenly the wonderful greyblue eyes under the long black lashes will gleam like coy diamonds and such a hearty little chuckle will come from her that every one else is bound to laugh out of sympathy  she and dimples are great allies and yet have continual lovers quarrels  one night she would not even include his name in her prayers  god bless every one else but not a word of dimples  come come darling urged the lady  well then god bless horrid dimples said she at last after she had named the cat the goat her dolls and her wriggly  that is a strange trait the love for the wriggly  it would repay thought from some scientific brain  it is an old faded disused downy from her cot  yet go where she will she must take wriggly with her  all her toys put together would not console her for the absence of wriggly if the family go to the seaside wriggly must come too  she will not sleep without the absurd bundle in her arms  if she goes to a party she insists upon dragging its disreputable folds along with her one end always projecting to give it fresh air  every phase of childhood represents to the philosopher something in the history of the race  from the newborn baby which can hang easily by one hand from a broomstick with its legs drawn up under it the whole evolution of mankind is re enacted  you can trace clearly the cavedweller the hunter the scout what then does wriggly represent  fetish worshipnothing else  the savage chooses some most unlikely thing and adores it  this dear little savage adores her wriggly  so now we have our three little figures drawn as clearly as a clumsy pen can follow such subtle elusive creatures of mood and fancy  we will suppose now that it is a summer evening that daddy is seated smoking in his chair that the lady is listening somewhere near and that the three are in a tumbled heap upon the bearskin before the empty fireplace trying to puzzle out the little problems of their tiny lives  when three children play with a new thought it is like three kittens with a ball one giving it a pat and another a pat as they chase it from point to point  daddy would interfere as little as possible save when he was called upon to explain or to deny  it was usually wiser for him to pretend to be doing something else  then their talk was the more natural  on this occasion however he was directly appealed to  daddy asked dimples  yes boy  do you fink that the roses know us  dimples in spite of his impish naughtiness had a way of looking such a perfectly innocent and delightfully kissable little person that one felt he really might be a good deal nearer to the sweet secrets of nature than his elders  however daddy was in a material mood  no boy how could the roses know us  the big yellow rose at the corner of the gate knows me  how do you know that  cause it nodded to me yesterday  laddie roared with laughter  that was just the wind dimples  no it was not said dimples with conviction  there was none wind baby was there  werent you baby  the wose knew us said baby gravely  beasts know us said laddie  but them beasts run round and make noises  roses dont make noises  yes they do  they rustle  woses wustle said baby  thats not a living noise  thats an allthesame noise  different to roy who barks and makes different noises all the time  fancy the roses all barkin at you  daddy will you tell us about animals  that is one of the child stages which takes us back to the old tribe lifetheir inexhaustible interest in animals some distant echo of those long nights when wild men sat round the fires and peered out into the darkness and whispered about all the strange and deadly creatures who fought with them for the lordship of the earth  children love caves and they love fires and meals out of doors and they love animal talkall relics of the far distant past  what is the biggest animal in south america daddy  daddy wearily oh i dont know  i spose an elephant would be the biggest  no boy there are none in south america  well then a rhinoceros  no there are none  well what is there daddy  well dear there are jaguars  i suppose a jaguar is the biggest  then it must be thirtysix feet long  oh no boy about eight or nine feet with his tail  but there are boaconstrictors in south america thirtysix feet long  thats different  do you fink asked dimples with his big solemn grey eyes wide open there was ever a boastrictor fortyfive feet long  no dear i never heard of one  perhaps there was one but you never heard of it  do you fink you would have heard of a boastrictor fortyfive feet long if there was one in south america  well there may have been one  daddy said laddie carrying on the crossexamination with the intense earnestness of a child could a boaconstrictor swallow any small animal  yes of course he could  could he swallow a jaguar  well i dont know about that  a jaguar is a very large animal  well then asked dimples could a jaguar swallow a boastrictor  silly ass said laddie  if a jaguar was only nine feet long and the boaconstrictor was thirtyfive feet long then there would be a lot sticking out of the jaguars mouth  how could he swallow that  hed bite it off said dimples  and then another slice for supper and another for breakfastbut i say daddy a stricter couldnt swallow a porkpine could he  he would have a sore throat all the way down  shrieks of laughter and a welcome rest for daddy who turned to his paper  daddy  he put down his paper with an air of conscious virtue and lit his pipe  well dear  whats the biggest snake you ever saw  oh bother the snakes  i am tired of them  but the children were never tired of them  heredity again for the snake was the worst enemy of arboreal man  daddy made soup out of a snake said laddie  tell us about that snake daddy  children like a story best the fourth or fifth time so it is never any use to tell them that they know all about it  the story which they can check and correct is their favourite  well dear we got a viper and we killed it  then we wanted the skeleton to keep and we didnt know how to get it  at first we thought we would bury it but that seemed too slow  then i had the idea to boil all the vipers flesh off its bones and i got an old meattin and we put the viper and some water into it and put it above the fire  you hung it on a hook daddy  yes we hung it on the hook that they put the porridge pot on in scotland  then just as it was turning brown in came the farmers wife and ran up to see what we were cooking  when she saw the viper she thought we were going to eat it  oh you dirty divils she cried and caught up the tin in her apron and threw it out of the window  fresh shrieks of laughter from the children and dimples repeated you dirty divil until daddy had to clump him playfully on the head  tell us some more about snakes cried laddie  did you ever see a really dreadful snake  one that would turn you black and dead you in five minutes said dimples  it was always the most awful thing that appealed to dimples  yes i have seen some beastly creatures  once in the sudan i was dozing on the sand when i opened my eyes and there was a horrid creature like a big slug with horns short and thick about a foot long moving away in front of me  what was it daddy  six eager eyes were turned up to him  it was a deathadder  i expect that would dead you in five minutes dimples if it got a bite at you  did you kill it  no it was gone before i could get to it  which is the horridest daddya snake or a shark  im not very fond of either  did you ever see a man eaten by sharks  no dear but i was not so far off being eaten myself  oo from all three of them  i did a silly thing for i swam round the ship in water where there are many sharks  as i was drying myself on the deck i saw the high fin of a shark above the water a little way off  it had heard the splashing and come up to look for me  werent you frightened daddy  yes  it made me feel rather cold  there was silence while daddy saw once more the golden sand of the african beach and the snowwhite roaring surf with the long smooth swell of the bar  children dont like silences  daddy said laddie  do zebus bite  zebus  why they are cows  no of course not  but a zebu could butt with its horns  oh yes it could butt  do you think a zebu could fight a crocodile  well i should back the crocodile  why  well dear the crocodile has great teeth and would eat the zebu  but suppose the zebu came up when the crocodile was not looking and butted it  well that would be one up for the zebu  but one butt wouldnt hurt a crocodile  no one wouldnt would it  but the zebu would keep on  crocodiles live on sandbanks dont they  well then the zebu would come and live near the sandbank toojust so far as the crocodile would never see him then every time the crocodile wasnt looking the zebu would butt him dont you think he would beat the crocodile  well perhaps he would  how long do you think it would take the zebu to beat the crocodile  well it would depend upon how often he got in his butt  well suppose he butted him once every three hours dont you think  oh bother the zebu  thats what the crocodile would say cried laddie clapping his hands  well i agree with the crocodile said daddy  and its time all good children were in bed said the lady as the glimmer of the nurses apron was seen in the gloom    iiabout cricket   supper was going on down below and all good children should have been long ago in the land of dreams  yet a curious noise came from above  what on earth asked daddy  laddie practising cricket said the lady with the curious clairvoyance of motherhood  he gets out of bed to bowl  i do wish you would go up and speak seriously to him about it for it takes quite an hour off his rest  daddy departed upon his mission intending to be gruff and my word he can be quite gruff when he likes  when he reached the top of the stairs however and heard the noise still continue he walked softly down the landing and peeped in through the halfopened door  the room was dark save for a nightlight  in the dim glimmer he saw a little whiteclad figure slight and supple taking short steps and swinging its arm in the middle of the room  halloa said daddy  the whiteclad figure turned and ran forward to him  oh daddy how jolly of you to come up  daddy felt that gruffness was not quite so easy as it had seemed  look here  you get into bed he said with the best imitation he could manage  yes daddy  but before i go how is this  he sprang forward and the arm swung round again in a swift and graceful gesture  daddy was a motheaten cricketer of sorts and he took it in with a critical eye  good laddie  i like a high action  thats the real spofforth swing  oh daddy come and talk about cricket  he was pulled on the side of the bed and the white figure dived between the sheets  yes tell us about cwicket came a cooing voice from the corner dimples was sitting up in his cot  you naughty boy  i thought one of you was asleep anyhow  i mustnt stay  i keep you awake  who was popoff cried laddie clutching at his fathers sleeve  was he a very good bowler  spofforth was the best bowler that ever walked on to a cricketfield  he was the great australian bowler and he taught us a great deal  did he ever kill a dog from dimples  no boy  why  because laddie said there was a bowler so fast that his ball went frue a coat and killed a dog  oh thats an old yarn  i heard that when i was a little boy about some bowler whose name i think was jackson  was it a big dog  no no son it wasnt a dog at all  it was a cat said dimples  no i tell you it never happened  but tell us about spofforth cried laddie  dimples with his imaginative mind usually wandered while the elder came eagerly back to the point  was he very fast  he could be very fast  i have heard cricketers who had played against him say that his yorkerthat is a ball which is just short of a full pitchwas the fastest ball in england  i have myself seen his long arm swing round and the wicket go down before ever the batsman had time to ground his bat  oo from both beds  he was a tall thin man and they called him the fiend  that means the devil you know  and was he the devil  no dimples no  they called him that because he did such wonderful things with the ball  can the devil do wonderful things with a ball  daddy felt that he was propagating devilworship and hastened to get to safer ground  spofforth taught us how to bowl and blackham taught us how to keep wicket  when i was young we always had another fielder called the long stop who stood behind the wicketkeeper  i used to be a thick solid boy so they put me as longstop and the balls used to bounce off me i remember as if i had been a mattress  delighted laughter  but after blackham came wicketkeepers had to learn that they were there to stop the ball  even in good secondclass cricket there were no more longstops  we soon found plenty of good wicketkeepslike alfred lyttelton and macgregorbut it was blackham who showed us how  to see spofforth all indiarubber and ginger at one end bowling and blackham with his black beard over the bails waiting for the ball at the other end was worth living for i can tell you  silence while the boys pondered over this  but laddie feared daddy would go so he quickly got in a question  if daddys memory could only be kept going there was no saying how long they might keep him  was there no good bowler until spofforth came  oh plenty my boy  but he brought something new with him  especially change of paceyou could never tell by his action up to the last moment whether you were going to get a ball like a flash of lightning or one that came slow but full of devil and spin  but for mere command of the pitch of a ball i should think alfred shaw of nottingham was the greatest bowler i can remember  it was said that he could pitch a ball twice in three times upon a halfcrown  oo  and then from dimples  whose halfcrown  well anybodys halfcrown  did he get the halfcrown  no no why should he  because he put the ball on it  the halfcrown was kept there always for people to aim at explained laddie  no no there never was a halfcrown  murmurs of remonstrance from both boys  i only meant that he could pitch the ball on anythinga halfcrown or anything else  daddy with the energy of one who has a happy idea could he have pitched it on the batsmans toe  yes boy i think so  well then suppose he always pitched it on the batsmans toe  daddy laughed  perhaps that is why dear old w g always stood with his left toe cocked up in the air  on one leg  no no dimples  with his heel down and his toe up  did you know w g daddy  oh yes i knew him quite well  was he nice  yes he was splendid  he was always like a great jolly schoolboy who was hiding behind a huge black beard  whose beard  i meant that he had a great bushy beard  he looked like the pirate chief in your picturebooks but he had as kind a heart as a child  i have been told that it was the terrible things in this war that really killed him  grand old w g  was he the best bat in the world daddy  of course he was said daddy beginning to enthuse to the delight of the clever little plotter in the bed  there never was such a batnever in the worldand i dont believe there ever could be again  he didnt play on smooth wickets as they do now  he played where the wickets were all patchy and you had to watch the ball right on to the bat  you couldnt look at it before it hit the ground and think thats all right  i know where that one will be  my word that was cricket  what you got you earned  did you ever see w g make a hundred daddy  see him  ive fielded out for him and melted on a hot august day while he made a hundred and fifty  theres a pound or two of your daddy somewhere on that field yet  but i loved to see it and i was always sorry when he got out for nothing even if i were playing against him  did he ever get out for nothing  yes dear the first time i ever played in his company he was given out legbeforewicket before he made a run  and all the way to the pavilionthats where people go when they are outhe was walking forward but his big black beard was backward over his shoulder as he told the umpire what he thought  and what did he think  more than i can tell you dimples  but i dare say he was right to be annoyed for it was a lefthanded bowler bowling round the wicket and it is very hard to get legbefore to that  however thats all greek to you  whats gweek  well i mean you cant understand that  now i am going  no no daddy wait a moment  tell us about bonner and the big catch  oh you know about that  two little coaxing voices came out of the darkness  oh please  please  i dont know what your mother will say  what was it you asked  bonner  ah bonner  daddy looked out in the gloom and saw green fields and golden sunlight and great sportsmen long gone to their rest  bonner was a wonderful man  he was a giant in size  as big as you daddy  daddy seized his elder boy and shook him playfully  i heard what you said to miss cregan the other day  when she asked you what an acre was you said about the size of daddy  both boys gurgled  but bonner was five inches taller than i  he was a giant i tell you  did nobody kill him  no no dimples  not a storybook giant  but a great strong man  he had a splendid figure and blue eyes and a golden beard and altogether he was the finest man i have ever seenexcept perhaps one  who was the one daddy  well it was the emperor frederick of germany  a jarman cried dimples in horror  yes a german  mind you boys a man may be a very noble man and be a germanthough what has become of the noble ones these last three years is more than i can guess  but frederick was noble and good as you could see on his face  how he ever came to be the father of such a blasphemous braggartdaddy sank into reverie  bonner daddy said laddie and daddy came back from politics with a start  oh yes bonner  bonner in white flannels on the green sward with an english june sun upon him  that was a picture of a man  but you asked me about the catch  it was in a test match at the ovalengland against australia  bonner said before he went in that he would hit alfred shaw into the next county and he set out to do it  shaw as i have told you could keep a very good length so for some time bonner could not get the ball he wanted but at last he saw his chance and he jumped out and hit that ball the most awful kerwallop that ever was seen in a cricketfield  oo from both boys and then did it go into the next county daddy from dimples  well im telling you said daddy who was always testy when one of his stories was interrupted  bonner thought he had made the ball a half volleythat is the best ball to hitbut shaw had deceived him and the ball was really on the short side  so when bonner hit it up and up it went until it looked as if it were going out of sight into the sky  oo  at first everybody thought it was going far outside the ground  but soon they saw that all the giants strength had been wasted in hitting the ball so high and that there was a chance that it would fall within the ropes  the batsmen had run three runs and it was still in the air then it was seen that an english fielder was standing on the very edge of the field with his back on the ropes a white figure against the black line of the people  he stood watching the mighty curve of the ball and twice he raised his hands together above his head as he did so  then a third time he raised his hands above his head and the ball was in them and bonner was out  why did he raise his hands twice  i dont know  he did so  and who was the fielder daddy  the fielder was g f grace the younger brother of w g  only a few months afterwards he was a dead man  but he had one grand moment in his life with twenty thousand people all just mad with excitement  poor g f  he died too soon  did you ever catch a catch like that daddy  no boy  i was never a particularly good fielder  did you never catch a good catch  well i wont say that  you see the best catches are very often flukes and i remember one awful fluke of that sort  do tell us daddy  well dear i was fielding at slip  that is very near the wicket you know  woodcock was bowling and he had the name of being the fastest bowler of england at that time  it was just the beginning of the match and the ball was quite red  suddenly i saw something like a red flash and there was the ball stuck in my left hand  i had not time to move it it simply came and stuck  oo  i saw another catch like that  it was done by ulyett a fine yorkshire playersuch a big upstanding fellow  he was bowling and the batsmanit was an australian in a test matchhit as hard as ever he could  ulyett could not have seen it but he just stuck out his hand and there was the ball  suppose it had hit his body  well it would have hurt him  would he have cried from dimples  no boy  that is what games are for to teach you to take a knock and never show it  supposing that  a step was heard coming along the passage  good gracious boys heres mumty  shut your eyes this moment  its all right dear  i spoke to them very severely and i think they are nearly asleep  what have you been talking about asked the lady  cwicket cried dimples  its natural enough said daddy of course when two boys  three said the lady as she tucked up the little beds    iiispeculations   the three children were sitting together in a bunch upon the rug in the gloaming  baby was talking so daddy behind his newspaper pricked up his ears for the young lady was silent as a rule and every glimpse of her little mind was of interest  she was nursing the disreputable little downy quilt which she called wriggly and much preferred to any of her dolls  i wonder if they will let wriggly into heaven she said  the boys laughed  they generally laughed at what baby said  if they wont i wont go in either she added  nor me neither if they dont let in my teddybear said dimples  ill tell them it is a nice clean blue wriggly said baby  i love my wriggly  she cooed over it and hugged it  what about that daddy asked laddie in his earnest fashion  are there toys in heaven do you think  of course there are  everything that can make children happy  as many toys as in hamleys shop asked dimples  more said daddy stoutly  oo from all three  daddy dear said laddie  ive been wondering about the deluge  yes dear  what was it  well the story about the ark  all those animals were in the ark just two of each for forty days  wasnt that so  that is the story  well then what did the carnivorous animals eat  one should be honest with children and not put them off with ridiculous explanations  their questions about such matters are generally much more sensible than their parents replies  well dear said daddy weighing his words these stories are very very old  the jews put them in the bible but they got them from the people in babylon and the people in babylon probably got them from some one else away back in the beginning of things  if a story gets passed down like that one person adds a little and another adds a little and so you never get things quite as they happened  the jews put it in the bible exactly as they heard it but it had been going about for thousands of years before then  so it was not true  yes i think it was true  i think there was a great flood and i think that some people did escape and that they saved their beasts just as we should try to save nigger and the monkstown cocks and hens if we were flooded out  then they were able to start again when the waters went down and they were naturally very grateful to god for their escape  what did the people who didnt escape think about it  well we cant tell that  they wouldnt be very grateful would they  their time was come said daddy who was a bit of a fatalist  i expect it was the best thing  it was jolly hard luck on noah being swallowed by a fish after all his trouble said dimples  silly ass  it was jonah that was swallowed  was it a whale daddy  a whale  why a whale couldnt swallow a herring  a shark then  well there again you have an old story which has got twisted and turned a good deal  no doubt he was a holy man who had some great escape at sea and then the sailors and others who admired him invented this wonder  daddy said dimples suddenly should we do just the same as jesus did  yes dear he was the noblest person that ever lived  well did jesus lie down every day from twelve to one  i dont know that he did  well then i wont lie down from twelve to one  if jesus had been a growing boy and had been ordered to lie down by his mumty and the doctor i am sure he would have done so  did he take malt extract  he did what he was told my soni am sure of that  he was a good man so he must have been a good boyperfect in all he did  baby saw god yesterday remarked laddie casually  daddy dropped his paper  yes we made up our minds we would all lie on our backs and stare at the sky until we saw god  so we put the big rug on the lawn and then we all lay down side by side and stared and stared  i saw nothing and dimples saw nothing but baby says she saw god  baby nodded in her wise way  i saw him she said  what was he like then  oh just god  she would say no more but hugged her wriggly  the lady had entered and listened with some trepidation to the frank audacity of the childrens views  yet the very essence of faith was in that audacity  it was all so unquestionably real  which is strongest daddy god or the devil  it was laddie who was speculating now  why god rules everything of course  then why doesnt he kill the devil  and scalp him added dimples  that would stop all trouble wouldnt it daddy  poor daddy was rather floored  the lady came to his help  if everything was good and easy in this world then there would be nothing to fight against and so laddie our characters would never improve  it would be like a football match with all the players on one side said daddy  if there was nothing bad then nothing would be good for you would have nothing to compare by added the lady  well then said laddie with the remorseless logic of childhood if that is so then the devil is very useful so he cant be so very bad after all  well i dont see that daddy answered  our army can only show how brave it is by fighting the german emperor but that does not prove that the german emperor is a very nice person does it now  besides daddy continued improving the occasion you must not think of the devil as a person  you must think of all the mean things one could do and all the dirty things and all the cruel things and that is really the devil you are fighting against  you couldnt call them useful could you  the children thought over this for a little  daddy said laddie have you ever seen god  no my boy  but i see his works  i expect that is as near as we can get in this world  look at all the stars at night and think of the power that made them and keeps each in its proper place  he couldnt keep the shooting stars in their proper place said dimples  i expect he meant them to shoot said laddie  suppose they all shot what jolly nights we should have cried dimples  yes said laddie but after one night they would all have gone and a nice thing then  well theres always the moon remarked dimples  but daddy is it true that god listens to all we say  i dont know about that daddy answered cautiously  you never know into what trap those quick little wits may lead you  the lady was more rash or more orthodox  yes dear he does hear all you say  is he listenin now  yes dear  well i call it vewy rude of him  daddy smiled and the lady gasped  it isnt rude said laddie  it is his duty and he has to notice what you are doing and saying  daddy did you ever see a fairy  no boy  i saw one once  laddie is the very soul of truth quite painfully truthful in details so that his quiet remark caused attention  tell us about it dear  he described it with as little emotion as if it were a persian cat perhaps his perfect faith had indeed opened something to his vision  it was in the day nursery  there was a stool by the window  the fairy jumped on the stool and then down and went across the room  what was it dressed like  all in grey with a long cloak  it was about as big as babys doll  i could not see its arms for they were under the cloak  did he look at you  no he was sideways and i never really saw his face  he had a little cap  thats the only fairy i ever saw  of course there was father christmas if you call him a fairy  daddy was father christmas killed in the war  no boy  because he has never come since the war began  i expect he is fightin the jarmans  it was dimples who was talking  last time he came said laddie daddy said one of his reindeers had hurt its leg in the ruts of the monkstown lane  perhaps thats why he never comes  hell come all right after the war said daddy and hell be redder and whiter and jollier than ever  then daddy clouded suddenly for he thought of all those who would be missing when father christmas came again  ten loved ones were dead from that one household  the lady put out her hand for she always knew what daddy was thinking  they will be there in spirit dear  yes and the jolliest of the lot said daddy stoutly  well have our father christmas back and all will be well in england  but what do they do in india asked laddie  why whats wrong with them  how do the sledge and the reindeer get across the sea  all the parcels must get wet  yes dear there have been several complaints said daddy gravely halloa heres nurse  times up  off to bed  they got up resignedly for they were really very good children  say your prayers here before you go said the lady  the three little figures all knelt on the rug baby still cuddling her wriggly  you pray laddie and the rest can join in  god bless every one i love said the high clear childvoice  and make me a good boy and thank you so much for all the blessings of to day  and please take care of alleyne who is fighting the germans and uncle cosmo who is fighting the germans and uncle woodie who is fighting the germans and all the others who are fighting the germans and the men on the ships on the sea and grandma and grandpa and uncle pat and dont ever let daddy and mumty die  thats all  and please send plenty sugar for the poor people said baby in her unexpected way  and a little petrol for daddy said dimples  amen said daddy  and the little figures rose for the goodnight kiss    ivthe leatherskin tribe   daddy said the elder boy  have you seen wild indians  yes boy  have you ever scalped one  good gracious no  has one ever scalped you asked dimples  silly said laddie  if daddy had been scalped he wouldnt have all that hair on his headunless perhaps it grew again  he has none hair on the very top said dimples hovering over the low chair in which daddy was sitting  they didnt scalp you did they daddy asked laddie with some anxiety  i expect nature will scalp me some of these days  both boys were keenly interested  nature presented itself as some rival chief  when asked dimples eagerly with the evident intention of being present  daddy passed his fingers ruefully through his thinning locks  pretty soon i expect said he  oo said the three children  laddie was resentful and defiant but the two younger ones were obviously delighted  but i say daddy you said we should have an indian game after tea  you said it when you wanted us to be so quiet after breakfast  you promised you know  it doesnt do to break a promise to children  daddy rose somewhat wearily from his comfortable chair and put his pipe on the mantelpiece first he held a conference in secret with uncle pat the most ingenious of playmates  then he returned to the children  collect the tribe said he  there is a council in a quarter of an hour in the big room put on your indian dresses and arm yourselves  the great chief will be there  sure enough when he entered the big room a quarter of an hour later the tribe of the leatherskins had assembled  there were four of them for little rosy cousin john from next door always came in for an indian game they had all indian dresses with high feathers and wooden clubs or tomahawks  daddy was in his usual untidy tweeds but carried a rifle  he was very serious when he entered the room for one should be very serious in a real good indian game  then he raised his rifle slowly over his head in greeting and the four childish voices rang out in the warcry  it was a prolonged wolfish howl which dimples had been known to offer to teach elderly ladies in hotel corridors  you cant be in our tribe without it you know  there is none body about  now just try once if you can do it  at this moment there are halfadozen elderly people wandering about england who have been made children once more by laddie and dimples  hail to the tribe cried daddy  hail chief answered the voices  red buffalo  here cried laddie  black bear  here cried dimples  white butterfly  go on you silly squaw growled dimples  here said baby  prairie wolf  here said little fouryearold john  the muster is complete  make a circle round the campfire and we shall drink the firewater of the palefaces and smoke the pipe of peace  that was a fearsome joy  the firewater was gingerale drunk out of the bottle which was gravely passed from hand to hand  at no other time had they ever drunk like that and it made an occasion of it which was increased by the owlish gravity of daddy  then he lit his pipe and it was passed also from one tiny hand to another laddie taking a hearty suck at it which set him coughing while baby only touched the end of the amber with her little pink lips  there was dead silence until it had gone round and returned to its owner  warriors of the leatherskins why have we come here asked daddy fingering his rifle  humpty dumpty said little john and the children all began to laugh but the portentous gravity of daddy brought them back to the warrior mood  the prairie wolf has spoken truly said daddy  a wicked paleface called humpty dumpty has taken the prairies which once belonged to the leatherskins and is now camped upon them and hunting our buffaloes  what shall be his fate  let each warrior speak in turn  tell him he has jolly well got to clear out said laddie  thats not indian talk cried dimples with all his soul in the game kill him great chiefhim and his squaw too  the two younger warriors merely laughed and little john repeated humpty dumpty  quite right  remember the villains name said daddy  now then the whole tribe follows me on the wartrail and we shall teach this paleface to shoot our buffaloes  look here we dont want squaws cried dimples as baby toddled at the rear of the procession  you stay in the wigwam and cook  a piteous cry greeted the suggestion  the white butterfly will come with us and bind up the wounds said daddy  the squaws are jolly good as torturers remarked laddie  really daddy this strikes me as a most immoral game said the lady who had been a sympathetic spectator from a corner doubtful of the gingerale horrified at the pipe and delighted at the complete absorption of the children  rather said the great chief with a sad relapse into the normal  i suppose that is why they love it so  now then warriors we go forth on the wartrail  one whoop all together before we start  capital  follow me now one behind the other  not a sound  if one gets separated from the others let him give the cry of a night owl and the others will answer with the squeak of the prairie lizard  what sort of a squeak please  oh any old squeak will do  you dont walk  indians trot on the war path  if you see any man hiding in a bush kill him at once but dont stop to scalp him  really dear from the corner  the great queen would rather that you scalp him  now then  all ready start  away went the line of figures daddy stooping with his rifle at the trail laddie and dimples armed with axes and toy pistols as tense and serious as any redskins could be  the other two rather more irresponsible but very much absorbed all the same  the little line of absurd figures wound in and out of the furniture and out on to the lawn and round the laurel bushes and into the yard and back to the clump of trees  there daddy stopped and held up his hand with a face that froze the children  are all here he asked  yes yes  hush warriors  no sound  there is an enemy scout in the bushes ahead stay with me you two  you red buffalo and you black bear crawl forward and settle him  see that he makes no sound  what you do must be quick and sudden  when all is clear give the cry of the woodpigeon and we will join you  the two warriors crawled off in most desperate earnest  daddy leaned on his gun and winked at the lady who still hovered fearfully in the background like a dear hen whose chickens were doing wonderful and unaccountable things  the two younger indians slapped each other and giggled  presently there came the coo of a woodpigeon from in front daddy and the tribe moved forward to where the advance guard were waiting in the bushes  great chief we could find no scout said laddie  there was none person to kill added dimples  the chief was not surprised since the scout had been entirely of his own invention  it would not do to admit it however  have you found his trail he asked  no chief  let me look  daddy hunted about with a look of preternatural sagacity about him  before the snows fell a man passed here with a red head grey clothes and a squint in his left eye  his trail shows that his brother has a grocers shop and his wife smokes cigarettes on the sly  oh daddy how could you read all that  its easy enough my son when you get the knack of it  but look here we are indians on the wartrail and dont you forget it if you value your scalp  aha here is humpty dumptys trail  uncle pat had laid down a paper trail from this point as daddy well knew so now the children were off like a little pack of eager harriers following in and out among the bushes  presently they had a rest  great chief why does a wicked paleface leave paper wherever he goes  daddy made a great effort  he tears up the wicked letters he has written  then he writes others even wickeder and tears them up in turn  you can see for yourself that he leaves them wherever he goes  now warriors come along  uncle pat had dodged all over the limited garden and the tribe followed his trail  finally they stopped at a gap in the hedge which leads into the field  there was a little wooden hut in the field where daddy used to go and put up a printed cardboard working  he found it a very good dodge when he wanted a quiet smoke and a nap  usually there was nothing else in the field but this time the chief pushed the whole tribe hurriedly behind the hedge and whispered to them to look carefully out between the branches  in the middle of the field a tripod of sticks supported a kettle  at each side of it was a hunchedup figure in a coloured blanket  uncle pat had done his work skilfully and well  you must get them before they can reach their rifles said the chief what about their horses  black bear move down the hedge and bring back word about their horses  if you see none give three whistles  the whistles were soon heard and the warrior returned  if the horses had been there what would you have done  scalped them said dimples  silly ass said laddie  who ever heard of a horses scalp  you would stampede them  of course said the chief  if ever you see a horse grazing you crawl up to it spring on its back and then gallop away with your head looking under its neck and only your foot to be seen  dont you forget it  but we must scupper these rascals on our huntinggrounds  shall we crawl up to them  yes crawl up  then when i give a whoop rush them  take them alive  i wish to have a word with them first  carry them into the hut  go  away went the eager little figures the chubby babes and the two lithe active boys  daddy stood behind the bush watching them  they kept a line and tiptoed along to the camp of the strangers  then on the chiefs signal they burst into a cry and rushed wildly with waving weapons into the camp of the palefaces  a moment later the two pillow made trappers were being dragged off into the hut by the whooping warriors  they were upended in one corner when the chief entered and the victorious indians were dancing about in front of them  anybody wounded asked the chief  no no  have you tied their hands  with perfect gravity red buffalo made movements behind each of the pillows  they are tied great chief  what shall we do with them  cut off their heads shrieked dimples who was always the most bloodthirsty of the tribe though in private life he had been known to weep bitterly over a squashed caterpillar  the proper thing is to tie them to a stake said laddie  what do you mean by killing our buffaloes asked daddy severely  the prisoners preserved a sulky silence  shall i shoot the green one asked dimples presenting his wooden pistol  wait a bit said the chief  we had best keep one as a hostage and send the other back to say that unless the chief of the palefaces pays a ransom within three days  but at that moment as a great romancer used to say a strange thing happened  there was the sound of a turning key and the whole tribe of the leatherskins was locked into the hut  a moment later a dreadful face appeared at the window a face daubed with mud and overhung with grass which drooped down from under a soft cap  the weird creature danced in triumph and then stooped to set a light to some paper and shavings near the window  heavens cried the chief  it is yellow snake the ferocious chief of the bottlenoses  flame and smoke were rising outside  it was excellently done and perfectly safe but too much for the younger warriors  the key turned the door opened and two tearful babes were in the arms of the kneeling lady  red buffalo and black bear were of sterner stuff  im not frightened daddy said laddie though he looked a little pale  nor me cried dimples hurrying to get out of the hut  well lock the prisoners up with no food and have a council of war upon them in the morning said the chief  perhaps weve done enough today  i rather think you have said the lady as she soothed the poor little sobbing figures  thats the worst of having kids to play said dimples  fancy having a squaw in a warparty  never mind weve had a jolly good indian game said laddie as the sound of a distant bell called them all to the nursery tea  printed by hazell
