straight in the air                       158       the club at crows corner     chapter i  mr crow and mr turtle   over in that portion of the big woods where the brook swings around a clump of alders in order to wind in and out among the trees is a very large and very old oak tree whose branches afford a roosting place for all the feathered inhabitants of that vicinity and give shade on warm days to all who are forced to wear fur coats during the summer  this oak tree stands near what might be called a corner of the brook and because old mr james crow is to be found among its branches every moment of the day or night except when out in search of food the oak tree the bend of the brook and the land in that immediate neighborhood have come to be known as crows corner so mr bunny rabbit declares and there is no reason to doubt his word  mr bunny is a very old fellow he never had any tail to speak of and in his younger days squire owl whose wife and little ones were in need of rabbit stew decided to take mr bunny home with him but the old fellow who was very spry during the earlier portion of his life jumped into a thicket of thorn bushes so nimbly that the squire only succeeded in nipping about half an inch off poor bunnys apology for a tail one of the old fellows ears has been split into two pieces by an overeager hawk and he has a great scar on his left side where mr reynard fox snapped at him but failed to get more than a small mouthful after all  as a matter of fact mr bunny has so many scars which tell of hairbreadth escapes and has been forced to run so many times for very life that no mistake can be made in setting him down as an old fellow of vast experience who could tell many an entertaining story of his own adventures and because he is ready and willing to talk at almost any time to a friendly listener i came to know about the fur and feather club whose meeting place is at crows corner  mr bunny is free to admit that mr james crow is older than himself and has seen very much more of the world than ever did any single member of the rabbit family because of the ease with which he can travel but at the same time he declares with many a sigh and groan because of the wickedness of this world that mr crow often tells stories in which is no truth whatever and this he does in order to make it appear that he is a bird of considerable importance in any neighborhood where he may chance to be  how the club at crows corner was started mr bunny cannot say he himself came upon it by mistake while he was scurrying here and there under every friendly bush and leaf in order to refuse an invitation to dinner which squire owl was very eager he should accept and when he arrived at that particular place in the big woods mr crow was telling cheeko squirrel and two or three members of his family about the wickedness of mr weasel who had just killed all mrs thrushs children  squire owl put an end to the meeting at that time for master cheeko and his little ones believed it necessary they should get under cover in the shortest possible space of time but when mr bunny had more leisure he went back to crows corner and was speedily made a member of the club  we dont have any regular hours for meeting mr bunny said while first telling about the association when squire owl or professor hawk have had such a big dinner that they forget to be hungry we get together around the tree those of us who belong to the fur section with the associates of the feather department on the branches and then it is that you might hear some rare stories if you happened along that way  at that moment mr bunny suddenly dropped his ears over his eyes and began to laugh heartily whereupon as a matter of course it seemed proper to ask what had caused his mirth  i just happened to think of a rare trick cheeko squirrel played on mr crow not long ago and there was a good deal of talk about expelling him from the club but everybody except mr crow himself thought it was so funny that they didnt have the heart to turn cheeko out for he means well as a general thing even though he does spend the most of his time scolding somebody or something  you see cheeko had the idea that it was his duty to get square with mr crow because the old fellow gave him a downright talking to before all the members of the club on account of his chattering so much while the speeches were being made it really wasnt to be wondered at that mr crow called him to order for you know what a disturbance he makes over nothing but cheeko thought he was abused and didnt get more than half the sleep he needed on account of lying awake nights to figure out how he could get the best of poor old jimmy crow  well one day while he was down near the pond where the geese family spend so much of their time dabbling around in the water in the most foolish way you can imagine cheeko hit upon what he thought was a great plan but it turned out to be a very serious matter or might have been if squire owl hadnt interfered  down at the pond lives an old fellow by the name of slowly turtle and between you and me i dont think he has very much sense although you cant really say he is foolish i suppose it takes him so long to go from one place to another that he gets himself all mixed up with watching out to see if he is moving he isnt the kind of fellow youd really want for a friend but because he doesnt do any great harm in the world we members of the club pass the time of day with him when we meet  well at this time im going to tell you about cheeko squirrel happened to go down to the pond just out of curiosity and there he saw old slowly lying on a rock sunning himself  howdy mr turtle cheeko said friendlylike and the old fellow being too lazy to speak winked one eye at mr squirrel  have you had your dinner yet cheeko asked as if it would make him feel dreadfully bad to know that mr turtle was hungry  i havent had time to go after it and its so near sunset now that im afraid ill have to wait till tomorrow  why dont you catch a big fat frog cheeko asked as if he couldnt rest easy until he knew that mr turtle was comfortable  i havent seen any around here lately and there isnt time to go hunting today  i dont suppose youd be willing to follow any plan of mine mr squirrel said speaking soft as silk but if you did im almost certain i could put you in a place where all youd have to do would be to open your mouth when you wanted a bite  that pleased mr turtle way down to the ground and he agreed hed do whatever mr squirrel said providing he didnt have to walk too far so cheeko set about the plan hed figured out in his mind for getting square with mr crow in the first place he daubed mr turtle all over with clay till he looked like a ball of mud and while doing this he told the old fellow how to act  im going to carry you over into the woods a little way and you are to keep as still as a mouse till you feel some one meddling with the mud im sticking to your shell then youll know its time to get your dinner and all youll have to do will be to shut your jaws on whatever is within reach ill promise that you shall have meat that will be sweeter than the fattest frog you ever heard croak  mr turtle let cheeko do what he pleased and if youll believe it that squirrel rolled the old fellow in his covering of clay all the way from the pond up to crows corner it must have been a terrible job but cheeko was willing to do it for the sake of getting a joke on mr crow and when he came to the foot of the tree he sat down in front of what appeared to be nothing more than a clay ball with his tail spread out over his head as if he were thinking mighty serious it wasnt long before old mr crow espied him and it really did seem as if that bird would shake himself into little pieces he was so curious to know what cheeko was doing he sat on the very tip of one of the branches looking at the odd thing until he could keep still no longer and then he hopped down by the side of cheeko  what have you got with you mr squirrel he asked trying to turn the clay ball over and cheeko said carelesslike as if it didnt make very much difference to him whether mr crow got the information he wanted  roll it over two or three times and you may know as much as i do about it  mr crow twisted his head first on one side and then on the other until he had looked at the clay ball with both eyes but mr squirrel didnt offer to explain anything more and finally he grew so excited that it seemed as if he just really had to do as cheeko wanted he rolled the funny looking thing to and fro without learning anything regarding it and then began pecking at the hole in one end which mr squirrel had left open so mr turtle could get air  by this time poor old mr turtle made up his slow mind that the meat cheeko told him about was near at hand and before mr crow could wink an eye out came a queerlooking head with jaws that fastened on the birds leg in a way that wasnt pleasant or comfortable  theres no need of my saying that mr crow was frightened the idea of being bitten by a lump of clay nearly scared him white and up into the tree he flew cawcawing at the full strength of his lungs while mr turtle hung on the best he knew how for it must have startled him a good bit to feel that instead of getting a dinner he was going up into the air like a balloon of course old slowly couldnt make any noise but mr crow was doing that for both of them and down at the foot of the tree cheeko sat laughing until so mr porcupine declares it seemed certain he would burst  just then squire owl who had been awakened by the disturbance came out to learn what the matter was but mr crow was so frightened that he couldnt give him the least little bit of information and the squire had to find out for himself being nearsighted in the daytime it was quite a while before he saw mr turtles head and then he cried out angrily  what are you doing up a tree you rascal let go of mr crows leg and go back to your pond this instant  if i do that i shall break myself all to pieces mr turtle said speaking rather indistinctly because his mouth was so full and hearing the words mr squirrel laughed harder than ever until the squire began to get an idea of how it all happened  this is some of your doings cheeko squirrel he said savagely call off your turtle or ill come down there and eat you without butter  youve tried to do that a good many times and ive always got the best of you even when it wasnt very light so dont puff yourself up with the idea that im afraid of a big bunch of feathers like you while the sun is shining cheeko said shaking his tail till mr porcupine says he was afraid it would drop off  of course the squire was dreadfully angry because of cheekos impudence and down he came out of the tree without stopping to think how blind he was while mr crow shouted  never mind that miserable squirrel squire but take this terrible thing off my leg and mr turtle mumbled as well as he could without opening his jaws  im the one who should be helped for i cant afford to fall out of a tree at my time of life  all the while squire owl blundered around not able to see even his own nose and cheeko squirrel jumped around him laughing and shouting till every bird in the woods flew over to the corner to find out what was happening     chapter ii  cheeko in danger   mr bunny had paused in the midst of his story to laugh at the comical situation as described by himself with mr turtle clinging for dear life to mr crows leg and the old bird screaming at the full strength of his lungs for help while squire owl darted here and there blindly growing more and more angry as cheeko squirrel continued to say disagreeable things  you see what made it altogether too funny was the way the squire raved because he couldnt find cheeko bunny continued as he wiped away with his ears the tears which had been caused by mirth if cheeko only had a bit more sense he wouldnt have carried on quite so bad for he must have realized that the squire would lay it up against him but all he thought of at the time was the fun and the way he talked to that old bird was something dreadful  now you must remember that mr crow didnt hold his tongue all this time but kept on shouting for help until you would have thought he was afraid of his life and we couldnt hear very much of what mr turtle was trying to say cheeko didnt have time to pay attention to any one except squire owl and danced from one branch to another screaming and chattering until suddenly down darted professor hawk with his mouth wide open  oh me oh my how that squirrel did hustle if the professor had once got a grip on him it was goodbye cheeko and nobody knew that better than master cheeko himself he gave one leap for a lot of thorn bushes which grew near the old oak tree as if somebody had put them there for the especial benefit of us members of the fur section and it seemed to me as if he alighted a good fifty feet from where he started he must have torn his coat in more than one place for when a fellow jumps like that he cant pick out just the right spot for stopping as i know to my sorrow when ive been trying to give mr fox the slip  of course professor hawk didnt stand any chance of getting at him once he was among the thorns and he would have sailed off in a huff but that the squire shouted for him to stop then he came back to the angry old owl and the two whispered together a long time without paying the least little bit of attention to poor jimmy crow i knew the big fellows were hatching up some kind of plan to get the best of cheeko and at the first good chance i told him the wisest course for him was to get as far from crows corner as his legs would carry him between then and sunset  it isnt of very much use to give cheeko advice for he always thinks he knows better than any one else and this time instead of thanking me for taking the trouble to find him among all those thorns he said as pertly as any sparrow you ever heard  i want you to understand bunny rabbit that im not afraid of those two old fogiesno nor of all their families ive taken care of myself in these woods a good many years and im not to be scared by an old owl now  its better to be scared than eaten cheeko i said as i rubbed two or three spots of blood from his coat for it was in a shocking condition by this time you cant stay here among the thorns very long because mr weasel is sure to hear all this row and once he gets on your trail youre a gone squirrel  he tried to run me down last fall but i gave him the slip all right cheeko said quickly puffing his chest way out because he was mighty proud of escaping from the bloodthirsty mr weasel  it isnt likely that a squirrel could get away more than once after mr weasel had started for him i said just a bit provoked because cheeko squirrel thought himself so smart and then i left him all swelled up with pride getting out from the bushes as mr blue jay came along screaming with anger on account of the hubbub in the club quarters where everything is usually conducted in the most seemly manner  mr jay is a wise bird and you can make a note of that just as soon as he saw that clay ball hanging to mr crows leg and understood what was beneath all the mud he knew exactly how to fix things but it was quite a while before he could make mr crow and mr turtle hear him which is saying a good deal when you come to understand what a loud voice he has after a while however he succeeded in making old jimmy hold his peace and then he said as if he were the president of the club instead of only a smallsized member  you cant expect mr turtle to tumble out of the tree just to please you james crow for he would break himself to pieces and besides if what cock robin tells me is true he didnt come up here of his own free will  im not saying he did mr crow snapped out short as pie crust he took hold of my leg and i couldnt get here without him and thats why the miserable creature is making so much trouble  im not doing a thing mr turtle said speaking as if the tears were just ready to run down his muddy cheeks im too old to be tumbling around like a jumpingjack and if anybody is making trouble its this wretched crow who has put on more airs than a peacock since the club was started  how did he get hold of crows leg in the first place mr jay asked as if he were a regular judge and had a right to pry into other peoples business  then poor old slowly told the whole story while cheeko snickered and screamed from his hiding place among the thorns and after mr jay had studied the whole thing over he said bristling up the feathers on his head theres only one fair thing for you to do james crow take old slowly back to the shore of the pond and then hell let go of your leg  but how will i get all this mud off my shell mr turtle asked speaking quite distinctly for a fellow who had his mouth full of crows leg  soak yourself till it comes off mr jay said with a laugh and the president of the club asked as if he were in a good deal of pain  will you open your mouth if i carry you back to the pond its going to be a dreadful job to fly such a distance with you hanging there but im willing to make the try if youll agree that what mr jay has said will be the square thing  of course mr turtle promised for what else could he do while he was up a tree so far and all the members of the club who had come to learn what was going on got out of the way to give mr crow a fair chance it was a good deal like work to fly while his leg was being pulled so badly but he contrived to do it and after watching until he settled down at the edge of the pond i began to look around for cheeko squirrel  squire owl and professor hawk had gone away telling mr porcupine they were off for a picnic but that didnt seem reasonable to me for the pair were not such very warm friends as all that and i knew there was trouble in store for cheeko if he didnt watch out a good deal sharper than i ever knew of his doing  i just wish you could have seen that squirrel when i found him sitting at the front door of sonny hedgehogs hole ready to get under cover at the first sign of danger do you know he really believed he had tired out the squire and that there wasnt any danger he could come to harm  you wont find me in a pickle no matter how long you hunt he said shaking his tail till it really made me seasick id like to see the owl or the hawk for that matter that i couldnt fool when i laid myself right out to do the job theyve run things their own way so long around here that they think everybody else must get off the earth when they say the word ill show em what an uptodate squirrel can do  youll be showing nothing mighty soon cheeko if you dont take a tumble to yourself i said and i couldnt help speaking a bit short for it provoked me terribly to see him throwing out his chest as if he were second cousin to senator bear youre letting the squire and professor hawk shut your eye thats whats the matter im telling you that those two have had their heads together to your harm and youll soon know what they were talking about if you keep the idea in your head that youre the biggest little animal in the woods take my advice and get away from crows corner for a while there are some nice ears of corn over on mr mans place now and it would be a pleasant little vacation to go there for a few days until this matter simmers down a bit  do you suppose im going to let those old birds think im afraid of them cheeko asked bold as brass and it was no use for me to try to keep my temper within bounds any longer  of course youre afraid of them i cried it only proves that youve fallen in love with yourself when you talk like that and im not going to waste any more time on you  nobody asked you for your time you longeared bobtailed old fraud cheeko said swinging his tail in the most impudent manner imaginable and i hopped off determined that id never raise a paw in his behalf no matter how much trouble he might be in but of course when it seemed certain hed be made over into a pie as im going to tell you about i quite forgot that he had insulted me when i was trying to do him a favor  i left him at the door of sonny hedgehogs home and went down toward the pond to see what luck poor old slowly had in scraping the mud off his shell but before reaching there whom should i come across but the squire and the professor hunting for nuts now you know as well as i do that there isnt a member of either the owl or the hawk family who has a hankering for nuts of course there was some mischief in the wind and i had a pretty good idea that cheeko was the particular nut they were looking for so i hid behind a lot of ferns till id got at the root of their scheme  it was too early in the season to find nuts on the ground but they didnt come to realize that until after searching around among the leaves a long while and then the professor flew into the top of the walnut tree where he nipped off two or three then he came down to where the squire was waiting for him and said with a chuckle  just as soon as that fool crow gets back all the members of the club will gather near the oak tree to hear what he has to say about the mixup with slowly turtle of course cheeko will be there too for there is nothing going on around these woods that he doesnt try to have a paw in well put the nuts where hell see them and you shall get in the shade where the sun wont hurt your eyes then if he isnt your meat ill agree to furnish the dinners tomorrow  the idea of two big bullies taking so much time to get the best of one little squirrel i forgot all about cheekos impudence to me and instead of looking after old mr turtle i scuttled back through the bushes to watch the villains while they laid their trap     chapter iii  bunny rabbits efforts   mr bunny rabbit hopped up on a fallen tree where he could the better be seen while telling his story and where also he might have eyes and ears on the alert for danger a cautious old fellow is bunny else he would not be alive this day for among the wood folk there is more than one who has a fondness for rabbit pie or stew and that member of the rabbit family who lives to have children of his own has given good proof that he keeps his wits about him the greater portion of the time  i was telling you about cheekos foolishness and how nearly it cost him his life mr bunny said after a pause so long that it really seemed for the time as if he had forgotten the story  of course old mr crow flew back to the oak tree as soon as slowly turtle had let go of his leg and oh me oh my how he did scold about mr turtle never once seeming to think that cheeko squirrel had anything to do with the matter nearly every member of the club pretended to believe that slowly was the only one who should be blamed although they knew that cheeko is a master hand at making mischief but it so happened that he wasnt there to make trouble and the result was that the president of the club had everything his own way  it was voted that mr turtle should never be made welcome at crows corner that he had behaved in an unseemly manner and ought to be shunned by every member of the club this matter had no more than been settled when we heard master squirrel screaming and chattering as if he were the only real thing in the woods and as his voice sounded nearer and nearer telling that he was coming to join the company i looked around to see what had become of the professor and the squire  if youll believe it they were nowhere to be seen and im such a silly thing sometimes that i really believed they had given up the scheme i saw them working on then i got interested in what mr crow was saying for he started in the best he knew how to have all the members of the club vote that slowly turtle and his entire family should be turned out of the pond and never allowed to come near it again  cocky robin wanted to know whod do the turning out and how it was to be done but the old man crow was so angry he wouldnt go into that part of the business at all and claimed that after the vote had been taken it would be time enough to settle what he called the minor points  just then up came cheeko his tail spread over his head and waving to and fro in that way which always makes me feel seasick it doesnt seem possible as i tell it to you now but it is a fact that not content with having been the means of giving mr crow the sorest leg you ever saw on a bird he must needs begin to brag about what he had done in the way of making trouble in the club  then mr jay who had been roosting in the very top of the tree with his crest sticking straight up because of what he had done toward straightening out matters lost his temper and began giving cheeko about as severe a lecture as ever any squirrel listened to but all the while the foolish mischiefmaker chattered and screamed as if he were the whole show  i had forgotten entirely about the squire and professor hawk until i saw cheeko running along the ground toward where three or four walnuts were lying near a clump of fir bushes and then i got right up on my hind legs and shouted to him that hed best keep under cover if he wanted to save his skin  take care of yourself if you can you bobtailed old fraud and ill show that a fellow about my size is able to do pretty much as he pleases in these woods  of course every member of the club was looking at cheeko by this time and ill venture to say there was not one present who didnt think he was making a fool of himself by talking in such a strain for there are precious few of us wood folk who can do as they please all the time  well master cheeko skipped toward the nuts shaking his tail to show that he was a terribly brave fellow and if squire hadnt been quite so blind it would have been the last tailshake for that squirrel you must know that the squire was hiding among the fir bushes in front of which the nuts had been laid and somewhere among the small branches was the professor watching out to take a hand in the plan in case the first part of it missed but of course we didnt know all that at the time  cheeko was so eager to show the members of the club that he had no reason to be afraid of anything wearing feathers or fur that he didnt look to the right or to the left but made straight for the nuts and just as he was about to pick up one out sailed the squire with a rush and a bang which showed how angry he was  now the professor had laid the nuts in the shade of the fir bushes so they would be sheltered from the sunlight but yet it was considerably lighter there than in the thicket consequently the instant the squire popped his head out he had to shut his eyes of course so by the time he struck the ground cheeko had jumped aside  if the foolish squirrel had been satisfied with thus giving squire owl the slip he might have boasted for many a day about going straight into the old fellows trap and coming out again without a scratch but he must needs scream and laugh as if it were something very funny and then professor hawk came into the game down he flew aiming straight for cheeko and with never a care as to how brightly the sun might shine for theres nothing the matter with his eyes and then was the time when i believed master cheeko was down and out for good and so he would have been but for mr crow who forgetting the trick cheeko had played on him dropped down from the top of the old oak more quickly than i ever saw a bird move before fluttering his wings directly under the professors beak just as he was on the point of snapping up a fat squirrel who would have delighted the stomachs of the little hawks  even though mr crow moved so swiftly it was the narrowest kind of squeak for cheeko the professors claws struck his back cutting through his coat in three or four places and he received such a blow that it was quite as much as he could do to scramble among the raspberry bushes which fortunately grew near at hand he didnt have his tail over his head then and thats a fact but he was about as discouraged an animal as you ever saw how that old owl did rave and scold when he found that cheeko had got off alive he accused every member of the club with having had a paw or a wing in his defeat and threatened with many a needless word to pay us off even though he had to spend every minute of his time for the next month  the professor didnt say anything but flew up on mr crows perch looking sour as vinegar and i said to myself then that he was the one we had the most reason to fear you could tell by the look in his eye that he was already thinking up some wicked plan and i really had palpitation of the heart because of imagining what he might be able to do if he set himself right down to getting revenge  if youll believe it i didnt dare stay at the foot of the tree where i could see the evil glare in his eyes even though i was snug among the thorn bushes but hopped off through the underbrush taking mighty good care not to show myself in the open for a single minute until i found poor cheeko who looked as if all he needed in this world was a deep deep hole where he could die in peace  have you found out that you cant do pretty much as you please cheeko i asked and he answered with a groan  i suppose you think it is funny to talk that way when a fellow is dying and he tried to swing his tail a bit but couldnt move a single hair i cant begin to tell how badly off he was  of course i couldnt help pitying him even though he had called me a bobtailed fraud and after doing my best to show him that the animal or the bird for that matter who boasts of what he can do and sticks his nose into danger simply to show that he isnt afraid is the silliest thing alive i promised to have mrs bunny fix him up the same kind of herb tea she always makes for me when ive been handled roughly by some of the wood bullies  he declared he couldnt get into his own house and that even though it was possible for him to move about as lively as before the professor hit him he wouldnt dare go up a tree for at least two weeks all of which showed that he realized how foolish he had been i hunted around until i found snug quarters under the roots of an old pine and helped him move in but i tell you the tears came to his eyes more than once before he settled down for his back was so sore that the least movement caused him pain then i started for home little dreaming that by trying to help cheeko i was at the same time laying a trap for my own little sonny bunny which as you shall see i found out that i really was doing  cheeko made me agree to come back as soon as possible and remembering that i had promised my wife some nice fresh lettuce from mr mans garden that night for supper i agreed with him that if i didnt get my chores done up early id send sonny bunny with the herb tea  now it seems that some of the neighbors had told my wife of all that happened at the club and she was nearly frightened out of her wits because i had stayed away so long when i told her of my promise to cheeko she said flatly that she wouldnt lift a paw to help an idle fellow who was always finding fault with everybody instead of getting in his winters supply of nuts but after hearing how badly off he was she took it all back and set about making the herb tea  if i dont get back by the time it is done send sonny bunny over with some of it and tell the little fellow to stay with cheeko till i get there i said to my wife for if anything could cheer an invalid it would be the funny capers of an innocent little rabbit like my youngest i only wish there was time for me to tell you of all his bright doings you should see him dancing in the swamp when the moon shines brightly and then if you didnt say he was the cutest baby who ever wore a fur coat it would be because you are not a judge of children  well i started off for mr mans garden taking good care to keep out of sight even though it was too late for the professors family to be out and too early for either the weasels or the owls and never so much as dreaming i had almost sent poor little sonny bunny to his death  i knew exactly where to find the best lettuce and got all i wanted without being seen by mr man or that meddling son of his then instead of going home in a hurry i loitered here or there to get young carrots or a few heads of clover thinking i would make of the dinner a regular feast  it was a full hour after sunset when i went into the house with such a supply of good things as would have surprised mrs rabbit if she hadnt been so sorely worried about sonny bunny  i sent him off with the herb tea very soon after you left cautioning him to hop back before it was time for mr weasel to come out and he hasnt shown his ears here yet you must go after him at once bunny and dont let cheeko persuade you to stay a single minute for i am too nervous to be left alone  at this point mr rabbits story was interrupted by the appearance of his wife who half hidden amid the ferns beckoned him to her side  stay where you are and ill be right back he said in a whisper dont move about too much for she is very timid especially since mr mans boy tommy set his dog to chase her  then he hopped away and what could a body do but wait until he should be at liberty to finish the story     chapter iv  sonny bunnys peril   it was possible to see mr bunny rabbit talking earnestly with his wife amid the ferns for five minutes or more and then he came back to the old log curling his whiskers and otherwise appearing to be well satisfied with the world in general and himself in particular  my wife is such a nervous thing since mr mans boy tommy set his dog on her he said hopping up on the log that he might the better be seen now she has got it in her head that mr weasel has found his way to our home and ran all this distance up here to warn me about being careful when i came to supper shes old enough to know that im keeping my eye out for that murdering villain and the first time i heard of his coming around where we live id move  i suppose it seems kind of queer to you that all us wood folk are so afraid of mr weasel but if you were to see him out on one of his killings youd understand it very readily it would seem just a little bit different if he picked us small people up for dinner or breakfast but he does nothing of the kind he commits murder just to please his wicked self and oftentimes doesnt stop to suck a single drop of blood from his victim a desperately wicked old fellow is mr weasel and even the squire and the professor are afraid of him  yes yes im going to tell you how much trouble i got poor little sonny bunny into through trying to help cheeko squirrel after he had so needlessly poked his nose into danger i couldnt help saying just a word about that miserable weasel because of all the fright my wife had on his account and now for the story i began so long ago  youll remember that my wife sent the poor little fellow to cheeko with some herb tea and when i got back with the things for dinner she was terribly worried because he hadnt come home im willing to confess that i didnt feel really easy in mind myself for he was too young to be out in the woods alone after dark never having been taught to take care of himself in the night and off i scuttled the best i knew how which wasnt slow but trying to make myself believe that sonny stayed to cheer cheeko  i was hopping along mighty fast when whom should i see just ahead of me on the path but mr fox standing with his head cocked over on one side as he always holds it when hes up to some mischief i was in a terrible hurry but it seemed safer to stop a bit till id found out what he was up to and lucky it was that i did  old mr fox had his mind so taken up with the business on hand that he didnt hear me when i crept under the ferns where i could see all that was going on he stood looking down sideways as if trying to make up his mind just what to do and then suddenly he began to scratch the dirt at a terrible rate of course i knew he wasnt building a new house at that time of night and after twisting my neck till i got a cramp in it trying to see it popped into my head that he was working at the very place where mr weasel killed my poor brother the summer before then i got mighty nervous for i knew that none of our family was using the hole unless theyd gone in since i came from cheekos new flat  you might as well come out and save me the trouble of digging for you sonny bunny mr fox said as he stopped to catch his breath and my hair stood right up on end for i began to understand that my little sonny bunny meeting mr fox on the way home had dodged in there to get out of his way  itll be the worse for you if you make me do all this work mr fox said breathing loud for he didnt like to dig so hard for one small rabbit and i just really held my breath i was so afraid sonny bunny would think he could make matters any easier by trusting to that treacherous fox but the little fellow had good sense and lay still as a mouse so the miserable villain began digging again  oh me oh my how hard i did try to think up some plan to help poor sonny bunny out of the scrape for of course it wouldnt have been any use to make a fight with a fellow so much bigger than i was and at last it seemed as if id struck just the plan  i snooped around through the bushes holding my breath mighty hard for mr fox has a good pair of ears till i was among a lot of raspberry vines not so very far from the old oak i crept way in among them although i got some pretty bad scratches and when i was so far in that there was no danger the squire could get hold of me i sung out the best i knew how  oh please mr crow send somebody to help me for im near choked to death here among the raspberry bushes and am afraid mr weasel will come along before i can get out  then mr fox stopped digging and pricked up his ears making his voice sound mighty soft as he asked as if he were my best friend  who is in trouble  its bunny rabbit i cried making believe i thought it was mr crow who spoke please send somebody here right quick dear mr crow  im coming right away mr fox said still making his voice soft and then i heard him come pattering along  then was the time when sonny bunny should have scooted for dear life but the little fellow hadnt had experience with bad wood folks and laid snug when he might have got away it seemed to me that i was in a pickle for if mr fox came up while i was in the raspberry bushes id be likely to go home to supper with him unless i got a fair chance to show how fast i could run so i kept on yelling for help and mr fox he kept trying to soothe me sos the rest of the folks who might be hungry shouldnt come up to invite me to a stew  youd better believe i made the dirt fly trying to back out of the place id gone into with the idea of helping sonny bunny and it seemed as if i were getting into a worse hole every minute when i heard something that made my blood run coldits a great wonder my hair didnt turn white it was that soft whirring noise the squire makes when he flies and it looked as if id miss my share of the lettuce and carrots id spent so much time gathering  i might as well confess that i got all mixed up with knowing that mr fox was after me on one side and somewhere in the air was the squire watching for a chance to stick his big claws in my back to say nothing of the fact that mr weasel might have heard what was going on  i just shut my eyes and waited wondering which one would get at me first and then suddenly i heard a screech from mr fox with a yell from the squire at the same minute i opened my eyes in a hurry and poked my nose out to see what had happened but there was such a mixup that it was quite a while before i could see anything but fur and feathers swinging around together like mad  you can guess that i didnt think about trying to save myself from being scratched by the thorns on the raspberry bushes but dug out as quick as any rabbit ever did in this world and oh what a row i found going on it seems that the squire had caught sight of mr fox and thinking it was me dove down on him without stopping to make sure what he was tackling burying his claws so deep that he couldnt pull them out in a hurry just at that very minute mr weasel who sure enough had heard me yelling sneaked up and theres no need of saying that he made a spring for the squire catching him by the neck  now you know that when mr weasel once gets a grip he doesnt let go in a hurry leastways not until hes got the upper hand of whoever is between his teeth and there the three were floundering around in a way that would have made me laugh till i cried if it hadnt been for poor little sonny bunny who was most likely crouching in his uncles old home so frightened that he didnt even know what his name was  i said to myself that if i missed this chance of getting away i might not have another so off i started but feeling mighty sorry that i couldnt stop to see the end of the row do you know that i had to go to the very lower end of my poor brothers house in order to get sonny bunny he was so scared that it didnt seem as if he heard me when i hollered for him to come out and i was forced to drag the little fellow by the back of the neck so far that it made my jaws ache for he isnt as much of a lightweight as he used to be  after a while i managed to shake some sense into him and off we started for home knowing by the yelps and hootings that the fight was still going on with mr weasel holding his tongue all the while but most likely sawing a good deal of wood we found sonnys mother in what was just the same as a fainting fit when we went into the house she had worried so much about us both that she couldnt stand it any longer and off she went into a regular spell the minute she heard the patter of our feet on the dry leaves  of course it took some time to bring her around all right for im not a very good hand at such things and sonny is too young to be of much use in time of sickness so i suppose the fight was ended before we had matters straightened out at home but i wanted to sneak around through the bushes to see how the thing wound up and id have done it too if sonnys mother hadnt caught me by the ear declaring that shed suffered enough for one night and i must stay with her and the baby  id have given a good deal to know how the row ended but it was no use to argue with mrs rabbit so i put on my slippers and scurried around to help get dinner for goodness knows it was time all three of us had something to eat nothing could have been better than those carrots and i had eaten two at the same time thinking what a fool id been for not bringing back more when suddenly sonnys mother threw up both paws as if she were dying and before there was time to ask what had come over her i heard the sound of some one scratching at our front door  i didnt dare even to wait long enough to quiet mrs bunny but off i ran through the hallway which is very long in our house as you may suppose and before reaching the door i could smell mr foxy fox as plainly as i smell you this minute frightened it seemed as if i couldnt put one paw before another and for two or three minutes it looked as if id go home for supper with mr fox how he got out of the scrape with the squire and mr weasel i couldnt guess except that those two were so busy with each other that he contrived to slip off quietly but it didnt make very much difference to me just how it happened for i had troubles of my own to look after  one thing was certain that rascally old fox would have to do some digging before he could get at us and i ran back to mrs rabbit who had pulled herself together a bit holding her gently by the ears as i explained what was going on  at this point bunny stopped as if overcome by sad thoughts and stroked his whiskers softly with one paw to have broken in on his train of thought just then would have been downright cruelty therefore it seemed necessary to wait until he was ready to continue the painful story     chapter v  a meeting of the club   mr bunny rabbit remained silent a long while as if occupied with painful thoughts although in view of what he said later it was difficult to understand why he should have been sad for there have been but few of his family who having received a visit from mr fox live to tell the tale  then he continued  mrs bunny was so frightened by what i told her that it looked very much as if she would die of fright but sonny bunny and i rubbed her ears hard until we finally brought her around to that point where she was able to look danger in the face as one of our kind should but i am sorry to say seldom does  if you could prevent the old robber from getting in for a time sonny and i might be able to dig out at the other end she said at length and i fancied her idea was a good one but how it might be possible to keep mr foxy fox back was a hard question to answer  however it was a case of putting my best foot forward and i crept back down the hallway so frightened that i had the hardest kind of work to walk straight the murdering old scoundrel was scratching dirt at a lively rate when i came as near the front door as i dared and it didnt take more than half an eye to see that hed soon be able to get considerably more than his nose inside  then the idea came to me that i might do a little scratching and turning around until my tail was pointed straight for the front door i kept my hind feet at work till foxy began to cough and choke at a rate that made me feel as if i were doing a pretty good job  look here you longeared old hopper you stop kicking up so much dust or ill chew you into shoestrings when i get at you he cried and i knew from the sounds that he was trying to wipe the dirt from his eyes  yes and thats what you count on doing whether i kick up a dust or not i said speaking as if i were as brave and big as senator bear if you eat rabbit stew for supper tonight youll have to work for it thats what  it was quite a spell before he went to work again and i sat there ready to use my hind feet the minute he had his nose anywhere near the door knowing all the while that mrs bunny and sonny were working for dear life at the other end of the house  i hadnt much more than begun to scratch gravel again when i heard the sharpest kind of a yelp from mr fox and i couldnt help laughing out loud for i thought id most likely sent a stone into his eye but i soon found out that wasnt the cause of it  now what do you think had happened why mr mans boy tommys dog towser had happened along just in the nick of time so far as i was concerned and dear me how he was jumping into mr foxy fox talk about fighting i never heard such a row as i afterward learned nearly every member of our club was awakened by the racket and you might have searched them all without finding anything like pity for foxy  we never had any love for mr towser before but now it seemed as if he were the very nicest kind of animal that ever lived i knew mr fox was bound to get the worst of it so back i ran to tell mrs bunny when she heard the good news instead of sitting down with me to laugh she said real sharplike  dont get to feeling good too soon bunny nobody knows how many wicked animals will come around to see what is going on and when mr towser finishes the job we may find ourselves nearer to a stew than before sonny and i have nearly finished making another door and the best thing you can do is to close up the front one while mr foxy fox and mr towser are so busy then well go over and visit your cousins till we can build a new house for i wouldnt stay in this one another night  when mrs bunny really sets her mind on anything the easiest way for me is to give in to her and back i went scratching the dirt against the door the best i knew how though i was aching to listen sos to know how long mr fox held out  i hadnt more than done my part of the work in good shape when mrs bunny came to tell me that she and sonny bunny had fixed things at the other end so i went with her because she was dragging me by one ear in a way that wasnt comfortable we found my cousins hopping around outside their home listening to the row for foxy was taking on at such a rate that you might have heard him half a mile away and none of us went to bed until the sudden stillness told that mr foxy fox wouldnt steal another chicken nor ever disturb a member of our family  it wasnt more than daybreak next morning when mr crow sent one of cheekos brothers around to tell the members of the club that there was to be a meeting on important business as soon as the sun came out strong enough to prevent any of the squires family from showing themselves  i didnt stop for breakfast but started right off and on arriving at the big oak found almost everybody i knew except those club members who dont care to meet at meal time mr crow was perched on the very tiptoppest branch of the tree looking as if he had so much business on hand that he couldnt speak without forgetting some of it and i asked little cocky robin if he knew why the meeting was to be held  dont you know what happened last night he asked looking as if he thought something was wrong in my head  ive got good reasons to know seeings how i was right in the thick of it i said bristling up my fur sos to make me look mighty fierce if it hadnt been for me mr towser wouldnt have had such a chance at mr fox  what did you have to do with it he asked cocking his head in what i always thought a most impudent manner do you know he puts on more airs and graces than a peacock simply because hes the only bird that has a red vest to go with a brown coat of course i told him the whole story though there wasnt any need for me to say that id been frightened nearly out of my wits and before id finished mr crow called the meeting to order  you know how well the old fellow loves to talk and it seemed on this morning as if his tongue ran on wheels he began by telling all about the row which mr weasel kicked up with the squire and it seems according to his story that the head of the owl family had been killed as he had a good right to be after mr weasel got a grip on his neck then he spoke about the trouble mr foxy fox had caused us members of the club and announced that the longtailed villain was dead too with his skin most likely nailed up on mr mans barn that very minute  never a word did mr crow say about what id done toward fixing foxy so he couldnt do any more mischief and try as i might i couldnt get in a word edgewise in the way of explaining that if it hadnt been for me mr mans boy tommys dog towser wouldnt have had a chance to get the best of mr foxy fox  all hands of us were pretty well tired out before mr crow got right down to the business of the meeting and i was seriously thinking of hopping off home without waiting to hear why we had been called together when he came to the point  theres no more influential club in the big woods than the fur and feather association he said speaking in a dreadfully hoarse voice because of having talked so long that his throat was dry it is time we took an active part in outside affairs else we may expect to lose many a nights sleep by such a rumpus as was kicked up last night  what do you count on doing about it mr blue jay who had come in late asked with a laugh if mr weasel meets squire owl when hes out on one of his killings how can we stop him from murdering the pompous old bird who has done some harm to nearly every one of us and if mr mans boy tommys dog towser comes across mr foxy fox when hes up to mischief how can we lend a hand even if we want to it seems to me that last nights work was a good thing for us members of the fur and feathers and were the last who should be mourning over it  mr crow looked at mr jay savagely but it takes more than a hard look to disturb that bluecoated fellow and instead of being frightened he actually laughed in the presidents face  we havent come together to mourn because the squire and mr foxy fox got themselves killed mr crow said ruffling up his feathers till he looked a good deal like mr porcupine our duty is to take such measures as will prevent people like mr weasel and mr mans boy tommys dog towser from disturbing the peace this part of the big woods belongs by rights to this club and we must take such steps as will prevent evilly disposed people from jumping down on those of us who mind our own business without working harm to any one else  now do you know that seemed to sound very comical to mr jay and he didnt have any better manners than to laugh right out in meeting making such a racket with that shrill voice of his that youd have thought more than a dozen birds were trying to see which could make the most noise  mr crow waited till the illmannered jay had quieted down a bit and i could see that the old fellow had all he could do to keep his temper which is not to be wondered at when you consider that the president of the club was only trying to protect the members against those who had no business in that part of the big woods then he said turning to some of us of the fur section who were not so impudent as to interrupt  there is no reason why we should not forbid certain birds and animals from venturing on these premises and once that has been done we shall live in peace to say nothing of being able to sleep the whole night through without interruption  there was so much good sense in this remark that i clapped my paws to show my appreciation of it when suddenly we heard a dreadfully rough voice cry  are you foolish creatures really thinking itll do any good to forbid our doing this or that  looking up quickly whom should i see but the professor who was slowly circling around the tree as if trying to make up his mind which of us he would invite to breakfast oh me oh my what a scurrying there was to get under cover i went into the thorn bushes head first nearly scratching my eyes out and cheekos brother followed close at my heels while as for mr jay he flew off with a screech for more than one member of his family had gone to dinner with the professor and never come back  then if youll believe it that miserable hawk lighted on the very lowest branch of the tree where he could have an eye on all of us who had taken to cover and cheekos brother said to me his teeth chattering with fear so badly that i could hardly understand a word  now were in the soup for certain if one of us makes the littlest kind of move that villainous old professor will pounce down i wish mr crow had attended to his own private matters instead of calling us together where rather than protecting ourselves were likely to give that old scoundrel a breakfast  keep under the sharpest thorns no matter how badly your coat may be torn i whispered and the professor cocked his eye at me in a way that told he was figuring how he could best get his claws in my back  at this moment mr bunny chanced to see a particularly tempting bunch of clover and he leaped toward it without seeming to consider that it would have been more polite first to bring his story to a close     chapter vi  mr mans boy tommy   i suppose you think id have shown better manners if id asked you to excuse me before i lit out for that clover eh mr bunny rabbit asked as he hopped up on the log with his mouth filled with clover heads and leaves the trouble is that you dont know much of anything about it he added chewing meditatively on the green delicacy while he gazed at a clump of ferns as if fancying it concealed an enemy  if you were better acquainted with us wood folk youd know that jimmy hedgehog is hiding over there in the ferns watch and you can see them waving directly against the wind which tells that something heavy is moving among them when i caught sight of those delicious clover heads i could see that young hedgehog was getting ready to go for them the only thing that held him back was the fear that you might try to make trouble for him i had to scoop them up lively or theyd gone into jimmys stomach while you were asking questions i may not be able to make such a terrible show of fighting but when it comes to getting the best of whatever is being passed around your mr bunny rabbit doesnt often get left more especially if jimmy hedgehog is the only fellow he has to beat  oh yes i was telling how the club meeting wound up when professor hawk came around to make trouble well as i was saying cheekos brother and i were snuggled together under the thorns watching that wicked bird out of both eyes and thanking our lucky stars that the old squire wasnt alive to take a hand in the game then that foolish squirrel got it into his head that he could run faster than the professor could fly and declared that he wasnt going to get the life scratched out of him simply because a hungry bird had made up his mind to eat us  im going right out as a decent fellow should who doesnt want others to call him a coward and youll see how ill get the best of the smartest hawk that ever lived he said shaking his tail as well as he could amid the thorns  now youre talking like cheeko and showing yourself to be just as foolish i said trying hard not to let him see that i was angry because he hadnt better sense if your brother hadnt tried to prove that he wasnt a coward he wouldnt be sick in bed this very minute youd better stay where you are for you wont find many such snug hiding places as this not if you search the big woods from one end to the other  if i couldnt take care of myself better than you do id hide my head he said pert as you please of course it isnt right to expect very much of a fellow whose hind legs are twice as long as his front ones and i dont suppose you can help being afraid of your own shadow  now im willing to admit that im not the bravest animal that ever lived but it isnt pleasant to be talked to in such a manner by an impudent youngster like cheekos brother and i resolved that i wouldnt open my mouth again no matter what folly he might attempt because i held my tongue he thought hed make me ashamed of myself and went on worse than ever saying that he wasnt afraid of the professor with all his family behind him that he wouldnt stay among the thorns any longer than he pleased and a lot of cheap talk like that which went to prove that he was as impolite as he was silly  all the while he ran on like that he kept working his way through the thorns and i could see that the professor had his eye on him sharp as a needle cheekos family are all alike forever thinking they must do something no matter how foolish to show that they are dreadfully brave when according to my way of thinking they are only proving themselves silly  well cheekos brother kept creeping nearer and nearer to the edge of the thorns looking back at me every once in a while as if believing id be scared out of my wits because he was so venturesome but i never opened my mouth and finally he said with a flirt of his tail  nows the time when i will show that old hawk how much he knows about catching squirrels  it was exactly as cheeko would have spoken and i could but feel sorry for him even though he had insulted me he stood at the edge of the thorn bushes a minute twisting and turning his tail as if he wanted to attract the attention of every member of the club to his folly and then out he went running the best he knew how across the open space at the foot of the tree  now if youve ever had any acquaintance with the professor you know hes not slow by any means and cheekos brother had given him all the notice he needed that the foolish squirrel was going to show off before the other wood folks mr weasel himself couldnt have moved more quickly than the professor did i saw him twist his head as if to get a better view and then down he came faster than you could wink your eye  of course cheekos brother didnt have half a chance he hadnt much more than well begun to run when the professor had him in his claws and oh me oh my how that squirrel did squeal it wasnt any use to howl after hed just the same as coaxed the professor to catch him and there wasnt a member of the club who didnt insist that hed been served exactly right  if an animal is brave there isnt any need of his running around telling people mr crow said when the professor and cheekos brother had disappeared but if he sticks his nose into danger just for the sake of showing folks how clever he is he not only shows that he is mistaken as to the meaning of the word brave but has proven himself very foolish  you may believe it or not but its the solemn truth that there wasnt one of the wood folk who felt sorry for cheekos brother and thats saying a good deal for as a rule were all broken up when anything like that happens especially when it is done right on the clubs premises  cheeko himself will come to just such an end and for that you may take my word mr jay said as he straightened out his feathers which had been ruffled a good bit when he flew off so suddenly to get out of the professors way  well hope that the lesson he has just had will teach him to have better sense in the future mr crow replied for the old fellow always looks on the bright side of everything and mr jay added in an angry tone  but it wont and that you may depend on ive lost all patience with the squirrel family they go chattering and scolding around as if they owned the whole of the big woods and ive yet to see one of them raise a paw toward helping a neighbor  before any one else could speak we heard a terrible noise among the bushes and had no more than well hidden ourselves when up comes mr mans boy tommy with one of those miserable slings on a forked stick and it went without saying that he had a lot of small stones in his pocket ready to shoot at the first one of us even including mr crow who should show himself of course he cant kill anything with such a toy but it is possible for him to hurt a fellow mighty bad as i know to my cost  why do you know not a great while ago i was hopping across the path that leads to mr mans barn when that wretched boy aimed straight for me and whats a great deal worse hit me with a small stone just behind the ears i really thought for the moment that i had got what id never recover from i did manage to hobble away of course else i wouldnt be here today but my head ached for two or three days as though it would split open i cant for the life of me imagine why boys find so much sport in hurting animals  illustration we heard a terrible noise among the bushes  well there was the boy tommy and in his hand was the sling with a little stone in it ready to be fired mr crow had crept around the trunk of the tree hoping to keep out of sight but the boy looking for something to shoot at espied the old bird and in another second the president of the club flew away crying caw caw caw with all his strength mr mans boy tommy shot at him but mr crow wasnt there so he didnt get hit  it seemed to me that the moment had come when i should take to my heels for i was hidden only by a few mullein leaves and tommy wouldnt have to hunt very long before he stumbled right over me while he was putting another stone in the sling i jumped out from under the leaves and headed straight for home but unluckily for me the boy got a glimpse of the tip of my tail short though it is as i darted through a clump of alders  now it so happened that lying on the ground where he could get at it handily was a piece of halfdecayed wood which had most likely fallen from the big oak a long while before and if youll believe it that boy had time to pick it up and shy the thing at me before i got out of sight not once in a hundred times could he have hit me but it so happened that this was the unfortunate once and i was knocked head over heels into the brook so nearly stunned that i was almost drowned before i came to myself  when i did get my senses that miserable boy was just reaching out his hand to pick me up and you never saw a rabbit struggle as i did then being in the water and not knowing how to swim it was quite a task to get out quickly more than once he had his fingers on my ears but each time i contrived to wriggle away and at the very moment when it seemed as if i must give up and go into the stew or pie as his mother should decide i gave him the slip  i was wet as a drowned rat the mud stuck to my hair until it seemed as if my coat were twice as heavy as usual and i was sore all over from the blow but yet i could run faster than he and if ever a rabbit put his best foot forward it was i i had never believed he could move as quickly as he did then and no matter how i struggled he kept uncomfortably near my heels till just as i darted around a clump of mullein stalks whom should i come plump upon but mrs rabbit herself  gracious me bunny what a disgraceful condition you are in she cried holding up both front paws and getting ready to read me one of her long lectures but i swung her around by the ears as i said speaking queerly i suppose because of breathing so hard after the long chase  dont stop here to talk if you want to save your skin mr mans boy tommy has nearly killed me and he cant be far away this very minute run run for your life  sometimes mrs rabbit is a very sensible animal and on this occasion she took my advice running at full speed especially when she heard tommy cry  by jiminy now ive got two rabbits come on fellers the woods are full of em  of course we knew by the words that there was more than one boy out with slings and i was so tired that it didnt seem as if i could run another inch when i was knocked into the brook i somehow was turned around so that i was headed away from home and we had a long long distance to go before there was the littlest kind of a show for safety it seemed as if matters were just as bad as they could be but it appears that they were not for just then who should pop out of some tall grass but my poor little sonny bunny and those dreadful boys so close behind that i could almost hear them breathe  at this point mr bunny ceased speaking and began to chew a straw as if seeing in his minds eye the picture of that wild race for life     chapter vii  cheekos curiosity   mr bunny remained silent a long while and not until he was reminded that he had broken off his story at a very exciting point did he continue then it was to say  even at this day i am surprised that all three of us were not captured by that army of boys each of whom was armed with one of those disagreeable slingshots peashooters or whatever you choose to call them i was panting from long running and my wife so excited as hardly to know whether she was on her feet or her ears while poor little sonny bunny was so confused by seeing us in such a state that he actually quivered  of course i had sense enough to know that we hadnt a single second to spare in that neighborhood and it was up to me to save the family or go down into the stew with them i dont like to boast as do the squirrels but yet i must say that except when we come face to face with mr weasel we rabbits can do a powerful lot of thinking in a short time when we are in a holeor perhaps i should say when we want to get into our own particular hole  i twisted one of mrs rabbits ears right sharp to bring her to her senses quickly and jumping straight for sonny bunny tossed him around with my nose as i whispered  run for your life sonny and run as you never did before its up to you to see that your mother gets home before those wicked boys can lay their hands on her so move lively  sonny bunny is a good deal like me in some things and it was as if the little fellow understood the whole situation in a sniff of your nose before you could say jack robinson in case you wanted to he was showing his mother the way home his little legs twinkling like drumsticks amid the bushes  mrs bunny and sonny hadnt much more than disappeared when mr mans boy tommy was almost the same as walking all over me and i had to do some mighty lively hopping to keep out from under his feet now im not trying to make myself out the bravest fellow that ever walked but it is a fact that i had sense enough not to run straight for home as i knew the rest of the family were doing and when that busy tommy caught a glimpse of me i was steaming off as if we lived in the very middle of the big swamp of course he came after me with a whoop and a yell and if the noise was anything to be judged by there were more than a hundred other boys close at his heels  i wasnt fretting very much just then because id had a breathing spell to say nothing of knowing that mrs bunny and sonny were clean out of the muss so off i went limperty limperty limp taking my own time and leading that crowd of boys and slingshots straight into the swamp where i was allowing theyd pitch head over heels into the mud till they were in such shape that their mothers couldnt help whipping them soundly when they got home  mr mans boy tommy wasnt quite so simple as id taken him to be for when he came to the edge of the swamp he fired one shot that never came anywhere near touching me and yelled to the fellows behind  hold up or well be in the mud up to our necks whats the use of chasing a lot of rabbits that arent worth eating at this time of year when we can catch moren a thousand squirrels between now and tomorrow morning  then all the crowd began to yelli wonder why it is that boys must make a terrible noise whatever they are doingand back the whole of them trooped heading as if they counted on bringing up at crows corner  i didnt have any very important business on hand just then for it isnt pleasant to go home when mrs bunny is all haired up with excitement because at such times she seems to think matters may be smoothed by scolding at me so off i hopped after the yelling screaming cannibals counting on finding out what other mischief that boy tommy had hatched of course i kept so far behind that they couldnt see me and my mouth was stretched from ear to ear in a broad grin thinking how surprised theyd be to know i was taking my turn at chasing them  they struck a beeline for the club quarters and on arriving there loitered around with never a thought that there were plenty of chores to be done at the farm till i was tired of trying to see what was going on so off i hopped counting on paying cheeko a visit to liven him up a bit i hadnt got more than halfway to his new home when whom should i see but that same squirrel i supposed was so sick he couldnt even flirt his tail  whats all this row about he asked cross as two sticks and acting as if he blamed me because the little wretches from the farm had been making so much noise  i told him all that had happened and if youll believe it instead of appreciating what i had done in the way of getting my family out of the scrape he said with his nose turned way up in the air  youre always trying to make out that youve done something mighty smart bunny i cant see how it was possible for you to act in any way different from what you did if id been there those boys would be singing another kind of a tune by this time  it seems to me that youve brightened up considerably since mrs bunny dosed you with the herb tea i said speaking a bit crossly perhaps for it got on my nerves to have him so pert all of a sudden and pitching into me just the same as before he got hurt  if id taken very much of that nasty tea id be dead by this time and i want you to tell mrs bunny that ill just about whip the life out of sonny bunny if she ever tries to get any more of that stuff down my throat i was only shaken up a little and as soon as you meddling people let me alone i came around all right now im going to drive those boys out of the club premises if james crow cant look after things at such a time as a president should ill teach him a lesson  it provoked me to hear the foolish squirrel talking like that at a time when hed better have been in bed attending to himself but im so softhearted that it really made me feel badly to hear of his anxiety to get into more trouble before he was well out of the scrape with the professor and i said in the most friendly way you can imagine  now look here cheeko itll be wiser for you to go straight back home and stay there till your coat is mended in better shape for if one of those boys should get a fair shot at you as they did at me thered be one squirrel the less in the big woods why dont you take warning from your poor brothers fate  now i ask you if i said anything which one friend shouldnt have said to another at such a time and yet do you know cheeko went away into the air with anger youd thought id really insulted him he bristled up his tail swinging it around over his ears exactly as before he got hurt and shouted at me  look here bunny rabbit ill have you understand that i dont want any advice from you what does a burlesque imitation of a seesaw like you know about fellows in my class from this time on youll keep your tongue between your teeth when im anywhere around else both your eyes will be knocked into one and dont you forget it  i had a good deal more than half a mind to tell him i could swallow such as he without standing any chance of being troubled with dyspepsia or kick him into the middle of next week without straining my legs but i didnt want to stir up a row particularly while those boys were so near that they might have taken a hand in it so off i hopped but you may be certain i didnt go very far away on account of wanting to see what cheeko would be foolish enough to do i hid behind a lot of mullein leaves where it was possible to see what was going on near crows corner and it wasnt necessary to wait very long before that foolish squirrel came up against all he was looking for and a little more  cheeko and i had been talking quite a while and when i was where a view of the club premises could be had my surprise was great because not a single boy was to be seen i had supposed wed have them loitering around nearly all day and why they went away so quickly was more than i could make out it was while i was trying to solve the mystery that i saw at the very foot of the old oak the dearest little house that ever was built some careless person had left the door wide open and there in full view of any dishonest person who might be passing was a large ear of corn it seemed queer that the thing should have appeared there so suddenly but yet i never suspected that mr mans boy tommy had anything to do with it until i heard mr crow calling out in his hoarsest voice  youd better get away from that thing cheeko squirrel unless youre aching to spend the rest of your days in jail  then it was i saw cheeko running around and around the house looking at it from every point and chattering in that crazy way of his until you would have thought there were at least a dozen squirrels near about  i reckon i can do what i please without any interference from you jim crow cheeko cried with that exasperating chuckle of his i wasnt brought up in these woods to be scared by an owl or a crow either for that matter when im wanting advice from you ill ask for it  youd better ask quickly if theres any idea in your head of going into that place mr crow said never seeming to lose his temper though it must have been terribly trying for one of his age and experience to have a young thing like cheeko speak so saucily i saw mr mans boy tommy when he put that house there and he took good care that the corn should be seen by any who passed now he never has been very careful to do folks a good turn so im advising you to keep your nose out of the place for it must be a trap of some kind  i reckon i know as much about whats what as any old crow that ever cawed cheeko said with a laugh as he ran around to the front of the house and looked in mr mans boy tommy knows too much to set a trap for me and im going to teach him a lesson on the folly of leaving good corn where i can get my paws on it  dont go in there cheeko i cried forgetting how impertinent he had been and a moment later felt sorry i had spoken for he cried as he shook his tail with that seasick motion  mind your own business old hoppertyskip  then he made one leap for the corn counting i suppose on dragging it out in a hurry but he hadnt much more than touched it when bang down came the door with mr cheeko inside and he had found out whether mr mans boy tommy knew too much to set a trap for him  that settles cheeko mr crow cried from his perch on the tree hell stay where he is till tommy gets ready to take him out  cant we open the thing i cried running toward the foot of the tree arriving there just as jimmy hedgehog stuck his nose out of a hole near at hand to see what was going on tip it over jimmy cheeko is inside  just then a very small rabbit thrust his ears out from amid the leaves near at hand and mr bunny leaped down from the log as he cried in a tone of joyful surprise  why heres my little sonny bunny whatever is he doing so far from home     chapter viii  jimmy hedgehogs escape   mr bunny rabbit hopped around his little sonny rubbing noses with him smoothing the rumpled fur on his back and otherwise behaving as if he had not seen him for a very long time when these marks of affection had been displayed sonny rose on his hind feet as if to look his father directly in the face and wrinkling his nose in a peculiar manner seemingly began to tell a very long story to which mr bunny listened attentively wagging his ears now and then in token of admiration or disapproval  when sonny had finally come to an end of the recital he crouched on all fours directly under his fathers nose and began nibbling at some young raspberry leaves which were growing conveniently near at hand looking very much as if he was waiting for an answer to his long story or explanation whichever it may have been  mr bunny stroked his chin as if in deep thought for several seconds peered cautiously around for signs of danger scrutinized closely every bush and clump of ferns in the vicinity after which he began to talk earnestly to sonny bunny it surely seemed as if he were giving him certain explicit directions concerning what should be done for when he had come to a close the father and son rubbed noses once more after which the youngster hopped away while mr bunny resumed his position of storyteller on the log  nice looking young rabbit isnt he mr bunny asked as he watched solicitously until sonny disappeared from view amid the foliage no fellow could ask for a better son than my little sonny bunny i can count on his doing exactly what i tell him and he never goes away from home without asking permission from his mother or me  why did he come oh his mother sent him to tell me that mr man had just gone out with his gun and towser tagging on behind she was afraid he had started off to find me simply because i took a few carrots and some lettuce the other day ill have my eye on him sharp enough but it was taking a big risk to send little sonny out at such a time i explained to him exactly the route he must take when going home and cautioned the dear fellow about going into the open without first making certain that crafty dog wasnt anywhere near at hand  oh yes you want to hear the rest of the story about cheeko well there isnt a great deal more to tell im sorry to saythat is about his being trapped by mr mans boy tommy though he did get away after a long and painful experience which has taught him a valuable lesson so mr crow says  as i was saying when sonny bunny interrupted us i yelled for jimmy hedgehog to tip the little house over with his nose but you know what a clumsy thing he is and it seemed as if i should fly before he got ready to make a try while he was poking around to see how it could be done the easiest i scratched away the dirt with my hind feet making a hole for it to tumble into and last when jimmy had made up his mind i shouted for cheeko to look after himself when the thing fell sos to be ready to jump out the minute the door opened  now youd better believe jimmy and i worked hard and fast for there was no telling how soon those miserable boys might be back and all the time old mr crow was perched on the top of the oak tree giving orders as if he were the captain of the biggest vessel that ever floated  get your noses further under the house he screamed when it seemed to me as if my whole head was in the dirt and id strangle to death if id rooted the least bit deeper why dont you have some get up and go to you he yelled again and again until i just couldnt stand it any longer even if he was the president of the club and up and told him i wouldnt ruffle a hair till he got through with his foolish noise  that made him real kind of huffy and while he was shaking himself to make his feathers stand out like jimmys quills we rooted at the house till it surely seemed id dropped a stitch in my back and over she went plump into the hole id dug now wouldnt you have thought that the door would open when the thing fell cheeko declared that he couldnt see the least little bit of a crack when it tipped and after that it was all over so far as cheeko squirrel was concerned because the house was bottom up resting on the top of the door in such a way that a dozen rabbits and hedgehogs with moren a hundred crows to boss em couldnt have moved it  jimmy and i rooted and rooted the best we knew how with cheeko coaxing and crying all the time promising never to be impudent to us again if wed only get him out of the terrible fix but it was no use he was in a bad box and there was nothing we could do to help him  weve both worn the skin all off our noses and cant stir it a little bit i said feeling mighty sorry for the little fellow even if he had been rude to me whenever i had tried to do him a good turn  try it just once more bunny dear he cried and his voice sounded as if there were tears in it dont let that wicked boy tommy carry me off to one of his miserable prisons  you wouldnt take the advice of those who were older and more experienced in the world and now you must pay the price for being headstrong mr crow cawed and it made me provoked to hear him reading a lesson to poor cheeko when he was in such a peck of trouble so i said speaking as easy as i knew how  theres no use telling him about what has been done mr president he knows all that only too well and wed better spend what little time weve got before mr mans boy tommy comes back in trying to make him feel better  he would have the dose no matter what we could say and according to my way of thinking its high time he was brought up with a sharp turn for he had got it into his head that he owned pretty near all the big woods mr crow said and then he flew off to watch for tommy sos to give us fair warning for however sharp the old fellow may talk his heart is always in the right place when it comes to helping us wood folks who behave ourselves  well jimmy and i kept on trying to turn the box over again until we heard mr crow calling out that the boys were coming and then it was up to us to get out of the way unless we were willing to go further with cheeko than would be at all pleasant  weve got to skip i whispered to him putting my mouth close to the crack of the door and before i could get away he cried oh so mournfully  please dont leave me bunny dear when im in such terrible trouble  dear knows id have stayed by him until the cows came home if i could have done the poor fellow any good but i couldnt and the tears almost blinded me as i hopped off into the bushes just in time to be well hidden before that gang of young ruffians came up  hurrah weve got a squirrel mr mans boy tommy cried as he picked up the box and squinted into it hurry and well put him into that cage we made yesterday  then off the whole crowd ran and poor cheeko with them id forgotten all about jimmy hedgehog because of feeling so sorry for cheeko and was wiping my eyes with my ears when he squeaked poking his nose out of the hole he had dodged into when the boys came up  whats the reason we shouldnt go and see what they do with cheeko it wont be much of a trick to keep out of sight and follow them at the same time  i hadnt anything in particular to do just then and if youll believe it i forgot that mrs bunny had told me not more than half an hour before that mr man was out trying to kill something  off jimmy and i went mr crow calling after us as he saw us hopping along in the direction of mr mans barn  youd better take care of your own hides instead of following that foolish cheeko who hasnt got a thing more than he deserved  youre a hardhearted old bird jimmy cried and a deaf man could have told by the sound of his voice that he was angry theres just a chance that we can help the poor fellow  help nothing mr crow cried sharply and off he flew as much as to say that he washed his claws of us both  well i couldnt help feeling just a bit nervous after the old bird had warned us but yet strange as it may seem even then i didnt think of what mrs bunny had told me about mr man i followed jimmy though and it didnt take us long to come up so near the robbers that we could hear them telling what they counted on doing with poor cheeko from all i could make out they had some kind of prison with a wheel in it and there hed be made to run round and round till he couldnt run any more  of course we had to hang back when coming within sight of the barn and then i coaxed jimmy to go back to the old oak but he allowed hed see the last of cheeko no matter what might happen and it really seemed as if i ought to stay with him after all hed done in the way of helping me with the little house so i told him id hang round for a spell but id draw the line at going any nearer the barn  well we stayed there in the bushes a while without being able to see very much although we could hear the boys talking and then jimmy said speaking as if he were all out of patience with me  im going to see what they are doing if youre afraid you can wait here till i come back  i said all i could to prevent him from running his nose into danger as cheeko had done but he wouldnt listen so i crept further into the bushes and off he toddled how long i stayed there it would be hard to say but it seemed as if two or three hours had passed when i heard mr crow saying his voice sounding as if he were a long distance away  look out for your hide jimmy hedgehog for here comes mr man with a gun and a dog  then of course i remembered what mrs bunny had told me and although i was so frightened that my teeth chattered i couldnt help creeping out a bit to see what jimmy was doing i had just got into a place where it was possible to have a full view of the barn when whom should i see but that foolish jimmy standing on his hind legs looking from one side to the other but never behind him where was mr man creeping along as if he were making ready to shoot  oh me oh my how i tried to scream for him to turn around but my lungs are not very strong as you know and i couldnt have made him hear me if he hadnt been half as far away but mr crow was on the watch and he screamed as he flew down almost directly across jimmys face  cant you see an inch behind your back silly beast ive been telling you over and over again that mr man was out looking for such as you  you never saw a hedgehog jump as jimmy did then he hadnt paid any attention to anything except what the boys were doing and now he made up for lost time it seemed to me as if he turned more than four somersaults before he struck the ground and even while he was leaping bang went mr mans gun i couldnt see whether my friend had been hit or notdear dear youll have to excuse me a minute more for there is mrs bunny shaking her ears at me now what do you suppose she has got on her mind  then mr bunny jumped off the log hurriedly running toward a bunch of ferns which were swaying to and fro although there was not a breath of wind stirring and there was nothing to be done save wait until he should be at liberty to conclude the story     chapter ix  fooling mr fox   it was fully ten minutes before mr bunny brought the conversation with his wife to a close and then she hopped away as if very angry looking over her shoulder now and then at him as he jumped up on the log again  yes that is mrs bunny he said with a sigh as he stroked his whiskers thoughtfully do you know that foolish rabbit thinks im wasting my time sitting here telling you stories about the club members because she wanted me to run over to mr mans farm for more young carrots upon my word im almost ashamed to call on him so often it really seems as if i and other members of the rabbit family had gathered more than half his crop already and surely he ought to have a few after he has spent so much time planting them for us and his boy tommy has very nearly broken his back at the weeding  there isnt the least little bit of danger in running over there especially if he has gone out with towser as she said and i asked why it was that a big fellow like sonny bunny couldnt go after a few carrots when his father had other business on hand then if youll believe it she almost the same as accused me of being willing to send sonny into danger because i was afraid to go myself and i the very rabbit who killed grandfather fox  well i didnt really put him out of the world with my own paws but i led him into a trap where mr man found him later and if that isnt the same as killing him id like to know what it is mrs bunny is forever wanting carrots if her head aches theres nothing to be done but get young carrots when theyre in season i mean if she gets nervous about sonny bunny then the only thing to straighten her out is a bunch of carrots and so it goes on all the time till im actually worn down to skin and bones ministering to her whims  how did i kill grandfather fox thats a long story but ill tell it to you as soon as i finish with jimmy hedgehogs narrow escape and surely he did have the slimmest squeak for his life that ever any animal had when mr mans gun went off at the very minute jimmy jumped i thought for certain he was a gone hedgehog and was wondering whether i couldnt get mr crow to go and break the news to his family but a minute later i saw the bushes waving furiously over by the stone wall then i looked around for the dead body and so did mr man but it wasnt there cause why cause jimmy wasnt anywhere near dead  how mr man did scold because he didnt find any hedgehog lying around loose he blamed it on the gun then he declared that it was all owing to old mr crow and vowed hed spend the rest of the week hunting for the president of the club just because he had warned jimmy well he might hunt two weeks for mr crow and unless he came upon him when the old fellow was asleep ill answer for it he couldnt kill him for the president of our club is always wide awake  do you know ive seen mr man his boy tommy and two of the servants out looking for that same old crow and shooting off their guns till youd thought it was fourth of july and yet never a single tail feather belonging to mr crow was rumpled when you catch mr weasel asleep you may kill that bird but not before  of course when i saw that jimmy had got away i started off after him for it wasnt pleasant to stay there while mr man was in such a rage because he might try to get even with me on account of the carrots so off i toddled taking precious good care to keep under cover all the while till i came to the big oak and there was jimmy washing his face i cant make out how he succeeds in doing it without nearly killing himself with the quills that stick up all over his body  he never touched me jimmy said with a grin when he saw me and i thought that was a good time to read him a lecture on the wicked folly of being so careless when he knew as well as i do that everybody on the farm is ready to kill one of the hedgehog family though why people should be so down on jimmys folks i cant make out for they mind their business as a general rule  you neednt talk to me jimmy said before id more than half spoken what was in my mind after that jump of mine ill back myself against the whole farm gang  but youd have stood there like a silly till your head was shot off if it hadnt been for mr crow i said just a bit provoked because jimmy seemed to take all the credit of the escape to himself  how do you know he asked speaking as pert as ever did cheeko you cant tell but i was getting ready to jump at the very minute mr crow came sailing around as if hed gone crazy  now what do you think of such talk as that from a fellow who had barely pulled through by the skin of his teeth i didnt waste any more time on him but walked off and then was the time that i killed grandfather fox you see the old fellow had been after my scalp more times than ive got claws on my paws and it so happened that i always gave him the slip without trying very hard but mrs bunny had said to me over and over again  dont crow bunny at least dont crow so loud dont you know that pride goeth before a fall some day youll meet grandfather fox where hell have the best of it and then sonny will be without a father  i made believe laugh when mrs bunny said such things but way down in my heart i was frightened for it stood to reason that i couldnt always expect to come off best when i ran up against an old villain like him but what could i do you wouldnt expect that id stay at home every minute just because of being scared why everybody in the big woods would be laughing at me worse than ever they say now that im afraid of my own shadow but it isnt true as any one who ever saw me dancing in the moonlight can testify besides it is my business as the head of the family to do the marketing and if i laid at home snug mrs bunny and sonny would stand a chance of starving to death  you can put it down in your hat that i was mighty cautious however whenever i went out for i said to myself that if grandfather fox ever got his teeth into my back it wouldnt be owing to my own carelessness  well as i was saying i walked away when jimmy hedgehog began to make so much foolish talk and just for the moment had forgotten all about that miserable fox when whom should i see staring straight at me but the old fellow himself and by the way he was licking his chops i knew he felt certain i was his meat at last but the matter wasnt settled by considerable for he was on one side of a barbedwire fence and i on the other so there was something to be done before he could put me into a pie  you can make up your mind that i did a power of thinking in a few seconds and even if i am just the least little bit cowardly when it comes to fighting im a master hand at finding my way out of a bad scrape that very morning i had seen mr man and his boy tommy setting a big steel trap down at the edge of the swamp on the very side of the fence i then was and it seemed to me as if it might do me a world of good just at that time  goodmorning grandfather i said mild as milk and staring at the wicked old fellow as if he were the best friend a lone rabbit could possibly have  how well you look bunny he said opening his mouth till i could see every tooth he had and knew he was longing to stick them into me i dont believe i ever saw a prettier coat than the one you have on there was a time after you had met the squire when it was rather ragged  ive had it mended since then and i laughed as if believing he had said something terribly funny for even if im not the bravest animal in the world i wouldnt let a mangy old fox think i was afraid of him no matter how scared i might be  you and i havent been very good friends in the past but it isnt too late to change all that and he came close up to the fence as he spoke while i looked over my shoulder to see that the way was clear for running as i said  ive always been busy when you wanted a chat but now that were on the opposite sides of a fence and the barbs on the wires are mighty sharp theres no reason why we shouldnt get better acquainted  thats what i would like and he grinned till i could see halfway down his throat the only trouble is that ive got a dreadful cold and it tears me all to pieces to speak loudly enough for you to hear why not come on this side or wait till i can get over on that and then we can talk at our leisure  thats what id like to do and i shook my ears in a way such as i knew provoked him but mrs bunny says that colds are catching and i wouldnt like to run the chances of taking yours  then he wrinkled up his nose as he looked around to find a way to jump at me without taking the risk of getting torn pretty near to pieces on the barbs and dont forget that i kept my ears moving mighty fast for there was no telling when my legs would be needed to save my skin it wasnt many seconds before i saw his tail begin to swing from one side to the other and i knew hed made up some plan in his mind so i said free and easy like but keeping my eye on the path all the while  i know youd like to have me stay with you longer grandfather fox but were expecting company at our house tonight and i must be moving else mrs bunny will begin to think ive fallen in with rogues perhaps when we meet again ill have more time  then i started off limperty limperty limp as if i werent in any very great hurry and the old fellow trotted along on the other side of the fence watching out sharp for a chance to get through  it wasnt a great while before we came to where one of the wires had been broken and i knew that it was up to me to show how fast we rabbits could run for he came through with a rush as he snarled  i reckon youd better go home with me this time bunny it so happens that my wife is expecting company too and she is needing a fat rabbit like you for dinner  it would really have done your heart good if you could have seen how i skipped over the ground with that redmouthed old fellow so close behind that his breath actually ruffled the fur on my back just for a minute i began to think that i had taken too many chances and would really go home with the villain for one of his strides was equal to three or four of mine and he was putting in his best licks as i knew only too well having been chased by him many a time before  then and it wasnt any too soon i can tell you we came to the clump of bushes where i knew mr man and his boy tommy had hidden the trap and youd better believe i gathered my legs under me for the jump of my life for if i made a mistake then i was done for sure  youd thought i had wings by the way i went up into the air counting on striking the bushes near the top sos not to get caught and as luck would have it i hit the mark just right over i went quick as a shot and in a jiffy id doubled back getting under cover at the very moment when grandfather fox tried the jump  the old fellow wasnt as spry on his feet as he had been the last time we had a race and when he came down instead of clearing the bushes as i had done he flopped right down into the middle of them i heard a sharp click and then such a howl as never was in the big woods before grandfather fox had landed exactly where i counted he would and bunny rabbit rocked to and fro on the log hugging his knees with his fore paws laughing until it was absolutely impossible for him to continue his story for several minutes     chapter x  bobby coons trick   mr bunny rabbit laughed so long and so hard as he thought of how he had outwitted grandfather fox that it really seemed necessary to pat him vigorously on the back lest he should strangle and then two or three minutes more were wasted as he coughed and choked  when this last spasm was at an end he wiped his eyes with the tips of his ears as he said in an apologetic tone  i really couldnt help it you know to think that grandfather fox had chased me three or four times a year since i was old enough to run by myself and that at last i should lead him into a trap from which he couldnt get out  again bunny gave way to his mirth and for a time it really seemed as if the story never would be ended but he finally drew his face down soberly wiped his eyes again and said as he continued to rock back and forth with his knees in his paws  when i heard the old fellow yelping the way he never did before i knew there wasnt any chance of his getting out of the trap else he wouldnt have made such a terrible row for fear of letting mr man know where he was so i came out where he could see me and oh how ugly he did look  so this is the mean kind of trick you fixed up to play on a poor old fox who never did you any harm he said with a whine trying to look as if hed always been a friend of mine  you never did me any harm grandfather because you couldnt catch me but if youd got your teeth in my back after coming across the fence i reckon there isnt any question but that id been introduced to the company your wife has at home i said keeping my ears bent over my back sos to get the first warning of when mr man or his boy tommy came up as i know they would after a little while  i was only trying to fool you bunny and the old fellow did his best to grin friendlylike cant you take a bit of a joke from one who has known you almost ever since you were born i knew your father before you and a right respectable rabbit he was  i suppose that was why you ate him i cried suddenly remembering that it was this same old wretch who had eaten daddy most likely you tried to make out that he was a particular friend of yours and thats why you did it  was it your father i ate asked grandfather fox as if in surprise really you make me feel badly bunny for i wouldnt hurt a single hair on the head of anybody belonging to you and you ought to know that much by this time  he didnt fool me a little bit for i knew mighty well he would snap my nose off that very minute if i should be so foolish as to give him the chance  why dont you try to tell the truth for once in your life i asked and before he could answer i heard somebody coming through the bushes making as much noise as an elephantthat is i reckon an elephant would raise just about such a racket though i never saw one but mr crow told me all about em he says hes seen moren a million in his day and i wouldnt wonder if that was the truth  it dont make any difference how much noise was being made it was time for me to show grandfather fox my heelsthat i knew without being told more than once so off i went moving mighty softly for i didnt count on letting mr man get his hands on me till after id had the pleasure of seeing that old foxs skin nailed on the side of the barn and even then its safe to say id keep my weather eye lifting pretty lively for danger on account of sonny bunny if nothing more  after getting so far away that it didnt seem as if there could be any danger i hid snug in a bush and waited it wasnt many minutes before i heard the noise of a gun and then i said that the end of grandfather fox was come but i couldnt seem to make up my mind to go home and tell mrs bunny the good news till id seen his skin on the barn and we knew there wasnt the least bit of a chance he could come to life so off i went limperty limperty limp not going so fast but that id be sure to hear if any of the farm people were nosing about when whom should i come plump up against but the president himself hiding among the leaves as if hed joined the fur section of the club  what in the name of goodness are you doing down here on the ground mr crow i asked and youd better believe i was surprised  didnt you ever hear of a birds scratching around for something to eat mr rabbit he asked cocking one eye up at me in the queerest kind of way  but you were regularly hiding mr crow i cried and do you know that mixed him up so much that if there hadnt been feathers on his head i really believe you could have seen that he was blushing  well to tell the truth i was watching mr man he said after a while and that made me more surprised than ever so i asked  why mightnt you do that better in a tree sir if i could fly as you can and wanted to see what was going on you can wager all the doughnuts mrs man ever fried that id be up high in the air where it would be possible to see what was going on without stretching my neck out of shape  as a rule i should do the same thing mr bunny but although im really ashamed to admit it this is one of the days when im afraid of mr mans gun now i wouldnt have you tell that to any living creature but somehow the sight of his gun sent the cold chills down every feather on my body hes out for business this afternoon and when i came across him he was carrying bobby coon by the tail which shows hes ready to kill anything and everything that comes his way  poor mr coon i cried and i felt mighty sorry for bobby and i had always been good friends though i must admit that he has some habits of which i dont approve do you know how he happened to play in such hard luck mr crow  i didnt see the murder done it was all finished when i flew just over mr mans head not knowing he was so near because at the time my mind was roaming across the seas where ive spent so many happy days he fired at me quicker than you could wag your ear and i heard the shot whistling about my head until i got real nervous do you happen to know what he was up to a few minutes ago  then i told the president all that had happened from the time grandfather fox met me and he said when i had finished the story  ive always claimed bunny that youre not as big a fool as you look and you can prove it by going straight home instead of hanging around here where youre in danger simply for the satisfaction of seeing mr foxs skin nailed up on the barn besides itll take mr man a good hour to do the job as it should be done  why dont you take your own advice mr crow i asked and he replied with a flirt of his tail  thats just what im about to do mr bunny i only stopped here to see what mr man was going to do with poor bobby coon but theres no more sense in my doing that than there is for you to wait for the funeral of grandfather fox im right glad hes dead even though he never killed any of my relatives but if i had a young family where a fox could get at them i shouldnt feel easy in mind a single minute when he was around although ive heard said that the crows are not what you might call real good eating  then mr crow stepped out into the open where he could have a fair chance to raise his wings and off he sailed without a single caw which shows how nervous he really was  well i began to turn about smelling the safest way home for what mr crow had said gave me the idea that perhaps i was foolish to spend my time so near the farm especially when i could come before anybody was stirring next morning to see grandfather foxs skin and just at the very minute i had hunched myself to jump who should come ambling along but bobby coon  you cant think what a start it gave me to see him after the president of our club had said he was dead if he hadnt called in a way that would have been very unnatural for a dead coon it isnt certain id stayed to meet him i was afraid it was nothing but his ghost i saw  what is scaring you bunny dont you know me  mr crow just told me you were dead that he had seen mr man carrying you home by the tail i said as soon as i could gather my wits and much to my surprise bobby said as if it was something that happened to him regularly  thats just what mr man was doing bunny and i reckon he thought i was dead all right ill tell you how it happened i was asleep on a big branch that happened to grow near the ground never dreaming there could be any danger because i was in the very middle of the big woods when mr man came along and at the very moment i awakened he hit me a clip with the end of his gun i had sense enough to understand that there wasnt any chance to get away then and instead of trying to run i fell plump on the ground lying there as if the breath had been entirely knocked out of my body which came near being the truth on account of the fallthe clip he gave me wouldnt have killed a flea well for all mr man is so big hes considerable of a fool and without stopping to see if i were really dead he picked me up by the tail walking off as if he had done something very brave  bobby stopped talking then as if he had told the whole of his story but i asked  did you wiggle out of his hands  there was no chance to do anything like that bunny for he had wound my tail around two of his fingers till i thought certain hed pull it out by the roots but i had to bear the pain without grinning and i hung wabblylike as a dead coon would till we came to where grandfather fox was caught in a trap and then mr man let out a yell as if he had just found a longlost brother coons didnt amount to very much just then when there was a fox skin to be taken that would bring in ten dollars or more and down i was dropped so that mr man could gather in the fur i waited till i saw he had got well started at the work and then off i sneaked if it hadnt been for falling out of the tree and having my tail twisted in such an ungentlemanly manner id be as good as new the wood folk can talk about never catching a weasel asleep but i tell you its a pretty cold day when any of the people from the farm can get the best of brother coon unless they shoot him down before hes had a chance to show them some of his tricks  then bobby chuckled and grinned as if he had done something wonderfully smart and im not saying that he didnt but i wanted him to know that if it hadnt been for my chucking grandfather fox into the trap he might not have come off so easy and began to tell the story beginning at the very first sos hed know that some folks in the big woods were just as smart as the coon family  i hadnt got into the thrilling part of it when suddenly i heard the sound of somebodys coming through the bushes and before i could open my mouth to yell who should show himself but that miserable dog towser frightened i was so scared that for five seconds i never raised a paw and then just as bobby was ambling away at the best speed he could make i came to myself  oh me oh my how i did run instead of following bobby as i hoped towser would although i never had any grudge against a coon what should that beast of a dog do but take after me and i was so mixed up that i didnt know which way to turn but kept my nose pointed in the same direction it was when i started  bunny ceased speaking very suddenly sitting there motionless gazing at the ferns which were being swayed to and fro by the gentle breeze and it seemed best to wait until he was in the mood to continue for it was only natural that his thoughts should be unpleasant as he contemplated the treachery of towser in thus taking by surprise himself and bobby coon     chapter xi  towser and the senator   mr bunny seemed to have forgotten that he was telling a story and continued to gaze at the waving ferns as if his thoughts were very far away until it appeared absolutely necessary to ask whether mr towser succeeded in making very great trouble for him  oh it didnt amount to anything much he said with a chuckle as of satisfaction pulling himself up with a start such as he might have given at the moment he made the unpleasant discovery that mr towser was on his track of course it wasnt very great fun for me to run for my life at a time when i was scared nearly to death but before the thing was ended i had a heap of fun say what do you think of the senator anyway  dont you know him of course you know senator bear we call him the senator because he doesnt amount to half as much as he thinks he does and goes around pushing his chest out as if he were the most dangerous thing in the big woods when all of us at the club know that hes only a big bunch of fur that doesnt dare to make any kind of fight large as he is unless mr man gets him in a corner where its a case of putting in the big licks to save his own skin i do think a bear is about the most useless creature we have among us he spends the whole winter long sleeping and when he finally comes out of his den all he does is to go pottering around stealing honey from the bees or watching for a chance to get hold of what some smaller fellow has gathered in  mr crow says there are bears who really do amount to somethingbig big fellows who wouldnt think anything of making one bite of a boy like tommy man and who are the very worst kind of fighters but we dont have any such in these woods why do you know there have been lots of times when ive really felt ashamed for the senator because of his showing himself to be such a coward bobby coon has thrown it in my face more than once that im the most scared thing to be found in the big woods but ive seen the senator run many a time at the littlest kind of noise when id held my ground at least until id found out what really was the matter  you cant make out why i should be talking about senator bear when id started to tell about mr towsers chasing me eh well its because the senator got mixed up with mr towser and me a good bit before that chase came to an end i suppose you want me to go back and tell about it in what mr crow would call a proper mannerhes mighty particular about the way he tells a story and always kicks up a terrible fuss if one of us so much as wags an ear when hes holding forth with one of his longwinded yarns  let me see id got to where mr towser took after me without paying any attention to bobby coon and i was making my legs move the best i knew how being all out of breath at the beginning of the race because of having started so suddenly well i kept my nose pointed straight ahead and if id run far in that direction id brought up in the swamp where id found more water than dry land though i didnt think of anything like that at the time  mr towser made certain hed got me that time and once when i looked back over my shoulder i saw that he was laughing now do you know that helped me to put in the big licks more than anything else could have done i folded my ears back sos they wouldnt hold the wind and straightened myself out till i wasnt much thicker than a streak of daylight jumping through the bushes whenever i saw a chance sos mr towser would be forced to go a good ways round and before many minutes went by i had all my wits about me  i dont want to say anything that may sound like bragging but its a fact that when i get right down to business in the woods there arent many members of the club who can come anywhere near me for speedtheres no telling how fast i can run when it gets right down to a pinch and i was needing all my feet just then for mr towser isnt anybodys fool when it comes to a race owing to his legs being so long  well as i was saying i went through every bush that stood in the way and had just made a leap that beat anything ever done by a member of my family when what do you think i came within half an inch of jumping down the throat of senator bear who was lying on the dry moss in the sun enjoying himself of course he came up on his feet like a steel spring when i flew past him but he was too clumsy to do me any mischief and then i pulled up mighty short for i knew thered be quite a surprise party when mr towser came along  i dodged into a big bed of ferns for it stood to reason that my race had been called off on account of general conditions and there i waited stuffing my paws into my mouth sos i shouldnt roar right out loud for i was laughing till it really seemed as if there was danger id burst the senator was standing with his mouth half open wondering if it were actually a rabbit or only a little bit of sunlight that had given him such a start and then towser came around the edge of the bushes full tilt but pulling himself in mighty quick when he saw what he was up against  i saw the senators ears twitch and knew he wanted to run but there wasnt any time to get headway on so he had to stop and do the best he knew how mr towser didnt claim to be any bear dog and i reckon hed have given the biggest bone he ever saw to have been out of the scrape without actually running away there the two stood one afraid and the other scared but both knowing there wasnt any chance of keeping the peace without owning right up to being cowards ill bet six of mr mans biggest carrots that if id gone right out and coaxed them not to fight theyd thanked me with tears in their eyes for helping them out of a bad hole  the senator came up on his hind legs waving his fore paws in the air as if all he wanted was to make fur fly and mr towser growled in a way that would make your blood run cold but neither of them moved out of his tracks i was looking over the tops of the ferns wondering whod make the first move when suddenly somebody came up against me so strong that i was nearly knocked over and a great deal more scared than id be willing to admit who do you think it was why nobody but bobby coon and i felt like pulling his tail real hard because hed given me such a scare most likely i would have done it for im awfully reckless when im angry if it hadnt been that i wanted to keep my eyes on the senator and mr towser  well you know how foolish bobby coon can be without trying very hard and instead of waiting to find out how the two would fix things he whispered to me just hold your breath a minute and see me give those two great ninnies the scare of their lives then before i could say a word to stop him he scratched around among the leaves at a furious rate singing out as if he were just regularly thirsting for somebodys blood let me at em im needing just about that much meat  it was mean of bobby to break the meeting up but even though i was furious with him i couldnt help laughing till my sides really ached oh dear how those stupid things did run at the first word that foolish coon spoke they were in such a hurry to get away that they tumbled over each other and before you could say jack robinson provided youd wanted to say it there was nothing to be seen but their hind feet as they clipped it through the bushes  i gave bobby a real serious scolding for breaking up the fun so soon for i had been aching to see how much of a fight they would have made and besides i had the least little bit of a hope that the senator might have done up mr towser for there are times when that dog makes the lives of us club members a burden with sticking his nose in where it doesnt belong  illustration let me at em  if you could have seen bobby coon capering around after the senator and mr towser ran away from each other youd thought he had done the whole trick he threw out his chest as if he were the biggest thing in the woods and began telling about what the coon family had done in days past till i got provoked and said right sharply  any one to hear you talk would think you dare do almost anything  id like to know what you can scare up that i dont dare do he cried swinging his tail till the dry leaves flew around his head like mrs mans bonnet  nobody could hire you to walk around mr mans barn three times i said and the words hadnt much more than left my mouth before i was sorry that i spoke for i surely didnt want bobby to come to any harm and after the trick he had played on mr man it would be all his life was worth to go near the farm buildings because even if it could be done without his being seen by some of the people there mr towser would be certain to smell him out  id go round the miserable old house a dozen times and never turn a hair he cried trying to speak mighty brave but i could see that he wasnt hankering for any such job so i said soothinglike  i was only fooling with you bobby both you and i know there isnt a member of the club whod dare to do such a trick as that especially just now when mr towser is feeling mighty sore over his meeting with the senator  i truly believe that bobby thought i was scared nearly out of my wits by the idea of such a thing and that made him bristle up worse than ever so id think he was terribly brave  i dare go all over this farm this very night he cried as bold as a lion and if mr towser tries to be funny with me hell wish he never had been born for i wont stand any nonsense from that dog and i wouldnt if he were as big as seven of the elephants mr crow tells about  now youre talking through your hat i said and to tell the truth i was trembling all over at the thought of going where mr towser could get the best of me without more than half trying  you shall see whether i am or not he cried washing his face and smoothing his fur as if getting ready to go to a coon party ill ramble all over the place as soon as it is dark and if youve got the spunk of a flea youll come to see me fool mr mans folks  i was so frightened at the idea of his being so foolhardy that id have gone right down on my knees to beg that he stop his nonsense but just then who should come up but his cousin jimmy hedgehog and of course he had to know what wed been talking about  i wanted to keep the whole thing a secret so bobbys folks shouldnt know what a spectacle hed been making of himself but that didnt satisfy the foolish fellow and he must needs up and tell jimmy all wed said  now if you know jimmy hedgehog a little bit you know hes forever trying to stir up other people so that therell be a row and then if theres the least bit of a chance that he may get hurt he rolls himself up into a little ball with all his quills sticking straight out when even butcher weasel wouldnt dare to touch him of course it didnt take him many seconds to understand that here was the best kind of chance for getting poor bobby into a scrape and he said as if he thought i was to blame for having said anything against the foolish scheme  bobby isnt the coward you are bunny rabbit and if he says hell have fun with mr towser tonight he means it id like to see one of the coon family go back on his word if he goes you and i will go with him and then we can tell all the club members how brave he is  of course this was the kind of talk to make bobby stick to his word though he must have begun to understand by that time how foolish he was and if youll believe me i didnt dare to say straight up and down that i wouldnt have anything to do with the silly business for fear jimmy would be forever telling at the club that i was the worst kind of coward to be found in the big woodswhich im free to admit privately is the fact  once more mr bunny paused in his storytelling to gaze pensively at the ferns which were now bending the tips of their plumes beneath the heat of the sun and it seemed no more than right that he should have ample time in which to reflect upon bobby coons folly and his own timidity     chapter xii  folly not bravery   there was no necessity of reminding mr bunny rabbit that he had been telling a story for after gazing pensively at the ferns a few seconds he continued meditatively as if giving words to his thoughts rather than speaking to any one  never again not if i live to be as old as an elephant and mr crow declares that elephants stay and stay alive till the hills grow to be mountains will i ever be so foolish as to take part in any silly thing simply because of being afraid to say that i dont dare stick my nose in where it doesnt belong a fellow like me who is moving about through the big woods a good deal and who keeps his ears and eyes wide open is certain to learn a good many things in the course of his life and since bobby coon led me on that terrible chase i have come to understand that it is folly not bravery to venture into danger simply for the sake of trying to prove that a fellow isnt afraid when way down in his heart he knows that he is scared nearly out of his wits  all the members of the club say im the biggest coward to be found anywhere around and suppose i am isnt it better to let the matter go at that than for me to prove myself foolish as well by doing what i know ive got no business to do of course it is but i wasnt as wise when bobby coon declared hed ramble all over mr mans farm while all of us knew that dog towser would be on watch as soon as the sun went down and instead of saying that i wouldnt have anything to do with such folly i made it look as if i were aching to be just as foolish as he was showing himself to be  im thinking that if jimmy hedgehog had minded his own business poor bobby would have come to realize that the farm wasnt any place for him especially after hed played such a trick on mr man but jimmy must needs keep on telling me how brave bobby was and making the talk only to keep the poor fellow up to what hed said hed do do you know that silly coon strutted around throwing his chest way out and telling what hed do if mr towser interfered with him when we all know that he couldnt go up against one of that dogs paws once i got him away from jimmy and tried to show him that he would still be running the biggest kind of chances even if he contrived to sneak around the place without mr towsers smelling him but he had the bravery business on his mind and it was a clear waste of breath to say anything  i can tell you that i was trembling all over mighty bad when the sun went down but yet i didnt dare go back home as i ought to have done for fear jimmy and bobby would tell at the club that id shown myself a coward so i waited with those two till it was real dark and then jimmy said bristling up his quills to make himself look like the fiercest thing on feet  nows your time bobby get on to your job and show the wood folks that youve got the good old coon blood in your veins  just for a minute i hoped bobby would back out for he sniffed in the wind quite a spell until jimmy beginning to fear that he wasnt going to have the fun hed laid out for himself began to laugh in a mighty disagreeable way as he said  if id thought you were only bragging when you told about rambling over the farm i wouldnt have wasted my time around here  you didnt get any brag from me poor bobby said his voice trembling as if he wanted to cry im going to do just as i allowed and you two fellows want to follow me close sos to make certain i wipe up the earth with mr towser if he has the nerve to show himself where i am  did you ever hear anything so foolish as that a coon allowing that he could get away with a dog like mr towser i had to follow when bobby started but i made out that i couldnt travel very fast owing to my left hind foots being sore and youd better believe that i didnt try very hard to get a front place in the procession though i could have run all around bobby and jimmy if id tried you can set it down under your collar that i took good care to smell my way along mighty cautious cause i wasnt aching to come up against anything that outclassed me  well bobby kept straight on heading for mr mans barn and i knew enough about the lay of the land to see that hed strike the farm pretty near to where mr towsers house stood so my feet got sorer and sorer till before we were very far from the bushes it was about as much as i could do to hop jimmy kept egging bobby on and this took up his attention so much that he didnt give any heed to me for quite a spell when i heard him whispering  come on bunny do you want to miss all the fun  it was on my tongues end to tell him that all the fun wed be likely to have that night would be what we might get out of seeing poor bobby killed but i thought wed soon be having trouble enough without my trying to stir up any more just then so i said talking as if it were all i could do to keep from crying  if your tongue was aching same as my foot is you couldnt even yip  then i hung back a little more and it seemed as if poor bobby must have run ahead considerably faster for in another minute i heard mr towser growling furiously and at the same time came a squeak which told for a certainty that bobby coon had come to an end of his rambling that dog must have got the scent of us while we were a long distance away and laid low till all he had to do was snap his teeth together on bobbys back  there was no chance for bobby to play the same trick that had fooled mr man for im allowing he didnt have time to do more than let out the squeak wed heard before he was really and truly dead he had shown jimmy and me that he dared to ramble around the farm but how much had he gained by it why there isnt a member of the club who doesnt say that he deserved to be killed for making such a simpleton of himself though according to my idea jimmy hedgehog is the one who ought to have got the worst of that mixup  well the killing of poor bobby didnt satisfy mr towser he had the scent of us and after giving what was left of bobby a toss in the air to make certain there was no life left in any of the pieces he came for us at full tilt thinking to make a clean job of the party you can put it down as a fact that my left hind foot got well mighty quick just then and without waiting to see how jimmy was getting along i lit out knowing i was up against the race of my life  as nearly as i can make out mr towser must have come afoul of jimmy when he first started for me and you can put it down in your hat that that hedgehog knew how to take care of himself even if he did egg others into danger so i suppose that he rolled himself into a ball with all his quills sticking straight up then you can guess that the dog didnt do much smelling of that prickly bunch for hes nobodys fool but after looking at it a minute turned all his attention to me  now its a fact that jimmy wouldnt do me a good turn if he had the chance but this time he surely saved my life by being just where he was for if mr towser hadnt stopped hed surely caught me on the meadow where there isnt the least little bit of a chance to dodge even as it was i had to move my feet mighty fast in order to keep ahead of him and when we came to the edge of the woods i was leading by four or five lengths with the odds big in my favor because of the bushes but i had to keep on moving all the time just the same and was precious near being winded when slaperty bang i fell into a hole nearly scraping the skin from one ear as i struck the bottom  youd thought that id naturally have chuckled mightily at giving mr towser the slip so neatly but its a fact that i felt really ashamed for it did seem ridiculous that one of my family would fall into a hole while running where was i well if youll believe it id struck grandfather foxs hole and he wasnt at home on account of having his hide nailed up on mr mans barn so there i was all by my lonesome with mr towser scratching gravel at a great rate but i knew he could wear his claws way down to the flesh before getting in for grandfather fox knew how to dig a house that would protect him from dogs  i didnt have to wait so very long before mr towser got tired of scratching and then i crept out counting on going straight home for it stood to reason that mrs bunny and sonny bunny would be worried because id been away so long but before id taken half a dozen hops whom should i hear calling me but cheekos oldest boy  youre to go straight up to the club mr rabbit he said when i stopped short to look over my left shoulder for luck mr crow has called a meeting right away and all the members of both sections are expected to be on hand bobby coon is dead and old mr slowly turtle is ready to swear that he heard jimmy hedgehog stumping the poor fellow to tackle mr towser  when i got to the big oak it seemed as if every member of the club was waiting for me and i felt really bashful when the president croaked  here comes mr rabbit and now we shall be able to get at the truth of the matter for even though he hasnt very much courage he will always tell the truth  just think of that it was the same as being called a coward after all id done to prevent it and if id behaved myself in the first place poor bobby might have been alive at that very minute yes jimmy hedgehog was there and you could see that he was feeling mighty grouchy for hed rolled himself into a ball with his quills sticking out in every direction i could just see the tip of his nose and one eye and by the way he looked at me i knew he was practically threatening to serve me out if i should say anything he didnt like  mr crow didnt give me any chance to look around after he saw me eyeing jimmy for he called me up to the foot of the tree and all hands crowded near as if i were the fellow who was having a trial instead of being only a witness  it has been reported to me as the president of this club that you heard young hedgehog urging bobby coon to trifle with mr towser by doing which he lost his life you are accused of being in mr coons company at the time and those who saw you claim that you did not even so much as raise your voice against the advice which jimmy hedgehog was giving his cousin we demand from you a straightforward account of the whole matter for as members of the fur and feather club it is our duty to learn if one member has acted toward another member in an unbrotherly fashion  you might have knocked me down with a feather by the time mr crow finished his longwinded speech i wasnt so blind but that i could see jimmy wasnt the only one who would get it warm and yet i give you my solemn word i hadnt the slightest idea of telling anything but the honest truth i got up on my hind legs to answer the president when mr jay shouted excitedly  look out for your skins here comes that disreputable professor hawk  mr bunny had no more than ceased speaking as if to take a long breath when the professor sailed slowly by and the storyteller watched curiously until he had disappeared from view in the distance     chapter xiii  disciplining jimmy   i just wish i could wring that old fellows neck mr bunny cried angrily as he shook one paw in the direction of professor hawk who was slowly circling around with his eyes apparently fixed on mr rabbit squire owl the old one as well as the young one is about as bad a bird as we members of the fur section care to meet but yet i think that old pirate is worse than all the owl family put together for the squires folks cant do much mischief except in the night and the hawk gang are at it all the time  of course i couldnt wring his neck even if i got a good hold with all four paws because he can give a fellow a terrible drubbing with his wings but if i were strong enough and could bite as butcher weasel can id give him all he wanted even if i had to spend my time night and day for a week in order to do it more than twenty times ive torn my coat mighty badly through jumping into a thorn bush to get out of that fellows way and such sort of business gets tiresome after a while  the worst part of professor hawk so far as we members of the fur section are concerned is that his eyes are so sharp he can sail around in the sky so high up that a fellow cant see him and yet keep a mighty good watch on all that takes place beneath him fly he can beat any bird i know of at that way of getting around and when he drops down for a young rabbit or a squirrel the chances are that its goodbye then  of course it doesnt do any good for me to sit here and scold about the professor hell keep on at his murderous business just as long as there are animals in the big woods for him to eat so ill get on with the story i was trying to tell when he stuck his beak in where it didnt belong just keep your eye out for the old fellow for it wouldnt bother him a bit to pick me off this log with you sitting close by and call it a good joke  let me seeid come to where the club meeting was broken up by the professor and id gone into a thorn bush head first well you can set it down as a fact that i wasnt in any hurry about coming out from cover till the word had been given that he had gone and even then i took good care to have a sharp look around before showing even so much as the end of my nose i was the last one out and when i hopped through the bushes jimmy hedgehog set up a great shout about my being the biggest coward of the crowd what was the use of answering him back it wasnt because of being so terribly brave that he stayed out in the open while all the other members of the club were hunting for cover but he knew that so long as he was rolled into a ball with his quills sticking out in every direction the professor wouldnt dare to meddle with him  im thinking one reason why he made so much noise about my being a coward was that he hoped to make the others forget they had met to overhaul him for egging poor bobby on to his death if that was the scheme in his mind it didnt work for in less than half a minute after i showed myself mr crow got right down to business and it wasnt so very long before all hands knew the story as well as i did mr blue jay perched himself on the very top of the oak tree where he could sound the alarm in case the professor showed himself again and cheekos oldest child was stationed in a bush at the edge of the clearing to give warning if butcher weasel came sneaking along so we werent afraid of being taken by surprise  some of the animals say that mr crow doesnt know as much as he tries to make out but he was sharp enough to get in all the facts concerning the murder of poor bobby and when the matter was ended every member of the club knew just who was to blame for what had happened over on the farm more than once while i was answering the question the president asked jimmy wrinkled up his nose at me as much as to say that he would serve me out for telling tales on him but i couldnt help myself could i they called me a coward and perhaps theres some truth in what they say but ill never give one of them the right to say im a liar and thats what could have been said if i hadnt told the story just as it was  well after the trial was over mr crow hopped to the very tiptoppest branch of the tree and gave out what i suppose youd call the sentence he said that jimmy hedgehog wasnt to be considered a member of the club till hed shown plainly and positively that he was sorry because he had urged bobby to go where mr towser was and that while he was deprived of the club privileges no member would be allowed so much as to speak to him more than that he wasnt to put his paw anywhere near the big oak it was that part of it which seemed to make jimmy more angry than anything else and he cried out as he actually shook his fist at the president  id like to know how you can stop me from coming near this blooming old tree in case i take a notion to hover round ill have you know jim crow that you dont dare to lay the weight of your wings on me less you want to be filled so full of quills that youd have to draw your breath crosswise do you think i wont come here if i feel like it you make me tired with your club talk and the sooner you take my name off the list the better ill be pleased  then jimmy shook himself till his quills rattled and looked around to see if any members of the fur section were going to call him to account for what he had said but i noticed that he was all ready to roll himself into a ball at the first move that might be made toward him of course it mixed us all up to have such talk as that right in meeting but there wasnt any use in making a row with a fellow you couldnt hit on account of his quills so no one said anything though i noticed that mr crow hopped about mighty lively which showed how angry he was  jimmy swelled around a few minutes shaking himself every once in a while as if he were the only thing of any account in the big woods and then off he strutted looking over his shoulder now and then to learn if any one had the nerve to follow him you could have heard a nut drop just so long as he was in sight but when it was certain he couldnt hear what was said all hands began to talk about what ought to be done with a fellow who had made himself so disagreeable  leave him to me mr crow said in his very youngest voice as soon as it was possible to make himself heard i want you to understand that im not any bump on a log and before im through with jimmy hedgehog hell wish hed kept his tongue between his teeth im the president of this club and there isnt any ordinarysized member of the fur section who can bulldoze me  it almost frightened me to hear the president speak in that way for while i havent any love for jimmy it made me feel rather bad to think how tough it would be for him when mr crow started out on his trail every one of the wood folks seemed to think that something more than suspending him from the club should be done to the member who had spoken out in meeting as jimmy had and while they were telling mr crow what he ought to do i slipped off for i knew that mrs bunny was probably getting a bit angry because id been away from home so long  now do you know it never came into my head that jimmy hedgehog would try to do me a bad turn because i had told what he said to poor bobby i had to answer the questions which the president asked or id sure been brought up with a round turn and i never said a word more than just enough to satisfy mr crow but for all that it seems jimmy had it in for me good and hot  i hopped along home with my ears well back over my shoulders so i could hear if anybody was after me and was thinking what a nice time id have with some of mr mans carrots that id brought in the day before when what should i stumble over but a place on the moss which looked as if thered been mischief of some kind done there lately i had an idea i could smell blood ever so faintly but even then i didnt suspect anything was wrong at home till i crept in through the hallway and there was poor little sonny bunny all curled up as if hed been tied in a knot while his mother was washing the blood spots off his coat  whats the matter i asked feeling as faint as ever a rabbit could and mrs bunny said speaking as if it were all my fault  its something to do with that precious club of yours and if you dont take yourself out of it this very day sonny bunny and ill leave this hole for good and all  mrs bunny never did like the idea of my joining the club but she hadnt come out quite so strong before and it staggered me so much that just for the moment i forgot that my poor little sonny seemed to be in trouble it was quite a spell before i could coax her to tell what had happened and when she did speak i found out how mean a sneak jimmy hedgehog could be without trying very hard  it seems that poor sonny was lying on the moss sunning himself at the very place where i fancied it was possible to smell blood when along came jimmy of course sonny stayed where he was never thinking one of the hedgehog family would do him any harm and without saying a word jimmy lay down on the poor little fellow rolling over on him as many as six times theres no need for me to say that my dear little rabbit looked when jimmy got up a good deal like one of mrs mans pincushions for quills were sticking out all over him  you can tell your father that thats what he gets for tattling about me jimmy said in a terribly ugly voice and if he doesnt mind his business from now on ill come and fix your mother the same way  poor sonny was so frightened and hurt that he couldnt say a word and there he lay not daring to move because every time he wiggled the least little bit the quills would stick into him worse than ever till his mother found him she had just finished pulling out the quills when i came in and of course felt a good deal excited wouldnt even let me touch sonny but declared that until id left the club for good and all i couldnt come where she or the children were  it wasnt the least little use for me to promise that id take my name off the list of members next morning she insisted that i do it that very same minute and if youll believe me nearly drove me out of my own home threatening to pour hot water on me if i didnt notify the president right away that i was through with joining clubs  when mrs bunny gets really mad there isnt any sense in trying to argue with her for she wont listen and seeing that i was driven out of the hole there was nothing left but to do as she had said you cant think how bad i felt about being obliged to do it for i knew all the members would laugh at me or say i didnt dare to stand up for my rights but there wasnt any other way out of the scrape as i figured it so off i went hopping mighty slow and trying to think up what i could say to make the other fellows believe id got tired of going to the club meetings  i suppose because i was so mixed up in my mind i didnt look after myself as i would have done at almost any other time and all of a sudden there was one of grandfather foxs grandchildren standing right in front of me so near that i could have touched him with my paw now youd better believe i was frightened and i had good reason to be for if he made one snap i was a gone rabbit as i couldnt make the first jump without his nabbing me  he licked his chops thinking i suppose that a bit of fresh rabbit would taste mighty good and i couldnt help saying to myself that i was the freshest thing in the big woods else id have had better sense than to have run straight into that impudent young fox as i had he was a member of the family with which i wasnt very well acquainted but when i understood by the swinging of his tail that he was getting ready to pounce on me i said as if he were the best friend i ever had in the world  good afternoon mr fox your grandfather was an old acquaintance of mine and im mighty glad to meet a grandson of his who looks so much like him  mr fox grinned but he never said a word and i made up my mind right off quick that there wouldnt be any need for me to tell mr crow to take my name off the club list for in two or three minutes more there wouldnt be enough left of me to talk about  at this point mr rabbit ceased speaking abruptly moving his ears to and fro nervously as if he had heard something disagreeable and common courtesy demanded that the silence should not be broken save by himself     chapter xiv  mr crows plot   while one might have counted twenty mr rabbit remained in a listening attitude and then shaking his ears with a gesture which was very like that of mental relief said with a smile as he stroked his whiskers swaggeringly  do you know just for a minute i thought the smell of young mr fox was in the air when i got rid of that fellows grandfather i said to mrs bunny that a full half of all our troubles had disappeared out of the big woods with the evidence of the good fortune nailed up on mr mans barn but i had entirely forgotten that the old rascal left behind him a regular gang of children and grandchildren and i truly believe they are the worst to be found anywhere in this world to say nothing of their being able to run twice as fast as their grandfather ever could even in his best days  i wonder why it is that the fox family have such a hankering for rabbit pie stew or even plain rabbit of course they dont turn up their noses at a good plump partridge and they know how to catch him too when the snow is deep but i verily believe theres nothing goes quite so near the right spot in a foxs stomach as rabbit meat mr crow says that years and years ago when the mountains were only grown into little hills clote scarpe the great spirit who made all the birds and animals used to walk around listening to any complaint his creatures might make i wish he would come around the big woods now you can set it down as a fact that id beg him to fix it so that the first taste of rabbit would make a fox so sick that hed come pretty near turning himself inside out and then thered be a little peace for my family  no its as you say clote scarpe doesnt pay very much attention to us wood folks now and it wouldnt surprise me a little bit if it were all one of mr crows yarnsi mean about the great spirits listening to our troubles for if anything like that ever had happened it seems as if some of my people would have fixed it for us long ago yet if youd listen to mr turtle hed tell you that years and years ago before even the rocks had grown one of his greatest greatest grandfathers who didnt have any hard shell on his back went to clote scarpe and had himself fixed so that none of the animals could bite him and thats the reason why hes got a house to live in this day that even jimmy hedgehog cant harm  dont be afraid that i wont finish my story i began a while ago speaking of the fox family brought my mind to what mrs bunny and i have talked over many and many a time and i couldnt seem to help telling you about it now ill go on about the fix i found myself in when i was going up to the club to tell the president that id have to give over being a member because it was making so much trouble for me at home and do you know that very scrape with young mr fox was what broke up our meetings at crows corner its a fact though perhaps the same thing might have happened in some other way  well there i was standing face to face with young mr fox and he grinning at me in a way that said just as plain as words could have done what a good time hed have eating me goodness im trembling even now to think of what he might have done before i had a chance to wag my ear if hed known that i was the one who led his grandfather into the trap where mr man could get hold of him so easily when he didnt even speak after id talked to him so sweetly the idea came into my head that perhaps i might jump right over his back and so get out of the hole in that way but it seemed as if he must have known what was in my mind for he said with another of his beastly grins  dont try to do anything like that bunny rabbit for im a good deal more spry with my feet than ever grandfather was and id catch you on the fly  perhaps youre making a mistake as to what i was thinking about i said innocentlike as if i didnt have sense enough to go home when it rained i was saying to myself that you had quite the most beautiful tail i ever saw on one of your family  do you know that struck him just right and for the life of him he couldnt help turning his head to look at it though between you and me it wasnt anything extra in the way of a tail except for the size cheeko had a better onemore bushy and with much finer hair young mr fox took all i said in sober earnest and began waving that flybrush of his to and fro so he could see it the more plainly and then was come the time id been playing for  the very minute he turned his head i gave the jump of my life and it was as many as ten feet straight in the air beating the rabbit record by more than five inches i sailed right over a big alder bush and when i came down on my feet young mr fox had just got it into his head that id played him a trick now you can set it down as a fact that i didnt linger around there any very great while  i was off like a runaway streak of lightning the very instant i had the ground under my paws and of course young mr fox started after me but i had a good three yards the start of him and to a rabbit who holds the record for running as i do that was a mighty long distance then again i knew all the crooks and turns in our part of the big woods while grandfather foxs grandson wasnt very well acquainted in that part of the country  before id much more than struck my gait i knew i could give him the slip whenever i wanted to and it seemed as if it would do the foolish fellow a world of good to teach him a lesson that he wouldnt forget right away so i set about doing it to the queens taste first i took a turn over by the pond where the ground was so wet in spots that hed sink in two or three inches at every leap while by skimming along the edge i was tiring him out which was what i didnt want to do till hed got it considerably harder than he had up to that time  illustration straight in the air  then i tore round by the head pine tree where senator bear lives thinking that perhaps the old fellow himself might like to take a hand in the game but he wasnt at home after that i hiked it up hemlock hill where i could run under the fallen timber and through the thorn bushes while hed have to show what he was able to do in the way of jumping or go a long bit around  that was the part of the race that broke his heart and when i circled over the top allowing id give him a sight of the clubs meeting place i saw him sitting down trying to pull a thorn out of his left hind foot then i laughed and cut capers till he started down the hill again on his way home after which i went off hippertyhop saying to myself that it would do poor little sonny bunny a world of good when i told the story to him  of course i had to go right past the big oak in order to get home and when i was there the most sensible thing i could do was to stop and have a chat with president crow for i wanted to tell him how well id served out young mr fox  old mr crow was roosting mighty low that day talking with bobby coons brother and when i told him what had happened he laughed till the tears got all mixed up with feathers on his cheeks for he had heard young fox telling squire owl that he was going to make the rabbit family look mighty sick as soon as he had time to attend to the matter  well after wed had a good time over what id done and when bobbys brother had gone away i up and told mr crow that i had to leave the club that very day else thered never be any more peace at home for me the news surprised him terribly as i understood by the way he kept smoothing out his tail feathers and it was quite a spell before he could seem to say anything but when he did speak it was the kind of talk that counted  well be sorry to lose you from the club bunny he said for even though you dont cut any great figure in helping the business along we can always count on you to do the running about when the house committee want to send out notices or if it is necessary for me to call a special meeting of course i dont want to advise you to do anything which may make trouble at your home but its my solemn advice for you to leave your name on the rolls till ive had a chance to talk with mrs bunny perhaps shell look at it in a different light when ive shown her how much good youre getting from keeping company with the other wood folks  now i had a pretty good idea that mrs bunny would take a broom to the president instead of listening to him if he went to my home while sonny bunny was so sick and i told him as much breaking it gently so he wouldnt get angry but bless you he didnt seem to mind it hes been around the world so much that hes got a mighty good idea of how things may be at a fellows home when one of the children has been abused  ill tell you what it is mr bunny he said ruffling the feathers on his neck as he always does when hes got some big scheme in his mind jimmy hedgehog is the one whos responsible for all the trouble weve been having and if i can find mr turtle at home ill rig up a plan thatll make mr hedgehog wish hed never been quite so pert with the president of the fur and feather club i dont count on letting that prickly young chap run things his own way around crows corner  what do you count on doing i asked for i was dreadfully curious by the time hed got through talking  leave it to me bunny rabbit ive been out of the shell too long to stand such nonsense from a hedgehog but at the same time i dont count on letting you into one of my secrets till the plans are all laid well go around by the way of your home and there ill tell mrs bunny what youve said about leaving the club thatll keep her quiet for a while or at least calm her down so you and she can live in the same house a bit longer and if my plan works as i think it will shell be so tickled that you wont hear anything more about her wanting you to keep away from crows corner  of course i let him have his own way for being old hes so headstrong that you cant stop him from doing what hes set his mind on no matter how foolish it may be but i wasnt much surprised after we came to my home and id called mrs bunny out of her hole to hear her talk quite disrespectfully to him about the club which she declared was nothing more nor less than an excuse for us animals and birds to idle our time away when we should be at home attending to household affairs  he didnt seem to lose his temper a little bit even when she talked the most but kept on trying to soothe her by saying that the only trouble wed ever had in the big woods among ourselves had been caused by jimmy hedgehog but wed hear nothing more of that kind after his plan had been worked out  mrs bunny smoothed down a little before he left and when he flew off i went into the bedroom to see poor little sonny bunny though i was just fairly dying to know what it was mr crow counted on doing to jimmy and why it was necessary for him to see mr turtle  sonny bunny was looking pretty bad when i went in but he perked up a good bit after i told him how id served out young mr fox and before a great while he began to play around just as ever though he was mighty careful not to rub up against anything on account of being so sore in the places where jimmys quills had stuck into him  it was the longest while before mrs bunny would so much as listen to my going out again to see what mr crows trick might be but after id talked so much about it that she began to grow a bit curious herself she agreed that it would be all right if i didnt stay more than an hour and took good care to keep away from the fox family  well i kissed sonny bunny who cried to go with me as he might have done if only his mother had been willing and then off i hopped puzzling my brain to guess what part mr turtle could have in mr crows plot     chapter xv  mr turtle   now if you had known the president of the fur and feather club as long as we wood folks have youd believe that when he laid himself right out to do a thing it would come pretty near to being finished way down to the ground mr bunny rabbit said as he continued his story after a pause no longer than might be necessary in which to draw a long breath mr crow as well as said that we folks in the big woods wouldnt have any more trouble with jimmy hedgehog after he got through with him and i counted that hed come pretty near keeping his word  if he hadnt said that he couldnt work his plan without mr turtle id been perfectly willing to stay at home till he finished the job whatever it might be but when he talked as if old slowly was the only one who could help him i got agitated just think of it getting a fellow to help you who makes a twodays journey of it from the pond to the big oak it twisted me terribly to figure out what mr turtle could do to help the president and i really had to leave home the very minute mrs bunny was willing to see how the thing was going to be worked  the first place i struck for was the big oak and there was mr crow roosting on the very tiptoppest branch looking as if hed been asleep for a month he didnt pay the least little bit of attention when i spoke to him and just for the minute i thought id best go back home without sticking my nose into any of the old fellows plans but if i did that there wouldnt be any rest for me the whole of that night so off i hopped into the open where he couldnt help seeing me if he lifted his head and then i shouted  hi there president crow hello  i must have made considerable noise toward the last for suddenly the old bird raised his head with a jerk as if hed heard butcher weasel coming after him and looked around as if frightened till he saw me then he shook himself so that the feathers on his neck ruffled up as if he were ready for a fight and asked crossly  is that you mr rabbit  of course i told him it was i as i stood right out there for all hands to see and if it hadnt been for making trouble when it didnt seem to be necessary id have something to say about the president of such a club as ours asking questions when he knew full well what the answers were  why are you loitering around here why dont you go home and do up your chores before dark he croaked in a way that didnt please me a little bit for im not the kind of rabbit that neglects his family except perhaps when theres something important on hand for me to watch and i told him so plainly but he croaked again  im still wanting to know why you dont go home there wont be any meeting of this club till nearly sunset and perhaps not then unless jimmy hedgehog gets into trouble  thats why im here mr crow i said quickly getting excited again im just regularly dying to know how old slowly turtle can do anything to help along the plan you said youd worked out  come around about sunset and perhaps youll see a thing or two he said and then stuck his head under his wing as if he were nearly dead for want of sleep  there didnt seem to be any sense in hanging around after that for when mr crow makes up his mind not to talk mr man himself couldnt drag a word out of him and off i went hippertyhop as if it werent in my head to go anywhere in particular but i was headed for the pond because id made up my mind to know what was to be done and that before it happened even if i had to hang around all night it was well that i felt so determined else id have missed the biggest part of the fun and dont you think that we didnt have lots of it before dark  it didnt take me many minutes to go to the pond for i skipped along at my best speed after i was so far away that mr crow couldnt see me and there i found old slowly lying out on the sand as if he were in the last stages of consumption  whats the matter mr turtle i asked for even though i dont like the old fellow any too well it pays to be polite and really just for a minute i was afraid hed make up his mind to die  ive got a terrible toothache mr rabbit he said stretching his neck out of the shell till it looked like a snake and when hed got as far as that i couldnt help laughing right in his face for anybody who ever heard mr turtle knows that he hasnt got a tooth in his jaws and never had  im in a bad way mr rabbit he went on making as if he didnt see me laughing and i dont know whatll happen if i cant get better mighty soon  is there anything i can do to help you i asked though i knew there wasnt for how can you cure the toothache for a fellow who never had any teeth  i dont reckon you can mr rabbit theres only one person in all the big woods who could do me the least little mite of good he said with a groan that sounded as if a spring inside of him had broken and was whirling around to beat the band  who is it you want i asked never so much as dreaming what kind of an answer hed make and he sobbed out as if he had already begun to die  jimmy hedgehog is the only fellow who could do me any good but im afraid ill draw my last breath before he comes around this way  you could have knocked me down with a feather when he said that for i knew it was some part of the plan mr crow had hatched up but i was more in the dark than ever and so would you have been of course i didnt let on that i knew the president of the club had been down that way and asked as innocent as any lamb  how is it possible that jimmy can help you mr turtle  i was eating a snail and must have got a piece of his shell in my teeth if jimmy would let me have one of his quills for a toothpick i might get it out  now what do you think of that talking about toothpicks when he didnt have even the shadow of a tooth to use them on well im not the kind of rabbit to miss any fun and knowing mr turtle wouldnt explain his plan to me however hard i might coax i said as if i believed all the hot air hed been giving me  if you think you must really see jimmy ill do what i can to find him  my dear bunny if youd do that much for a poor fellow like me who cant get over the ground as you can id never forget the favor as long as i live you are the one person in all the big woods who can get around quickly enough to save my life  i didnt wait to talk with him any longer for what would be the use when he was ready to tell me anything for the sake of shutting my eye so off i went putting in my best licks to be on hand when the fun began  do you know i had the job of my life finding jimmy it seemed as if he knew i was looking for him and he was doing his best to keep out of my way luckily i happened to see mr jay and he told me hed seen jimmy under a lot of fir bushes over by the swamp acting as if hed been taken with a bad fit of the sulks and sure enough i found him there but he didnt look as if he were very glad to see me  howdy jimmy i said soft as silk when id gotten over making believe i was surprised to see him there anything gone wrong that youre tucked away here where even professor hawk would have hard work to find you  now dont try to be funny he growled and just for the minute i was afraid we might have a row then and there because he was in such a bad temper id like to know what business youve got running all over the country looking for me  but i havent been running all over the country jimmy i said speaking softly because i didnt want to have any trouble come to think of it now that youve reminded me i did want to find you on account of slowly turtle  ive had enough of you he snarled bristling up his quills as if he counted on sticking some of them into me after the way you went back on me in that scrape bobby coon got me into im through with the whole rabbit family from this out just keep your eye on me and youll see that ill even up that business before im many days older  of course i couldnt have him holding out against me like that for i knew he might make lots of trouble if he tried very hard and then again it didnt seem right to blame me for what i really couldnt help so i talked as softly as i knew how smoothing things over till he said still acting grumpy  well what do you want of me i happen to know that youve been hunting high and low this past hour and if that meddling jay hadnt run across me by accident youd still be scurrying around as if i were the best friend you had in the world  thats just what i count you are jimmy and i nestled as near his nose as i could without filling myself full of quills that seemed to quiet him down a little and i went on to explain about mr turtle telling jimmy how sick the old fellow looked i expected every minute that hed give it to me hard for trying to stuff him with any such yarn as that old slowly had the toothache but do you know he never thought about mr turtles not having teeth and asked as if hed got real interested in the story  what does he think i can do im no dentists shop  when i told him that slowly believed the pain was caused by his getting a piece of snails shell in his teeth and that he could fix himself up all right if he had a hedgehog quill for a toothpick that foolish jimmy swallowed the story shell and all  im allowing that im the only one of the wood folks who really amounts to anything in the way of usefulness he said grinning like a jack o lantern and shaking his quills till i had to get out in the open for fear some of them would strike me if i can help old mr turtle of course i must do it but you wait till the president of your blooming old club gets into trouble that nobody but me can pull him out of and see how long itll be before i so much as lift a paw i wouldnt give that beggar jim crow one of my quills not if he was starving to death  i wanted to ask jimmy how much good he thought one of his quills would do to a crow who was starving to death but held my tongue because i didnt want to stir him up while he was in such a good humor and if i poked the least little bit of fun at him he might decide that he wouldnt go to mr turtle in which case id miss the fun i was counting on  well jimmy strutted out from under the fir bushes shaking himself to look big and walking as if he thought he was the only thing in the big woods while i hippertyhopped at his side but taking mighty good care not to get so near that there was any danger of being scratched you dont want to think that he was feeling any too friendly with me even though we two were getting along so peaceably and every now and then hed stop to threaten what he was going to do because id told the truth about the bobby coon business  i let him go on as wildly as he pleased for i was thinking to myself all the time that jimmy would soon be having a hard time if things went the way mr crow and old slowly had figured and it was all i could do to keep myself from laughing right out loud i felt so tickled it seemed to me that mr crow wouldnt hatch out a plan that could go wrong and mr turtle was so terribly in earnest about playing his part of it that i had good reason to think jimmy would have the hot end of the stick before long with me right on hand to see the whole game  yes i did tremble once in a while when i thought of how hot jimmy would be against me if he did get into a scrape for by my hunting him up it looked a good deal as if i had quite a finger in the pie whatever kind of pie it might be though as ive already said i hadnt the littlest bit of an idea as to what was really in the wind but i knew it was about time for things to begin to hum especially if slowly kept on doing his part as well as he had begun     chapter xvi  trouble in the club   it took jimmy a long time to get down to the pond because he had to stop every now and then to rub it into me on account of the bobby coon business and by the way he talked youd thought i was the only thing in the big woods whod not done right mr bunny said as he nursed his knee carefully swaying his body to and fro slowly but keeping a sharp watch around lest some one of his many enemies should creep upon him unawares  if it had been at any other time except when i counted he was going to get it good and hot mighty soon id have had it out with him then and on the spot for there isnt any hedgehog that ever walked wholl be allowed to give me cheap talk about what i hadnt any finger in except to tag on behind when the two of em were going toward mr mans barn and i wouldnt have done even as much as that if i hadnt known theyd call me fraid cat unless i stayed with the crowd  oh my how big jimmy did feel and how he threw out his chest while we were going to the pond and the more he talked the surer he was that there wasnt anything in the big woods that could so much as hold a candle to him as i told you i let him run on because i had a mighty good idea of what was going to happen and whenever we came to a big bunch of ferns i crept among them to have a chance for laughing without his seeing me for if hed caught a glimpse of the littlest kind of grin on my face hed have suspected that something was up when it would have been goodbye to mr crows plans  as luck would have it he never tumbled to a thing and when we got to the pond there was old mr turtle lying out in the sun as if his very last day had come he acted so sick that even though i knew hed never had a tooth in his head i almost began to believe he really did have the toothache  whats the matter mr turtle jimmy asked ruffling up his quills sos to make himself look as big as he felt and old slowly said speaking as if the breath had about gone out of his body  im in a mighty bad way mr hedgehog and i allow youre the only one in all the big woods who can give me a lift ive never done anything wrong to you and a young chap ought to be willing to help a poor old fellow whos got the misery in his tooth that im having  of course ill do what i can mr turtle and jimmy bristled around like a red and green auto thats gone wrong in its steeringgear suppose you show me the tooth and perhaps i can pull the thing out for you  i thought for sure jimmy had the old fellow then and that mr crows plan had failed but old slowly turtle isnt half as foolish as he looks for he never turned a hair when he said  its no use for me to try to show it mr hedgehog because ive had the pain so long that ive regularly got the lockjaw if youd be willing to let me have one of your stoutest quills im most certain i could fix the thing up myself you see ive got the thick part of a snails shell in my tooth and the minute that is out ill be all right  youre welcome to a dozen quills if thats what you want but youll have to get bunny to pull em out for i cant do it and jimmy looked around at me as if expecting i was going to thrust my paws among all those sharppointed toothpicks  i dont believe id care to trust bunny in such a job as that mr turtle said looking out of the corner of his eye at me as if to say that i was to keep my paws out of his pies which i was perfectly willing to do if youd turn around mr hedgehog sos i could see just which quill i wanted it wouldnt take me long to get what i needed  jimmy still believed that he must be the biggest kind of fellow among the wood folks if he was the only one who could save mr turtles life and around he swung his quills rustling like dry leaves in a strong wind i caught just one glimpse of old slowlys eye as he winked it wickedly and then i saw his jaws come together on the middle of jimmys tail where there wasnt a chance of his being pricked now dont you think there was any need of telling jimmy that things had gone wrong in the rear it was just the same as if old slowly had telegraphed for at the very minute mr turtle got the hold he wanted that hedgehog let out a yell which you could have heard from one end of the big woods to the other and off he started at full speed  mr turtle never said a word and he couldnt on account of his mouth being so full he didnt have time to wink at me again before i saw him whisking through the bushes just as if he were flying it was as much as a minute before i came to understand what was happening and then you can make up your mind that i put in my best licks to be on hand when the end came for jimmy isnt great at running and it stood to reason he couldnt keep up that pace very long  i dont allow that the frightened hedgehog knew where he was aiming for when he started you see old slowly must have hurt him a good bit if he shut his jaws together right hard as jimmy said he did for mr crow declares that he could bite off the end of an oak stick and not strain himself very much it so happened though that when jimmy struck his twominute clip he was heading straight for the big oak and nothing could have suited the president of the club any better  it wasnt very hard for me to get well up with the procession before the race was more than half run and as we came within sight of the big oak i saw that nearly every member of the club was there as if notices of a special meeting had been sent out i afterward heard that all cheekos boys had been running around the country a full hour to get the wood folks gathered where they could see the fun and surely those young fellows had done their work well for it didnt seem as if any one was absent though im allowing that more than one wished before the day was over that he hadnt been so prompt in answering the presidents invitation  as near as i could figure it out jimmy didnt have an idea that any one was near until he found himself in the very midst of the crowd and then he swung around in order to stop quickly when of course old mr turtle flew out like a rock on the end of a string without any idea of where hed bring up cocky robin and mr jay were roosting quite near the ground where they could keep an eye out for foolish worms which might happen that way and mr turtle swept them off the branch like ninepins knocking the two senseless  mr jay let out a screech as he fell and jimmy who couldnt seem to understand how hard he was swinging old slowly turned the other way like a flash mr turtle hitting bobby coons mother such a clip on the head that i thought for certain she was dead then mr crow hopped down to tell slowly to let up when jimmy turned again and over the old fellow went like the down of a thistle  i really havent the time to tell you all that happened before old slowly could be made to understand that he had carried out his part of the plot and a little more jimmy had regularly lost his head what with the pain caused by mr turtles jaws together with the uproar that began when he first appeared and kept swinging around and around like a windmill that has suddenly gone crazy with old slowly flying out at the end of his tail knocking down everything and everybody in his way  it seemed as if mr turtle must have been splintered into little bits for whatever he struck was hit hard but yet he really seemed to enjoy it and when the rumpus was over the old fellow acted as if he were quite disappointed at having the circus over so soon  if youll believe me fully seven out of every ten of the club members had been knocked over from one to three times before we got any sense into jimmys wild head and those who hadnt already come to harm were roosting mighty high as if afraid that slowly might lose his grip and come sailing up among the branches as he would have done if any part of jimmys tail had come off suddenly it didnt seem to me as if i had any call to mix up in the show even though the president kept singing out for me to jump in and catch the crazy hedgehog for when you find me mixing myself up with a lot of quills that are moving around as jimmys were then youll catch butcher weasel asleep  theres no telling how long the performance would have lasted if senator bear who had been awakened by the uproar hadnt come up just when he did and he got there in time to have old slowly strike him fairly on the side but it takes quite a blow to knock the senator out and jimmy didnt have time enough to swing around again before mr bear put one of his big paws on him  that held the crazy hedgehog down for a minute and president crow yelled savagely  let go his tail you foolish old turtle do you count on killing the whole club  im only doing what you asked me to do slowly grumbled as he let go his grip and the minute his mouth was opened you can set it down as a fact that jimmy took mighty good care to get his tail in out of harms way  now as ive told you before more than half the club members had been knocked around by slowly and jimmy and the minute they heard that the job had been put up by mr crow they sailed into him calling the old fellow more names than there are days in the month jimmy lay there under the senators paw but never said a word hed lost his breath after scrambling around so fast which was one reason why he had nothing to say and i reckon he was so frightened that he didnt dare to move his tongue for fear something worse would happen  well say ive heard rows before but never anything that came up to what we had right there under the big oak the members who had been bruised couldnt find hard words enough to sling at the president and those who came off without a scratch were cross because theyd been obliged to move around so vigorously in order to keep out of mr turtles way  mr crow stood the abuse for quite a while without making any back talk and then he lost his temper as even the blindest rabbit that ever lived could have seen for he hopped around first on one foot and then on the other acting as if he were choking because he couldnt get the words out fast enough  im through with every one of you he croaked ruffling up the feathers on his neck and flapping his wings youll never catch me being president again of such a club of dummies as this not if i live to be a thousand years old  you wont get the chance in this section of the country even if you should live two thousand years cried mr jay fairly boiling over with wrath because one of his eyes had been blackened and the greater portion of his tail torn away  its no use for me to try to tell you all that was said while every one was so worked up over what i had counted was going to be the joke of the season if there were any harsh names which they didnt call mr crow it was because they were forgotten in the excitement and the scolding might have been kept up to this very day if the professor hearing the noise hadnt come snooping around to see what he could pick up in the way of table dainties  yes that was the end of the fur and feather club mr crow wouldnt speak to a single soul of us for ever and ever so long jimmy and his folks were so angry at us all that they moved away down to the lower end of the swamp while old mr turtle took it into his foolish head that he hadnt been treated right and threatened to make it hot for the first member of the club who dared come near the pond which he claimed was his private property there was a warm old time in the big woods during the rest of that season and mrs bunny says it was the most fortunate thing that ever happened in our section because we members had been regularly idling our time away under pretense of transacting club business but of course you and i know that she puts it altogether too strongly  look look over in the ferns and mr bunny pointed excitedly with one paw theres mrs bunny herself i reckon she thinks you may be here with the idea of starting another club and she has come after me shes got sonny bunny by the paw which is the same as saying if i dont do as she wants shell take him and go to her mothers so i guess in order to keep peace in the family id better say goodbye  then mr bunny rabbit hippertyhopped away to where his family awaited him and there could be no question but that the long story had come to  the end
