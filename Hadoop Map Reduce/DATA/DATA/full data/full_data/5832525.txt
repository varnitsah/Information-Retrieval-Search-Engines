set off at full speed and almost immediately a shout went up from the rioters the sneaks are sending for help stop that boy                                                               74  you four are to act as sentinels said the superintendent study this map and you will hit upon a scheme                                 95  please dont drag me off skip said piteously ill never hurt you or anybody else again                                              128     down the slope     chapter i  the breaker boy   jest moved here eh  came last friday  and you are going into the breaker  yes  for thirtyfive cents a day  that is all the company pays and a green hand cant expect to get more  were you ever in a mine before  i never even saw one  a trip down the slope will be enough to make you wish such a place in which to earn a living never existed why dont you try something else before it is too late  what do you mean by too late  when a fellow is in debt to the companys store he cant afford to be independent and it is about the same as selling yourself outright for enough to eat and drink  i wont get into debt  wait a week and see if you can say the same thing then  i mustnt get trusted im the only one to whom mother can look for support we hadnt any money with which to go to the city and so came here it isnt likely i shall be obliged to stay in the breaker forever and after a while it will be possible to get a better job where are you working  im bill thomas butty  whats that  his helper hes a miner and ill have the same kind of a lay after being with him a while  were you ever in the breaker  i sorted slate from coal most three years an got more dust than money but im tough you see an didnt wear out my lungs  whats your name  sam thorpe but if you ever want anybody to help you out of a scrape an i reckon thatll happen before many days ask for bills butty  i am fred byram and mother has hired the new house near the store  im sorry for you but as it cant be helped now keep your eyes peeled for the boys are a tough lot when you want a friend come to me i like your looks and wish youd struck most any other place than farleys cause its the worst to be found in the middle field  with this not very encouraging remark sam went toward the mouth of the slope and the new breaker boy was left to his own devices  it was six oclock in the morning the underground workers were coming singly or in groups to begin the days work for which each would be paid in accordance with the amount of coal taken out and no one could afford to remain idle many moments  fred knew he must report to the breaker boss before seven oclock and approached the grimy old building wondering if it would be necessary for him to work three years as sam thorpe had done before earning more than thirtyfive cents per day  entering the breaker which was thickly coated both inside and out with coaldust he reported to donovan the boss by saying  i have come to work here is my ticket  green  yes sir  here chunky take this new hand alongside of you and see that there is no skylarking  the boy referred to as chunky made no reply but looked up from beside the long chute at which he was sitting as if the task of breaking in a new hand was very welcome a fat goodnatured fellow he apparently was and fred fancied he would be an agreeable taskmaster  he like the others was curious to know if his companion had been in a mine before and on receiving the information remarked sagely  youll be mighty sick of the whole thing before night but its safer than down in the galleries  what must i do  at seven oclock the coal will be dumped in at the other end of the chute an while its runnin past you must pick out the slate  is that all  by the time your hands are cut into mincemeat youll think its enough was the grim reply and before fred could speak again the days labor had begun the black fragments came through the chute with a roar which was deafening and the green hand was at a loss to distinguish coal from slate  take out the dull grayish stuff chunky shouted as he seized from the moving mass sufficient fragments to serve as specimens and in a short time fred began to have a general idea of his duties  before the forty minutes nooning had come around his hands were cut and bleeding but the thought of his mother who looked to him for support was enough to keep him busily at work and when the whistle sounded he had most assuredly earned half of the thirtyfive cents  a short rest a lunch eaten amid the sooty vapor which caused one to fancy he was gazing through a veil whenever he glanced across the building and then the fatiguing labor was recommenced to be ended only at the stroke of six when miners buttys mule drivers and bosses hastened to the surface of the earth once more after having been deprived of sunlight for nearly twelve hours  without paying any especial attention to the fact fred noticed that although he was among the last to leave the breaker the majority of the boys followed close behind as he started toward home  in order to reach the companys store it was necessary to traverse a mirey road on which were no habitations for nearly fifty yards and when fred was half this distance from the breaker a voice from behind shouted  hi hold on a bit you new feller  fred turned to see a dozen of those who had been at work near him advancing threateningly  what do you want he asked regretting now that he had not hurried on ahead as chunky suggested shortly before the whistle sounded  weve got a word to say an youre wanted very perticlar  i cant stop now  thats too bad for theres a little business to be settled right away and the largest of the party stepped so near in front of fred that it would have been impossible for him to have advanced except at the risk of an encounter  wont it do just as well in the morning  im afraid not  but i promised to come straight home  you cant go till our count has been fixed  i dont owe you anything  dont eh  no i never even saw one of your crowd until i came to work this morning  what of that  it shows there can be no account between us  youre makin a big mistake young feller aint this your first day in the breaker  of course it is  then what about payin your footing  my footing  every feller who comes here has got to make things square with us by standin treat  well im one who cant do it  oh yes you can and here the bully looked at his companions who echoed his words crowding yet closer around fred until it was literally impossible for him to make the slightest movement  i havent got a penny and what i earn is for mother  you can get an advance at the store  do you suppose ill run in debt for the purpose of treating you  thats about the size of it  then youre making a big mistake for i wont do anything of the kind and fred made one desperate attempt to force his way through the crowd  look out for him the leader shouted as he struck fred a blow on the cheek which would have sent him headlong but for the others who acted as a sort of brace  the new breaker boy was not disposed to submit tamely and struck out blindly but vigorously drawing blood from more than one nose before borne to the earth by press of numbers  while he was thus helpless every fellow who could get near enough dealt him one or more blows and not until they were tired of the sport did the young ruffians cease  now let up the leader cried in a tone of authority hes had a dose that shows what we can do an will git it ten times as bad tomorrer if he dont come down with the treat  the disciplining party ran swiftly toward the settlement when these words had been spoken probably because a dozen or more miners were approaching and fred was left to make his way home as best he could  he had just staggered to his feet when the men arrived upon the scene but no one paid any particular attention to him save as one miner remarked with a laugh  i reckon heres a lad who didnt know the rules but it wont take him long to find them out  fred was too sore both in mind and body to make any retort and he limped down the road believing this first attempt to earn a living was already a dismal failure  he would have kept the story of the attack a secret from his mother but for the marks of the conflict which could not be hidden and when questioned represented the affair as of no especial importance  mrs byram had a fairly good idea of the case however when he said despondently  i believe it would be better to try some other kind of work why cant we go to the city  because our capital is so limited to come here it was only necessary to move our furniture three miles and the promise of needlework from the superintendents family assured us sufficient income to meet the absolute cost of living but you need not go to the breaker again it may be possible to find employment elsewhere  theres little chance of that in this town mother fred replied with a brave attempt at cheerfulness i should be worse than a loafer to remain idle while you were working and by keeping my eyes open that crowd cant do very much mischief  wouldnt it be better to pay your footing as they call it once that has been done there can be no excuse for troubling you  i wont give them the value of a penny and ill stick to my job perhaps by flogging the bully i can teach them to let me alone  but you musnt fight fred mrs byram said in alarm  its better to have one regular battle than to get such a drubbing as this every night if they make any more fuss i shall take care of myself  now that the first sense of injury had passed away fred felt as if he had been at fault to allow himself to be so easily overcome and distasteful as was the work in the breaker he had fully resolved to remain and assert his rights in a manly way     chapter ii  the warning   on the second morning fred did not present himself at the dingy old building until nearly time for the whistle to sound and those whom he had good cause to look upon as enemies were already at their places by the chute  i heard some of the fellers served you out last night chunky said much as if such proceedings were a matter of course  theyd better not try it on again fred replied in a tone of determination  are you goin to fight  ill protect myself if nothing more  it wont do any good to try  why not  because there are too many of em an skip miller can down any feller in this breaker  who is skip miller  the boss of the crowd who laid for you  then ill settle matters with him and when he gets the best of me it will be time to pay my footing but not before  hell chew you all up  i aint so sure of that did you know what they were going to do  i had a mighty strong spicion  why didnt you tell me  then id got a thumping i wanted you to hurry out with me  by this time the work had begun and the noise was so great that conversation could be indulged in only at the expense of considerable shouting freds hands sore from the previous days labor were cut anew in many places and more than one piece of slate was marked with his blood as he threw it among the refuse  the gang as fred termed his enemies gave no sign of carrying the threat previously made into execution the watchful eyes of the breaker boss prevented them from idling and nothing occurred to arouse the new boys suspicions until just before the noonday whistle sounded when a piece of board thrown while donovan was not looking fell at freds feet  at first he believed the intention was to hit him with the missile but when the stream of coal ceased to flow through the chute chunky said as he picked up the board  the warnin has come  what do you mean by that  for reply chunky handed his mate the piece of lumber on which was printed in scrawling characters with red chalk      pay or skip     we mean bisness     no sneaks lowed hear     tonite is the last chance     the breaker regulaters  so they call themselves regulators eh fred said half to himself as he deciphered the message after considerable difficulty  thats some of skips doings hes started a reglar sciety an fellers what dont join have to step round mighty lively sometimes  do you belong  chunkey hesitated an instant as if ashamed of the fact and then replied  it dont pay to keep out cause they run things to suit therselves an a feller cant hold his job very long when theyre down on him  according to that i shant be here a great while unless this command is obeyed  thats what im afraid of why not come up with a little treat an settle the whole thing that way you cant do anything by fightin for there are so many  fred hesitated an instant as if considering the matter and then replied angrily  i wont be forced into anything of the kind if you belong to the gang tell them that i shall protect myself the best i know how and somebody will get hurt when theres another row  chunky had an opportunity to repeat the message at once for fred had but just ceased speaking when skip beckoned for him to come to the other side of the building and a command from the chief of the regulators was not to be disobeyed with impunity  fred was watching the movements of his enemies narrowly when donovan approached on his way to the water casks  have the boys been tryin to make you pay your footing the breaker boss asked  yes sir and it looks as if they didnt intend to let me stay very long fred replied as he held up the notification to quit  what are you going to do about it and the man looked curiously at the boy  stay where i am until they get the upper hand i cant treat for i havent the money and i may be able to show that the regulators are not the bosses here  i like your pluck my lad and can perhaps give you a lift skip shall have a flea in his ear before the whistle sounds again but of course its none of my business what happens after working hours  i dont expect any assistance sir and if they down me it cant be helped  youve taken a pretty big contract but between us both i reckon it can be carried out  then donovan continued on and looking up fred saw that all his enemies had been watching the interview closely  they may conclude it isnt best to tackle me if he is going to take a hand he thought and at this moment chunky returned  now you have got yourself in a scrape  how so  skip and all the fellers saw you talkin to donovan an they know you showed him the message from the regulators  what of that  they dont low anything of the kind an youve got to take a thumpin even if you do treat  so im to get a double dose eh  thats about the size of it skip says youll be laid up for a week when the sciety gets through with you  im much obliged for the promise but dont believe quite all he says  chunky shook his head as if to intimate that the case was a desperate one and then the nooning had come to an end the clouds of coal dust which had but just settled rose again as the machinery was put in motion and all was activity once more  although fred had spoken so bravely he felt seriously disturbed and during the remainder of the day his mind was fully occupied with thoughts of how he might successfully resist his enemies  when night came he had arrived at no satisfactory conclusion and at the signal to cease work chunky ran swiftly away thus showing that while he would not join with the society as against his mate he did not intend to take sides with him  donovans promise of assistance was not a vain one when fred emerged from the breaker a few paces behind chunky he saw the boss waiting for him and the latter said in a friendly tone  it dont do you much good to be seen talkin to me for both men an boys hate what are called bosses pets but well stave off this row till you get used to the ropes when its a case of taking care of yourself  under the protection of donovan fred walked to his home feeling a bit ashamed of thus avoiding the meeting with the regulators and more than one jeering cry did he hear before reaching the house  be careful of yourself now donovan said as they arrived at the cottage this wont make the lads any better disposed toward you an it isnt safe to move round very much in the dark  ill come home alone tomorrow an have it out  dont be rash wait for a chance an if skip gets hurt pretty bad nobody herell feel sorry  then fred entered the house and after a bath a hot supper during which his mother spoke many encouraging words and a long consultation to his best course he felt little fear of the regulators  mrs byram had good news for her son the wife of the superintendent had introduced her to several other ladies who promised to give her employment and the prospect of earning money seemed better than was anticipated when the question of moving to the settlement had been under discussion  we shall get along famously she said and perhaps it wont be many months before it will be possible to get enough ahead so we can venture to the city i am going to open an account at the store in your name for what little cash we had is very nearly exhausted  when are you going  now i shall be busy tomorrow and you must have a hearty supper  ill go the store isnt the nicest place possible during the evening  but the boys who are watching for you  they wont dare to do anything when the men are around fred replied carelessly and taking the memorandum which his mother had prepared he left the house  the one street of the settlement was almost deserted for it was yet too early to see the toilers who would spend the short time of rest in the open air near the store and freds business was soon transacted the desired credit was readily granted and with his arms filled with packages he started toward home once more  for the first time in the past twentyfour hours he had forgotten the existence of the regulators and the fact that skip miller with half a dozen companions was waiting for him never came into his mind until a hand was suddenly pressed over his mouth as a hoarse voice whispered  catch hold his legs an arms fellers never mind the stuff now  in a twinkling fred was lifted from the ground by a boy at each limb while the one who had spoken kept a firm hold upon his mouth and in this fashion he was carried swiftly along in the direction of the breaker as he thought  well have to fetch them bundles sos to make it look as if he fell in some one said and a voice which he recognized as skips replied  thats so you fellers what aint doing anything pick em up  whos got the rope  i have  why not throw him in an run the chances its too bad to lose what cost half a dollar  theres time enough to fix that after weve got him to the shaft  hold your tongues or somebody will hear us skip whispered angrily as his companions thus discussed the preliminaries  then came a long time of silence broken by the footsteps of the party or the loud breathing of those who were carrying the burden  several times fred tried to give an alarm but his mouth was held so firmly that not a sound could escape his lips and after a while he contented himself with simply trying to form some idea of the direction in which he was being taken  when the party had carried him for ten or fifteen minutes a halt was made and then his captors took the precaution of enveloping his head in a coat which shut out every sound save the loudly uttered remarks of the regulators  he heard skip berating one of the party because some reference was made to their destination and then ensued a noisy discussion as to what should be done with him  if he dont turn up tomorrer mornin old donovan will swear we took him off an therell be a heap of trouble for all hands one of the boys suggested  what of that nobody can say we did it an after hes had one night of it i reckon hell be willin to do as we say  but howll he get out  thats for him to say well show him what it is to go agin our crowd an the rest is his business  then fred was borne forward again until it seemed as if fully half a mile had been traversed when the regulators halted for the second time  the wrappings were removed from his head and as nearly as the prisoner could tell he was some distance from the breaker at the mouth of what appeared to be an abandoned shaft  now look here skip miller said as he stood before his prisoner youve taken it into your head that us reglators dont mount to nothin but by tomorrer mornin youll think different what we say we mean an dont you forget it if youd been man enough to do like every other feller it would a been all right but instead of that you go babyin to old donovan an we dont low sich funny business  what are you going to do now  show what the reglators mount to when you come out of this i reckon youll be willin to pay up like a man an join us  it will have to be a pretty stiff dose to make me do anything of the kind fred said angrily  thats jest what this is goin to be were lettin you off of a poundin sos to show what can be done an if you say so much as a word to old donovan well pretty near kill you  i shall talk to whoever i please  not after you come out of this dont think well allers let you off so cheap an at the first show of tellin whats been done tonight well give you another lesson  fred realized that it was useless to bandy words with those who held him so completely in their power and understanding also that he could do nothing to better his condition held his peace  skip showed himself to be an adept in the business of subduing refractory breaker boys by giving his orders promptly and in such a manner as would soonest accomplish the work under his energetic directions freds hands were soon tied behind his back a gag was fastened in his mouth and the rope placed under his arms  now raise him up an you neednt be careful about lettin him drop the sooner he gets to the bottom the quicker we can go back to the store put the bundles near the mouth of the shaft an in a couple of days somebody will find him  itll go rough with us if he tells who left him here one of the party suggested  theres no danger of that before he gets out hell know what it means to fool with us  fred remained passive he could not believe these boys would dare to do anything very serious and to attempt resistance would accomplish no possible good  raise him up skip shouted and in another instant fred was hanging over what appeared to be a deep hole to be dropped with a suddenness and force which for the time being deprived him of consciousness  while he lay at the bottom of the shaft the regulators placed the parcels taken from the store in such a manner as to make it appear that he had fallen in by accident and when this had been done they went swiftly toward the settlement regardless of whether their victim lived or died     chapter iii  in the shaft   mrs byram had no suspicion that her son might be exposed to any danger until after he had been absent an hour and then the remembrance of the threats made by skip miller and his friends caused her the deepest anxiety fred would not have staid at the store longer than was absolutely necessary and the fear of foul play had hardly gained possession of her mind before she was on her way to search for him  the companys clerk had but just finished explaining that the new breaker boy left there with his purchases some time previous when donovan entered in time to hear the widow say  i do not understand why he should remain away so long for he must know i would be troubled concerning him  didnt your boy stay in the house after i left him at the gate mrs byram the breaker boss asked  mrs byram explained why fred ventured out and the man appeared to be disturbed in mind  this is just the time when he oughter kept his nose inside them young ruffians are likely to do any mischief  then you believe something serious has happened  i didnt say quite that but it wont do much harm to have a look for him you go home an ill call there in an hour then turning to some of the loungers he asked has anybody seen skip miller lately  youre allers tryin to make out that hes at the bottom of everything that goes wrong skips father who entered at this moment said in a surly tone  if he aint its not for lack of willingness do you know where he is  home where hes been for an hour or more  donovan looked hard at the speaker and miller retorted  if you dont believe me it wont take long to find out for yourself  thats exactly what im going to do mrs byram i will see you again in less than an hour  with these words the breaker boss left the store and freds mother walked slowly home the anxiety in her heart growing more intense each moment  two hours passed before donovan returned and announced his inability to find the missing boy  i did think skip might have had a hand in it he said but i reckon hes innocent this time i found him near his own home with a crowd of cronies and according to all accounts hes been there since supper  but what has become of fred mrs byram asked preserving a semblance of calmness only after the greatest difficulty  i hope nothing serious has happened the superintendent has been notified and promises to send men out in search of him at once it is just possible he went down the slope to see the night shift at work  there was nothing in these words to afford the distressed mother any relief and the sorrow which would not be controlled took complete possession of her as donovan hurried away to join those who were examining every place where an accident might have occurred  meanwhile the subject of all this commotion remained where the regulators had left him it was a long time before he recovered consciousness and then several moments were spent in trying to decide where he was and what had happened  the fragments of conversation heard while the boys were carrying him told that he was in an abandoned shaft and unacquainted though he was with mines in general it did not require much thought to convince him how nearly impossible it would be to escape unaided  the bonds which fastened his limbs as well as the gag had not been tied firmly and in a short time he was free to begin such an examination of the place as was possible in the profound darkness  here and there he could feel the timbers left when the shaft was deserted and after groping about some moments discovered a tunnellike opening ten or twelve feet across the roof or top of this place was beyond his reach and he knew it must be a drift from which all the coal had been taken  it may lead for miles under the hill and i would be no better off by following it he thought unless there is a slope which communicates with it id be in a worse fix than now because the chances of being lost or suffocated must be about even  then in his despair he shouted at the full strength of his lungs until it was impossible to speak louder than a whisper  nothing less than the booming of a cannon could have been heard from the shaft by any one in the settlement and with the night shift in the working mine there would hardly be any one in the vicinity  after giving full sway to his grief for half an hour or more anger replaced sorrow and he rushed into the tunnel with no other thought than to escape from that particular place  stumbling on over decaying timbers rocks and mounds of earth which had fallen from the roof he pushed straight ahead until the decided inclination told that this drift tended upward there was now reason to believe it might communicate with another which in turn was reached by a slope and hope grew strong once more  how long he had traveled when the sound of voices caused him to halt it was impossible to form any idea but it seemed as if several hours elapsed and the first thought was to shout for help  i wont do it he said checking himself this tunnel may have led me back to the other mine and if the people ahead are some of the night shift theyll be likely to have considerable sport at my expense  walking cautiously in the direction of the voices he was suddenly brought to a standstill by an apparently solid wall of earth  he groped around until there was no question but that he had reached the end of the drift and when this discovery had been made he found a small aperture which opened into a gallery or chamber where were a dozen men the lamps in their hats illumining the place sufficiently for fred to distinguish the party  he had reached the limit of the abandoned drift and was looking in upon a portion of the new mine  even now he made no appeal for help the conversation of the men caused him to listen with no thought of his own condition  unless we do the job tomorrow night theres little chance of gettin through with it all right one of the party was saying and another replied with an oath  theres no reason why we should wait tonight would suit me  i dont believe in it a third man said whats to be gained by floodin the mine an turnin ourselves out of a chance to earn a living  you allers was chickenhearted joe brace havent we put up with enough from the mine owners an bosses we work for starvation wages while they can barrel money  would you say that if you hadnt been thrown out of a job  thats my business heres a crowd of us who have sworn to stick together no matter what happens an five have been warned out are we goin peaceable not liftin a finger agin them as have got rich while we starved  but how are we helpin ourselves by floodin the mine  three or four of sich bosses as donovan may be in the drift when with one stroke of a pick i let the water into the lower level and thatll show the others were men even if they do treat us like brutes  you will drown some of your own mates  them as are on the level must take their chances  its murder thats what it is an ill have none of it brace cried as he leaped to his feet and in another instant the whole party were facing him who dared dispute their right to do wrong  for some moments our hero could not distinguish a word so great was the confusion but when the tumult subsided in a measure two men were holding brace while he who appeared to be leader stood before him in a threatening attitude  youve sworn to go with the crowd and know the penalty for traitors  i know that ill blow the whole business if i get the chance ive got a brother in the lower level do you think ill stand by while he is bein murdered  better do that than turn agin us well give you one chance swear to hold your tongue an well do no more than make sure you cant betray us  an if i dont choose to swear  then well leave you here lashed hand an foot when the mine is flooded this drift will be cut off an it dont need a lawyer to say whatll happen then  so to spite them as have done you a bad turn youre willin to murder me  thats about the size of it  listen to me cale billings i promised to stand by you fellers when the agreement was to help each other agin the bosses but now its murder you mean id rather be on the lower level when the deed is done than have part or parcel with them as are willin to make widows an orphans  then we know what to do billings cried angrily as he rushed toward brace and for several moments fred had only a confused idea of what was taking place  brace was fighting against the entire party and under such circumstances the struggle could not be prolonged  when the watcher could next distinguish the occupants of the chamber brace laid on his back bound hand and foot while the others were on the point of departure  billings remained behind his companions to say  we gave you all the chance we could an now its only yourself youve got to thank for whatll happen before fortyeight hours go by  id die twice over rather than put the stain of blood on my hands  well youve got the chance to try it once an i reckon youll wish things was different before long well take good care nobody comes this way too soon  then the party filed out of the room one or two glancing back with undisguised pity and as they passed along the drift the place was wrapped in profound darkness with nothing to break the silence save the doomed mans heavy breathing  fred waited until believing the wouldbe murderers were beyond the sound of his voice and then he called softly  brace brace  whos there  a breaker boy who came into the mine yesterday  where are you  fred explained to the best of his ability and added  do you know of any way i can get out of here  no that part of the mine has been closed a good many years an it would take a week to work up through the old slope before then the water on the lower level is bound to flood this end of the workings  and we shall be drowned  i dont see any help for it  but we cant stay here and be killed fred cried in an agony of fear  its tough but theres no way out of it unless  what speak quickly for time mustnt be lost if were to do anything toward helping ourselves  how large a cut is there through the wall where you are standing  its only a small oneperhaps four or five inches across  couldnt you make it large enough to crawl through  it wouldnt take long if i had a shovel but without one it will be hard  set about it lad work is better than idleness when a fellow is in this kind of a scrape  fred obeyed instantly tearing away the earth regardless of the injury done his hands but making very slow progress the wall was composed of slate and gravel and a pick would have been necessary to effect a speedy entrance  meanwhile brace strove to cheer the boy by talking of the possibility that they might yet escape and hour after hour fred continued at the task until the moment arrived when it was possible by dint of much squeezing to make his way through the aperture  do you think it is near the time when the men are to flood the mine he asked groping around until his outstretched hands touched braces prostrate body when he began feverishly to untie the ropes  no lad we must have half a dozen hours before us  then we are all right fred cried joyfully you know the way out and billings plot can be made known in time to prevent the mischief  dont fool yourself with the idea that matters have been straightened because im free brace replied as he rose to his feet when freds task had been finished  but what is to prevent our leaving here  did you catch what billings said when he left  yes  then theres no need of sayin anything more some of the murderin crowd will be on guard at the entrance to the drift and knowing what we do of their plans every means will be used to prevent our ever seeing daylight again  dont you intend to do anything toward trying to escape  of course im not quite a fool  shall you go back with me or try to find the shaft  that would be useless we will go straight through this drift  but if billings crowd are watching for you  its simply a case of fighting for life there aint much hope of overpowerin them the job will be childs play compared with tryin to hold our own agin the flood thats sure to come soon  brace groped around for something which would serve as a weapon but finding nothing he said grimly  well have to go as we are lad an remember that if we dont get through the drift youll never see the breaker again     chapter iv  the barrier   brace did not so much as ask if fred was willing to join him in the struggle which must surely ensue if they met those who intended to work such great injury to the mine he walked straight on without speaking until five minutes had elapsed and then said in a whisper  it wouldnt be safe for any of that crowd to be found loafin near the entrance to the drift so we may expect to run across them before long if they get the best of me an you can slip past while they are doin it dont wait but make the most of your time  i wouldnt leave you to fight alone  why not my life dont count for anything when there are so many to be saved run if you can and tell what billings intends to do the superintendent is the one who should hear it first but if the time is short speak to any of the bosses  up to this moment fred had thought only that he and brace might insure their own safety but now personal welfare seemed insignificant as compared with what might be done for others  following closely behind brace that there might be no possibility of an involuntary separation he walked on in silence until the leader suddenly halted with a cry of dismay  whats the matter fred whispered  the villains have taken good care we shant escape the drift has been filled up this side of the doors  cant we dig our way through they havent had time to bring much stuff in here  more than likely two or three loads of coal have been dumped and then the doors were fastened the drift has been worked out and none of the bosses would come here in time to suspect mischief  what can we do  wait a bit till i make sure whats before us  brace clambered upon the barrier assured himself there was too much to be removed in the limited time at their disposal and then came back to where fred was waiting in painful suspense  it must be the old shaft or nothing walk fast now for the minutes are going mighty quick  alone fred would have had difficulty in retracing his steps but brace pushed forward as if it was possible to see every foot of the way and when the chamber was reached immediately began forcing his body through the aperture which had seemed hardly large enough for fred  neither gave any heed to possible injuries and the mans clothes were in tatters when they emerged on the opposite side of the wall to make their way with all speed along the tunnel  for a while the inclination of the path told fred the proper direction was being pursued and then it seemed as if they traveled an unusually long time over a road which appeared to be perfectly level  are you sure we are right he asked at length seizing brace by the arm to force him to halt  i dont know anything about it this part of the mine was closed before i ever heard of such a place as farleys  we should have continued going down hill until the shaft was gained  then we are off the track sure but it cant be helped now and there is little chance of finding our way back the air isnt bad and well keep on it may be there is another slope beside the one about which i have heard  we must be on the lower level  i reckon we are  and it cant be long before billings will do as he threatened  youre right  then we are certain to be drowned unless we can find a higher drift  yes an itll be a clear case of luck if we strike one dont stop to talk now we must go at full speed while the air is good  seizing fred by the hand brace started once more and for the time being both forgot fatigue in this struggle for life on with feverish energy they pressed yet no glimmer of light broke the profound darkness more than once each fell over the litter of timbers but only to rise and struggle on again until finally brace halted  its no use he said with a moan each step now is carrying us lower i remember hearing some of the old hands say the abandoned drifts were a hundred feet or so farther down the hill we must be considerably below the deepest shaft  have you given up all hope fred asked in a whisper for while surrounded by the dense blackness the full tones of his voice sounded fearsome  ay lad all hope  try once more there surely is a way out if we could only strike it  we may as well meet the water here ive been in the mines long enough to know that this runnin at random is worse than standin quiet when a mans time has come theres no use to fight  fred could not urge him farther the numbness of fear was upon him brought by this sudden surrender of the man whom he had believed would be able to extricate them from the precarious position and now he thought only of his mother  how long the two remained there silent and motionless neither ever knew to fred it seemed as if hours passed before brace seized him by the arm as he cried at the full strength of his lungs  hello mate this way  then he ran forward at full speed dragging fred with him and shouting like an insane man all the while until finally the boy could see a tiny spark of light far in the distance  its some one looking for us fred cried  whether hes come for us or is on business of his own matters little since his light is burning  then as brace ceased speaking fred heard a familiar voice shouting and an instant later sam thorpe had grasped him by the hand  why its bills butty what are you doing here  i came to look for the new breaker boy i thought skips crowd had done him some mischief  so they did an another set of scoundrels would have drowned us all out but for your coming  what do you mean  theres no time for talkin now how did you get here  by an old slope that i stumbled across the other day i found freds bundles near the shaft and believed he had been let down there  go on the best you know how ill give you a bit of an idea about ourselves while were walking  the gleam of the lamp sam wore in his cap was sufficient to show the way and by the time the entrance to the slope had been reached the butty boy knew the whole story  billings gang wont be able to do anything till after the day shift go on an i think it would be a good idea to let the superintendent know what has happened why not stay here till i tell him part of the story  go ahead brace replied well wait for you  will you tell my mother that i am all right fred asked  she shall hear of it first sam said as he stole out into the open air as if fearful of being seen  why didnt we go with him fred asked when he was alone with brace  because nobody knows how far the plan to flood the mine may have gone and by showing ourselves the villains may begin the job too soon to be prevented  it was yet dark instead of having been imprisoned in the tunnels twentyfour hours as fred had believed less than eight were passed there  that mr wright believed the news sam brought to be of vital importance was shown by his coming with the boy with the utmost speed and on entering the shaft he said to brace  tell me all you know about the plan to flood the mine  the story was given in detail and at its conclusion mr wright asked  how do you happen to know so much about this thing  because i belonged to the party till i found they meant murder  are you acquainted with all the members  no sir wasnt allowed billings allers let us understand there was a big crowd but wouldnt let any besides the officers know about it he said the men might give themselves away by talkin if they found who was members  why do they wish to throw all hands out of employment by flooding the mine  some of the bosses are too hard on em sir an a good many think its like sellin theirselves to deal at the company store  they should have come to me with their grievances but it is too late to talk of that now and immediate steps must be taken to prevent the mischief it wont be policy for you to show yourself until my plans have been perfected otherwise they would take alarm the boy can go home and i want him to be in the breaker this morning as if nothing had happened where can you remain in hiding for a few days  i dont know sir unless i leave town  that will not do for i may wish to talk with you again  he can come with me fred said quickly we do not know any one here and theres no danger of his being discovered  its a good idea go with the boy brace and i can let you know when it will be safe to venture out  very well sir but dont deal harshly with billings crowd theyve tried to do me the most harm one man can work another but yet for the sake of their wives an children id not feel easy in mind if they was turned away without warning  i promise to be as lenient as is consistent with the safety of others mr wright replied as fred and the miner left the slope walking rapidly lest they should be observed and a few moments later mrs byram was clasping to her bosom the son whom she had feared was lost to her forever on this earth  it was not long that fred could remain at home he had promised to go to the breaker and after he and brace partook of a hearty meal at the conclusion of which the latter was shown to a room where there was no chance of his being seen he started out with the promise to his mother that he would be very careful  by some channel of information the news had been spread that the missing boy returned home during the night and no one paid any particular attention to him as he walked down the street but on entering the breaker skip miller and his friends were decidedly disturbed the leader of the regulators glanced from fred to donovan as if expecting he would be called upon to give an account of his misdeeds but chunky who had evidently not been let into the secret greeted his mate as if the latters return was something he had expected  where was you last night he asked  i went out near the old shaft fred replied and skip who overheard the words appeared to be very much relieved  i thought youd run away  why should i do anything like that  i dunno cept that you wanted to get clear of the thumpin that the regulators promised  im not such a fool as that fred replied carelessly and then the outpouring of coal put an end to further conversation     chapter v  the mob   fred could not prevent himself from glancing now and then in the direction of skip miller and his friends during the forenoon and on each occasion he found one or more of the party gazing at him as if in wonderment they failed to understand how he succeeded in leaving the shaft and this surprise was less than that called forth by the fact of his remaining silent regarding their illtreatment  one two three hours passed much as usual and then something happened which caused the oldest worker in the mines unbounded astonishment  the machinery suddenly stopped and from all the bosses came the orders that every laborer should return home without delay  no explanations were given and when the vast army were on the outside they stood in groups around the works discussing the cause of this very strange state of affairs  i never knew anything like this to happen at farleys before an old miner said  and they dont even tell us why we are cheated out of a days work  the engineer says there is nothing the matter with the machinery  yes an he like us has been ordered to go home  these and a dozen other remarks fred heard as he left the breaker and while loitering for an instant to learn if any one suspected the true state of affairs he became conscious that skip and his friends were regarding him with mingled anger and consternation written on their faces  youd better get out of here or there may be trouble chunky whispered  why  cause skip has got plenty of time now to serve you out an he looks like somethin was goin to be done  hed better not try any more games i can take care of myself in the daylight  what do you mean did he do somethin last night  before fred could reply the captain of the regulators came up and chunky lost no time in moving away from this very important personage  say skip began as he stepped threateningly in front of fred whats the meanin of all this  do you mean the shutting down of the machinery  of course i do  why should i know anything about it  dont try to play off innocent to me youve been blowin about what the regulators did an thats why all hands can suck their thumbs today  dont you think that is a foolish idea fred asked with a feeble effort at a smile do you fancy you the regulators or i are so important that the whole force is laid off because of anything which may have happened between us  skip was staggered by this reply and after thinking the matter over for a moment he said in a surly tone  all ive got to say is that things will be too hot for you in this town if a word is told about what was done last night  you said pretty near the same before throwing me down the shaft  well im sayin it again for it stands you in hand to remember it  i wont forget  skip turned quickly as if the tone offended him and after glaring fiercely at the breaker boy walked slowly toward his friends  whats in the wind now is he making any more threats  looking around quickly fred saw sam thorpe who had just come up the slope with bill thomas  skip is afraid the shutting down has some connection with the doings of the regulators isnt it queer to stop the machinery so soon when mr wright was anxious to keep everything a secret  i heard him say that the pumps were out of order one set got choked this morning and it wouldnt be safe for the miners to stay in the lower level till they were repaired  sam winked meaningly as if he thought the matter had been arranged very skillfully but fred was yet at a loss to understand how anything could be gained by this move  why were all hands thrown out  there are some general repairs to be made and it was better to do the whole at the same time  then theres no reason why brace should hide any longer  he mustnt so much as show his nose come over by the slope and watch billings and his crowd they are in a peck of trouble expecting that brace will be found and since no one is allowed to enter the mine matters begin to look tough for them  fred followed his friend and saw those who had intended to cause a terrible disaster clustered around the mouth of the slope in a feverish state of excitement  this is a nice way to treat honest men billings was saying as the two approached we work for starvation wages an then get laid off whenever the bosses like without so much as a notice its time we did something to show were men  im told the pumps are choked an old miner said an if thats the case mr wright oughter shut down farleys never has had a very good name but one or two stoppages like thisll show its worked on the square  what a fool you are billings cried angrily havent you got sense enough to see that this thing has been done sos well run deeper in debt at the store an have to submit to a cut down when wright gets ready to put the screws on  several of the bystanders loudly expressed their belief in the correctness of billings theory and instantly the greatest excitement prevailed the group increased in numbers each moment and billings took upon himself the office of spokesman  one proposed they march in a body to the superintendents house and demand that the machinery be started again another insisted on forcing their way into the mine to ascertain the true cause of the stoppage and in this last speaker fred recognized one of the men who had helped make joe brace a prisoner  they want to find him before mr wright orders an examination he whispered to sam and the latter replied  in less than an hour theyll have force enough to do as they please its time we were out of this you go home to tell joe and ill see mr wright if possible  fred was all the more willing to follow this advice because skip and his party were in the immediate vicinity and the lawlessness of the men might render them bold enough to administer the promised flogging then and there  the streets of the little town were crowded with knots of miners some of whom seemed to think the superintendent had acted for their good while others were indulging in the most extravagant threats  mrs byram was standing in the doorway when her son arrived and it could readily be seen by her face how relieved she was to have him with her once more  you mustnt leave the house again today she said in a tremulous voice go up stairs and tell mr brace what has happened  the miner was impatient to learn the cause of the excitement for he could hear the hum of voices on the street but did not care to look out of the window for fear of being seen  freds story was not a long one and he had to repeat it several times before brace was satisfied  i spose wright knows his own business best but it looks mighty dangerous to shut down so sudden  perhaps it was the only course to pursue fred suggested billings crowd may have been so near carrying their plot into operation that there was no time for anything different  that might be but take my word for it theres going to be trouble at farleys before this fuss is settled  do you think billings would dare to force his way into the mine  hed dare do anything with men enough at his back  suppose they got in and didnt find you  i aint thinkin of myself for it would be easy to get out of town  if they have an idea youve escaped from the drift all hands will be on the watch knowing you could expose their plot  everything is correct so long as they dont find out where i am an when its time to move ill agree to give em the slip go down stairs so you can see if the trouble is about to begin  before fred could obey sam thorpe burst into the room  theres a regular mob on the way to mr wrights house they threaten to burn it if the works are not opened in an hour  where is the superintendent brace asked  in the mine i think hes not at home for i just came from there  is billings leadin them  yes  how many of the companys men are on guard at the slope  about a dozen  who are they  sam repeated the names and brace said musingly  there are one or two that im doubtful of theyve been too thick lately with billings  it cant be helped now for mr wright wouldnt dare show himself long enough to make any change  at this moment a loud cry from the street caused the boys to run quickly down the stairs and brace ventured to look out from between the folds of the curtain  the mob in a spirit of bravado and to gain recruits were parading the streets before making their demands and had halted in front of the companys store that billings might harangue those near by he was dilating upon the wrongs inflicted on honest workingmen and calling for everyone to join in the struggle for their rights when to the astonishment of all mr wright appeared coming from the direction of the slope  the superintendent would have passed the mob and entered the store but that the men barred his way forcing him to halt directly in front of mrs byrams home  we was lookin for you billings said insolently as he stepped close to mr wright  well now that you have found me speak quickly for there is very much that i must do before night  open the works a voice shouted  give us a chance at the bosses  tell us whats the matter why are we thrown out of a job  hold on billings cried ill do the talking  it was several moments before the tumult ceased sufficiently for the leader to make himself understood and meanwhile the superintendent stepped on the threshold as mrs byram opened the door  in the first place billings began we want to know why the works have been shut down  because the pumps in the lower level are choked and there is every danger that portion will be flooded  but why are us miners barred out  it is evident someone has been trying to work mischief and i do not care to run the risk of allowing the same party free access to the place until all the damage is repaired  do you mean to accuse us of tryin to drown each other one of the throng asked  i shall make no accusations until everything can be proven but meanwhile all must remain out of the works that the guilty parties may not be able to do worse mischief  that is only a trick to keep us idle so the store bills put us more completely in your power billings cried insolently  you know the company must lose a great deal of money by taking the men out  it was impossible for mr wright to make himself heard further the miners began to speak each one for himself and little could be distinguished save the threats to burn the houses belonging to the officers of the works if the machinery was not started immediately  after this threat had been made the men grew more bold and before those in the cottage had time to screen themselves a shower of stones were flung at the superintendent who barely succeeded in protecting himself by jumping behind the door  fred and sam the latter of whom had an ugly cut on the cheek closed the door quickly bolting and barricading it with the furniture nearest at hand and the riot had begun  the angry men pelted the house with such missiles as could be most easily procured and during two or three minutes it seemed as if the building must be wrecked  mr wright would have run into the street as the only way by which the widows property could be saved but fred and sam prevented him by force and brace who came down stairs at the first alarm said decidedly  you mustnt think of such a thing your life would be taken  it is cowardly to remain here  it is foolhardy to face single handed two or three hundred brutes like those who are yelling  but the widows property  the building belongs to the company and you can easily pay her for what may be destroyed  during this brief conversation the front windows had been shattered and the mob appeared to be on the point of carrying the place by storm when a voice cried  i aint here to fight agin women who are in the same box with ourselves whats to prevent our smashin the windows of his own house  thats the way to talk another replied come on well attend to his case later  as if by magic the mob vanished but the hoots and yells told of the direction in which they had gone  something must be done at once or there is no knowing where this thing will end fred you and sam get some boards up at these windows and ill learn how many of the men can be trusted to stand by us keep out of sight a while longer brace  mr wright left the building by the rear entrance the boys watching until he disappeared within the companys store and then sam proceeded to obey the orders  nearly every pane of glass in the front of the house had been broken and there was not lumber enough to close more than one  we shall have to go to the yard for boards do you dare to try it fred  why not skips crowd are most likely with the men  mrs byram was afraid to have her son leave the house at such a time but joe brace made light of her fears and she gave a reluctant consent  we shant be away more than half an hour and the mob will pay no attention to us while they have so much mischief on hand fred said as he followed sam     chapter vi  on duty   in order to reach the yard where the lumber was to be found it was necessary that the boys should pass near the store and at a point where mr wrights house could be seen plainly the mob which now surrounded it was in full view and the angry shouts mingled with breaking glass came to their ears with great distinctness  it doesnt seem right for us to stay here when we might be of some service there fred said as he pointed in the direction of the building  i dont know what we could do if we were on the spot it isnt likely those men would stop because we asked them to do so and so far as i can judge it is very much better to stay at a respectful distance  and let them destroy the buildings  what can you do to prevent it  nothing that i know of and yet it is wicked to let this thing be done without some protest  mr wright would attend to that matter if a protest would amount to anything our duty is to protect your mother and that must be attended to before anything else  i realize that fact fully but  at this moment mr wright called from the rear of the store  boys come here  obeying the summons they were led to a rear room where were assembled the principal officers of the mine all looking more or less frightened and the superintendent said as they entered  is there anything to prevent your doing as i wish during the next few hours  not that i know of sir fred replied we were about to fasten up the broken windows at home but that is of little consequence in case you require our services  the force of men on guard at the slope is too small if the rioters try to effect an entrance it is in the highest degree important that billings crowd be prevented from getting in until all our arrangements have been made will you go on duty there until troops can be summoned  we are willing to do everything in our power  then arm yourselves with these guns  mr wright pointed to a number of muskets as he spoke and sam did not delay in selecting a weapon  i must tell mother where i have gone or she will be worried fred said as he started toward the door  i will call upon her at once and you need not delay  how long are we likely to remain on duty  only until troops arrive we have telegraphed to the governor and a company should be here within the next twentyfour hours  it isnt probable the sentinels will take our word for it that you have sent us  here is a line to donovan and you had better start at once for theres no saying how soon the rioters may get tired of destroying dwellings tell donovan that we hope to send him a larger force soon  the boys felt very much like soldiers as they marched toward the slope each armed with a gun and half a dozen cartridges and the tumult which could be heard distinctly heightened the illusion  they have set fire to some building sam said as he pointed to a column of smoke which rose from the direction of the superintendents home if that kind of work has begun theres little chance of its being ended while billings crowd hold the town  i ought to have staid with mother theres no reason why i should help fight the companys quarrels while she may be in danger  you could be of no assistance and it is better to be out of the way for skip and his gang will not remain quiet while it is possible to do mischief  at the same time i should be with her fred replied but making no motion to return  upon arriving at the entrance to the slope they were stopped by a sentinel who cried as he leveled his gun  halt what do you want  we have been sent by mr wright with a note to donovan sam replied  stay where you are and i will call him  this looks like fighting sam said as the sentinel shouted for the breaker boss if they are afraid to let the boys come nearer than hailing distance whatll be done when the mob get here  if the soldiers arrive things will be worse than they are now fred said with a sigh and then donovan interrupted the mournful conversation by calling as he came up the slope  oh its you eh well get in here quick i thought mr wright had sent some one to help us  so he has and sam handed the breaker boss the superintendents letter were to go on duty here till help arrives in the shape of soldiers  i spose you two will count for one man but we need a good many more by the looks of things go into the first level an stay there till youre wanted  obeying these instructions the boys found a dozen men lounging about the chamber some lying on the empty trucks and others moving to and fro restlessly but all well armed  each one was most eager to know what was being done in the village and the story had but just been told when the first alarm came  get up to the mouth of the slope donovan shouted from above theres a small crowd comin this way an its best to be prepared for em  the command was promptly obeyed and all watched the score of men who were approaching instead of nearing the sentinels they turned off to the left before arriving within hailing distance and one of the party said in a tone of satisfaction  thats all right theyre only lookin around to see if our eyes are open  they are going in the direction of the shaft into which skips crowd threw me fred whispered to sam  yes  and in that way it would be possible to get into this portion of the mine  i spose so but they aint likely to make such a long trip as that  why not if by so doing the lower level could be flooded without any risk to themselves  now dont get frightened fred there isnt one chance in a hundred that any of the crowd know about the old gallery  but if they do all of us might easily be driven out by the water  since it troubles you so much speak to donovan hes the boss and will know if anything should be done  you tell him  not much im not going to be laughed at  fred hesitated only a moment he believed that it was of the utmost importance this possible means of entering the mine should be guarded and calling donovan aside told him of his escape from the shaft but refrained from mentioning joe braces name  i reckon youre more frightened than hurt lad but at the same time i dont want to run any risks since sam thorpe knows the way through take him an start one of you could keep a hundred from comin in at such a small hole as you tell about  are we to stay there  half an hourll be long enough if they dont show theirselves by then well know theres nothin to be feared from that quarter  fred repeated to sam what donovan had said and the orders were not received in a cheerful spirit  thats all you get for bein scared it aint any joke to travel through the lower level an we can count on stayin there till midnight  its better than being flooded out  im not so sure of that  then you wont go  of course i will do you think im such a fool as to act dead against orders come on an lets get through with it as soon as possible  by using an empty car allowing it to run down the grade by its own weight they were soon at the heavy doors which marked the termination of the first level here a halt was made because even the boys whose duties it was to open the barriers were absent and from this point the remainder of the journey was made on foot  at the lower level five miners were found repairing the pumps and the boys were forced once more to tell what had occurred in the village  men what want to work dont go round kickin up sich a row as this one of the party said as fred and sam passed on give some of that billings crowd a chance an the slope neverd be opened agin  theres a miner who wont join the mob fred said  yes but for every man like that a dozen can be found to fight against their own interests  now the boys no longer walked side by side sam led the way watching narrowly the lamp in his companions cap to discover the first signs of firedamp and guarding well the flame which served to show him the proper course  be careful of your matches he said warningly they may be worth a good deal before we get back from this wild goose chase  how much farther must we go  half an hour of fast traveling should bring us to where you found the tunnel choked with coal an i dont reckon you count on tryin to get any farther  we couldnt do it no matter how much we might want to  oh yes when the doors are opened that pile will come down mighty quick but while it stays as it is the passage is blocked better than if a dozen men were on guard  another time of silence during which the boys walked rapidly and then sam uttered an exclamation of surprise  some one has been working here half the coal is pulled away an it wont be much of a job to get into the chamber  who could have done it  perhaps billings gang worked a spell after the order to quit was given  what could they have gained by reaching joe again  taken him through the old drift to the shaft but lets work our way over this pile an then start back before our oil gives out  ten minutes of sharp labor and the boys were in the chamber where brace had been left to die sam throwing himself on the hard floor as he said  well take a breathin spell before leaving you see now there was no use in comin  so it seems but i couldnt help thinking some of that crowd which passed the slope knew how to get here  it aint possiblehark what was that  a low hum as of conversation could be heard from the other side of the wall and sam sprang to the aperture made by fred and joe brace  ill never yip again about youre being scared he whispered after one glance here come the whole crowd an were in a fix  they wont dare to crawl through if we threaten to shoot  lets first find out exactly what they are here for it may be they are only looking for joe  standing either side the aperture the boys watched the approach of the men whose movements were revealed by the miners lamp each carried  it was impossible to distinguish the conversation until the party was very near the break in the wall and then one shouted  hello joe how are you  weve come to pull you out of this scrape another said after waiting a few seconds for a reply  then a lamp was pushed through fred and sam crouching close against the wall to avoid observation and its owner cried in a tone of astonishment  he isnt here the place is empty  a deep silence reigned for a moment and then some one said in an angry tone  it aint hard to understand the whole thing now he slipped the ropes an come out this way wright has heard the story an thats why the works were shut down so suddenly  but whats become of him he aint in the town  of course he is an hidin somewhere jim you run back an tell billings sos he can hunt the sneak out  are you goin on alone  why not them fools are guardin the slope an we can flood the place before they so much as think any one has got in behind them tell the boys well be back by sunset  sam touched fred to warn him that the time for action had arrived and slight as was the movement it caught the attention of the man on the opposite side  hold on he cried theres somebody in here an we must know who it is  before he could thrust his lamp through sam shouted  stand back or therell be trouble two of us are here both armed and we shall fire at the first one who so much as shows the tip of his nose     chapter vii  the struggle   recognizing at once that the voice they had just heard did not belong to the man for whom they were looking the rioters remained silent with surprise and during this short interval sam brought the butt of his gun to the floor with unnecessary force in order that there might be no question about his being armed  who is inside one of the party finally asked and sam replied  it does not make any difference so long as you dont attempt to come through  we shall do it just the same an itll be so much the worse for you if a finger is raised to stop us  theres no need of very much talk were here to keep you out at the first movement both will shoot and weve got ammunition to hold the place till the others come  this bold assertion caused the rioters no little uneasiness as could be told from the fact that the entire party retreated down the drift where they apparently began a consultation as to the best course to be pursued under the circumstances  come on this side sam whispered if we stand opposite each other and are obliged to shoot we shall get the worst of it  do you really mean to kill them fred asked as he changed his position  i intend to hit whoever comes through if i can an theyll have to run the risk of the killin part  if we could only send word to donovan  well we cant an it looks as if we might have to stay here a long while unless they get the best of us nobody will think of coming to look for us for a good many hours an thats why i said we were in a fix  neither of the boys cared to prolong the conversation their situation was desperate and to state it in words seemed like making it worse but as fred afterward said they kept up a terrible thinking until the rioters began operations by approaching the aperture once more keeping close to the wall on either side to prevent giving the defenders an opportunity of using their weapons  see here the spokesman began weve come to give you a chance of actin square you know who we are an that what we do will help all hands who work here let us through peaceably an well allers be your friends but if were obliged to fight for it therell be nothin left of you  well take our chances rather than have such as you call us friends but it strikes me that a fight with all the weapons on our side is too big a contract for you to tackle  put out your lamps boys an well show these fools what can be done  in an instant the tunnel was plunged in profound darkness and the lights worn by the boys served to reveal their whereabouts clearly  both realized how great would be the disadvantages under such circumstances and in the least possible time the tiny flames were extinguished  even while this was being done the rioters attempted to effect an entrance but without exposing himself to a blow sam discharged his weapon paying little regard to accuracy of aim  the noise of the report echoed and reëchoed through the passages and the chamber was filled with smoke during which time fred fancied he saw a form leaning half through the aperture and he also fired  that makes two cartridges an now weve only got ten left sam said in a half whisper at this rate we cant keep the battle goin a great while an when the thing is ended we shall have to take whatever they choose to give  donovan may send some one before the ammunition is exhausted  he wont think of such a thing for a good many hours yet could you find your way back to where the men are at work on the pumps  and leave you alone  one of us must go or else these fellows will soon be where a great amount of mischief can be done  i am willing to do whatever you think best  then go and tell whoever you meet of the pickle i am in ill stay because ill most likely make a better fist at fighting than you  do you want the cartridges  yes and the gun  fred placed the weapon against the wall near his companion and turned to go  dont light your lamp until you are so far away that the flame cant be seen for it wont do to let them know we have divided forces  a silent handshake and sam was alone  its goin to be a tough job an most likely ill get the worst of it he said to himself as he leaned toward the aperture in a listening attitude  five minutes passed and then came a shower of missiles causing a choking dust to arise but doing no further injury immediately afterward the boy fancied another attempt was being made to crawl through and he discharged both weapons in rapid succession  now weve got him a voice shouted and before sam could reload the guns two or three men were in the chamber  he crouched in the further corner hoping to slip the cartridges in the barrel while they should be hunting for him but one of the party ignited a match and an instant later he was held as if by bands of iron  light your lamps an be lively about it for theres another one here  sam made one violent effort to release himself but in vain when the chamber was illuminated he saw a crowd of men peering in every direction for fred  its bill thomas butty one of the party said in surprise i didnt know he was a bosses pet  neither will he be very long wheres the other fellow and sams captor tried to choke the answer from him  if he dont speak quick strangle him we cant spend much time on a kid some one suggested and the question was repeated  sam knew that the men were in no humor to be trifled with and there was little doubt but the strangling would follow unless he obeyed it was possible to delay the explanations for a few seconds and thus give fred so much more time to reach the lower level  with this view he coughed and struggled after the vicelike pressure upon his throat was removed to make it appear as if it was only with the greatest difficulty he could breathe and fully a moment was thus gained when his captor kicked him two or three times as he said  none of that shamming speak quick or ill give you something to cough for  the fellow who was with me went back to the slope  how long ago  when we first knew you were here  thats a lie for we heard you talking  what makes you ask any questions if you know better than i  when did he leave  i told you before of course he waited long enough to find out how many there were of you  at least five minutes had passed from the time sam was first questioned and this must have given fred a safe start  go after him zack and take jake with you the spokesman said sharply travel the best you know how for everything depends on overtakin him  the two men started at full speed and the leader asked sam  where is joe brace  brace sam repeated as if in bewilderment why he didnt come with us  wasnt he in this place when you got here  of course not im most certain i saw him in the village just after the works were shut down  there was a ring of truth in the boys tones which could not be mistaken and the rioters appeared satisfied  abe go an tell billings that brace got out of here in time to warn wright an let him know what weve struck dont waste any time now  when the messenger had departed the leader beckoned to another member of the party and said as he pointed to sam  take care of him the whole thing would soon be up if he should get away  whatll i do with the cub the man asked in a surly tone  anything so that you keep him safe a thump on the head will help straighten matters if he tries to kick up a row  where are you going  well foller up zack an jake an if they catch the boy therell be nothin to prevent our finishin the business we came for  after a brief consultation which was carried on in such low tones that sam could not distinguish a word the men started down the drift leaving the prisoner and his captor alone  sam knew the man was named bart skinner and that he was an intimate friend of billings he had the reputation of being quarrelsome and intemperate and was exactly the sort of person one would expect to see among such a party as were now committing lawless deeds  i dont count on wastin much time with you bart said when the footsteps of his companions had died away in the distance ill leave you in a safe place pervidin you behave but let me hear one yip an ill try the weight of my fist come along  no attempt had been made to fetter sam the rioters understood that it was impossible for him to escape and probably looked upon it as a clear waste of labor  when bart spoke he seized the boy by each arm forcing him through the aperture and then retaining his hold as he followed once in the tunnel the two pressed on at a rapid gait toward the shaft sam being obliged to walk a few paces in advance until they arrived at a point where a tunnel had been run at right angles with the drift but which was shut off by stout wooden doors  well stop here a bit bart said as he tried to unfasten the rusty bolts which had not been used for many years  believing that he might as well accept his capture with a good grace instead of sulking over it sam did what he could to assist in opening the doors  when the task was finally accomplished bart motioned for the boy to enter first and after assuring himself by the flame of his lamp that the air was pure he obeyed  go on a bit an see if it is a drift or only a stable  theyve exhausted the vein after following it about thirty feet sam replied as he walked the full length and when on the point of turning to retrace his steps the doors were closed with a clang while from the outside could be heard the mocking voice of bart as he shoved the bolts into their sockets  its deep enough for what i want to use it youll do no mischief while here an i reckon the bosses will hunt a long time before findin you  then sam heard the sound of rapidly retreating footsteps and thought to himself as he vainly shook the timbers  if those fellows overtook fred im likely to stay here till the mine is flooded     chapter viii  the pursuit   when fred left sam to defend the breach in the wall he fully realized the necessity of giving the alarm quickly and did not stop to light his lamp until after scrambling over the barrier of coal  once this had been done he ran at his best pace guided by the wooden tracks on which the cars were hauled until he was obliged to halt from sheer lack of breath a dull sound in the rear caused him to push on again very quickly for he believed sam had found it necessary to discharge his weapons  on making the second halt a few moments later he detected a certain scurrying noise which at first he fancied might have been caused by the rats but immediately came the voice of a man and he knew the rioters were pursuing him  ill get a pretty heavy dose if they catch me he muttered hurrying once more and when the journey was half finished it became apparent that the pursuers were gaining upon him  the lives of others beside his own might be sacrificed if he did not win the race and he bent all his energies to the undertaking once he stumbled almost fell but luckily recovered his balance and darted on forced to run upon the ties because the space either side was so narrow  nearer and nearer came the men until he could hear their heavy breathing and one of them shouted  halt or well shoot  knowing that they might have gotten possession of his gun he had reason to believe the threat would be carried into execution but he said to himself  its better to be killed by a bullet than take what they choose to give and the command only served to quicken his pace  minute after minute passed no shot was fired his breath came in quick gasps and it seemed impossible to continue the flight many seconds longer the pursuers were now within a few yards and nothing could be seen ahead whether the lower level was close at hand or a mile away he could not decide but in his despair he shouted for help  pick up some chunks of slate an see if you cant hit him at this rate we shall soon have to turn back  one of the men stopped long enough to gather an armful of fragments and as he continued the pursuit threw them with murderous intent at the fugitive  two passed very near the almost exhausted boys head but none inflicted any injury and he shouted again and again for those who were working at the pumps  at the very moment when fred lost all hope a tiny ray of light appeared from out the gloom and he cried for help once more then fell headlong to the ground  when he next realized anything he was surrounded by miners who had evidently been running and one asked impatiently  can you tell us what happened lad an how them sneaks managed to get in here  have they gone back  indeed they have we chased them the matter of half a mile an then concluded it was time we got the story from you for it might not have been safe to pass the first drift  in a few words fred told his story adding as it was ended  there is a big crowd of them and all hands are bent on flooding the mine  we dont care to have them drown us out like rats so i reckon therell have to be some fightin done before that little game is played  but what about sam  theyve got hold of him for sure but hell have to take his chances with the crowd for we cant help him now  theyll kill him  i dont reckon theres much chance of that lad but if there was we couldnt do a thing id go farther than most anybody for he was my butty an a right good boy but hes in the hole to stay till the company get the upper hand of them as would kill their best friends to injure the bosses  fred knew it was bill thomas who spoke in such a tone of utter helplessness and there could be no doubt as to the correctness of his statements  id go back alone if i had the gun  then its lucky you left it behind best go up the slope an tell donovan what has happened here sos he can send men to the old shaft say to him that well be through in a couple of hours more an want him to start the pumps for were workin in four feet of water  after stationing one of their number as guard the miners resumed their labor and fred started toward the slope bent on inducing donovan to take some steps for the relief of sam  wearied by the previous exertions he made but slow progress and when he reached the breaker at least half an hour had elapsed  those who had been left to guard the mine were on duty in positions where their bodies would be sheltered in case of an attack with firearms and in a group outside were forty or fifty of the rioters  bill thomas wants to know if you will start the pumps they are working in four feet of water fred said as he approached donovan  it cant be done now if the whole level is flooded these fellows have made two rushes and are gettin ready for another  dont you suppose this is to prevent you from discovering that a portion of the rioters are getting in through the old shaft and fred told of what had occurred in the drift  thats jest the size of it but what can be done we cant spare a man from here  there are surely more at the store who would help us  very likely but they wont come while this crowd is here  if mr wright knew what was going on he could send a party to the shaft  yes if he knew it  why not send him word  how  this was a question fred did not answer and donovan continued  theres no chance by which any one could get from here to the store while that gang of murderers keep watch over all our movements  it is nearly night in an hour it will be too dark for them to see what is going on  who will take the risk of trying to slip past them  i will  youll be in a worse box than sam is if they catch you  something must be done and since you cant spare anybody to go to the poor fellows assistance im ready to take my chances while trying to help him  donovan did not reply until after looking carefully around as if calculating the probabilities of success and then he said  ive a mind to let you attempt it if the soldiers dont arrive before morning and billings crowd are coming through the old shaft as you say we must have help soon or give up the fight there is a chance you will get past all right and im certain we can expect no one to come unless we say it is impossible to hold out longer  i am ready to go  very well wait until it is dark an then you may make a try for it  it would have pleased fred better if he could have been actively employed at once for the knowledge that sam was in the power of the rioters troubled him more than personal danger would have done but nothing remained save to wait as donovan said and he tried to be patient  from the men on guard he learned that mr wrights house had been attacked but the mob contented themselves with destroying the windows and setting fire to the stable the building itself yet remained intact and there was reason to believe no more outrages except such as might be committed near the mine would be committed  them as are standin in with billings dont really know what they want except as he tells them freds informant said an thats what makes things of this kind dangerous if the men understood exactly the cause of such rows thered be little trouble  but since they dont what will be the result of this one fred asked  thats moren i can tell the mob may quiet down an then again they may grow worse so theres no sayin whatll happen anyhow you dont want to take many chances on your way to the store  ive got to help sam  right you are but at the same time you aint called on to take too big risks dont start unless things look favorable for gettin through all right cause cale billings aint a nice sort of a man to meet when hes on the top of the heap  sam is in his power  how do you know  it is only reasonable to suppose so  then all the more cause for you to keep away from him id like to have some one to see the boss but i havent got the nerve to send a boy instead of goin myself  since this was a direct reflection upon donovan fred refrained from making any reply and the conversation ceased  twice before dark the rioters made a demonstration in front of the slope as if bent on effecting an entrance and each time fred fancied more men were sent in the direction of the old shaft  it was not for him to make any suggestions however and with a heavy heart he watched the maneuvers believing that each moment saw sam in more peril  a messenger was sent to the miners in the lower level telling them that the pumps could not be started and urging all hands to hold the drift against the rioters but that was everything which could be done under the circumstances and the most vulnerable point was virtually left unguarded  when night came the lawless party built several fires between the slope and the shaft very much as if they wished to show that they were on guard and donovan motioned to fred as he walked a few paces down the drift  i didnt want the others to hear what i said for its just as well they shouldnt know what a scrape were in if you can get to the store tell mr wright that he mustnt wait for the soldiers theres no question but bill thomas party have got their hands full keepin back them as come in by the shaft and it cant be long before well be snowed under its about twenty to one now an in case of a rush the matter would be settled mighty quick  if i can leave the mouth of the slope without being seen therell be no trouble  half a dozen of us will go out a short bit an you shall follow on behind there ought to be a chance of slippin off an if there isnt well have to give it up for im not willin you should take too big risks  fred threw off his coat and vest that he might be in good condition for running and then as the men marched out of the slope he crouched in the rear  the rioters made no demonstration but stood ready to repel an attack watching closely all the maneuvers and donovan whispered to the boy  it wont do to try it lad they are scattered around in such a way that you couldnt get a dozen yards before bein seen  im going to try it  dont lad dont several said quickly and fearing he might be forcibly detained fred started  he went straight back from the slope bending low in the vain hope of escaping observation and having gained a distance of an hundred feet set off at full speed forced to run in a half circle to reach the road  to those who were watching it seemed as if hardly a second elapsed before a great shout went up from the rioters  the sneaks are sendin for help  stop that boy  dont let him get away  these and a dozen other orders were given at the same time and those rioters who were nearest fred began the pursuit  hell never reach the store donovan said sadly as he led the way back to the slope when fred was swallowed up by the darkness even if these fellows dont overtake him there are plenty between here and there wholl hear the alarm     chapter ix  joe brace   during the first five minutes after he was locked in the short drift sam thorpe gave himself up to unreasoning anger he threw himself again and again upon the timbers as if believing it would be possible to force them apart and shouted at the full strength of his lungs until he was literally unable to speak louder than a whisper  then recognizing the uselessness of such proceedings he sat down to think over the matter calmly  if fred succeeded in giving the alarm im not in very much danger of being drowned out he said to himself but if he was caught i can count on dying in about two hours  with this mental speech came the assurance that he had yet a hundred and twenty minutes in which to fight for life and he resolved not to waste a single second  the lamp in his cap gave sufficient light for a thorough examination of his prison and it was soon made a solid wall of earth and slate surrounded him the only outlet was through the doors which were of planks and thickly studded with nails that they might be strong enough to resist a heavy pressure of water  his only weapon was a stout pocket knife but even with a saw he could not have cut his way through  the hinges were next examined they were fastened to large joists which in turn had been set firmly into the strata of slate  the only weak point he could find was where the two doors came together and the flat bolt was exposed its entire width and about an inch of its length could be seen thickly covered with rust and here sam decided to direct his efforts  there isnt much chance i can cut it through in two hours he said but its better to work than lay still thinking of what may happen  breaking the stoutest blade of his knife he began with the jagged surface to scratch at the iron while cutting through the rust his progress was reasonable rapid but on firm metal was very much like filing a boiler plate with a pin  then the blade of his knife was worn smooth and he broke off another piece repeating the operation until the steel had been used to the hilt  the bolt was cut nearly half through but as he judged two hours must have passed  if they succeed in flooding the mine i shall still be a prisoner when the water comes he muttered and at that moment he heard the sound of approaching footsteps  two or more had come from the direction of the shaft and halted near the door  its no use to try and fight our way into the drift through the hole he heard one of the newcomers say and recognized the voice as that of cale billings  are you goin to give up beat  not much inside of an hour well have fifty men here and while the fools think we are trying to get in by the slope a tunnel can be made from one of the smaller cuttings  what good will that do  if i aint mistaken we shall come out on the second level where itll be no more than childs play to get the best of both crowds  but suppose wright has sent for soldiers i heard he telegraphed to the governor  well be in possession of the mine an i reckon theyll be willin to make terms with us for a regiment couldn drive us out  well what are you stoppin here for  i want to see where that boy is we mustnt lose him yet awhile  hes in here  an i reckon hell stay till we want him billings replied with a laugh after apparently examining the bolt  then the two men passed on and sam began his slow task again hope was strong in his breast for he knew from the conversation that fred had succeeded in warning the miners  he used the small blade and it wore away so quickly that there could be no chance it would last to complete the work  if i could get a purchase on the door it might be broken open now the bolt is cut so much he said looking around once more  near the uprights was an extra piece of joist standing on end as if forming a portion of the side  the floor of the cutting was full of irregularities where the slate had been broken or taken out and this gave him the opportunity to get the required purchase  with one end of the joist pressed firmly against a slight elevation and the other on the doors just over the bolt he clambered up until near the top when all his weight and strength were brought into play  once twice he swayed up and down and then inch by inch the metal yielded until the heavy timbers swung outward and he was free so far as liberty of movement in the drift was concerned  at the moment when he emerged there was no one in the passage and he hurriedly reclosed the doors that his escape might not be discovered by those who should pass  after some difficulty he succeeded in pushing the broken piece of iron into the sockets in such a manner that a casual observer would hardly notice anything wrong and then extinguishing the light in his cap he went swiftly toward the shaft arriving there just as half a dozen men were on the point of descending  crouching against the wall at one corner the newcomers failed to notice him but it was impossible to ascend the rope ladder which had been let down without attracting attention because of the numbers who continued to arrive at irregular intervals  during an hour he waited shrouded from view by the gloom and then came the desired opportunity  two men returned from the further end of the drift and ascended the ladder  ill follow them and run the risk of being recognized he said to himself and suiting the action to the words he climbed the network of rope immediately behind the second rioter  it was twilight when he arrived at the surface and billings forces were building a row of fires directly in front of the slope  to start toward the village immediately would be to take too many chances of detection and sam loitered on the outskirts of the crowd watching for the desired opportunity which came when fred left the slope to carry donovans message to mr wright  instantly the alarm was given sam started in pursuit accompanied by a dozen others and only by outstripping the rioters could he hope to make his escape  fred ran as he had never done before with the howling mob at his heels and foremost among them was sam two men were in advance of the escaping prisoner but by an apparent misstep while he ran alongside the second the rioter was overturned and but one remained the others being so far in the rear as not to count in the chase  fred glanced over his shoulder now and then but the darkness prevented him from recognizing his friend until the latter deliberately threw himself in front of the pursuer and a tumble was the result  keep on its mesam the butty boy shouted as he scrambled to his feet before the man had fully recovered his senses and with a cry of glad surprise fred asked  how did you get away  its too long a story to tell now when we need all our breath are you trying to reach home  no the store  then you know what billings crowd are intendin to do  yes and help is needed at once  sam made no reply both the men he had overthrown were on their feet again and with a dozen others were close in the rear making every effort to overtake the fugitives  the race was virtually won however unless other rioters were met on the road the boys yet had thirty or forty yards the advantage and before this could be overcome they were within sight of the store from which attracted by the shouts came mr wright and a number of employees  all of these latter were armed and the pursuers halted at a respectful distance while the boys dashed into the building breathless and nearly exhausted  it was several moments before fred could repeat the message donovan had sent and this was hardly done when a message from the governor arrived stating that no troops could be sent until the following day  im afraid those at the mine will have to take care of themselves mr wright said when he learned of the condition of affairs there if we should leave here or even divide our force the store as well as the offices might be sacked  but the mine will be flooded if billings succeeds with the tunnel  it cant be helped now we should need at least fifty men to effect an entrance and eighteen is the full number who can be trusted  those who are there may be drowned  there is no danger of that since all hands are on the alert for the first signs of trouble  then sam and i may as well go home  it would be a good idea to tell brace that he must try to get here unobserved the men already believe he is in town and i am afraid they may discover his hiding place when theres bound to be mischief done  disheartened because after incurring all the danger no real good had been done fred motioned to sam and left the store  the streets of the village presented an unusual appearance nearly every house was open and lighted as if for a general illumination while the sidewalks were crowded with throngs of excited women and children  this would be a good time for skip to pay you off sam said as they walked swiftly along while so much is goin on they could do pretty near as they pleased without fear of being stopped  what he might do seems to be of little consequence compared with the danger which threatens the poor fellows at the mine if the lower level should be flooded while they were guarding the drift theres every chance all would be drowned  it dont do to think of such things when theres nothing which can be done to help them it might be worse an theres some comfort in that  i fail to see anything very cheering in such an idea fred replied and then the two were at mrs byrams home  the door was locked but the lightest of taps sufficed to attract the widows attention and the visitor received no less warm a reception than did the son  brace was so impatient to learn what had been done by the rioters that he descended the stairs immediately upon hearing the boys voices and while mrs byram prepared supper fred and sam gave an account of their own adventures as well as all which was known concerning the mob  so im to sneak over to the store eh the miner asked as the recital was concluded  that was what mr wright said  ill do nothin of the kind  why not  because ive had enough of hidin like a fellow who had done somethin wrong  but it isnt safe to show yourself  ill take the chances an see what billings gang can do  dont think of such a thing mrs byram cried in alarm you might be killed  a fellow who has worked a matter of half a dozen years at farleys cant be knocked out so easy  are you going into the street  yes an to the mine if i take the notion  what could you do alone against two or three hundred men  show that there is one fellow who aint afraid of the whole murderin gang  that would be the height of foolishness  i cant help it was the dogged reply and brace rose to his feet as if to leave the house  both sam and fred sprang up to detain him but before a word could be spoken by either angry shouts and cries were heard in the distance  they are up to fresh mischief sam exclaimed as he cautiously pulled back the curtains to look out  there are a dozen of the rioters on the sidewalk he cried and they are evidently watching us  brace ran to sams side and the instant he showed himself some of the men shouted  heres the traitor weve got him caged  string him up  yank him out sos the bosses can see how we treat spies  these cries were echoed by the body of men who were approaching on a run and mrs byram said as she drew brace from the window  they have learned you are here and in their mad excitement murder may be committed  then came from the street as if to give emphasis to her words  hang him hang him hes worse than the bosses  you must go to the store now sam cried  whats the good they will get in there as easily as here  mr wright and his men are well armed and can protect you  there has been no shootin done yet an ill not be the cause of the first bullet it is better to give myself up at once  you shall not and sam clasped the miner around the waist try the back door it will be possible to give them the slip if you hurry  brace hesitated a moment as if unwilling to display anything which might be mistaken for cowardice and then fred and sam literally forced him toward the door  while you run i will attract the attention of the men mrs byram said as she showed herself at the window and the miner sprang out at the very instant when half a dozen of the rioters entered the gate  tryin to give us the slip eh one of the party cried as all rushed forward  it was too late for brace to return in a twinkling the men had surrounded him fred and sam saw a short but sharp struggle and before they could so much as make a move toward going to his assistance he was overpowered  attracted by the cries of their companions those at the front of the house came around swiftly and brace was half carried half forced into the street  mrs byram tried to plead with the mob but they pushed her aside without ceremony as they shouted  well show them at the store how we deal with spies and traitors  weve got the rope and the sneak now we only need two or three of the bosses to fix the thing up brown  do you suppose they really mean to hang him fred asked in a tone of awe and sam replied sadly  im afraid they will billings always was down on him and the men are so excited as to hardly know what they are about so anything is possible     chapter x  the rescue   the capture of brace seemed to inflame the passions of the mob and not even while the buildings were being sacked was the town in such a state of excitement  by the time the prisoner had reached the vacant lot in front of the store it appeared as if every man woman and child in the village were on the street  sam and fred felt impelled to follow the howling shrieking mob although it was not probable they could aid the unfortunate man and both pressed as near as possible  billings gang havent got possession of the mine yet sam whispered  how do you know  because if that had happened we would see bill thomas or donovan around here somewhere  perhaps they have been made prisoners  it isnt likely even if they couldnt hold their own it would be possible to retreat in good order armed as they were  dont you suppose mr wright will try to do something if these fellows really mean to hang brace  they are bound to help him but i dont see what can be done against so many  owing to the crowd around him it was impossible for the boys to see the prisoner the men swayed to and fro as if fighting among themselves and after a time the reason of these movements was made plain  two long pieces of timber had been lashed together at one end and set up like the letter v inverted these were held in place by some of the mob and drove through the fastenings at the top was a long rope  billings was on hand acting as master of ceremonies and when this portion of the work had been finished he shouted  half a dozen of you take hold of the rope an when i count three string him up  in an agony of apprehension fred looked toward the store no one appeared at the door it seemed as if the bosses had abandoned joe brace  stand ready boys billings shouted well soon show em how we serve out spies  there was a moment of painful silence during which more than one of the mob acted as if frightened because of the terrible crime about to be committed and then an old miner cried  hold on this thing has gone far enough  what do you mean billings asked angrily  just this i joined your crowd to stand up for my rights not to commit murder theres been mischief done already an the most of us will be sorry when weve had time to think the matter over  hold your tongue and go home like the rest of the old women  ill stay where i am an youll be the one to go home if the boys take my advice  then continuing the old man reminded the throng that he had worked at farleys longer than the majority could remember he spoke of the fact that until this day there had been no mob rule intimated that they were blindly following one in whom very few ever reposed confidence and asked if they were willing to hang a friend simply because billings commanded it  the speech was a long one and before twenty words were spoken as many determinedlooking men gathered around brace to prevent any harm from being done  dont listen to the old fool billings cried in a voice hoarse with rage but now very few paid any attention to him and when the prisoners friend finished his appeal there was no danger a human life would be taken  some of those who had been most eager to drag brace away unloosened his bonds and at least a hundred stood ready to defend him  at this juncture mr wright came from the store and the mob were in the proper frame of mind to listen  he explained the true condition of affairs told exactly why the works had been shut down and finished by promising to let the matter be forgotten regardless of the amount of property destroyed in case the mob should disperse  and if we go home what then billings asked sneeringly well starve to please you eh  those who attempted to flood the mine will not starve at farleys for all in the plot must leave not one of that party can work here but the others shall be treated as before  so were to be driven out  certainly it isnt probable any honest miner would care to work with those who may succeed in drowning their fellows simply to gratify a spite against the officers of the company  it will take more than you to drive us away  i can at least prevent you from entering the mine and that i shall do even if it is necessary to station guards entirely around the property are you willing to go home now men with the assurance that work shall be resumed in the morning  ay that we are an glad of the chance it was out of the fryinpan into the fire when we left one set of bosses to take up with cale billings an his cronies a miner shouted and immediately the mob dispersed leaving the leaders standing in the lot evidently consulting as to how their lost power might be regained  when brace was at liberty he joined sam and fred and the three walked to the latters home neither speaking until they were inside  do you think the strike is really over mrs byram asked after fred told her of what had occurred  it is so far as the majority of the miners are concerned brace replied but theres no telling what billings may contrive to do between now and morning  i suppose those men are still in the mine trying to overpower donovans party  most likely but now that wright has got the upper hand theres little chance theyll be allowed to stay very long  despite the excitement on every hand the occupants of mrs byrams cottage were glad to retire at the first opportunity and before the tumult in the street had died away they sought the needed repose it had been decided that brace should remain for a while since it might be dangerous to meet billings and his friends while they were smarting under the sting of defeat  at the usual hour next morning the whistle sounded summoning the miners to work and every one responded save those who had been warned to leave the town  mr wright was at the entrance to the slope and had a pleasant greeting for each man and boy causing more than one to look ashamed because of the part taken in the wanton destruction of his property  joe brace and sam went into the drift leaving fred with chunky and that young fellow said as he seated himself at the chute  things have been pretty lively round here eh  i should say so were you out with the regulators  i saw em once or twice  if youll take my advice youll leave that crowd skip millers as bad as billings  dont speak so loud hes lookin over this way an may make things hot for you if much is said  if he didnt do anything yesterday i guess he aint dangerous  he couldnt find you  then he was lookin for me  thats what i heard some of the fellers say  i should think hed seen enough of such business but if he hasnt ill have to take care of myself  be careful chunky whispered he an some of the other fellers think you are more of a spy than joe brace was  and they mean to flog me for it  skip says you told mr wright about their droppin you in the shaft  hadnt i the right to do you suppose ill let them try to kill me and never open my mouth about it  well it aint safe for hes got a big crowd  then he hasnt had enough of the riot  it aint that but he says the regulators have got to stand up for their rights an you havent paid your footin yet  and i dont intend to if any of them try to make me itll go hard with them  at this point the machinery was started the stream of coal and slate began to flow through the chute and the breaker boys were forced to attend to their work  several times during the morning donovan spoke to fred as he passed and at twelve oclock when all hands were indulging in the forty minutes nooning and chunky had crossed over to speak with skip the breaker boss ate his lunch by the new boys side  you didnt come back again last night he said  no sir after brace got away from the mob he and sam went home with me we didnt think youd need us when the trouble was nearly settled  neither did we as soon as the men found their senses mr wright brought a lot of them up here an we soon got rid of billings friends  had they begun to dig a tunnel  bless you yes an were within a dozen feet of bill thomas party when we found them if the row had lasted two hours longer we couldnt be workin here today an some of the boys would be under water  do you think the whole matter is finished  yes so far as the majority of the men are concerned but billings swears he wont be driven out of town an he may manage to do more mischief  why dont mr wright have him arrested  because he gave his word that nothin should be done to them as went home peaceably an he couldnt jump on billings without bringing all hands into the scrape cordin to my way of thinkin weve got off cheap  was mr wrights house damaged very much  itll take a good many hundred dollars to put it in the same condition it was before but money doesnt count when theres been no blood spilled  do you think there is any chance the men will try to hurt brace now  thats hard to say youre in as much danger as he is for they know that you and sam stood in with us an its just possible some dirty trick will be played you an bill thomas butty are to stop at the office tonight mr wright wants to see you  what for  hell have to explain that its time to go to work again be careful of yourself  donovan walked away as the whistle sounded and chunky came back looking very stern  youll get into more trouble by standin in with the bosses he said in what sounded like a threatening tone  does skip miller think he can say who i shall talk with  whether he does or not none of the fellers like bosses pets  even if i was a pet as you call it i cant see how it concerns any one but myself almost anything is better than being a regulator  ive told you what the fellers think an that ends it look out for yourself after this  i cant accuse you of ever looking out for me not even when a hint might have saved me from a pounding  chunky made no reply and fred understood that although the riot was ended his position in the community had not been bettered one sample of mob rule evidently pleased the regulators and they were prepared to assert their alleged rights more strongly than ever  when the days work was finished joe brace and sam came for fred and he walked out of the breaker in their company while skip and his adherents stood near the building ready to take advantage of the first opportunity for mischief  dont think we shant get a whack at you the leader cried them fellers wont allers be round an when our time does come thingsll be worse than they was in the shaft  if i ever hear of your touchin fred ill take a hand in the row myself brace said threateningly  oh yes you will skip replied with a leer and then led his followers down the road each one making some insulting remark as he passed  ill straighten that fellow out joe said angrily hes got the will to do most anything an we must take him down a peg before itll be safe for you to move around  dont say anything to them for it will only make matters worse ill see to it that they dont get another chance at me sam mr wright wants to see us at the store will you wait for us joe  indeed i will till things get settled i want to keep my eye on both you boys  the superintendent was in his office at one end of the building when the party entered and he beckoned them to join him  dont hang back brace for i wish to see you as well i want to take your butty away and give you fred instead how would you like that  first class sir  i wish to have a few whom i can trust on the lower level i dont ask for any spying but expect to be informed if there is any serious mischief brewing there may yet be some who will aid billings to gain his revenge sam is to remain with thomas but will work near you  very well sir and brace rose to go thinking the interview was at an end but mr wright detained him  the most important matter is concerning the old shaft and drifts from which points very much mischief might be done sit down while we talk of it  at this moment skip miller entered unobserved by those in the office and seeing the occupants of the little room made his way behind a pile of goods where he could hear very much of what the superintendent said     chapter xi  billings and skip   joe brace did not appear to think there was much to fear from the late rioters so far as the possibility of their making an entrance through the old shaft was concerned  this end of the gallery is pretty well filled up already he said an with a few loads of slate it can be shut off entirely more especially after the doors are barred  it is not from that portion of the mine that i apprehend any trouble look here and mr wright spread on the desk before him a plan of the workings at this point you can see that an old drift runs parallel with and not more than three yards from our lower cut the veins probably come together farther on  it wouldnt take a man very long to work his way through joe said reflectively  and not knowing where an attempt may be made it will be very difficult to prevent mischief  unless the old shaft should be guarded  to do that we should be obliged to station men entirely around our works for here is the abandoned slope and farther down the hill two or three places where an entrance could be effected  but billings an his crowd dont know all this  possibly not yet there are many of the older men who could tell the story  joe shook his head in perplexity  illustration you four are to act as sentinels said the superintendent study this map and you will hit upon a scheme  i am not warranted in hiring a large force of men as guards mr wright continued and we must do that from the inside you and thomas with these boys as helpers shall work on the lower level and i will take care that none but true men are near by  how will that mend matters  you four are to act as sentinels it makes little difference how many loads you take out for the company will pay day wages  even then i dont see how we can do anything  you and thomas must form some plan study this map and i am confident you will hit upon a scheme  is there any chance that the drifts choked with gas  very little  joe was thoroughly puzzled and after several moments of silence mr wright said  get your supper now and then talk the matter over with thomas  at this intimation that the interview was at an end the miner left the office followed by the two boys and when they were out of the store skip miller came from his hiding place without having been seen by the superintendent or his clerks  the leader of the regulators lounged carelessly toward the door until satisfied no one was paying any particular attention to him when he stepped briskly out and walked rapidly to a groggery situated at the farther end of the town  here as he had anticipated was cale billings and a select party of friends all of whom were discussing their late defeat  skip did not care to state the reason for his coming in the presence of the entire party and waited patiently in one corner of the room until it should be possible to beckon the leader out of doors  wright may think were whipped billings was saying but thats where he makes a big mistake he cant drive us out of this town no matter how much he may blow an it wont be many days before well show whats what  theres little chance for us the way things look now one of the party said with a laugh  how do you know the folks round here have seen what i can do an theyll soon find out that theres a good deal of fight left  as he said this billings looked first at one and then another to note the effect of his bold words and in doing so chanced to see skip who immediately made a series of what he intended should be mysterious gestures  whats the matter with you the man asked angrily but instead of replying skip placed his finger on his lips and quickly left the room  it was several moments before the leader understood he was wanted and when this fact dawned upon him he followed meeting the boy a few yards from the entrance  was you cuttin up them monkey shines for me he asked in a surly tone  of course  well whats wanted  you jest said as how youd like to get square with the company  sposen i did does that concern you  praps i heard somethin round to the store youd want to know  say if youve got anything to tell out with it for i cant fool away my time with you  first ive got a trade to make  talk quick  do you know the new breaker boy the one whats so thick with wright an joe brace  yes  i want to get square with him an if youll help me do it ill tell what i heard a lot of em saying  was it anything id like to know  itll show jest how you can get the best of the whole crowd  then ill do what i can an be glad of the chance cause ive got a little score to settle with him myself  skip no longer hesitated but repeated in detail all he had heard while hiding in the store billings listening with closest attention  thats the best piece of news ive heard for a year my boy the latter said an you shant be the loser by tellin me if youve got the nerve to do a little work after everything is ready both the breaker boss an this new feller shall be where they cant help themselves  the leader of the regulators felt exceedingly proud that the rioter should ask him to participate in the plot and promised without the least show of hesitation to do anything which might be required of him  how long before youll be ready he asked  it may be a week but you drop in here for a minute every evenin sos i can talk about the thing if the plans dont work theres no use to be in a hurry over sich a job as this  ill show up reglar skip cried gleefully and then as billings reentered the groggery he hurried away to tell the good news to some of his chums  during this plotting joe brace and bill thomas were at freds home discussing the best means of following mr wrights instructions the plan of the works was studied carefully but in it was found no solution to the problem and when they retired that evening nothing definite had been decided upon  the night shift went to work as usual and but for the evidences of wanton destruction a stranger would hardly have mistrusted that farleys had lately been a scene of rioting  on the following morning fred passed through the breaker to speak to donovan before entering the slope and skip miller displayed the greatest excitement on seeing him  i dont know how it could have happened the breaker boss said for i havent told even my own wife that you was to be joes butty but these young villains know all about it ive heard skip tellin his cronies an im sure theyre up to some mischief be careful an dont go outside alone leastways not till the business of the riot has blown over  ill look to it that they havent a chance to do much harm fred replied laughingly as he passed on to learn the first duties of a miner  joe bill and sam accompanied fred to his new working place and the former said as they were being let down the incline  i hear billings swears he wont leave town  i passed him on my way home last night bill added and he warned me agin keepin sam as my butty  why  he says he is a spy hand in glove with you an that all who work with them as give information to the bosses will catch it rough  bill thomas laughed as he said this but joe looked serious  i dont like this way of working the lower level is bad enough without thinkin all the time that somebody is tryin to do a fellow up  nonsense barkin dogs dont often bite an so long as we know he means mischief there aint much chance of trouble the thing to be figgered out is howre we goin to fix this job  again the two men discussed the situation walking along the drift with the plans before them while the boys were forced to be content with listening to the conversation  it was finally decided that they should work here and there along the entire cut trusting that it would be possible to hear if any one began to dig on the opposite side  its a case of keepin quiet an listenin for suspicious sounds bill said we wont try to get out coal today an perhaps by night mr wright will have a better plan  by watchin billings we could get some kind of an idea as to when he was likely to begin operations  donovan promised to see to that part of it  then well kinder lay round till we get the hang of the place you boys go on to the end of the drift an come back dont make any noise  the forenoon was spent in what was little more than patrol duty and when mr wright came below he approved of their plans nothing better was suggested and until nightfall all four paced to and fro the other miners having been withdrawn from the drift  when evening came skip did not wait to see if fred came out but hurried off to the groggery where he was made happy by billings extreme friendliness  the leader of the mob arose immediately upon seeing him and led the way outside saying when they were some distance from the building  ive been thinkin over what you told me an am certain we can work this thing all right  when  in a day or two if you could manage to get hold of that paper the job might be done in a jiffy  but joe an bill have got it  sposen they have a smart lad like you oughter find some way to get at it an it would be worth your while to try  it couldnt be done  praps not by you but i know of some no older than you whod have it before morning of course i dont blame a boy for not tryin when he hasnt the nerve  see here skip cried impatiently havent i showed grit enough to do most anything  if you have prove it by gettin hold of that paper  i cant see what you want it for  because it shows us all the levels with it we can tell jest where to begin work  ill make a try for it anyhow but i cant figger any way to get at it  watch for a chance they wont keep it in their hands all the time and by knockin off work now an then loafin round near where they are youll soon have your hands on it  you wont go back on me if i get into trouble  dont worry about that i never shake a friend  with this assurance skip walked away feeling very happy because of the manner in which billings spoke but sadly perplexed as to the best course to accomplish the desired end     chapter xii  a singular accident   two trustworthy men had been selected from the night shift to keep guard on the lower level during the time between sunset and sunrise and about an hour before the relieving whistle sounded not having heard any suspicious noises they lounged down toward the slope where the miners were at work  here paying but little attention to what was going on around them they conversed with the laborers or smoked pipes as black as their faces in order to while away the moments which must elapse before the labor was ended  men were passing and repassing on every hand and in the darkness no one saw a small figure in whose cap the lamp was not lighted run swiftly from the foot of the slope up the drift where the sentinels should have been  on either side of the passage shallow cuttings had been made that the miners might step aside to avoid the cars as they were drawn to and fro into one of these the figure with the unlighted cap glided and crouching in the farthest corner was screened from view unless a careful search should be made  when the day shift came on duty chunky reported to the breaker boss that skip miller could not come to work on this day  why not donovan asked sharply  cause hes got to do somethin at home he told me to tell you  when did you see him  last night  where  over by taylors  what were you doin at that grogshop  nothin i was jest walkin around an met him  look here chunky it will be best for you to keep away from that place no decent man or boy would go there an id be sorry to know you trained with the regulators ive got my eye on them fellers an when trade is dull theyll be the first to get their walkin papers  if father dont care what i do it aint any business of yours so long as i work from whistle to whistle  thats very true but i shall make it my business to see what your father has to say about it  this threat had the effect of checking the almost insolent air chunky had begun to display and he went to his place at the chute very meekly  while this brief conversation was being held joe and bill with their helpers entered the lower level where the careless sentinels reported matters as being quiet  we havent heard moren a rat since you left one of them said i dont believe billings has got the nerve to try any funny business an in this case mr wright is more frightened than hurt  thats a good fault matey bill replied gravely its better to have half a dozen of us nosin around for a week or two than run the risk of what cale an his friends may do  oh i aint kickin but it dont seem reasonable they could get into the old drift for it must be choked with gas  by findin that out we might save a good deal of work joe replied quickly it wouldnt take long to cut through where the wall is thinnest  youre right mate an well get at it now boys go over to the blacksmiths for four shovels bill added as he pulled the plans from his pocket  sam and fred obeyed and while they were absent the two men studied the drawing for at least the hundredth time  save for those who were seated on a block of coal poring over the paper the drift was deserted and the one who had secreted himself in the cutting crept silently forward until it was possible to see what the miners were doing  as a matter of course this party was skip miller and he said to himself with a chuckle of satisfaction  with all day before me itll be queer if i cant get what billings wants  when sam and fred returned bill had decided at which point the excavation should be made and he said designating a spot hardly more than a dozen yards from where skip was hidden  if the plan is corect this oughter be our place well try it anyhow you boys tell one of the drivers to bring up a car for we dont want to choke the drift with dirt  then bill stuck his pick in the wall which was made up of earth and slate skip who sat directly opposite had a full view of all that was done  when the car had been brought into position bill told sam and fred to shovel into it what he and joe threw from the cutting and soon all four were working industriously  before the time for nooning arrived it became necessary to shore up the top of the tunnel lest the mass of earth should fall and bury the laborers and when this was done both the men entered the excavation which was now twelve feet in length  in this confined space the air was oppressively warm and the miners threw off their blouses leaving them in the drift near the entrance  skip knew that in the pocket of the one worn by bill was the paper he had been instructed to steal and he watched eagerly for an opportunity to creep up unobserved  while sam and fred were at work it was impossible to do this but the car had been nearly filled and in a short time it would be necessary to get another  the men could no longer throw the dirt from where they were working to the entrance and fred had been ordered to stand midway the cutting that he might pass it on to sam  ill run this car down an get another if youll give me a lift at starting it sam finally shouted and fred came out  the incline was sufficient to carry the rude vehicle to the switches at the foot of the slope after it was once set in motion and using a crowbar as a lever this was soon accomplished  sam ran behind it a few paces and then clambered up to the brake where he could control the movements of the heavy load  fred watched him until the tiny flame in his cap was lost to view in the distance and then he returned to the tunnel unconscious that skip had glided from his hidingplace to follow closely behind  it was necessary the leader of the regulators should work with the utmost celerity for if fred turned he would distinguish the dark form even in the gloom  skip had already formed a plan  he crept close behind the boy whom he hated until the latter entered the tunnel then stooping he picked up the crowbar and raised it for a blow in this position he waited until fred was in the middle of the tunnel clambering over the pile of dirt to get at his shovel  the time had come  swinging the heavy bar once around he struck the bottom of the joist which supported the shoring over head and the heavy timbers put up insecurely because they were to be used but temporarily fell with a crash  the jar disturbed the earth at the top and large masses fell completely filling the entrance burying alive those who were on the inside  that settles them i reckon skip cried gleefully as unmindful of the blinding dust he sprang toward bills blouse  to find the plan of the mine was but the work of a moment and then with the precious document thrust in the bosom of his shirt he started at full speed toward the entrance to the slope  the crash of the timbers and earth was by no means an unusual sound in the mine where heavy masses of coal were constantly being detached by blasts and the leader of the regulators had good reason to believe it would be unnoticed his only care was to avoid sam in case he should return sooner than might be expected and to this end he darted from one cutting to another until having reached a point from which at the proper moment he could gain the slope  here he remained partially screened from view until the empty car which sam was to send to the new cutting had passed on its way up the drift  now he listened intently and in a few moments came the cry  a break a break and three men buried help on the lower level  those who were near enough to hear this appeal sent the alarm from drift to drift up the slope until the entire mine seemed to be ringing with the words  help is needed on the lower level  in view of all that happened together with the knowledge that if any attack was made by the billings gang it would be on the lower level every workman ran with all speed to the bottom of the slope and among the foremost was mr wright  what has happened he asked of a blacksmith who was darting toward the chamber in which the tools were stored  bill thomas joe brace and a butty are buried in a cutting the fools were makin up there a piece  go back mr wright cried to the swarm of men which came down the slope like a living stream not more than twelve can work to advantage and we have that number here  but we want to do our share an old miner replied  you shall have a chance if we do not find them soon it is not safe to have so many here at once  all hands understood the reason for this caution and as the crowd turned to ascend skip miller slipped from his hiding place and joined them he did not fear detection while every one was in such a state of excitement and even if he should be recognized it would be only natural for him to have followed the men at the first alarm  it was necessary however that he should avoid donovan and with the utmost caution he emerged from the slope running as fast as his legs would carry him on reaching the open air  not until taylors groggery was near at hand did he slacken speed and then assuming as best he could an air of composure he opened the door cautiously to peep in  cale billings was the only customer and on seeing skip he cried  come in lad i reckon youre here to see me  struggling hard to prevent his heavy breathing from being observed by the proprietor the leader of the regulators entered and whispered  theres been an accident on the lower level an two or three shut in  explosion  the top of the cuttin fell in an it wont be a easy job to dig em out  was you there  sam nodded his head in a triumphant manner  youre a lad after my own heart billings said approvingly as he extended a huge grimy hand for the boy to shake if half the men here had your spunk wright wouldnt have got the best of us so easy did you fix that thing i told you about  skip nodded his head and again billings shook his hand  thats what i call business lets have it  the leader of the regulators was about to draw the dearlyearned document from his pocket when the proprietor of the place interfered  none of that he said sharply theres somethin goin on what aint straight an i wont have it in my shop  do you mean to go back on a friend billings asked in an injured tone  not a bit of it but the company are lookin after you mighty sharp cale an i dont want to get in trouble theres plenty room out of doors  all right the shop belongs to you but it may be the losin of a good customer and billings walked out with skip close at his heels  now give me the paper  when the document was delivered the man glanced at it to make sure it was the one wanted and then said in a fatherly tone  i reckon youve fixed things to suit yourself if the new breaker boy was in the cuttin when the roof fell  theyre diggin for him now but im goin to get the worst of this job  how so  taylor will blow the whole thing an then wright will know it was me  aint i here to protect yer  yes but  dont worry my son go into the breaker as if nothin had happened  i cant cause i sent word i wouldnt come today  then keep out of sight till night and meet me on the railroad track after dark well have this job mighty nigh done before morning  billings was walking toward the slope and not daring to follow him any farther skip ran swiftly in the opposite direction wondering where he could hide until sunset for the first time he began to fear the consequences of his cruel deed and the thought that the officers of the law might soon be in search of him was by no means reassuring  he sought the shelter of the thicket farther up the hill where a view of the slope could be had and there he waited expecting each moment to see lifeless bodies brought from the mine     chapter xiii  buried alive   at the moment when skip miller knocked away the joist which supported the timbers at the top of the tunnel fred had stooped to pick up his shovel and this position saved him from being instantly killed  one end of the shoring plank was yet held by the upright placed in the center of the cutting and it remained at an angle although pinning him down while the earth covered him completely  for a moment he was at a loss to know what had happened and then he heard as if from afar off joe calling him by name  here i am under the timber he replied  are you hurt much  i think not but i shall stifle to death if the dirt isnt taken away soon  it aint a sure thing that you wont stifle even then he heard bill say sharply take hold mate an lets get him from beneath while we have a chance to breathe  then the grating of the shovels was distinguished and pound by pound the weight was removed until nothing save the timber held him down  can you get out now joe asked and his voice sounded strangely indistinct  not till the joist is pulled away  when that is done its safe to say tons of the roof will follow bill muttered and joe asked  does it hurt you much lad  the edges are cutting into my back terribly  grin an bear it as long as you can our only chance for life is to break through the wall into the old tunnel but if that timber is taken away its goodbye for all hands  then dont bother about me its better one died than three  there was no reply to this the men were digging at the barrier of earth with feverish energy and each instant respiration became more difficult the slight amount of air which filtered through the bank of slate and sand was no more than sufficient for one pair of lungs  the darkness was profound the lamps had been extinguished by the shock and five minutes later it was impossible to relight them the oxygen had become so nearly exhausted that a match would not burn  fred bit his lips to prevent an outcry the huge timber was crushing him slowly but surely and the pain was intense  each instant the blows of the men grew fainter strength and even the power of movement was rapidly succumbing to the noxious vapor  joe was the first to give up and as the pick fell from his nerveless hands he said faintly  its all over lads we might as well pull the timber from fred and die at the same moment  dont weaken mate bill said imploringly who knows but were within a few inches of the other drift  even if thats true the chances are well be stifled by the gas  the alarm may be given in time to save us from the entrance  sam cant have come back yet an before any one knows what has happened we shall be dead  joe had lost all courage and the apathy of despair was upon him his words robbed fred of the last hope and as it fled consciousness deserted him  bill delivered a few more feeble blows with the pick and then he in turn sank to the ground  the hand of death was very nearly upon them and the agonies of dissolution already passed  within a few feet of where the unconscious men lay willing hands were working at the obstruction no more than three could labor at once but these were relieved every two minutes in order that their energy might not be impaired by weariness and meanwhile others shoveled the slate and earth into cars that the drift might be kept clear  mr wright personally assisted in the labor and it was he who began the cheering which ensued when an aperture was made in the barrier  at it with a will boys he shouted but be careful about removing the timber for some of the poor fellows may be beneath it  the foul air rushing out nearly overcame the laborers but the eager rescuers heeded not their own peril and the moment finally came when the unconscious ones were fully exposed to view  pass out the men and then dig beneath the boy he must be released in that manner otherwise we may all share their fate and mr wright shoveled the earth carefully away from fred while the others carried joe and bill into the drift  from his place of concealment on the hillside skip miller saw a party of men come out of the slope bearing an ominous looking burden  one of them is dead he whispered to himself as his face paled  then came another party and a few seconds later the third each carrying a similar load marched down the road leading to the village  the sight nearly overpowered skip he shook as if in an ague fit and after staring at the sad spectacle until the men had passed from view he turned and ran through the grove believing the officers were close upon him  the news that two miners and a boy had probably been killed spread through the village rapidly and cale billings was in taylors groggery when one of the late rioters brought the intelligence  its a wonder they dont accuse us of havin somethin to do with the accident the newcomer added and the proprietor said sternly  i dont want to drive customers away but if any who come here have had a hand in murder theyd better not show their heads round this place again  billings looked disturbed but made no reply although having had no direct share in the crime he knew he was really an accomplice and the knowledge that taylor might inform against him was by no means pleasant  it was eight oclock in the evening when skip ventured to come down from the hillside and he looked like a boy who had been very ill even at this late hour he did not dare to walk through the village but skulked around the outskirts until he saw chunky whom he hailed in a whisper  where have you been freds chute mate asked in surprise  i had some work on the other side of the hill  have you been there all day  yes jest got back are those fellows dead  ordinarily chunky was not quick to arrive at conclusions but now he asked in a suspicious tone  how did you know anything about it if youve jest got back  oh i heard from some of the fellows  who  never mind and skip spoke sharply  did they all get killed  none of em but the doctor says fred wont be over it for three or four days joe an bill are both in bed though theyll be out in the morning  does wright know who did it  did what  why knockwhatever was done  i thought the roof of a cuttin fell in cause it wasnt shored up enough  i spose that was the reason skip replied in a nervous way  it seems to me you know more about this thing than anybody else  youd better not say that again and skip stepped forward a few paces with clenched fists  you can get the best of me so ill have to hold my tongue but i reckon ive had all i want of the regulators tryin to kill a feller who never did much of anything to you is a mean trick  shut up or ill knock your head off you cant back out of our sciety an if you ever say i tried to kill anybody ill pound you till there wont be an inch of skin left  chunky did not wait to hear more he started at full speed toward his own home and skip was more alarmed than before  now im in a worse scrape than ever for hes jest fool enough to tell what he knows an then there will be trouble id better go to meet billings an perhaps he can help me out  he could reach the rendezvous without going through the village and greatly to his relief the leader of the rioters was waiting to receive him  now this is somethin like business and billings patted the boy on the head  skip stepped back the touch of the mans hand now when through him he had gotten into so much trouble was disagreeable  what am i to do he asked fiercely  help me finish what youve begun  i wont do it theyll have me arrested an you must get me through the scrape  so i will after ive served the company out well go off somewhere together  and im to leave home  theres nothin for it if wright gets the idea that you knocked the timber away  if he doesnt know it already there are them who will tell him chunky thinks i did somethin to help the thing along  he does eh and now billings began to look disturbed is he likely to go to any of the bosses  he might tell some one else who would do it  thats true what with him an taylor things begin to seem kinder scarey for me  im in worse trouble  youre right an that shows we two must keep together  but i dont want to leave home  you cant help yourself once in the scrape its bad to back out  skip had good evidence that the way of the transgressor is hard he felt a decided repugnance to becoming billings constant companion but he dared not go home and it seemed as if there was no other course left open  it wont do to stay here very long for folks might see us and it wouldnt be hard to guess we were up to mischief will you go with me or take the chances of bein arrested  ill have to do what you say skip replied with a groan and billings started straight across the hill toward the abandoned shaft  where are you going  well hide for a while it aint safe to loaf round here much longer heres a dollar go to taylors an get somethin to eat tell him i want cooked food cause im bound on a tramp  i dont dare show up there  move on or ill break every bone in your body youve got to toe the mark now if you dont want to go to jail  billings used the tone of a master and skip understood that his crime had brought him to slavery of the most degrading kind  the groggery was filled with men when he arrived and in the number he found safety all were excitedly discussing the accident some intimating that billings had a hand in it and no one paid any particular attention to the frightened boy who crept cautiously in as if to avoid being seen  wants grub eh taylor asked when skip made known his errand whats he up to afraid theyll nab him for what was done today  i dont know  now look here skip miller i aint got any too much love for you but it dont seem right to let a boy go on as youve begun go home now an leave billings to take care of his own business  if i dont carry back the stuff hell say i stole his money  well take the grub an then get back as soon as you know how  all right skip replied meekly  if youre not home in half an hour ill see your father tonight  i wish i dared to go skip said to himself as he hurried away with the bundle workin in the breaker aint a marker to what itll be runnin around with cale billings     chapter xiv  precautions   not until two days had elapsed were the victims of the accident able to leave their rooms and then they met sam and mr wright at mrs byrams home  well be ready for work in the morning bill said in reply to the superintendents inquiries what troubles me is that ive lost the plan of the old mine it was in my blouse when the timber fell an  how that joist could have got away without some one to help it is what worries me joe interrupted i set it an know the weight from above could not have any effect  there is no chance of foul play the level has been guarded night and day therefore unless our trusted men are at fault it was purely an accident  im not sayin it wasnt but yet the whole business looks queer and with this remark joe dismissed the subject from his mind  mr wright had come to learn when the guardians of the level would be ready to return to duty and bills answer sufficed  the men who have been there during the past twentyfour hours shall be given other work in the morning and once more i can rely on you thus far nothing suspicious has been seen or heard he said and i begin to believe billings has given up his thoughts of revenge the only strange thing is that millers boy has disappeared and his father can think of no reason why he should run away  farleys wont be the loser if he never comes back joe replied that boy is a bad one an it wouldnt take much to make me believe he an billings are firm friends  there is no necessity of talking about him we are not afraid of boys the question is whether we are warranted in guarding the lower level much longer  thats for you to say sir we had rather be at our regular work  well well try it a day or two more perhaps youd better break through into the old drift and then we shall know whether it is possible for evildisposed persons to find a hiding place there  this closed the interview so far as mr wright was concerned and on his leaving the house the others discussed the work to be done the following day but skip millers disappearance had little place in the conversation  bill mourned the loss of the plan which was supposed to be the only guide to the old mine but joe did not think it was of such very great importance  all we care to know is whether the airs foul an of course the best way is to finish the tunnel which came so near finishin us that work can be done without any guide  but we may want to follow up the drift which will be a long job if we have to go on blindly  theres no use fussin over what cant be helped the paper got trampled into the dirt most likely otherwise them as have been lookin would a found it before this  i dont feel like givin over the search so easy spose we four have a reglar hunt in the morning  sam and i will go now fred said we shall feel better for a little exercise after being cooped up in the house so long  very well take a turn at it this afternoon an if you dont succeed joe an ill try tonight  the boys set off without delay but they were a long while reaching the slope for every person on the street thought it necessary to congratulate them upon having escaped a terrible death and at the breaker donovan delayed the search by making minute inquiries as to the condition of affairs in the drift just prior to the accident  any one would think from all these questions that you believed somebody was responsible for the trouble sam said with a laugh  prhaps i do billings an skip miller disappeared on the same day an that looks suspicious to me though mr wright wont listen to anything of the kind  its a big satisfaction to know they have left fred added and we have gotten rid of them cheaply do you know where they went  out of the village somewhere harvey saw them walking up the track  then we can reckon that therell be no more mischief done for a while come on fred lets get down the slope  the boys left the breaker without noticing that chunky was trying to attract their attention and were soon in the lower level making a systematic search  shoveling over the loose dirt along the track they continued on until the cutting which had so nearly been a grave for fred was passed and then sam said as he halted  its no use to hunt here it couldnt have got up this way  the draught may have carried it quite a distance  there isnt air enough stirrin to move it a foot but it wont do much harm to look  they were nearly at the chamber where sam was taken prisoner before fred abandoned the hunt and as he turned to retrace his steps both came to a sudden halt  as if from beneath their feet arose a muffled cry of distress  the boys looked at each other in alarm and as they stood motionless the mysterious sound was repeated  what can it mean fred asked in a whisper  thats moren i can tell theres no drift below this  that was surely a human being and in trouble of some kind  perhaps the cry comes from the end of the drift which has been closed  it sounds under the ground right here and fred stamped with his foot just as the noise was heard for the third time  theres no question about its being a man come on lets bring some of the miners to help find him  the boys ran down the drift at full speed and half an hour later returned with two of the miners  it was right here that we heard it sam said as he pointed to the shovels they had left behind in order to mark the spot  the party listened intently but no sound save their own breathing could be distinguished  i thought youd been frightened about nothing one of the miners said with a laugh you might as well tell us the mine was haunted as to give out such a yarn ill guarantee that nothin largern a mouse could hide here  but we surely heard a cry fred insisted  and it seemed to come from beneath our feet  nonsense its foolish to make such talk when we know the things impossible and the men turned away as if angry at having been brought so far on a useless errand  we know whether  sam ceased speaking very suddenly for at that moment the sound of distress came with great distinctness  the men looked around each trying to hide his fear and then a regular search was begun  the noise could not have come from the old drift and the level was examined thoroughly but without success  it beats me one of the miners said at length im sure theres nothing beneath here but the solid earth  let the boys tell wright the other suggested and his companion assented  well hang around here till he comes or you get back but dont stay very long for i dont like the looks of things  why not  it may be a warnin for some of us ive heard tell of such  fred laughed heartily and the man replied impatiently  when youve been in a mine as long as i have you wont think theres any fun to be made of warnins before the explosion of fire damp in the old workings ive been told the miners heard all kinds of queer noises  go on the second man said fretfully an dont waste time chinnin here when prhaps we oughter be gettin out to save our lives  the boys started feeling a trifle disturbed because of the unexplainable cries and arrived at the store as the whistle sounded for the night shift to begin work  the superintendent was surprised by the information brought and insisted as had the miners that the sounds could not have been made by a human being  i will go down the slope at once however he said and the boys accompanied him on what proved to be a useless errand  every portion of the lower level was searched a party descended the old shaft traversing the abandoned passages to the chamber connecting with the new portion of the workings but nowhere could be seen any signs of life  joe and bill alarmed because the boys had not returned came to look for them in time to join the exploring parties and the latter was decidedly uneasy when mr wright ordered the useless labor to be stopped  he in common with several others believed the mysterious noises to be warnings and there was every evidence of a panic until mr wright spoke at considerable length on the subject intimating that the cries were due to natural causes  then those who were off duty went home and among them were joe bill and their helpers  these last discussed the subject without arriving at any definite conclusion when the time to separate arrived  on the following morning work was resumed in the cutting the loose earth having been cleared away a reasonably solid roof was put up and once more the tunneling operations were pushed forward vigorously  all hands were on the alert for a repetition of the mysterious cries but nothing was heard save the noise of the picks and shovels with now and then a muffled crash as fragments of the vein were detached by blasts  during the nooning lunch was eaten in the cutting and while they were sitting quiet a singular vibration of the earth could be felt  it seems as if some one was digging directly beneath us fred said when the little party ceased eating to gaze at each other in surprise  most likely theres a line of slate just under our feet an brings the sound from the other drift joe replied promptly  thats about the size of it bill added but the boys noticed that both the men listened from time to time as if in great perplexity  the peculiar tapping continued without interruption and before the time of rest had more than half expired joe said as he arose to his feet  come on lads were close to the old drift an after thats been opened well have another look around for i want to find out what these queer noises mean  each one worked with the utmost rapidity and when another hour had been spent bills pick broke through the barrier of earth  that ends the job an now to see how the air is  the miner had hardly ceased speaking when a huge volume of gas burst through the aperture nearly suffocating the party and extinguishing the lamps instantly  jump to it lively boys joe cried hoarsely as he began shoveling back the earth when you cant work any longer get a breath of fresh air in the drift  there was every danger that the lower level might be so filled with the noxious vapor as to cause an explosion and both men and boys labored manfully  all were working blindly but the general direction of the aperture was known and the greater portion of the earth could be thrown with a fair degree of accuracy  ten minutes passed and the flow of foul air was partially checked twice had each person been forced to retreat to the main drift and fred was about to go for the third time when it seemed as if the flooring of dirt gave way beneath his feet  half suffocated by the gas and overwhelmed by the falling fragments he hardly realized what had occurred until finding himself in what was unmistakably another and yet lower tunnel or drift     chapter xv  a discovery   after the first alarm passed away fred understood that he had fallen but a few yards and the earth which covered him represented only a very small portion of the upper tunnels floor  scrambling to his feet he fancied for a moment that the sound of scurrying footsteps could be heard and while listening joe said  hello are you hurt  not a bit  where are you  it seems like a regular cutting and the air is pure  light your lamp an look around  obeying this command fred found his suspicions correct and so reported  can you get back  not unless you pull me up  well attend to that in a minute  the rush of air from below had so far checked the gas now partially shut off that the men could also light the lamps in their caps and the remainder of the task was quickly accomplished  with a couple of timbers as braces the aperture to the old mine was closed securely and then the attention of the men was turned to the boy  look out down there bill shouted im goin to drop a couple of joists sos we can come back  let them go  now drag em out of the way an well follow  when this had been done the men and sam descended all completely mystified by this new discovery  heres somethin that i reckon mr wright didnt know about bill said as he surveyed the scene and then he added with great emphasis as a sudden thought occurred to him now we can come pretty nigh guessing what them noises meant some one has been tryin to get into the other level an when a big hole was made fred put an end to the work by fallin through  this could be told by the mound of earth a short distance away as well as by the marks of a pick around the edges of the aperture but further proof was found in the shape of a shovel which sam stumbled over  this belongs to the company he cried pointing to the brand  yes an a blind man can figger whos been here cale billings didnt leave town as he tried to make folks believe  then lets have him this cuttin cant be so long but that well get all over it before sunset joe cried as he wrenched the shovel handle from the iron work to serve as a weapon  i thought i heard somebody running in that direction when i first fell fred said pointing toward the quarter in which it was reasonable to suppose the old shaft might be found  joe led the way the others following close behind until when half a mile had been traversed they arrived at two slopes or inclined tunnels running at right angles from the level  it wont do to pass these bill cried well take one while the boys search out the other  he darted into the righthand opening as he spoke but returned before joe could join him saying  that was a false cutting it only runs a dozen yards an theres nothin in it sam you an fred look into the other one while we keep on  the idea of coming upon cale billings while they were unarmed was not a pleasant idea for the boys but they would have braved considerably greater danger rather than show signs of fear and both obeyed promptly  this slope ran at an inclination of nearly fortyfive degrees for about fifty yards when it turned sharply to the right terminating in a small chamber where the vein had probably came to an end  as sam and fred entered the place a figure darted from one corner and attempted to rush past them but the flight was checked very suddenly  why its skip miller sam cried as he lowered his lamp that the rays might fall upon the prisoners face  yes its me skip said piteously please dont drag me off  illustration please dont drag me off skip said piteously ill never hurt you or anybody else again  how did you come here  with billings he made me do jest what he said an i didnt dare to show up in town  why not  cause i knew mr wright would have me rested on account of pretty nigh killin you  what fred cried in surprise then it wasnt an accident  skip literally groveled on the ground in his fear he understood now that his share in that business had not been known until he himself betrayed the fact  dont lug me off he screamed id have to go to jail  you wouldnt so long as we kept the thing a secret fred replied with a feeling of mingled pity and contempt because of the abject terror displayed we must take you with us but neednt tell about your villainy  then father would just about beat me to death for runnin away why not let me stay here ill never hurt you or anybody else again  although skip had tried to kill them the boys felt a certain sense of aversion to dragging him away while he pleaded so piteously and in order to gain time in which to think the matter over sam said  tell us how you got into the lower level  in a faltering voice skip gave a truthful account of all his movements on that particular day  have you been here ever since  yes  and billings too  he went out twice for whisky an some water  what have you been doing  billings made me dig an shovel all day an most of the night  trying to get into the lower level eh  yes an when i got played out he pretty near pounded my head off  i reckon we heard you yelling where is billings now  he ran ahead of me when the earth began to cave in an thats the last ive seen of him say it wont hurt you a bit to let me stay here an ill do the square thing if i ever get out of the scrape  youd starve to death  id rather take the chances of that than go to jail or let father get hold of me  but what good will it be to stay here fred asked hiding wont mend matters and youll have to come out some time  that may be but i dont want to go now and once more skip fell on his knees in front of those whom he had wronged  what do you think about it fred sam asked in a whisper  i dont like to yank him out no matter what he tried to do to me  nor i  then why not let him stay hell get punishment enough by hiding here alone in the darkness with nothing to eat  but we shall have to give him a little grub we cant think hes hungry when were got plenty  ill agree to whatever you say  sam was silent for a moment and then turning to the kneeling boy he asked  could you find your way out of here  i might if i had a lamp but the oil has all been burned in mine  how long do you count on staying  jest as many days as i can  well see here were going off an leave you to take the dose in your own way but its on the agreement that you try to be a decent fellow after gettin out  ill promise anything an wont so much as say the name regulators agin  if its possible fred an ill bring you some grub but you mustnt count on it  dont take any risks skip replied humbly i can live on wind a couple of days if that villain of a billings dont come back  you neednt worry about that if he went up the drift bill an joe will most likely nab him come fred we mustnt stay any longer or theyll think something is wrong  as the boys turned to go skip tried to thank them for the mercy shown but did not make a great success at it he had been literally trembling with fear and now his gratitude rendered him almost incapable of speech  thats all right skip well see whether you mean it or not after you get out  ill be square as a brick if i ever get through with this scrape he replied and then as the boys turned the angle of the slope he was hidden from view in the darkness  i dont know as were actin very sensible sam said slowly when they were in the drift once more but its better than draggin the poor beggar off to be arrested  a good idea sam and im sure skip will be a decent fellow after this we must try to get back here tonight with food and oil  unless joe and bill keep us at work well have plenty of time forhello here they come now  the two miners could be seen in the distance or rather the light of their lamps was visible and when they were within speaking distance fred asked  did you find him  no weve followed up the drift as far as we dared an are now goin back to see if any of the day crew know these old works where did that slope lead to  it ends about fifty yards from here  didnt see anything of the villains eh  billings isnt there thats certain fred replied after a brief hesitation  the men did not appear to notice the equivocal answer and bill suggested that they return to the workings without further delay  well have a guard set at the shaft so he cant give us the slip in that way an if any of the boys know these drifts it wont be a long job to smoke him out  he may get off before we can reach the top of the slope fred suggested hoping by this means to prevent the conversation from reverting to their long delay  then so much the better lad bill replied in a tone of satisfaction all we want is to be rid of such trash an if he leaves town thats enough  if at this moment either of the party had turned it would not have been difficult to distinguish even in the gloom the form of cale billings as he followed ready to work further mischief or escape as might be most convenient  unsuspicious of the nearness of their enemy the little party continued on to the hole through which fred had fallen and as they clambered up the joists the leader of the rioters muttered  dont think you can smoke me out so easy ill leave my mark on this mine before bein run down or know the reason why  neither sam nor fred gave so much as a passing thought to the man who was responsible for all the damage which had been done they were so engrossed with the desire to aid skip without being discovered by those who might call him to an account for his crime that all else seemed as trifles  ill tell mother and she will cook for us what may be needed fred whispered after they were in the lower level walking rapidly toward the slope  that part of it dont trouble me so much as how were to come back to the mine without bein seen by some of the men sam replied and turning sharply bill asked  what are you fellers chinnin about  theres no harm in talkin eh and sam assumed an air of impudence such as the men had never seen before  i dont reckon there is lad but seein as how weve hung together so long it wasnt strange to ask  i didnt mean to be too fresh bill sam replied understanding that he had spoken in a disagreeable manner fred and i were only figuring about coming back to make sure billings didnt get into the level while you were outside  that part of it can be fixed easy joe shall go to the store while i see if anybody here knows about the old drift and with three on guard i dont reckon he can do much mischief  then you can stay with him while i run home for some provisions fred whispered and during this conversation cale billings was clambering up the joist which led to the last level     chapter xvi  good samaritans   knowing that joe and bill were in mr wrights confidence donovan had no hesitation about placing guards as desired and immediately after they ascended from the slope every exit was closely watched  now you boys can see weve fixed things in proper shape bill said in a tone of triumph do whatever you choose until tomorrow an joe an mell attend to mr billings case  but he might get into the lower level by the same way we did sam ventured to suggest  there are plenty below to take care of that  then theres no reason why we should come back  not unless you want to see the game played out  well run down to freds house and then have a look at the place where he went through  suit yourselves about that was the careless reply as bill started toward the store to confer with the superintendent  now is our chance sam whispered it wont take us more than ten minutes to run over to your house and we can get back before bill comes  fred started at a rapid pace and by the time the miners had finished telling their story to mr wright mrs byram knew of the interview with skip  of course i will give you some food she said readily it may prove to be the best possible thing for him that he should be so thoroughly frightened can you carry oil enough in a bottle  as much as will be needed until tomorrow it wont do any harm if he scrapes along on short rations for a while sam replied with a laugh the only thing is to get him something before joe an bill go back  a generous package of food a small quantity of oil the whole in a paper parcel and the good samaritans started for the slope once more noting with satisfaction as they passed that the miners had not yet left the store  no particular attention was paid to them as they entered the slope and screening the package as much as possible from view the boys went with all speed to the repentant regulators hiding place  so far as could be seen the cutting through which fred had fallen remained as when they ascended and after letting themselves down this the task was well nigh accomplished  skip was most extravagant in his demonstrations of gratitude when they entered the chamber and displayed the supplies  itll take me a mighty long while to straighten this thing up but ill do it somehow he said and sam replied roughly  well talk about that later jest now theres a chance others will find out where you are for joe and bill have gone after men to help search for billings  then they didnt find him  no  i reckon he has gone to taylors  that wont do him much good unless he walks out of town for now it is known hes near by all hands are bound to hunt him down  then theyll be sure to find me  well hold on in the old drift till they get back an try to prevent them from coming up here by saying weve searched this slope fred said after a moments thought thats the only way i know of to keep the secret  it wont do any harm to make the attempt sam added dont light your lamp and keep perfectly quiet  skip retreated once more to the farther corner of the chamber and the boys walked slowly down to the drift halting a short distance from the mouth of the slope as sam picked up a shovel  heres another tool belonging to the company it must have been thrown away by billings or skip when you dropped on their heads  keep it to show weve been hunting it cant be long now before the men come and well need some good excuse for loafing here  lets sit down till we hear them im tired enough to want a rest  seated on the decaying timbers of the car track the boys discussed in whispers the possibility of aiding skip to escape from his unenviable position with never a thought of the deed with which billings was to crown his villainous career  the leader of the mob had immediately begun to look about for a chance to wreak his vengeance on the company when joe and bill with their helpers left the level and he was yet at the farther end of the passage when the boys returned with supplies for skip  their desire to avoid attracting the attention of the workmen caused them to move noiselessly consequently he was ignorant of the fact that they were in the mine  it was hardly five minutes after they descended to the old drift when he came back to the cutting and the odor of gas brought him to a stop  them fools broke through after all he said examining the earth piled up at one end an i reckon they found out it wasnt safe to work much farther on that course  one of the shovels was standing against the side of the excavation and with this he dug a portion of the dirt from the hole made by bills pick  the foul air rushed through with such force as to nearly suffocate him but instead of being disappointed he appeared overjoyed  i couldnt a fixed things better in a weeks solid work an ill take the chances of gettin out  enlarging the aperture by pushing the earth through between the braces while he covered his mouth and nose with his blouse he crept back to the drift unfastened his caplamp removed the safety screen and placed the light in the passage after raising the wick a trifle  just as these preparations had been completed the faint sound of the whistle could be heard from above  its astonishin what luck im having he muttered i can get out while the day shift are leavin an ten minutes will be enough to fill this level so full of gas that no power can prevent an explosion  the air was heavy with the noxious vapor as he went rapidly toward the slope up which crowds of miners were passing and as some of the men loitered behind the others it became necessary he should hide in the drift to escape detection  why dont the fools move faster he said in a hoarse whisper it cant be many seconds before the thing comes an therell be no chance for me thered be a lynchin sure if i should show up jest ahead of an explosion  big drops of perspiration stood on his brow as he realized that the trap he had set for others might close upon himself and for an instant he resolved to run back and extinguish the lamp  it wont do he said half turning and then moving nearer the slope theres gas enough in the drift to choke me before id get ten yards why dont the idiots move faster  only the absolute conviction that he would be lynched if caught at such a time prevented billings from rushing out  each second the vapor became denser and he wondered why the miners did not perceive it  the catastrophe must be very near at hand and he was exposed to the greatest danger  when it seemed as if an hour had passed the last man went up the slope and he started at full speed to gain a higher level  the incline was almost reached half a dozen steps more and he would be partially sheltered by the jutting point of slate  luck is still with me he cried so loud that those above must have heard him and at that instant the earth seemed to rock to and fro there was a flash of blinding light and the air was filled with flying fragments  where had been the lower level was now an apparently solid mass of earth coal and slate covering the body of him who had wreaked his vengeance upon the company  joe and bill were returning from the store when the noise of the explosion was heard and they as well as everyone in the vicinity knew from sad experience what had occurred  were responsible for this bill cried his face paling the gas has burst through from the old drift  thank god it came when most of the poor fellows were quittin work and joe started on a run followed by every person in the village  at the mouth of the slope a vast crowd had gathered women were calling their husbands and children by name and as each learned her loved ones were safe shouts of joy mingled with the wailings of those whose cries remained unanswered  even after mr wright arrived the utmost confusion prevailed all knew it would be certain death to make a descent while the deadly vapor was so dense and a second explosion might be expected at any moment  bill and joe stood near the mouth of the slope ready to respond to the first call for volunteers when mrs byram came up  where is fred she asked with a brave attempt controlling her fears  he went to your house with sam so theres no need to worry about them  they were not there more than ten minutes  then both are in the crowd somewhere for they wouldnt go down the slope till we got back  the almost distracted mother had no thought of keeping skips secret at such a time and when the two miners heard her story all hope for the safety of the boys fled  they must have been in the old drift underneath the explodin gas joe exclaimed involuntarily  it isnt sure the trouble began where we think bill said quickly with a warning glance at his companion ive known of men who were shut in a drift for a week an then brought out none the worse for wear so dont despair mrs byram  but why isnt something done to aid them  we shall set to work the very minute it is safe to venture into the next level go home an joe or i will bring you the first news  do you think i could remain there knowing my boy is dying orordead  the women near by endeavored to console the sorrowing mother with words of encouragement they themselves believed to be false and bill whispered to his mate  theres a mighty slim show for the poor lads an its through helpin him as tried to murder em that theyve been caught  mr wright was doing his utmost to ascertain how many were yet in the mine and after a long while succeeded in learning that at least a dozen men had been overpowered while some distance up the slope  those who reached the surface told of a number whom they had seen fall and some were certain one or two did not have time to gain the slope  who will go with me the superintendent asked as a car was made ready i dont want the married men to volunteer for they are needed at home and none of us may come back alive  then why not stay here yourself a woman cried your wife an children need you as much as ours need their fathers  because it is my duty was the calm reply now who will come i only want two  then the car is full bill said as he and joe took their places in the boxlike vehicle were willin to go alone if youll stay behind  no man shall encounter dangers from which i shrink lower away slowly boys he added to those who were fastening a rope to the car and keep a sharp lookout for our signals  an it was his house my jim helped try to burn the woman who had spoken before said in a whisper  make haste mr wright cried impatiently remember that every second is precious  the miners crowded around the car to shake its brave occupants by the hand as if they were never to return and it was absolutely necessary to push them away in order that the terrible journey might be begun  with their safety lamps held so that the condition of the air might be ascertained at each stage of the descent the men slowly disappeared from view and at the mouth of the slope the crowd surged to and fro in painful suspense but not a sound could be heard save as some wife or mother gave vent to a sob of distress     chapter xvii  down the slope   during the time that billings was making his preparations for the last act of his life sam and fred remained seated a short distance from the cut which led to skips hiding place  both were listening intently for the first sound which should betoken the coming of the miners and the falling earth which was displaced by billings feet as he worked in the cutting attracted their attention  theres some one in the tunnel we made sam whispered lets creep up and find out who it is  that wont do for theres no chance billings would come back if he once got out and we should arouse suspicions  despite this warning sam advanced a short distance and on becoming convinced that the tunnel really had an occupant rejoined fred as he whispered  wed better sneak further along i reckon somebody is on guard up there and we musnt be seen so far down  he had held the shovel during this excursion and still retained it as they walked noiselessly along the drift until arriving at the mouth of the short slope  here the two halted at the moment when the confined gas ignited by the open lamp burst its bonds and the shock sent them headlong up the incline  huge masses of earth were detached on every hand except directly in the narrow way leading to skips hiding place and on scrambling to their feet a solid wall shut them out from the drift  what was that fred cried in alarm as he assured himself his lamp was uninjured  an explosion an were penned in here to starve to death sam replied in a trembling voice  cant we dig through this bank and reach the hole in the roof  there is no longer any lower level as we knew it and unless we could make a new drift thered be no use working  but this part of the mine seems to be all right  yes unless theres another explosion i reckon we can stay here til  till what  we shall starve to death after a while  this mournful conversation was interrupted by skip who came running down the slope with the most abject fear written on every feature of his face  familiar as he was with the mine he had no need to ask for the cause of the noise and understood as well as sam the little hope there was for life  are you shut in too he cried  were here sam replied grimly  an youd been outside if i hadnt wanted to stay rather than take a flogging  youre right skip but this aint the time to find fault all three are in the same box an we might as well be friendly  wont they try to get us out fred asked faintly  nobody knows where we are skip replied bitterly  we told mother about you and shell be sure to repeat it to joe and bill now were in such danger  skips face brightened for an instant and then he said in a despairing tone  they dont know where this place is billings is certain the oldest miners never heard of the drift he thinks it was made years before the workings were opened at farleys  joe and bill have been down here  even they wouldnt know where to start in how long will the air hold out sam  i dont know but theres no need of usin it any faster thans necessary well put out two of the lamps one is enough an we may be mighty glad to drink the oil  fred was very nearly incapable of action the knowledge that his companions had lost hope literally dazed him and he could not even follow sams suggestion  two of the lamps were extinguished and since fred was the only one retaining the means of dispelling the darkness sam and skip forced him on ahead as they went still further into the tunnel where the air would be more pure  this is the only point from which we may expect aid sam said an seein that we can do nothin its better to stay here  wont joe and bill try to help us fred asked  theyll try but whether itll be possible to do anything is another matter  cant we begin to dig weve got one shovel  neither of us knows in which direction to start an when workin more food would be needed therefore to keep alive as long as possible wed better stay quiet  skip threw himself on the floor close to the end of the cutting as if reconciled to whatever might happen and sam sat down beside him  do you think there is any chance that we can get out of here fred asked after a long silence and sam replied gravely  we may as well look the matter straight in the face its possible they can strike us without much trouble but that aint likely  during half an hour the boys remained silent and motionless as if each was trying to reconcile himself to the terrible doom which threatened and then fred said with a feeble attempt at cheerfulness  it must be near supper time suppose we have one square meal  because a man knows hes slowly drowning theres no reason why he should try to keep his head under water more than is necessary sam replied sternly  what do you mean  we are not suffering with hunger now but soon will be so its wise to wait till grub is absolutely needed to keep us alive  then lets do something this sitting still thinking of what is to come seems worse than the reality can ever be  very well weve got a shovel well decide in which direction its best to dig an begin operations  there surely is a chance of striking another drift  yes theres a chance sam replied as if the conversation wearied him each one shall say which course he thinks most likely to bring us out  skip wished to continue up the slope arguing that each inch gained would carry them so much nearer the surface while fred believed it best to work through the mass of earth that had fallen because there a pick would not be necessary  wed better try skips plan sam finally said by making our way along the old drift a chamber of gas might be struck when all hands would be suffocated come on and ill start it  he wielded the shovel until tired the others carrying the earth back to the foot of the slope in their hats and then fred tried his hand at the labor  in this manner each did a certain amount of the work but at the expense of no slight suffering in the confined space it was very warm and this exercise brought with it an intense thirst which of course could not be quenched  skip drank a little oil now and then but fred could not force himself to taste the illsmelling stuff  there was no way by which the passage of time could be measured when all were sleepy they laid down to rest and on awakening a small quantity of food was dealt out after the scanty meal had been eaten they continued what every one now believed was useless labor ceasing only when the desire for slumber became overpowering again  reckoning these periods of work and rest as days and nights seventytwo hours had elapsed when the supply of food was exhausted and they realized that the final struggle was at hand  the air remained reasonably pure probably because a vent had been left somewhere in the choked drift but there were moments when the odor of gas was perceptible thus causing sam to believe efforts were still being made to reach them by those on the outside  but little work was done when the food had been consumed now and then one or the other would use the shovel in a listless way for a few moments at a time but each had become so weak that any prolonged exertion was out of the question  they slept as much as possible and refrained from discussing the terrible situation fred no longer listened for the sounds which would tell that help was near at hand and the odor of the oil did not prevent him now from taking his share when the scanty allowance was doled out  finally the hour came when the last drop had been drank the tiny flame of the lamp seemed to have been the only link which connected them with the outer world and then without any means of dispelling the profound darkness the bitterness of death came upon them  fred was the first to sink into a stupor from which he awakened only at rare intervals then skip yielded to despair and sam was virtually alone  all three were half sitting half lying in the excavation they had made and the moments passed unheeded to fred it seemed as if he had been unconscious for many days when he became aware that sam was shouting wildly  in a dazed way he raised his head and after a while understood that his companion was saying in an incoherent tone  theyre coming theyre coming  who who skip asked feebly trying in vain to rise to his feet  the miners cant you hear the sound of their picks  when they could bring themselves to understand the meaning of sams words both the sufferers were revived by the excitement sufficiently to stagger to an upright position but as only at intervals was the cheering sound heard fatigue soon overpowered them again and once more sam alone remained conscious  he made every effort to preserve all his faculties and after another long painful time of suspense he was rewarded by hearing a faint hail  hello lads are you near  yes yes in the end of a short slope  how many are there  three  all well  two are pretty near gone hurry as fast as possible  dont fret lad were workin the best we know how an have been these four days though not allers on the right track  then from time to time the laborers shouted in order that they might not deviate from the right course and sam answered each call at the full strength of his lungs which at the best was faint  nearer and nearer came the sound of shovels and picks until the trembling of the wall told that life liberty and food were near at hand  sam remained leaning close against the barrier that he might hear every hail until he saw the face of a man appear from amid a shower of falling earth and then knowing the rescue was accomplished he lost consciousness  around the mouth of the shaft stood a great crowd when the inanimate boys were brought out during the nights as well as days this throng remained waiting to see those known to be in the halfruined mine these anxious watchers sympathizing with the three griefstricken mothers had left their posts only so long as was absolutely necessary and had seen each lifeless body as it was sent to the surface the last coming from the slope being the mangled remains of cale billings  each morning the newspapers had printed long articles regarding the disaster at farleys and in the list of those known to be dead were four names the number of victims sacrificed that billings might avenge a fancied wrong  with the rescue of the boys the work was finished and in the rear of the bearers all the watchers and laborers followed to the village remaining in the streets until word was sent that no injuries had been sustained  then perhaps for the first time came the question of what was to be done now that farleys was in such a condition as to preclude any possibility that the works could be opened for several months  its a hard lookout for all of us one old miner said to a mate but thank god that villain of a billings has no more than four lives to answer for     chapter xviii  shut down   food and rest were all that was needed to restore the boys who had been rescued to their normal condition once more and since the works were necessarily shut down they had ample opportunity for the latter remedy  fred learned from his mother that bill and joe had remained foremost among the laborers nearly every moment of the time they were imprisoned in the drift but the full story of the rescue was not told until on the second day when joe called  it looked pretty blue one spell the latter said in reply to freds questions the first attempt to get down the slope was a failure when we reached the upper level all three were so nearly overcome by the foul air that mr wright could hardly make the signal for the car to be pulled back late at night we tried it agin an brought out the four poor fellows who were caught on the slope next mornin billings body was found an then it wasnt hard to tell what caused the trouble  did you spend any time there looking for us  no for bill and me calculated that if you hadnt got to skip before the explosion come it would be a months work to find the bodies we went down the old shaft an began from there workin at guess till both of us began to believe wed gone wrong if sam hadnt yelled jest as he did the gang would have started in from the old drift that runs to the chamber  in that case we wouldnt have been found in time  youre right but seein as we did find you all secure theres no use speculatin about the other side of the matter  have you seen skip  he was down to the store this mornin tellin what he knew of billings movements for the coroner is investigatin the affair  and sam  hes lively as a cricket an counts on comin here this afternoon  how long will it be before the works can be opened again  two or three months for the whole gang but some can begin in half that time i reckon its goin to be rough on them as havent anything laid by for a rainy day  and mother and i can be counted among those fred said with a sigh  dont worry about that my son mrs byram replied cheerily it is sufficient for me that your life has been spared and i am certain we shall be able to provide for the future but you are not to go into the mine again the four terrible days spent at the slope fearing each instant that the rescuing party would reach the drift too late caused me to resolve that you should not be exposed to any more such dangers  but it dont stand to reason hell have another experience like the last joe said promptly hes already gone through moren the majority of us fellers an lightning dont often strike twice in the same place  mrs byram shook her head to signify that the decision was final but before she could add words to the gesture mr wright knocked at the door  i have come to make some arrangements with fred about working in the store he said as his summons was answered and entering continued after a nod to the invalid and joe we shall need more help there for a while and will pay three dollars per week  there could be no hesitation about accepting the proposition and before the superintendent left it was decided fred should begin next morning provided he felt sufficiently strong  sam thorpe is to work with you mr wright said as he turned to leave the house and i expect good service from my new clerks  ill go bail that you get it joe said with a laugh an now if it aint askin too much id like to know what chance there is for the rest of us  we can use about a hundred men among whom will be you and bill the pumps have been choked so long that it will be some time before even the upper level can be put into working shape but employment shall be given to all at the earliest possible moment  then mr wright returned to the office and during the remainder of the day fred had quite as many callers as could be entertained in the little house  among these were sam and skip and the latter renewed the promises made in the mine  ive backed out from the regulators an while the shut down lasts am goin to see what i can do in the way of workin the garden fathers let me off from a floggin if i go straight after this  on the following morning fred was at his new place of business at a very early hour and both he and sam found plenty with which to occupy their time until sunset when they were at liberty to do as they chose  during the next week nothing of particular interest to the young clerks transpired  at the mine the largest force which could be worked to advantage was employed and those who were forced to remain idle were given credit for food and rent  when the labor had become systematized to such a degree as to allow the superintendent a little leisure and while fred was copying some letters in the private office mr wright watching him several moments in silence asked  do you never expect to do anything but work in a mine fred  oh yes sir if mother and i can get some money laid by i want to go to the city  what will you do there  i dont know sir but there should be plenty of chances for a fellow who is willing to work  there are but since it may be some time before you are in a condition to leave here why not make yourself familiar with this branch of mining  how could that be done sir  by hard study you may use any of my books and after getting a smattering of the business you might decide to take up civil engineering a profession which would suit you admirably  if i only could  there is nothing to prevent here is a work which you can understand and after mastering its contents ill guarantee youre ready to hold your own against any engineers assistant in the middle field  on that very day fred began his studies and sam joined him with the understanding that not less than two hours of each evening should be devoted to the work  both the boys were astonished at discovering how little they really knew about mining even though well acquainted with many of the details and rapid progress was made during the fortnight that followed  if you keep on at this rate well be lookin for new buttys bill said one evening when the students had explained to him the principles of hydraulics  you wont need any for some time and then perhaps we shall have learned how ignorant we are and give up in despair  therell be a good many called for tomorrow the upper level is in workin order an a hundred men are to be put on in the morning  this was indeed good news the inhabitants of farleys had been anxiously awaiting the day when it would be possible to earn something toward the household expenses and this first evidence that the works were really to be opened caused a great amount of pleasurable excitement  nearly every one in the village was at the mouth of the slope to see the workmen go in and there sam and fred met skip  mr donovan has promised to take me into the breaker as soon as there is any coal to come out he said gleefully an my garden is lookin fine  i dont reckon youve sold many vegetables yet sam replied laughingly  the plants are only just up an the stuff will be late but the first that is ripe im going to send you fellers an bill and joe  the miners entered while the spectators cheered loudly and then the idle ones dispersed well content to know their time would soon come  skip returned to his garden while sam and fred resumed their duties at the store but were interrupted an hour later by mr wright who said  it is important that a message be delivered in blacktown before noon and there will be no train until late this afternoon do you boys feel in trim for a ten mile tramp across the mountain  yes sir an double the distance if necessary sam replied promptly  very well wrap up some crackers and cheese while i write a letter  ten minutes later the two were on their way with no slight task before them for it would be necessary to travel over a rough country the entire distance since the journey by the road around the mountain could not be performed in a day  it was an agreeable change after having been confined to the store so long and they trudged on merrily resolved to return in a more leisurely fashion because mr wright had said no more work would be required of them until morning  in three hours the message had been delivered and they were on their way home  little time was spent in the valley but on ascending the mountain once more a halt was made for lunch  they were midway between blacktown and farleys not a dwelling could be seen in either direction and the boys speculated as to what the country looked like before coal was found in the vicinity  i wonder what caused the first man to come here lookin for it sam said musingly  most likely some one well up in geology was hunting for specimens and found an outcropping vein  it must have been a mighty pleasant surprise  and one that i would like to experience just fancy poking around in this way till you struck what could be easily turned into gold  as he spoke fred dug up the earth here and there with a stick playing the part as he supposed of the first discoverer and at the same time slowly ascending the mountain  hold on dont leave so soon im just getting ready to rest in proper style  fred turned around to return when he struck his toe against what appeared to be a projecting rock and fell headlong  thats what you get for tryin your hand at prospecting sam said with a laugh and fred arose to his feet with a rueful look on his face which caused his companion yet more mirth  it may be sport for you but i dont see anything so funny about knocking all the skin offhello what a queer looking rock i tumbled over  he had turned and was gazing at the projecting point a fragment of which was broken when sam came up to learn the cause of his companions astonishment  why it looks like coal he exclaimed taking a piece from the ground to examine it more closely and an instant later fred was startled by hearing him shout it is coal the vein at farleys must run straight through the hill  then this belongs to the company  not a bit of it the one who owns the land can work here and if we could raise money enough to buy ten or fifteen acres on this side of the hill byram and thorpe would be mighty rich fellows     chapter xix  the consultation   it is not to be wondered at that the boys were in a perfect fever of excitement because of their startling discovery  they uncovered the spurs of pure coal sufficiently to learn that it was a true vein and judging from the indications there could be no question but it extended over a large area just below the surface  is it as good as that taken out at farleys fred asked when they ceased digging for a moment  i cant see any difference why you and i alone could mine enough to make us pretty near rich for theres neither shaft nor slope to be made  do you suppose this land is valuable  for farming purposes it isnt worth a cent and unless the owner knows what is here it could be bought for a song  what is the price of a song according to that estimate  well say a thousand dollars for a hundred acres  but you wouldnt need as much in order to get at this vein  buildings would be necessary after a while an youd want a track to get the coal into market  dont you suppose we could manage to get a thousand dollars  if you count on doin it by workin at farleys it would take about a thousand years all the money i can earn has to be used by the family now that father isnt working  but can we do nothin  it does seem kinder tough to find a fortune and not be able to take advantage of it but i cant figure out how we can turn it to account  lets fill our pockets with these pieces and tell mr wright what weve struck  yes an before tomorrow night hed own this whole tract it would be wiser to see what bill an joe think about the chances of raisin money  very well well talk with them it wont do to leave this uncovered an im in a hurry to get back  the earth was scraped and above this the boys strewed branches and leaves until one might have searched a long while without discovering the secret  then walking at their best pace the successful prospectors continued on toward farleys trying in vain to suppress their excitement  those whom they wished to consult were at the mine and without even stopping to tell mrs byram of their discovery they went directly to the slope  bill and joe were in the second level at some distance from the other workmen when the boys arrived  what do you think of that fred asked excitedly as he held out one of his specimens  bill supposing he was to see a rare sight brought his caplamp close to the object for a second and then said angrily  havent you boys got anything better to do than bring coal in here for us to look at we see enough of that stuff without luggin it around in our pockets  but this didnt come from farleys  well sposin it didnt what of that and bill threw the coal far down the drift  not much except that sam and i found a vein three miles from any settlement  what both the miners cried in the same breath and bill ran to pick up what he had thrown away so contemptuously  fred began and sam ended the story of the find and while they were talking bill turned the specimen over and over saying when they concluded  if as good coal as that shows at the surface it must be a big vein  it is but how can we take advantage of the discovery sam thinks the land could be bought for a thousand dollars  then you must buy it  how could we raise so much money  people dont allers pay cash for what they buy you might get it for two or three hundred dollars down with a mortgage for the balance  even then i dont see how it can be done  nor i jest now but well figure the thing out tonight at your house joe an me will be there after supper dont tell anyone except your mother nd when you boys are rich i speak for the job of breaker boss  then bill and joe hardly less excited than their younger companions resumed the interrupted labor and the amateur prospectors went to tell the wonderful news to mrs byram  freds mother was not as elated as the boys thought the occasion demanded but when the miners arrived and appeared to be so sanguine that the discovery would be of great pecuniary benefit to those who made it she became greatly interested  the main question was how to raise the necessary money with which to purchase the land and this had not been answered when the party broke up at a late hour  well figger it out somehow bill said as the visitors arose to depart its been sprung so sudden like that we havent had time joe an me will learn who owns the land first an then some of usll get a bright idee  with these cheering words the meeting was adjourned and sam and fred went to bed to dream of becoming millionaires through the accident which befell the latter as he fell over the spur of coal  next morning however they awoke to the fact that the days provisions depended upon their labors in the store and as this was also the first step toward earning sufficient money with which to buy the land both were on hand at an unusually early hour  i want you to go over to blacktown bank mr wright said to sam when he entered the building the train leaves in half an hour and since you can return by the same conveyance there is no reason why i should give two boys a holiday as i did yesterday  i will be ready in time sir sam replied and fred whispered  why not walk home and see if anybody has been fooling around the spur we found  thats jest what ill do providin it is possible to get back before the train is due there cant be any kickin if im here an hour or two ahead of time  a package of papers and a bank book was given to sam by the cashier who said warningly  here are two thousand dollars in checks and you are to bring back eight hundred dollars in change be careful what you do and come home on the first train after the business has been done  i dont reckon any one would kick if i walked instead of waitin until afternoon for the cars sam said as he took the documents  it isnt very safe to come across the mountains with so much cash but i dont suppose there is any danger the man replied and sam glanced meaningly at fred as he left the building  i wish i hadnt said anything to him about looking at the vein fred muttered to himself as his companion disappeared from view it would be better if he came directly back without thinking of what will never bring us in a cent of money  it was too late now however to regret the words which had been spoken and fred found plenty with which to busy himself during the remainder of the day  at noon a telegram came for mr wright and in response to what was probably an imperative summons he started for the city on the next train the one on which sam would have returned had he not determined to walk across the mountain  an hour passed and yet the messenger was absent  that boy has had time to travel twice the distance from blacktown here the cashier said impatiently to fred and the latter could make no reply but he in turn was growing very anxious  how would it do for me to go and meet him he asked finally  that is foolish talk was the petulant reply if he doesnt come soon it will be best to send a sheriffs officer  this remark was well calculated to make fred yet more nervous not for a moment did he believe sam would do anything dishonest and yet he should have been back even in case he had walked home several hours before  it was after sunset when the messenger finally made his appearance and fred was about to greet him with words of jest but the expression on sams face caused him decided alarm  what is the matter he asked anxiously  i have been robbed was the reply in a hoarse whisper  how  i dont know coming across the mountain i laid down on the land we wanted to buy an i fell asleep when i awakened the money was gone an that is all i know about it  money gone eh the bookkeeper cried what did you want to buy land for  that has nothing to do with the loss of the cash sam replied as he looked the man full in the face i lost the package which was given me at the bank and have been hunting for it since noon  it will make considerable difference as youll find out before this thing is cleared up and the cashier moved toward the door as if to prevent the boy from leaving the building why not tell the truth and say you stole the money  because i didnt do anything of the kind  tell that to the marines for you cant make me believe it thieves dont loaf around the mountain  they must have done so in this case for i walked nearly back to blacktown and should have found the package if it had fallen from my pocket  then where is it  i dont know  fred go for a constable  the cashier yet remained by the door and now he held it open a few inches that his order might be obeyed  please dont do a thing like that fred cried while sam stood near the desk pale as death but every action breathing defiance  do you think ill let a boy steal eight hundred dollars and do nothing toward recovering it  wait until mr wright comes back and see what he thinks  and in the meantime he or his accomplice will have had plenty of time in which to carry the cash beyond our reach  but i am sure that what he tells is the truth  i dont believe a word of it such a thing never happened before and the thief shant go free now if i can prevent it  fred was about to plead yet further for his friend but the cashier checked him by saying  another word in his behalf and i shall believe you know something of this very mysterious robbery will you go for the constable  no i wont move a step from this place until mr wright comes back  this show of friendship was not sufficient to save sam from the ignominy of an arrest the cashier had hardly ceased speaking when one of the miners made an attempt to enter the store and the angry official sent him for the guardian of the peace  youll have a chance to go back to blacktown and it may be that you will find the money on the way he said in a tone of irony  sam made no reply silent and motionless he awaited the coming of the officer     chapter xx  the accused   not for a moment did fred believe it possible sam had done anything dishonest in regard to the money and yet it seemed very singular that he could have been robbed without knowing when the deed was committed  he had no opportunity to speak privately to the accused boy because of the strict watch maintained by the cashier but he remained very near him as if eager to show confidence in his innocence  from the time the miner had been sent in search of an officer not a word was spoken now and then sam glanced at his friend as if to ask that his story be credited and the accuser kept a strict watch over every movement  there was no parley when the officer arrived his duty was to take the prisoner away and he did so in a matteroffact manner which aroused all of freds anger  it wouldnt do him any harm to say he knows you aint a thief he whispered but never mind old fellow bill an joe shall come to see you  believe ive told the truth an that is enough for me sam replied with a choking sob tell the folks at home about it but try to make em know i never stole a dollar  fred promised to do this and would have accompanied his friend to the depot but for the cashier who said sternly  i insist on your remaining here a large amount of money is missing you boys have got a secret between you and it may have some connection with the robbery i will not allow you to talk with the prisoner  do as he says an dont have any row sam added  ill stay here was the reply and when mr wright gets back well see what hes got to say about it  its time for the train the constable interrupted  go on quickly sam before a crowd gathers  fred gazed after the accused until he was lost to view in the distance and then turned away with a heavy heart  the cashier had nothing more to say about the robbery but he found plenty of work for the boy to do much as if wishing to keep him in sight until mr wright came home  it was halfpast eight when the last train arrived and the superintendent was not on it  fred should have been home two hours before and his mother always in fear of an accident since the explosion came in search of him  to her the story of sams misfortune was told and she at once demanded a private interview with the cashier  dont tell him why we wanted to buy land fred whispered and his mother promised to keep the secret for a short time at least  ten minutes conversation with the angry official sufficed and then the two went to sams home where the sad news was told  not until ten oclock did fred and his mother reach the little cottage where bill and joe were impatiently awaiting their arrival  weve heard something about the trouble the former said and want to know all the perticlars  fred repeated what has already been told and added  what he said concerning the land we talked of buying has made the cashier more suspicious than he would have been its too bad to give the secret away but it must be done unless the money can be found  theres no reason why we cant wait a while joe said after some thought ill go to blacktown tomorrow an see him  you surely cant think he took it  of course not an yet i dont understand how it could a been stole  he must have lost the money  it wouldnt be a bad plan for us to walk to blacktown over the same path he took bill said fred can show us the way  i dont believe theyll let me leave the cashier seems to think im concerned in the robbery  it wont take me long to tell him he dont run this place ill go to mr wrights house find out when hes likely to be back an then tend to the other matter joe wait here  the miner was not absent more than an hour and when he returned the others had come to the conclusion that sam had lost the money before reaching the coal vein  mr wright has jest telegraphed that hes on his way to new york so we may not see him for two or three days ive told the folks at the store whats to be done an though theres some kickin about freds leavin they dont dare to say very much  then the sad visaged party separated to get as much rest as possible and at early dawn the miners were at mrs byrams again  believing sam had traveled over nearly the same course as that taken by he and fred the latter did his best to guide the searchers correctly  theres no use to hunt round very much till we strike the vein for theres where he missed the money so wed better travel at our best gait to that place joe said as he led the way with fred by his side  the sun had been above the horizon but a few moments when they reached the scene of the discovery and despite sams dangerous position bill insisted on viewing the outcropping of coal  its a true vein theres no question of that he said after a careful examination an we must hustle to get the cash whats needed to buy the property  id be willin to give up my share if sam was out of his scrape  you wont do any such foolish thing well help the lad an ourselves at the same time for theres a chance to get rich here which mustnt be lost and bill covered the spur once more  now the search was begun fred led the way slowly the others following a short distance behind and all three scrutinized the ground carefully  not a word was spoken by either until they were on the highway near blacktown and then bill said sadly  if it was lost somebody has found it an in case thieves run him down it aint likely theyre going to be so foolish as to give us a chance to get on their track  where are we to go now fred asked  well see a lawyer if theres one in the place an then have a talk with sam  there was no trouble about getting legal advice and in the company of a kindlyfaced gentleman the party were ushered into the jail where sam in the lowest depths of despair was found  oh im so glad youve come he cried seizing fred by both hands it has been terrible here  dont be downhearted lad bill said with an attempt at cheerfulness well stick by you no matter what happens  i want you to tell me the whole story the lawyer interrupted describe every little particular of the journey  there isnt much to tell i got the money an walked as fast as i could to a place on the mountain where i laid down to rest an fell asleep when i woke up the package was gone  did you see anyone who might be following you  no sir  whom did you meet after leaving the town  not a single person  are you certain the money was in your pocket when you laid down  i felt of it a little while before that  the lawyer continued to question sam for a long while but without gaining any new information and even the boys friends were forced to admit that the story was a strange one  id say it was thin if i didnt know sam so well bill mused as the party left the jail after promising the prisoner they would return at the earliest opportunity  the boy couldnt a took the money thats certain but how he contrived to get rid of it beats me  it is possible we may learn something to our advantage before the trial can be held the lawyer suggested in a tone which to fred sounded the reverse of cheerful but i think it very important you should see mr wright without delay  joe shall go to new york  how could i find him there  fred and mell get right back to farleys ask for his address an send it to you by telegraph  that is a very good idea a train leaves in less than an hour the lawyer said approvingly decide where the message shall be sent and it will be there before he arrives  joe was unwilling to take so much responsibility upon himself and urged that he did not look fit to visit the city but bill overruled all his objections  youre the one to go so that settles it the miner said as he pulled out his wallet heres what money ive got an if mores needed let me know  what am i to say to the superintendent if i see him  urge that no further steps be taken against the boy after what you say he did during the riot the officers of the company should be lenient  but that kind of talk sounds as if you believed hed stole the money bill exclaimed in surprise  the case looks very bad for him and if it should be called up before we found some evidence in his favor he would most certainly be convicted  sams friends gazed at each other in astonishment that the lawyer employed to defend him should thus intimate he was guilty almost shook their faith in the boys innocence  you must go all the same bill said after a long pause an me an fred will toddle back home  the adieus consisted only of the words goodbye and then the miner and the boy turned their faces toward farleys once more  it seems as if finding the coal was bad luck for us fred said when they were on the mountain if it hadnt been for that poor sam never would have thought of walking home  i dont go very much on what folks call luck lad the thing was bound to come whether you saw the vein or not so we must buck agin it  the lawyer thinks sam stole the money  an moren hell believe the same if somethin dont turn up  i cant fancy what could happen to help him unless the thief himself came forward to tell the whole story  it does look kinder black but we mustnt lose heart  of course this settles our chances of buying the land  nothin of the kind my day is broke up now an ill spend the rest of it lookin around a bit  sam will need all the money weve got to spend  ive a little laid by for a rainy day an with what joe can raise we oughter pull through on both jobs  on arriving at the spur another search was made with the same result as before and then the two hurried on sending a telegram to joe immediately after reaching the town     chapter xxi  amateur detectives   fred was forced to attend to his duties at the store immediately after the return from black town and while so engaged could not fail to hear the many comments upon the case  the news of the alleged robbery had spread with wonderful rapidity and the majority of the miners believed sam to be guilty  twice during the afternoon the cashier questioned fred closely as to what the prisoner meant when he spoke of their desire to buy land but despite the coaxing and even threats he refused to divulge the secret  if it cant be helped ill tell mr wright but nobody else the boy repeated and further than this he positively refused to speak  then its time you went home the official finally said in an angry tone you know so much about this thing that i dont believe its safe to have you where there are many valuable things which might be stolen  if you think im a thief why not send me to jail with sam  i shall suggest to mr wright that you be arrested and i fancy hell follow my advice  fred walked out of the store knowing that several of the clerks had overheard the latter portion of the conversation and believing those whom he met on the street already looked upon him as a thief  it cant be helped my boy his mother said you have the satisfaction of knowing the accusation is false and that must suffice until the time when the whole affair is brought to light  im afraid that never will be everybody thinks sam is lying and if we should tell of the coal we discovered the folks would say for sure he stole the money  during the remainder of the day fred staid in the house not so much as showing his face at the window and shortly after sunset bill called  ive found out who owns the land he cried triumphantly  i wish wed never walked across the mountain  now dont be foolish lad  how can i help it when people call me a thief  i heard the cashier had kinder turned you out but that dont mount to anything wait till the superintendent comes back  hell believe as the others do  then wait till i catch the real thief  you  im going to try it  but you cant leave the mine  thats jest what i have done  what have you thrown up the job  me an the cashier had a little tiff a few minutes ago an ive closed accounts with farleys  i hope you didnt take up what he said to me  well i kinder had a row on my own account but that aint neither here nor there were both loafin now an i want you to take a trip with me  where  i aint jest sure but well strike blacktown first an then go wherever things look most promisin  have you heard anything mrs byram asked as she gazed at the man sharply  i cant say i have an i cant say i havent skip give me a idee thats worth workin up even if it comes to nothin so well have a vacation  tell me what youve heard fred cried excitedly  it aint so very much only jest enough to set me thinkin one of skips regulators was over here this noon an flashed up considerable money for a boy like him  and you think he stole the package from sam  i dont say anything of the kind but skip heard bout the trouble sam was in an thought it wouldnt do a bit of harm if we found out where this feller got so much cash  when are you going  in the mornin but dont get your hopes up for it may all end in smoke  regardless of this warning fred did grow excited and before bill took his departure he felt quite confident that the thief would soon be discovered  his spirits fell considerably next morning when joe returned from new york having come home on the night train  its no use he said sadly as he entered mrs byrams home just as fred and bill were making ready to set out for blacktown  wont mr wright do anything to help sam  no he says if the boy is innocent it will be much better to have the matter settled in court when everybody will know he was wrongfully accused  does he believe him guilty  im afraid so though he didnt say very much  when is he coming home  day after tomorrow he got a long letter from the cashier yesterday an i reckon that made the case look pretty tough agin sam  well bill said speaking for the first time since the arrival of his mate weve spent the money for nothin but it cant be helped now we thought it would be best to see him an since its turned out wrong all we can do is to push the other plan for what its worth  whats the other plan joe asked  bill explained and concluded by saying  it will be a good idee to have you here to post us on what happens while were away keep your eyes peeled an if anything perticlar turns up come over  then without waiting to hear whether joe was pleased with the idea bill started calling sharply to fred as he left the house  it wont do to loaf lad if weve got to get sam out of the scrape with all the officers of the company agin us  a hurried goodbye to joe a kiss from his mother and fred followed bent on proving his friends innocence in order that the suspicion of crime might also be removed from him  during the walk to blacktown hardly a word was spoken but bill said when they were within sight of the village  wed best separate here an tonight ill meet you over by the hotel  aint we going to see sam  not today  but what am i to do  walk round till you run across skip an then make friends with the feller whats with him  is skip here fred asked in surprise  of course else how could we find the boy i gave him money last night an reckon he come over on the first train  did he say where hed be  no but youll sure run across him then hang round till its time to meet me it dont stand to reason well find out anything today but well get our pipes laid  bill turned away as if fearing to prolong the interview lest he be seen by the boy whom he fancied knew something about the case and fred walked aimlessly to and fro for nearly an hour when he was accosted by skip  when did you come the latter asked as if in surprise as he glanced meaningly toward a rather disreputable looking boy at his side  fred told the exact truth and added that he was laying off from work for a day or two because of an invitation of bill thomas to see the sights in blacktown  skips friend at once proposed that fred spend the day with them and the two strangers in the village were soon pretending to enjoy the lavish hospitality of the fellow who was known by the name of gus dobson  only once before it was time to meet bill did skip have a chance to speak privately with fred their host had left them while he talked in whispers for several moments with a friend of about the same age and general appearance and skip said  id like mighty well to help sam out of his scrape cause it would kinder square off what i did to hurt you an him  do you think this fellow knows anything about the money  he aint givin himself away but jest see how much cash hes got as many as three dollars were spent yesterday at farleys and hes still slingin it out  perhaps this is some hes been saving  gus dobson hasnt worked any to speak of since the regulators was started an i know he hadnt a cent at the time of the fuss over to farleys  has he said anything about sam  yesterday he asked a good many questions  i dont see how were going to find out where the money comes from unless he wants to tell us fred said with a sigh and then gus looking considerably disturbed joined them  when are you fellers goin home he asked abruptly  ill start pretty soon skip replied but fred dont have to leave till bill thomas gives the word whats up  nothin much cept i wont see you agin  why not  i promised to take a trip with the feller what was jest here an its time we was off  whats that for  i dont know as its any business of yours and gus looked at his guests suspiciously  of course not skip replied quickly but weve had such a good time that a feller cant help feelin sorry youve got to go  this explanation did not appear to be entirely satisfactory  the boy alternately gazed at one and then the other for several moments in silence and finally said in a threatening tone  a good many fellers have tried to get the best of me but i allers made em sick before the job was finished  now what are you drivin at skip asked in well simulated surprise  if you dont know i wont waste time talking was the reply as gus walked hurriedly away and the boys saw him join his friend a short distance off  hes tumbled to our game skip said sadly an id like to knock the head off the feller what put him up to it  that shows he knows something about the money  he may think were on another racket but theres no use loafin round here ill go to the depot an you find bill  fred had no difficulty in following this last suggestion the miner was already at the rendezvous and when the details of the apparent failure had been given he exclaimed angrily  its all my fault an instead of helpin sam ive done him a power of harm  what do you mean  i was in too much of a hurry and thought myself mighty smart so told the lawyer what we suspicioned he aint much less of a fool than i am for he sent out to find a friend of gus and asked him all kinds of questions now weve driven em away an may as well go ourselves  are we to give up working  theres no use in stayin here any longer an well strike across the mountain come on sos itll be possible to get home before dark     chapter xxii  unexpected news   fred was opposed to leaving blacktown without seeing sam but bill smarting under the sense of having brought about his own defeat insisted upon an immediate departure  it aint likely we could get into the jail now the day is so far spent an if we did what would be the use theres nothing that could be said to cheer the boy  i promised  you can keep it the next time we come and bill put an end to the discussion by starting toward the mountain  fred followed with a heavy heart and the two trudged on in silence until they were within a short distance of the newlydiscovered coal vein when bill exclaimed in surprise  im blest if there isnt joe whats up now i wonder  this question was soon answered the approaching miner cried while yet some distance away  what are you comin back so soon for  there was no reason why we should stay longer and without sparing himself in the slightest bill explained what a blunder had been committed  well youd better go to blacktown agin or else take the train for new york  why  the cashier has been swearin out a warrant for freds arrest an itll be served the minute he gets back  a warrant for me fred cried in alarm what have i done  the fool thinks you know where the money is an that you made the arrangements with sam before he left to get away with it  mr wright wont allow such a thing  the letter he wrote seems to have made the cashiers neck stiffer than it was yesterday an i dont reckon it would do much good to depend on any officer of the company  ill give that feller a piece of my mind bill cried angrily and joe replied  dont do it yet a while he told donovan this noon that youd gone with fred to put the cash in a safe place so it may be that the constable would like to see you by this time  why where does he think it was  buried on the mountain somewhere an if he sends men out to see if any diggin has been done lately the vein will surely be found  ill go back any way bill cried after a short pause such as him shant call me a thief  now look here matey what will be the good of gettin yourself in jail ive told freds mother jest how the matter stands an she believes as i do that itll be better to hang off a while in the hope something will turn up  an have the constables chasin us all over the country  it aint certain theyll do that  but it may never be known positively who took the money fred added  if youre both so anxious to go to jail wait till it is proved sam is a thief an then show up to the constable things cant be worse for holdin on a few days  cordin to your own figgerin theres a chance the coal will be found  ill take care of that business while you an fred keep out of sight with what i had an what could be borrowed ive got two hundred an twenty dollars you shall take the odd money an the balance ill plank down as a first payment on the land  do you know who owns it  a farmer who lived five or six miles the other side of blacktown  thats correct an the sooner you see him the better  will you agree to keep away from farleys  yes bill said slowly as if angry with himself for making the promise fred an mell sneak round till the trades made for this side the mountain an then figger up what its best to do  where can i see you tomorrow  right here well stay in the woods a night or two  have you got anything to eat  no but its an easy matter to buy all we want  take this money in case it is necessary to leave on the jump an ill go on  handing his mate the twenty dollars joe went at a sharp gait toward blacktown and bill said with a shrug of the shoulders  so were both thieves cordin to the cashiers ideas but wait till we get the land secured an ill give that young man a lesson such as wont be very pleasant  do you really mean to sleep in the woods  why not its warm weather an well be pretty nigh as well off there as at home  then wed better be looking for a good place if mother hadnt sent word that i was to stay away id go to farleys this minute an let them arrest me for it seems as if we act guilty by running off  thats jest my idee lad but well obey orders a day or two  a short distance to the right was a thicklywooded grove and here the two soon found what would serve very well as a camp  a small cleared space almost entirely screened from view by bushes afforded all the protection which might be needed and bill threw himself on the ground  i reckon we can go without supper he said with forced cheerfulness an therell be no bother about lockin the doors  it wont be long before im asleep walking around so much has tired me more than a full days work in the breaker  dont keep awake on my account the sooner your eyes are closed the sooner youll forget that theres a chance of bein sent to jail  with his head pillowed on some dry leaves fred had no difficulty in summoning slumber but bill tossed to and fro on the hard bed without the slightest desire for sleep  the boy was dreaming of the frightful hours spent in the short slope after the explosion when he was awakened by the pressure of a hand on his mouth  it was dark save for the twinkling stars and silent except when the leaves were swayed by the gentle wind  dont speak bill whispered as he removed his hand i can see the light of a fire over there to the right an its well for us to know who are campin so near  what do you want me to do  follow me well creep up far enough to see whats goin on an then come back unless theres reason for changin our lodgings  ill keep close behind you and fred rose to his feet bill parting the bushes with both hands to avoid the slightest noise  the glow of flames could be seen a long distance away evidently on the opposite edge of the grove and the two approached it as rapidly as was consistent with silence  soon the hum of voices was heard and after a short time bill stopped suddenly gripped fred by the hand and pointed ahead  around a campfire over which pieces of meat were being cooked sat gus dobson and the friend who had caused him to distrust fred and skip  there may be a chance for us to find out a good deal of what we want to know bill whispered and once more he advanced moving with the utmost caution  it was possible for the spies to creep within five yards of the encampment thanks to the bushes and when this had been accomplished the boys were eating supper  i dont believe in stayin here too long gus was saying when fred and bill were near enough to distinguish the conversation  nobody d think of huntin for us in this place his companion replied an it aint safe to take the cars yet a while for them boys from farleys have got men to back em  spposen they have how can anybody find us if we walk up the track to the next station  its easy enough to send word all around an then wed be nabbed the minute we showed our noses in a town  it will be jest as bad if they come here huntin for us  youre a reglar fool gus dobson so long as we can keep the stuff where it is whatll be gained by arrestin us weve got to take it with us when we leave an then whoever catches us will have the thing down fine  but we cant stay here forever  a couple of weeks wont hurt us an by that time folks will give up lookin so sharp theyll think we got away  were too near farleys  then make a move we can keep on a dozen miles or so through the woods an bury the stuff agin  i wanter get to new york  theres plenty of time for that an itll be nothing moren fun to camp out two or three weeks  gus made no reply and after supper had been eaten his companion lay down beside the fire saying as he did so  im goin to sleep you can figger the thing out between now and mornin and say what youre willin to do  itll have to be as you say i spose gus replied sulkily but we must leave here  all right well start tomorrow an when a good place is found put up a reglar camp  as he said this the boy rolled over as if to end the conversation and gus laid down beside him  bill waited until the heavy breathing of both told that they were asleep and then with a motion to fred he began to retreat  not until he was an hundred yards from the campfire did the miner halt and said in a low whisper  it was a mighty good thing for us that warrant had been sworn out for you if the cashier had waited a day or so wed gone home without an idee of where them young scoundrels were  it seems certain theyve got the money  not a doubt of it  why dont we jump right in on them perhaps theyd tell where it was buried  if they didnt wed be worse off than before for either one is smart enough to know nothin can be done to em while the cash is hid the only way for us is to keep an eye on the little villains till they get ready for a move then well do our work  itll be pretty hard to watch in the daytime without being seen ourselves  we must manage to do it somehow for this is perhaps our last chance to help sam     chapter xxiii  a misadventure   neither fred nor bill had any desire to sleep now that the solution of the mystery seemed so near they remained in the same place where the halt was made until the blackness of night gave way before the pale threads of light  its gettin pretty nigh time to begin our work bill said an this heat we mustnt make any mistake  im afraid we cant get near enough to see whether they take the money or not perhaps it isnt anywhere around here  then well follow em if it takes a week to find out what were after my idee is that wed better separate sos to make sure of knowin whats goin on you stay here an ill creep over to the other side then we shall be doublin our chances  but what is to be done in case we dont see them dig up the money  foller no matter how long a chase they lead us we shall come together somewhere on the road but it wont be a bad plan for you to take a little of this money if we had only bought some grub last night things would be in better shape  i can get along without food for a week if there is any hope of helping sam  the whole thing will be cleared up providin we dont loose sight of them heres the money an now ill be off youd best crawl nearer before the sun rises  with a pressure of the hand bill started making a wide detour around the encampment and fred was alone trying hard to repress a tremor of excitement which was causing him to tremble as if in an ague fit  after waiting half an hour and assuring himself that bill was well off fred began an advance working his way from bush to bush until convinced he could approach no nearer with safety  by this time the sun had risen and his rays falling upon the faces of the sleepers awakened them  both sprang to their feet and gus began building the fire while his companion was busily engaged at something among the bushespreparing food for cooking as fred thought  then you still think we oughter leave here gus said interrogatively  yes an the sooner the better theres no knowin when that fellers friends may come sneakin around agin well hurry up with the breakfast an start when its over  the boys had quite an outfit as fred could now see a fryingpan coffeepot tin cups plates and a bag well filled with provisions  gus acted the part of cook and soon the odor of hot coffee was wafted in the direction of the watcher causing him to feel the need of something to eat  but little conversation was indulged in during the preparations for the meal gus companion did not show himself until everything was ready and then he ate hurriedly as if time was too precious to admit of talking  now lets divide the load the boy said as he leaped to his feet and began tying the cooking utensils together if youll see to the grub ill take care of these  fred gazed intently expecting to see the money exposed to view but no mention was made of it  gus shouldered the bag his companion swung the remainder of the baggage over his shoulder and the two started walking rapidly around the mountain on a course which would carry them to the eastward at right angles with the railroad track  fred followed remaining as far in the rear as was possible to keep them within view and at such a distance that he could no longer overhear the conversation  beyond a doubt bill was also in pursuit but he did not show himself and fred fancied he was well over to the left travelling on a parallel line with the boys  during an hour these relative positions were maintained and then gus threw down the bag as if to make a halt  now theyre going to dig up the money fred said to himself and he pressed forward that he might see all which occurred  in this he was mistaken however the two had simply stopped to rest and such of the conversation as could be overheard only had reference to the location for a permanent camp gus insisting they were far enough away from the villages while his companion urged that twice this distance should be covered  its plain they have no idea of digging fred muttered it begins to look as if we had made a big mistake but if that is so what was the meaning of the talk they made last night  it was an enigma which he could not solve although believing they were on the wrong track he did not feel at liberty to abandon the search until after consulting with bill and as yet no signs had been seen of that gentleman  the halt was continued for half an hour and then the two boys pushed on again walking at a leisurely pace until the forenoon was well nigh spent when they came to a full stop at the bank of a small brook  they were now as nearly as fred could judge eight or nine miles from the starting point and that this was the end of the journey could be told by the preparations made  from the bag a new hatchet was produced and both set about hewing small trees and bushes with which to build a camp  not until this shelter was put up did fred dare to move near enough to hear what was said and then he found a hidingplace in the thicket twenty paces in the rear of the rude dwelling  even though two hours had been spent in this work bill did not show himself it was possible however that he believed it dangerous to move about in the daytime but would join his companion after dark  such conversation as the boys indulged in had no especial interest to the listener since it referred almost entirely to the length of time they would remain in the camp  when the day came to an end fred had not heard anything of importance and he resolved to advise an immediate return to farleys when bill should join him  during the evening gus and his companion appeared to be very jolly they told stories sang and laughed as if there was nothing in connection with this camping out to be concealed and the watcher in the bushes wondered why the miner did not come  half a dozen men might have walked around the encampment without being observed by the boys and bills delay seemed very singular  fred did not dare to leave his place of concealment and even if it had been perfectly safe to do so he knew not in which direction to look for his friend therefore nothing could be done save exercise patience  the hours passed without any change in the condition of affairs the campfire burned itself out the supposed culprits retired to rest and fred who had slept but a short time during the previous night found it absolutely impossible to prevent his eyes from closing  lower and lower his head drooped upon his breast until slumber came and he remained unconscious for many hours  the glare of the sunlight aroused him after the occupants of the camp were astir and he sprang to his feet in alarm  the noise made by this sudden movement startled those whom he had been detailed to watch and before fred could collect his scattered senses both the boys were upon him  for a single instant the three stood surveying each other and then gus and his companion seized the bewildered spy by the arms rendering useless his frantic struggles to defend himself  can you hold him tim while i get something to tie his hands gus cried and tim replied  i can take care of three or four jest like him get the rope outer the bag thatll be strong enough  with a quick movement the boy clasped fred around the waist and held him firmly until gus returned  when the prisoners hands had been lashed to his side he was led to the camp where his legs were also bound and the captors seated themselves in front of him  now tell us where that man is tim said sternly  what man  you know who i mean the feller what come over to blacktown with you an skip  i wish i knew fred replied with a sigh  dont lie to us and gus shook his fist in the helpless boys face that miner went to a lawyer an told him i had a hand in stealin the money what sam thorpe lost then you an skip tried to pump me now give us the whole yarn or things will be mighty hot  fred remained silent  hes been follerin us ever since we left the town tim said after a moments thought an it stands us in hand to get outer this lively or the rest of his gang will be on us  have we got to do more trampin jest on account of a sneak like this gus asked fretfully  do you want to stay an run the chance of bein carried back to blacktown  of course not but travelin all the time when we mighter got on the cars in the first place is moren i bargained for  if youd had your way wed been pulled in before this get the stuff in shape an i reckon well fix things right now let him carry the load an well take the tramp kinder easy  gus obeyed with a very ill grace and while he was getting the cooking utensils together tim walked along the bank of the brook to where a flat stone lay half submerged in the water  fred watched his every movement as he overturned this and dug with a pointed stick until a small square package had been exposed to view  there was no question in the prisoners mind but that the wrappings of cloth covered the money sam was accused of stealing and now the secret had really been discovered all else seemed trifling in comparison  i wonder how it happened that i didnt see that when they left the last camp he thought as tim put the bundle carefully in the inside pocket of his coat  so youve found out what you come for eh the boy cried angrily well it wont do any good for when we get through with sneaks they cant do much harm pick up that load an if you dont walk lively ill find a way to make you  how can i pick up anything while my legs are tied  tim unfastened the ropes from freds ankles loosened one of his arms and threw the cooking utensils over his shoulder  come on gus he said impatiently well take turns carryin the grub till weve given the slip to whoever may be follerin and then he can tote the whole load  fred was faint from lack of food but he mentally braced himself to perform the task and gus cried as he struck him a blow full in the face  step out now an when we make camp tonight youll get a taste of how we serve spies itll be a worse dose than the regulators ever gave you an dont forget it  theres no time for foolishness tim said impatiently his gang may be close behind an we cant afford to pay him off yet a while  with this sage remark he took up the provision bag and led the way across the base of the hill at right angles with the course pursued on the previous day while gus remained in the rear to urge the prisoner on in case he faltered     chapter xxiv  bills mishap   joe brace returned to farleys on the morning after he warned bill and fred of what the cashier intended to do and went directly to mrs byrams  ive bought the land he cried exultantly the farmer was mighty glad of a chance to sell for five hundred dollars an if id had more time the price could have been whittled down to four theres a mortgage of three hundred to be paid in a year an thatll be jest the same as nothin after we show up whats there  did you see fred the widow asked anxiously paying but little attention to the good news  met him an bill last night told em what was up and theyll keep shady till things can be fixed  then nothing was accomplished by their going to blacktown  joe explained why that excursion had been a failure and added  theyre on the right track so we can count on everything comin out right before long  are you intending to stay here  no i only came to tell you what had been done an shall go back on the train to make sure my deed is recorded i bought in the name of byram thorpe thomas  brace how does that strike you for a firm  although you and mr thomas are so sure the discovery will be a source of great wealth i cant feel much interest in it while fred is in danger i wish they would go to some city rather than remain so near home  i shall see em this afternoon an now that the business of the land is settled will advise them to take a little pleasure trip  please see to it that they do not suffer for food  ill tend to everything in great shape have you heard whether mr wright has got back  he sent word that he would be home tonight  then perhaps id better wait an have another talk with him  no no i will see him myself it is more important you care for those who are hiding in the woods  joe had no further time for conversation the train by which he intended to return to blacktown was already due and he hurried away after repeating confidently  ill seeem tonight maam an you can rest easy they shall live on the fat of the land now we own a coal mine  there was barely time for the miner to leap on board the cars and as they were whirled away by the puffing engine the constable who had arrested sam accosted him  where you bound joe  to blacktown was the gruff reply what are you up to servin warrants for that fool of a cashier  yes i reckon thats about the size of it  got one for me  of course not what makes you talk such nonsense  i heard that bill was goin to be rested cause hed tried to help sam an seems hes a mate of mine i didnt know but youd planned to pull in the whole family  but now be honest an admit that the case looks pretty black for the two boys  thats all nonsense sam lost the money an it was the fault of the company not his  how do you make that out  easy enough theyd no business to send him with so much stuff it was the cashiers duty an thats what makes him so sore cause mr wrights bound to blame such slipshod ways of shirkin work  allowin youre right it dont help sam thorpes case any  well see about it before the worlds many days older i aint quite a fool an when i get through your precious cashier will feel sick  after this threat joe refused to indulge in further conversation and the constable left him to seek more agreeable company  the words of the officer had aroused a new train of thought in the miners mind he fancied the lawyer whom bill had consulted should be informed of what had happened  with this idea he visited the legal gentleman immediately after the train arrived in blacktown and not only told him all which had happened relative to the robbery but divulged the secret of the vein  the knowledge that his clients were in a fair way to be rich and consequently influential caused a very decided change in the lawyers manner and he displayed more zeal than joe had expected  we can easily get bail for your friends in case they are arrested he said and in the meanwhile i will attend to the deeds it is necessary the titles should be searched before the discovery is known by the public and if you need any money i shall be glad to advance it  if the farmer cant back out of his trade weve got all thatll be wanted yet awhile joe replied but the most important thing jest now is to get bill an the boys out of their scrape  can you find mr thomas  i reckon so  then tell him to come here at once perhaps it will be well for the boy to remain in hiding a day or two longer and i shall make it my business to ascertain what evidence there is against him  ill go for bill now and joe left the office after having been again assured by the lawyer that the transfer of the property would be attended to without delay  the miner prepared for his walk by buying a small stock of provisions and then he set off in the direction of the mountain believing it would be possible to find his mate with but little difficulty  an hours tramp brought him to the famous vein on which he had already built many aircastles but neither bill nor fred could be seen  satisfying himself that there were no strangers in the vicinity he called them loudly by name but without receiving any reply  then he trudged on around the mountain shouting alternately for one and the other until afar off in the distance it seemed as if an answering hail could be heard  now he ran with all speed in that direction and soon he heard bills voice crying  joe is it you joe  indeed it is my hearty where are you  here in the bushes with what come mighty nigh bein a broken leg  joe was soon by the side of his mate whom he found lying on the ground apparently in the last stages of exhaustion  whats the matter old man are you hurt  bill told of what he and fred had seen and about the proposed chase concluding by saying  when the little villains started around the mountain i follered as the boy an me had agreed on but after a twohours tramp i fell into a hole an reckon my leg is broke  i dont see any hole joe said as he looked about him  it happened a long bit back i didnt want to break up the game by lettin fred know what was wrong an so tried to crawl toward the vein thinkin if folks were sent out to look for the money theyd find me but this is as far as i could get it would a been a case of starvin if you hadnt come along  if youre hungry i can fix that part of it all right and joe produced the package of provisions have a good time with this while i take a look at the leg  only the most superficial examination was necessary the broken bones could be plainly felt and the limb was so swollen that it seemed essential that the boot and trousers should be cut from it  i dont see my way clear in this job joe exclaimed as he removed the garments it aint safe to leave you here alone an yet help must be had to carry you to farleys  now that ive got a mouthful i can lay here a few hours longer go on ill keep till you get back  if there was some water near by i could tie you up more comfortable like  never mind that but leave at once so to be the sooner here  joe hesitated no longer but set off across the mountain at a speed which brought him to farleys in less than half an hour  here it was only necessary to state what had happened in order to find plenty of volunteers for the task of bringing bill home and as the party set out mrs byram followed a short distance by joes side in order to say  ive seen mr wright and he evidently believes both sam and fred are guilty  wont he let up till we can run down them fellers what bill was follerin  he says to me as he did to you that the law must take its course and will not even do anything to prevent bills arrest  were goin to bring the poor feller home an this company what think they own farleys an every soul in it had better let him alone  take him to my house where he can have more care than at a boardingplace  all right an thank ye maam  but what about fred where is he  theres no call to worry because of him as soon as bill is off my hands ill hunt the boy up an prhaps the two of us will bring home the real thieves  the widow could go no farther and joe took his place at the head of the party walking at his best pace  bill was suffering a great deal of pain when his friends arrived but not a word of complaint escaped his lips and some pleasant word was exchanged for every greeting  itll be a hard pull to get me over the mountain but ill not see farleys for many a long day if you cant hold out  well have you there old man an not spend any too much breath over the job joe said cheerily as he began to build a litter  several of the party were curious to learn why bill had come into that outoftheway place but he refused to make any explanations and joe pretended not to hear the many questions  it was nearly dark before the injured man arrived at mrs byrams home and then nature had so far asserted her rights that he lay unconscious until after the physician arrived  i reckon ive done all thats possible joe said to the widow an now ill start back  you wont think of searching through the woods in the night  no but ill trudge over to where i found bill sos the hunt can be begun bright an early it aint likely ill bring fred home till after ive seen the lawyer agin  if he isnt in trouble it will be better to remain away a few days longer  ill answer for it that hes all right maam an it shant be many hours now till he can hold his head up with the best of em  with these cheering words joe left the house intending to go home for supper before continuing his task but on arriving opposite the store mr wright stopped him by saying sternly  i would like to have a few words with you mr brace  my time has come joe muttered to himself but ill show these smart fellows that they cant haul up everybody in town jest because it pleases em     chapter xxv  joes interview   joe brace had a very good idea of why the superintendent wished to see him and he entered the office prepared to speak his mind plainly  i understand that you have not been working for the past day or two mr wright began  thats correct  have you left our employ  it amounts to pretty much that  has thomas quit also  when a man knows that hes to be arrested he aint likely to hang round sos the warrant can be served without much trouble to the constable but jest now bill isnt in a condition to work for anybody  whats the matter  he broke his leg an a lot of the boys have brought him to the widder byrams house  i hadnt heard of that  itll come kinder rough on the constable  i understand to what you refer brace and am not pleased to hear you speak in such a manner  it cant be helped sir when a feller sees them as risked everything to do the company a good turn while billings had full sway run down an chucked into jail for nothin it makes him feel sore  there was good reason for the arrest of sam thorpe  even admittin thats so which i dont why should fred byram an bill be pulled into the fuss theres nothin to connect them with it  they have acted very suspiciously ever since the money was said to have been lost  thats where you are makin a big mistake mr wright ive had a hand in all their maneuvers an so has the widder consequently if one is guilty the whole crowd are  what do you mean  i cant explain yet awhile but itll come out before long when youll see everything was square an above board  look here brace mr wright said in a friendly tone i called you in here to have a confidential chat upon the subject and it is not right to keep from me anything which may have a bearing on the matter  what i know cant be told for a while but ill give you the particulars of what weve already found out and without further questioning joe related the events of the past three days save so far as they were connected with the discovery of the vein  it surely looks suspicious the superintendent said musingly but i fail to understand how those boys could have gotten the money from sams pocket unless he remained in town skylarking with them  thats somethin i cant explain but when i find fred well know a good deal more about the matter  do you think anything could be accomplished by my visiting sam  im certain of it for one talk with him is bound to convince you he isnt a thief  the superintendent remained silent several moments and it seemed very much as if this second conversation with joe had caused a change of opinion  very well he said finally i will think the matter over shall you be here in the morning  im goin to leave farleys as soon as i get a bite to eat an it aint likely ill be back till fred can come with me  mr wright arose to intimate that the interview was at an end and joe left the store with a gesture of defiance and anger toward the cashier  while all this was taking place fred occupied anything rather than an enviable position  when the march was begun he found it extremely difficult to make his way through the woods loaded down as he was and with one arm tied to his side but gus had no mercy at every opportunity he spurred the prisoner on using a stout stick for the purpose and more than once was fred on the point of open rebellion  he felt confident the boys would not dare do more than give him a cruel flogging after which they must leave him behind but this would be to lose sight of the thieves and almost anything was preferable to being thus defeated in his purpose  ill stick it out he said to himself and wait for the time when i can tell the story to some one who will help make them prisoners  during an hour the boys traveled straight ahead and then gus insisted upon a halt  tim agreed because his breakfast had not been perfectly satisfactory and he wanted a second meal now they were as he believed free from pursuit  the provisions were brought out from the bag and as the two boys began to eat freds hunger returned with such a force that he could not resist the impulse to ask for food  say if youll give me some of that bread ill carry all the load when we start again i havent had a mouthful since i left blacktown  an youll go without two or three days longer gus replied with malicious pleasure youll have the whole load an no trade about it either so hold your tongue or ill use the stick again  tim laughed as if he thought it great sport to hear the prisoner begging for food and fred threw himself upon the ground resolving not to give them another opportunity for mirth  if theres a chance to get hold of the bag tonight ill help myself he thought it cant be stealing for im surely entitled to a share when they force me to stay with them  gus amused himself for a while by thrusting food close to the prisoners face and then withdrawing it but he tired of this when fred made no effort to take what he knew was not intended for him  the halt continued about an hour and then as gus had threatened both packages were placed on freds shoulders  now step out livelier than you did before for we dont want to make another halt until we are ready to build a camp tim said as he began the advance  treat me decent an ill travel as fast as you can  you aint gettin it half as bad as you deserve an itd be a good idea to keep your mouth shut  as during the first portion of the journey gus amused himself by prodding the prisoner with a stick but as the day lengthened and tim refused to halt the boy grew too weary to indulge in such pleasantries  in order that fred might carry all the burden it was necessary to unloosen both his hands and without being observed by his companions he contrived to transfer several crackers from the bag to his pocket  the second stage of the journey lasted nearly two hours and then tim decided the camp should be erected on the bank of a small stream  they were now according to freds belief not more than twenty miles from blacktown and a trifle less than that distance from farleys  as far away as the eye could reach was a town but no one knew its name  we might have stayed nearer home if the camp is to be made so close to a settlement gus said fretfully  while we keep out of sight nobodyll know were here an in case we want to leave suddenly on the cars it wont be far to walk id like to get hold of a boat an then we could run down the stream without much trouble  why not buy one  after a day or two well find out if there is any near just now we must get the camp built an then take things comfortable for awhile  fred watched tims every movement in order to learn where the money would be hidden but failed to see any attempt at burying it the protuberance just over his breast served to show the treasure was yet in his possession and gus seemed well content it should remain there  the prisoner was ordered to hew the materials for the camp while the others put them together and during this work he contrived to eat the stolen crackers  the shelter was a rude affair hardly more than sufficient to protect them from the rays of the sun and when completed all hands lay down to rest fred being bound hand and foot again to prevent any attempt at escape  not until night was the prisoner given food and then gus doled out two crackers an amount which would have been little more than an aggravation if he had not previously ministered to his own wants  during the hours of darkness no watch was kept but fred remained awake nearly all the time straining his ears in the vain hope that he might hear something of bill  the second and third days were but repetitions of the first and then it became necessary to visit the village in order to procure food  ill walk up the stream till a place to cross is found tim said an if i dont see a boat before then will strike out for the town keep your eye on the sneak an dont give him a chance to get away  help me fix the ropes around his legs a little tighter an ill answer for it that he wont go far  tim complied with this request and when fred was trussed up like a chicken he took from his pocket the stolen money  it wont do to carry all this so youd better take care of it a while ten dollars will be enough for me even if i should happen to come across the boat  subtracting this amount from the total he gave the remainder to gus who put it carelessly in his pocket as if accustomed to handling large sums of money  then he started along the bank of the stream his companion accompanying him a short distance and fred realized that the time had come when he must make one desperate attempt to take his jailer prisoner  gus has got nearly all the money he said to himself and if i could manage to slip the ropes it would only be a question of a fight in which im almost certain to get the upper hand  he had been left seated with his back against the trunk of a tree and the first move necessary was to release his arms  to do this he struggled desperately regardless of the pain but the bonds remained firm until gus returned when as a matter of course he did not dare to make any further movement  now tim is so far away that he cant interfere im going to pay you off for playin the sneak gus said as he took up his station directly in front of the prisoner if i had my way you shouldnt have a bite to eat from now out an by the time we get ready to leave you couldnt do much mischief  if youre afraid why not kill me thats the safest plan  id like to was the savage reply an would if i was sure of not bein pulled up for murder i can give you a lively time for the next two or three hours though  gus began to fulfill his promise by tickling freds nose with a twig and the prisoner was by no means averse to the cruel sport since it gave him a good excuse to struggle  he writhed and twisted as if to move beyond reach of his tormentor but all the while his sole aim was to release his hands and gus was so deeply engrossed with the efforts to cause pain that he failed to understand what his victim might succeed in doing     chapter xxvi  turning the tables   the constant straining caused fred to perspire freely and after many vain efforts he succeeded in catching the rope which was around his wrists under the point of a projecting limb of the tree  now he had a purchase and by a mighty effort at the moment when gus made a more than usually vicious lunge slipped one of his hands from the bonds thanks to the perspiration which moistened the strands  he did not take immediate advantage of his freedom it was essential to await a favorable opportunity and this came when gus knelt before him for the purpose of pricking the apparently helpless boy with the blade of his knife  fred could not arise but he flung both arms around his tormentors neck hugging him so close as to prevent the latter from using his hands  for an instant his surprise was so great that he remained motionless but before fred could take any advantage of his inactivity gus recovered from the shock to exert all his strength and began to free himself  under ordinary circumstances fred would have been no match for his captor but now the knowledge of what was to be gained lent him great energy and he clung to him with desperation  let go or ill stab you with this knife gus shouted but fred was too careful of his wind to make any reply  over and over they rolled one trying to use his weapon while the other did his best to prevent it and but for an accident the battle might have been continued until the smaller boy was exhausted  it was not possible to control the direction of their bodies and suddenly both were precipitated into the stream  fred was a good swimmer while his adversary knew but little of the art and he succeeded in holding gus head under water until he was nearly strangled  the tables were now turned  it only remained for fred to drag the halfunconscious boy to the shore and there transfer the rope from one pair of legs to the other  when gus again had a clear idea of matters he was securely tied and fred had put into his own pocket the package of money which sam was accused of stealing  to pack in small compass the remaining store of provisions cut a stout stick and place the hatchet in a belt improvised from a piece of the rope occupied but a few moments and then fred said sternly  im going to slacken up on your legs a bit sos you can walk and now its your turn to step out lively  when tim comes back you shall pay for this  i intend to be a long distance from here before that time arrives  he can catch you  to do it hell have to be smarter than i think he is  wait an see  thats just what i dont propose doin i understand your purpose now youre trying to keep me here as long as possible get up  i wont an you cant make me  fred struck the prisoner several severe blows but he did not so much as cry out  ill beat you black and blue if you dont stand up and walk  pound away i can bear a good deal of that rather than go to jail  again fred used the stick but in vain gus shut his teeth firmly and took the punishment with a stoicism worthy a better cause  it was important that no time should be lost tim might find a boat and return to the camp before going to the town  fred stood still in perplexity for an instant and then throwing aside the stick raised gus in his arms  it was a heavy burden but he staggered on with all possible speed  as soon as gus began to understand that he might be carried away despite his refusal to walk he set up a series of the most terrific yells and fred was forced to come to a halt  ill soon put an end to that kind of fun he said angrily while whittling a piece of soft wood with this in your mouth there wont be much screaming  now gus began to fancy he might be finally beaten and then tried new tactics  see here all you want is the money an now youve got it ill agree that neither tim nor mell chase or try in any way to catch you if im left here theres no need even to take off the ropes but let me stay where hell see me  fred shook his head  i need you quite as much as i do the money and i am bound to take you along  what good will it do to have me put in jail  itll be the means of freeing a better fellow than you ever dared to be  ill kill you some day  possibly but that dont let you out of this scrape  by this time fred had the gag ready and a stout pressure on the prisoners cheeks caused him to open his mouth  the wood was thrust between gus teeth and fred tied his handkerchief over it to prevent it from slipping  now when youre willing to walk ill take that out he said once in every few minutes when we have to stop to rest ill look at your eyes if you wink it means youre ready to do as i say  gus glared at him savagely but was careful to keep his eyes wide open  again fred shouldered his burden realizing meanwhile that he could never reach farleys if his prisoner remained obstinate  when an hundred yards had been traversed he was forced to rest  gus eyes stared at him  a second and a third time was this repeated at each interval the distance was shorter and fred knew he could not travel much farther  if he dont give in pretty soon i shall he muttered to himself as he threw his burden to the ground for the third time  to his great relief gus winked violently when fred pulled the handkerchief down to gain a view of his eyes and the gag was removed without loss of time  will you agree to walk now he asked  yes yes it wouldnt take a feller long to stifle with that thing in his mouth  i dont care what happens so long as i get you to farleys  once more gus tried to beg off but fred would not listen  walk fast he said and if you dont do your best in goes the gag again  there was no necessity of emphasizing the demand the prisoner moved with alacrity but his captor was by no means certain as to which was the proper course  tim had made so many turns in his flight that freds ideas regarding the points of the compass were very hazy  both the boys were suffering from lack of water and no halt was made until two or three hours past noon when they were at the edge of a swamp  quenching their thirst with the illtasting liquid they lay down on the ground to rest and did not continue their journey for some time  why not stay here all night gus asked  because we havent traveled far enough yet  but i cant hold out much longer no matter how hard i try  youll have to go as far as i do  wait till mornin an then ill walk twice as fast to make up for the time spent now  we must get in another hours tramp before sunset fred replied determinedly and although gus pleaded very hard the decision was not changed  but little was accomplished during the last portion of the traveling both were thoroughly tired and when the shadows of night shrouded the recesses of the forest in gloom the welcome word was given  heres a little stream and wed better stop here theres a chance for a drink  its about time gus added sulkily as he threw himself on the ground  fred divided half of the food into two portions but did not dare to loosen the prisoners arms sufficiently to admit of his eating unaided  ill feed you first and then take my share he said and gus devoured the food ravenously after which he quenched his thirst when fred bound him securely to a tree  the prisoner slept soundly but to his captor the night was the longest he had ever known he did not dare give himself wholly up to slumber lest tim should be on their track and attempt to effect a rescue while the fear that the money might be lost this time beyond recovery rendered him very nervous  its going to be tough lines before we get to farleys he said to himself but i ought to hold out if for no other reason than to clear sam beyond a doubt  when the morning finally came fred fed gus again both took large drinks of water and their journey was resumed  now gus neither begged nor made comments he marched just ahead of his captor in a sullen manner as if having decided upon a certain course of action and fred remained continually on the alert fearing lest he meditated an attack  at noon the two halted and while eating the last of the provisions knowing that after this they must go hungry until arriving at a settlement fred fancied he heard a noise as of someone approaching  his first thought was that tim had succeeded in following their trail and he hurriedly made ready a gag to prevent an alarm from being given  gus heard the same noise and before fred could prevent him he began to shout loudly for help  it was several seconds before the outcries could be checked and then the mischief had been done  the noise of a heavy body forcing its way through the underbrush sounded more clearly and fred sprang to his feet hatchet in hand ready to defend himself to the utmost  gus looked triumphant and again shouted loudly but the expression of his eye was changed to despair as the stranger burst through the foliage  why joe joe fred cried as he leaped forward and caught brace by the hands how did you happen to get here just when you were most needed  i reckon id gone right past without knowin you was anywhere near if it hadnt been for your wild yells  it was gus who did that fred replied glancing with a smile toward the discomfited prisoner he thought as i did that it was tim  do you mean his partner  yes  have you got the best of both  in the fewest words possible fred explained how the capture had been made and joe actually leaped for joy when the stolen money was displayed     chapter xxvii  an unlookedfor denial   youve done a big thing my boy brace said approvingly when freds story was concluded an it wont be long before we can bring sam back to farleys with not so much as a suspicion against him besides that we own the land thatll make all hands rich  how did you do it  joe gave him all the details and concluding with the interview between himself and mr wright said  i didnt leave that night as i decided on but went back to see poor bill an your mother insisted i stay till mornin the sun wasnt up when i started out an a mighty blind hunt it proved to be till the first camp was struck that kinder livened me a bit but i couldnt get onto the trail an from then till gus yelled i hadnt any idea which way to go  how far do you suppose we are from farleys  i reckon itll take smart walkin for the rest of this day an the best part of tomorrow before we see the works  and the provisions i took from tim and gus are all gone  ive got enough for supper if we dont eat too hearty and the balance of the time we can suck our thumbs  then wed better make another start it must be three oclock  do you know the straight cut  im not even certain were heading right  by keeping on the high land we are bound to come out somewhere near farleys or blacktown  when the journey was continued gus took good care to give his captors no trouble for he understood that joe would show but little mercy if there was any attempt to cause delay  at a reasonably rapid pace the three marched until darkness forced a halt and then the small amount of provisions brace had brought was consumed without satisfying the hunger of either member of the party  gus was tied between his captors where he could stretch himself at full length and the night passed quietly there was no longer any fear tim could effect a rescue even though he might be near at hand and fred enjoyed a most refreshing rest  what all hoped would prove to be the last days journey was begun without breakfast and the advance was by no means rapid  at ten oclock fred declared he could go no farther without a rest and the party sought shelter from the sun under a wide spreading tree where a view could be had of a depression in the land for some distance ahead  joe and fred were facing this open stretch and had but just begun to discuss the subject which was ever uppermost in their mindsthe coal veinwhen a figure carrying a heavy burden emerged from the thicket on the lower side evidently bent on ascending the mountain  now what can that fellow be doing joe asked as he arose to his feet its a boy an wed be in big luck if it should turn out to be that precious tim  but it isnt he wears a cap and this one has a hat it looks something likewhy it is its skip  skip joe repeated in amazement whats he doin out here an with such a load  in order to answer that question i shall have to ask him and fred shouted the boys name  skip started as if alarmed at being summoned and then waving his hat in triumph he came toward the party at his best pace  i knew id find you if i hunted long enough he exclaimed as he came within speaking distance and added when he finally reached the tree and threw down the burden its mighty heavy an i thought one spell yesterday id have to give up the job reckon youre glad to get it eh  what have you there  grub of course when joe didnt turn up an there was no sign of fred i figured that youd both want somethin to eat so took out my wages in what was handiest to eat mrs byram said id never find you but it wouldnt do any harm to try so here we are  did you spend your money to buy us food fred asked  why not itll take a good deal moren that to straighten things between us an id like to get the count squared some time  youve done it already skip it was you who first put us on the track of the thieves and now youve helped the cause along wonderfully for it has been a good while since i had all i could eat  well fill yourself up right now theres no need to hurry for you cant get to farleys tonight anhello gus got through with your trip so soon  youll wish i hadnt before this thing is ended was the surly reply and then the prisoner turned his back on the exchief of the regulators  quite naturally skip was eager to hear the result of the chase and while joe and fred were eating they gave him the full particulars  do you know the way home brace asked when the story was told  of course ive been out here half a dozen times was you calculatin to keep straight ahead  yes  then youd gone six miles the other side of farleys  if that is the case its lucky you found us lets make another start now ive filled up it seems possible to travel without stopping again until we are at mothers door  with a guide and provisions in plenty the long tramp yet to be endured seemed but a trifling affair and the party with the single exception of gus were in the best of spirits  the night was spent near a small water course in the valley and at three oclock all hands entered the companys store at farleys  both mr wright and the cashier were in the building and they listened in undisguised astonishment as joe told the story of the capture  here is the money except what they have spent fred said when joe concluded the recital and he handed the package to the superintendent  an examination showed that but fiftythree dollars were missing and then mr wright turned to gus who was wearing a look of mingled indignation and innocence  how did you get this money from thorpe  who is he sir  the boy who was bringing it from the bank  i never saw him  then how did you get these notes  i never had em sir  why i took them out of his pocket fred cried in surprise  explain yourself mr wright said to the prisoner  me an tim sanger was goin to camp out on the mountains while work was slack gus began with an air of truthfulness we had a shanty built an tim went off fishin when this feller here he pointed to the astonished fred jumped in on me id seen him in blacktown so didnt think anything was out of the way till he knocked me down  why did he strike you  thats jest what i dont know he tied me all up like this an i had to do as he said till we met joe brace then i heard one of em say to the other this will get sam out of the scrape for we can say gus dobson had the money what was stole in his pocket thats all i know about it an i never saw them bills till this very minute  it was a good scheme for sam to give up the money in this way when he found the case was so dead against him the cashier said in a low tone as if speaking to himself but he took care that mr wright should hear distinctly  what do you mean joe cried fiercely  nothing nothing i must have been thinking aloud  you intended we should hear every word the miner added excitedly  be quiet brace while we get the facts of this strange story mr wright said sharply  you have got the facts already sir i told you before i left town that this fellow was one of the thieves  that doesnt prove anything the cashier replied with a malicious smile  ill prove more than that to you if you dare show your nose out doors  either leave the office brace or hold your tongue and now the superintendent spoke in an angry tone  fred what have you got to say in answer to this boys story  not a word sir what joe has told you is true and if it aint believed you can serve the warrant which was issued for me as soon as you please  he cant say anything gus added triumphantly if tim was here he could tell you jest why we left blacktown but of course he dont know about the job this feller is try in to put up on me  where is tim  i dunno hell likely come home when he cant find me  are you willing to stay here until he returns  sure there aint any reason why id want to run off if you tell my folks where i am  joe could contain himself no longer  do you mean to put his word agin ours he cried fiercely  why not the cashier asked softly it looks to me very much as if his having been brought here was an outrage  if you speak to me agin ill spoil the whole of your face you cur after arestin a boy for meetin with an accident in doin what you oughter done an gettin out warrants for others what couldnt have had a hand in the matter its easy to see why you want to believe this little villains story when the truth is known you understand blessed well that the town will be too hot to hold you  that will do mr wright cried sternly i shall have no such language used here leave this moment brace and when you are more calm well discuss the matter  joe looked in silence first at the cashier and then at the superintendent after which he said to fred and skip  come lads this is no place for us weve saved the companys money an now are likely to be treated as we were for standin by em at the time of the riot  with this reminder he walked out of the building followed by both the boys     chapter xxviii  opinions   the three who had entered the store in such high spirits left it in a maze of bewilderment and anger  that gus could concoct so plausible a story was none the less astonishing than that mr wright should give it credence so far as to refrain from ordering the boys immediate arrest  joe was so enraged that during the walk to freds home he did nothing but inveigh in the strongest terms against the company and more especially these two of its servants who had insulted both himself and fred by refusing to believe their united statements  ill pound that cashier till he cant say beans he cried shaking his fist in impotent rage  what good will that do people wont believe our story any quicker because of it  ill be satisfied an thats enough  dont make such threats fred said imploringly if he hears of them it will only give him a chance to make trouble for you  ill not only make em but carry out every one it wont take much more talk to coax me into servin wright the same way  several of the miners acquaintances hailed him as he passed but his heart was so full of anger that he paid not the slightest attention and fred felt a sense of most profound relief when they were inside the house where the wild threats could not be heard by those who might report them at the store  after the greetings with mrs byram the travelers went to the chamber where bill lay helpless his fractured limb bound in splints and bandages  here the different stories were told again and the invalids astonishment was not less than that of his companions  it dont hardly seem reasonable he muttered after a long pause i reckon the best thing would be for you an fred to see the lawyer right away theres no knowin what kind of a scrape may grow out of this  itll do jest as well if we go in the mornin on the first train joe replied after the tramp weve had it comes kinder natural to hanker for a bed  i spose it would be tough but dont waste any time tomorrow  wright cant do much between now an then so rest easy mate they wont be able to take the land from us an in another year well be among the bigbugs ourselves  are you sure the trade cant be backed out of  ive left everything with the lawyer and hell fix matters about right  bill closed his eyes as if in thought fred went down stairs to talk with his mother and skip took his departure joe saying as he accompanied him to the door  we wont forget what youve done lad an before long us fourthats countin samwill be in condition to pay off our scores  ill have all i want when the fellers i buried in the mine promise to forget whats been done  then you can rest easy for the matter was settled yesterday when you brought the grub  after skip left joe went out to see his friends and an hour later he returned in a perfect rage  that villain of a cashier has taken good care to tell his side of the story he exclaimed bursting into the invalids room an moren half the men ive seen believe we got the money from sam to stick the robbery on that thievin gus mr wright has taken the boy up to his house an is pettin him like a prince i spose to square off for what we did to him why even donovan says old man dobson oughter prosecute us for the outrage as he calls it  i cant believe it bill cried trying in vain to rise to a sitting posture  im tellin the truth all the same theres a big excitement in town an i wouldnt be surprised if fred was arrested in the mornin spite of what hes done  dont the folks know what kind of a boy that dobson feller is  i reckon they do but the cashier keeps talkin about destroyin one fellers character to help another an the blind fools here swallow all he says  what makes him so down on our crowd  cause he had no business to make the arrests an if it was proved gus an tim stole it hed be in a bad mess with all hands  look here joeand bill spoke very earnestlyit dont make any difference how tired you an fred are you must go to blacktown this very night that lawyer will tell us jest what oughter be done an weve got to fight this thing tooth an nail now all hands are agin us  joe realized that this was good advice and went at once to confer with mrs byram and fred  the result of this last interview was that an hour after midnight the miner and the boy left the house quietly and walked at a rapid pace directly across the mountain  this is pretty tough lad joe said when they were some distance from the town it seems as if id done nothin but tramp for the last month  i wont grumble if this matter is straightened out finally but just now it looks as though all hands would have been better off to let things go as they might  dont get downhearted when our mine is open you can afford to laugh at this little fracas  although joe spoke so cheerily he was far from feeling comfortable in mind as was apparent when they visited the lawyers house at a very early hour next morning  the mental anxiety could be plainly read on his face as he waited to receive the legal opinion after telling his story  i dont think you need fear any serious trouble although matters may be very disagreeable for a while that gentleman said it will be well for us to make complaint against the dobson boy and by causing his arrest be certain of having him here when he is wanted i will attend to it at once  how much money do you want  we wont speak of that now when i do business for a firm as rich as yours i am not afraid of losing my fees  it would be hard to find any poorer concern  theres where you make a mistake mr brace your title is clear an expert whom i sent reports that there can be no question as to the presence of coal in large quantities and i shall be only too glad to purchase stock when the company is formed  do you mean the whole of that joe asked his eyes glistening with delight  to prove it i will advance on your joint note any reasonable amount of money which may be needed in fact i think it would be a good idea to give mr wright a hint of your discovery when im quite sure hed view this whole affair in a different light  well keep the secret a while longer id rather get out of the scrape before folks know what weve found an then settle old scores now fred spose we go to see sam  ill walk to the jail with you and you can wait until i have despatched an officer to farleys for the dobson boy  the fact that lawyer hunter had come with the visitors insured them every facility for seeing their friend and the three met in the turnkeys room with the knowledge that they might be together the entire day  poor sam looked forlorn indeed when he entered the apartment it had been so long since his friends last visit that he fancied they were deserting him  his appearance changed decidedly when they explained the reason for their absence and two hours were spent in giving a detailed account of all that had happened since his departure from farleys  then forgetting the present troubles the three talked of the day when they would be mine owners instead of laborers and built so many air castles that neither heeded the passage of time until mr hunter returned with the information that an officer had visited farleys only to find the superintendent looking anxiously for gus  it seems that mr wright took the boy home last night and believing in his protestations of innocence despite your testimony left him unguarded as might have been expected he took advantage of this credulity to make his escape and now i fancy it will be many days before he revisits this part of the country  then all we have done goes for nothing fred said mournfully  in that you are very greatly mistaken thorpe will be acquitted beyond a doubt and it is not likely mr wright dare press any charge against you at present i shall go with you to farleys after sam is released on bail and guarantee matters will be set right  am i to go out sam asked in surprise  as soon as it can be arranged your friends are to accompany me and the matter can be accomplished very quickly  fred was amazed at the ease with which all this was done he and joe went before a magistrate and repeated under oath the story they had told so often two friends of mr hunters signed a paper to which the others names had already been affixed and ten minutes later sam was with them looking radiantly happy at being in the open air once more  it was too late to return home unless joe and fred were willing to take another tramp across the mountain and all three went to the hotel where they formed a very jolly party  on the first train next morning the partners accompanied by mr hunter arrived at farleys and found public sentiment greatly changed the flight of gus had caused very many to believe he really was the guilty party although no one could guess how he gained possession of the money and the walk to mrs byrams was something like an ovation     chapter xxix  a question of title   it was as if each person who had doubted sams honesty felt it necessary to call at mrs byrams and congratulate him upon what now appeared to be good proof of his innocence  fred and the miners also came in for their share of attention and even bill whose limb was paining him severely joined his partners in celebrating their victory which now seemed certain  before returning home mr hunter called to consult with his clients relative to making a stock company of the new mine and when he left it was with full authority to do whatever he believed their interests demanded  among the visitors in the evening was donovan and he had no hesitation in calling himself very severe names for having been so stupid as to think it possible his old friends could have been engaged in any questionable transaction  the cashier is about as sore a man as can be found in town he said an if i aint way off in my reckonin hell be lookin for another job mighty soon  does he say anything against us bill asked  hes glum as a fish every feller who goes in wants to know where gus is an he keeps out of sight all thats possible  have you seen mr wright today  no but i heard he an that lawyer of yours had a long chin about the business say bill by the time you get out of this scrape youll owe a pretty penny for law i reckon why dont you try to make the company pay it  we can stand the racket an wont ask a soul to help us  somebody must have died an left you a pile for men that work at farleys dont often have enough to pay big lawyers for runnin around  itll be all right donovan so dont worry about that  but the mine boss did worry he failed to understand how bill and joe could incur such expense with any prospect of paying it and when he left the house it was to discuss the matter in all its bearings with a select few of his particular friends  the superintendent did not consider it worth his while to call but on the following morning joe received a note to the effect that if he intended to return to the mine it would be to his advantage to resume his work at once  tell mr wright that ive got through with his company an he can put a man in my place whenever it suits him the miner said to the messenger and the latter had hardly reached the store before a workman from blacktown arrived with the startling intelligence that the four who had been accused of the robbery had purchased a large tract of land on the mountain and were about to open a mine  this news was so wonderful that one of the loungers volunteered to walk to the town for the sole and only purpose of learning if it was really true  an hour later it was rumored that fred received the following telegram from blacktown       have opened books for subscriptions and already received      pledges to the full amount necessary for beginning the work                                                arthur hunter  the lounger returned in hot haste with information that the people there were in the highest state of excitement regarding the new company which was being formed by some of the most influential men in the county and related with many embellishments of his own the story of how the vein had been discovered by sam and fred  this was sufficient to cause another stream of callers to mrs byrams house and learning that the secret had been made known the four owners had no hesitation in giving all the particulars  now the cashier was more unpopular than ever even those who refrained from censuring him on the day previous had nothing but hard words for the man who could make such an error as to charge with theft those who were wealthy in the possession of such a rich vein as the new one was reported to be  fully onethird of all those in the companys works took a half holiday to see the new mine and some of the most sanguine started out to prospect for other evidences of coal  in six hours land in the immediate vicinity of the mountain increased in price until it would hardly have paid to buy it unless gold could be found in large quantities and the entire county was in a ferment of excitement  it is needless to say that the four partners were very happy but even in the midst of the great joy they found time to wonder why skip had not called to congratulate them  nearly every other one of their friends and acquaintances visited the house at some time during the day and evening but the exchief of the regulators was conspicuous by his absence  i wonder what the matter is with him fred asked when at a late hour the partners were alone do you suppose he thinks we dont want to see him just because we have been fortunate  if he does its the biggest mistake of his life i like the little rascal although he did play us a bad trick an if he dont show up before noon tomorrow ill hunt him out joe said laughingly  but skip did not put in an appearance before the time set and true to his word joe went in search of him  the information he brought back to his partners was mystifying  skip had not been at home since the day on which sam was liberated and his father fancied he was absent on some work for the firm  this singular disappearance troubled fred greatly and during the remainder of the day he spoke more often of the boy than regarding the mine  hell turn up before long joe said after all had tried in vain to conjecture where he might be but fred fancied that the miner did not speak very confidently  nothing was heard personally from mr wright but it was common gossip about town that he had visited the newlydiscovered vein several times and spent one entire day at blacktown  another twentyfour hours passed and skip had not returned home his parents were now beginning to feel alarmed but the majority of the townspeople not trusting in the sincerity of his repentance intimated that he had joined gus preferring to run away rather than lead an industrious life  i wont believe anything of the kind fred replied hotly when donovan reported the general feeling regarding the disappearance he never would have done so much to help us unless meaning exactly what he said  i reckon hard work didnt agree with him the breaker boss answered with a laugh  when bill gets a little better joe and i will go after him  where  i dont know but it wont do any harm to look around and i am  fred was interrupted by a knock at the door and on answering it was handed a telegram  somebody is beggin to be let in to the new company i reckon donovan said laughingly but his smile vanished very quickly as he saw the look which came over the boys face  whats the matter lad joe cried and instead of replying fred handed him the telegram which read as follows       mr fred byramsuperintendent wright has served an      injunction restraining our company from taking further steps      on the plea that the land purchased belongs to him his case      so far as i can learn is very strong it is advisable that you      and brace come here at once      arthur hunter  whawhawhat does it mean joe stammered  i should say things were gettin serious donovan replied as he read the message over joes shoulder mr wright is a hard man to fight an the chances are hell get the best of you  then he left the house as if in great haste to spread this additional news and the partners looked at each other in dismay  that is why weve heard nothin from the superintendent since our secret leaked out bill said grimly you two had better tramp across to save time you can get there three hours ahead of the next train  come on fred cried as he aroused from the daze caused by the startling intelligence lets learn the worst quickly  its pretty tough to lose the thing after swellin as we have for the last couple of days joe added gloomily but without rising from his seat  dont whine till were sure its gone and bill tried very hard to speak cheerily  at this point mrs byram entered the invalids room to say  mr wright has sent over to ask fred and mr brace to call at his office  matters are beginning to look brighter already bill cried and joe asked gruffly  how do you make that out  if he was so sure of provin we had no claim to the land he wouldnt have a word to say now hes tryin to make a trade  he cant with me unless you fred an sam insist itll be the whole or nothing  now thats the way to talk bill replied if we can raise the money to fight there wont be any bargain made  dont you intend to call upon the superintendent mrs byram asked  not a bit of it maam tell whoever he sends that fred an joe are too busy just now but if he wants to make a pointment some time next week theyll try to see him  but it cant do any harm to talk with mr wright  it wont do any good an theyd better see the lawyer first  mrs byram left the room to deliver the message and bill delayed his partners that they might know exactly how he felt regarding the matter before starting on the journey     chapter xxx  a suit at law   dont give in an inch bill said in conclusion to his remarks concerning the validity of the title get over there as quick as you can and dont let the lawyer weaken  itll take big money to carry on a fight in law  well try to raise it somehow  after promising to send him word as to the progress of affairs before night in case they were detained more than one day joe and fred went down stairs and at that moment mrs byram opened the door to admit mr wright  he was particularly pleasant in his greetings and asked as he observed that they were on the point of going out  did you finally conclude to come to the office  we were on our way to blacktown joe replied gruffly  but we have plenty of time for a chat since the train does not leave for two hours of more  we are going to walk fred explained  then you can surely spare me half an hour  what for joe asked sharply  i wish to see if we cant arrive at some amicable settlement of the suit which i have been forced to bring  wouldnt it been better to have talked first an then begun the law business  in regard to that i had no alternative the company ordered me to proceed exactly as i did  id like to hear whats goin on down there bill shouted from above and fred said  its no more than fair that we should go upstairs hes got the right to know what mr wright proposes  yes i prefer to speak with all the partners though perhaps there is no necessity of sending for thorpe  we havent got the time to do that joe replied come on an lets get through with the business as soon as we can for were due in blacktown mighty soon  the miner led the way to the invalids chamber and bill greeted his former superintendent with the curtest of nods  i have come in the hope that we can arrange matters without having recourse to the law mr wright began if immediately after discovering the vein you had advised me i could have told you that our company owns the entire mountain by purchase from the heirs of the original owner  but mr hunter told us the title was perfect fred interrupted  lawyers cannot always be depended upon there is no question as to the truth of what i say and here is a true copy of our deed  he handed bill a legal looking document but the miner motioned it away  i dont want to see it he said neither of us could understand it in a weeks study the only thing for us to do is listen to what you propose  in view of the services you all have rendered in the past i should be sorry to see you lose the money already paid on this property and more so to have you involved in an expensive lawsuit now i am empowered to make this offer the company will return the money paid settle with your attorney and allow you a reasonable compensation for the labour performed in addition it may be that we can give you a few shares in case it is decided to open new works  as mr wright paused bill raised his head and looking fixedly at the visitor asked  if the property is yours beyond a question what makes you offer to give us anything  because you have acted in such a friendly manner toward us i am not one who forgets a friend  you came mighty near doin so when sam was arrested an warrants sworn out for fred an me  that was a matter in which it was to your interest that the law should take its course a large majority of the people believed you knew something about the robbery and the only way to settle it absolutely was to have the case decided in court  then we ought to thank you i spose and bill leaned forward despite the pain caused by the movement if we conclude to take the offer well let you know tomorrow  i am sorry to say that we can agree to no delay if the terms are accepted at once well and good but they will not be held open for a lawyer to interfere  then ill speak for myself an say no bill cried angrily the others can act as they please but if all this is to be done jest on account of your friendship then wheres the harm of waitin till next week if we want to  i have only repeated the stipulations made by the company  well we dont want anything to do with em joe added what bill says goes with me an i reckon fredll stick by us  i believe as they do mr wright  then you refuse the generous proposition  we do but have our own idea as to how generous it is bill replied grimly  do you think it will be possible to fight successfully a company as rich as ours  well try it for a while anyhow an wont give in till were whipped  i dont like to make any threats but feel it my duty to warn you of the consequences if we press the charge of theft the evidence is strongly against you and more particularly so since you returned the money  i reckon that about winds up this ere interview and joe arose to his feet with a menacing air go ahead with the suit but theres such a thing as collectin damages an rich as your company is i dont believe they can get out of payin em  that is childs talk if you refuse what is little less than a present i will go  an its pretty nigh time joe added as he opened the door dont try to make us any more such presents or we may not keep our temper  it could be plainly told that the superintendent had already lost his temper for he went down stairs rapidly slamming the street door behind him with a force which literally caused the cottage to tremble  he aint so sure of his case as he would have us believe bill said when they were alone its jest possible he may try to make things hotter for us by servin the warrant on fred so youd better not come back from blacktown till the widder sends word get over as quick as you can an dont forget to tell the lawyer about the generous proposition  the two started without further delay and the reception met with by those whom they passed on the street told how rapidly the bad news had travelled  on the day previous every person was very cordial as if trying to establish his or her position as friend but now they were greeted even less pleasantly than before the riot and joe said savagely  theyre a set of curs i did believe some of the things we heard yesterday but now soft words wont go down with me no matter how the property turns out  it cant make any difference what is done or said all i ask is that we get sam out of his troubles  you an me are about as deep in the mire as he is if the case goes agin us well try not to borrer trouble till theres better reason where do you spose skip is keepin himself all this time  i wish i knew nobody can make me believe he went off with gus  hes got a different game than that an im thinkin well hear from him mighty soon  why  no particlar reason i only jest think so  having changed the topic of conversation which was the sole cause of his mentioning skips name joe relapsed into a silence which was not broken until the two arrived at the newlydiscovered vein  here a party of surveyors were running imaginary lines and measuring distances as they referred from time to time to several formidable looking documents and joe said bitterly  wright is gettin ready for the fight if we had plenty of money i wouldnt feel so bad but unless the lawyer can borrow some for us were likely to come out the little end of the horn  we shall soon know all about it and fred continued the journey at a swift pace  mr hunter was in his office when the partners arrived and the expression on his face was not such as to inspire courage  i didnt expected you so soon he said motioning them to be seated  we walked over rather than wait for the cars fred replied  i was sorry to summon you on such sorry business but superintendent wright has begun a fight for the possession of the land and some of our prospective stockholders are alarmed by the attack  has he really got any hold on the property  he claims that the companys deeds give them title to the entire mountain  then how did it happen that the farmer could sell  it all hinges upon the question of survey if the lines run twenty years ago are incorrect as he claims then the land you bought is located in the valley and in that event not worth half you paid for it  what does the farmer say joe asked  i fancy mr wright has bribed him to forget where his property was two days ago he had a very clear idea of the location but this morning he thinks mr wright is correct in fact he is almost ready to swear he owned land only in the valley  he told me exactly where it was situated an we bought with the positive understandin that he was sellin a tract on the mountain joe said  that is one of the questions i wanted to decide if he made those representations we may force him to tell the truth rather than stand a suit for obtaining money under false representations  fred thought it was time to tell of mr wrights proposition and when he had finished the story the lawyer said with a look of positive relief  im glad to hear that we will force them to show their hands by asking an immediate trial for thorpe  but suppose he should be convicted fred cried skip is not at home and we need his evidence  we must take that risk rather than allow them time to work up a worse plot     chapter xxxi  skip   it seemed to fred as if they were about to sacrifice sam in order to aid in confirming the title of the land and it required no slight amount of mr hunters eloquence to persuade him differently  by pressing for trial we have a better chance of proving his innocence under ordinary circumstances i would be certain of the result but where so much property is a stake i do not like to trust the superintendent too implicitly  but what effect can his innocence or guilt have on the other question  it might prejudice our case if he went before a jury every point must be guarded against and this is the first to be settled  can we raise money enough to carry the thing through joe asked  i think so but will tell you better tomorrow after i have had time to see some of the subscribers with whom i have not yet spoken  do you think weve got any chance of winning  i wish it were possible to say yes but under the circumstances it seems to me that the odds are in the favor of the company represented by mr wright  yet you dont advise us to accept his proposition fred said  certainly not even if i was in favor of making a compromise the amount offered would be no temptation i should advise you to refuse ten thousand dollars for it will cost the company much more than that if we can raise sufficient to carry on the suit  is there anything for us to do fred asked  very much it is necessary to remain here and send for thorpe i will first attend to pressing for trial and then have an interview with the farmer for the purpose of frightening him into telling nothing but the truth i fancy we can restore his memory by threatening him with a criminal suit  ill run over for sam joe said as if a walk of five miles across the mountain was nothing more than a pleasure trip  it wont do for you to come he added as fred was about to speak because im afraid wright might use that warrant  yes it is much better you should remain here mr hunter said quickly isnt it possible to find the boy who first suggested dobson was the thief  im afraid not it looks very much as if hed run away  it wont do any harm to walk around town while im gone joe suggested you may come across some feller who has seen him  i shall expect to meet all three this afternoon the lawyer said as his clients rose to go  do not talk with any one regarding either case and above all make no promises without first consulting me  joe and fred left the office the former saying when they were out of doors  keep a stiff upper lip lad an if the company gets the best of us remember that farleys isnt the only colliery in the middle field when bill is on his pins again we can pull up stakes an look for another job  i am worrying about sam rather than ourselves it would be terrible if he was convicted of a crime he never committed  better that than to be guilty but we wont look at it in such a bad light yet awhile im off now when its time for me to be back hang around the hotel  then joe started at a brisk pace and with a heavy heart fred walked aimlessly through the town  the idea that by so doing he might learn something regarding skip seem preposterous and he hardly gave it a thought after joe made the suggestion therefore he was startled by hearing a familiar voice crying  hi fred hold on a minute  turning quickly he saw skip coming toward him at full speed and looking as if he had been on a long rough journey  where have you been he asked in surprise  trying to find that feller tim  tim what did you want of him  nothing but i thought you might when things turned out at farleys as they did it seemed to me that by gettin hold of him the truth would come out  have you been at that work all this time  yes  of course you couldnt find him  of course i could an if you want him ill go straight to where hes hiding  fred looked at his friend in astonishment for an instant and he cried  come to the lawyers with me this minute youre the very fellow hes been wanting to see  five minutes later the two were closeted with mr hunter who appeared very well pleased with the news brought by skip  how did you chance to find the boy he asked  it was a good deal like luck fred told about he an gus campin by the river an i snooped up that way a lot of us fellers stayed a week in the same place so it was handy to get around it was two days before i saw any signs of him an then i come mighty nigh tumblin over his camp  how long since you left him  yesterday noon  have you been traveling all this time  pretty much but it dont make any difference if you want to send after him  that is exactly what i want to do and as soon as possible  im ready now and skip started toward the door  i didnt mean quite as soon as this go for something to eat while i make the necessary arrangements come back here when youve had dinner  itll be two or three dinners in one skip muttered as he followed fred down stairs  didnt you take any provisions  some but not enough to last a great while it dont make any difference though so long as i found tim  skip was not so excited but that he could eat a hearty meal and when it was finished the two boys returned to mr hunters office just as that gentleman entered accompanied by a constable  the official questioned skip very minutely as to tims whereabouts and when the boy had explained the situation to the best of his ability the former said  i reckon we wont have to walk all the way by riding up the valley road eight or ten miles it is possible to cut off a good bit of the distance  very well adopt any method which will insure your return tomorrow noon for the trial is to come off at twelve oclock go with him skip and see to it that there is no loitering by the way  are you intending to hire a team fred asked the constable  yes  then ill go with you to the stables  the constable walked rapidly ahead leaving the boys to follow more leisurely and fred had time for a brief conversation  youve been a good friend skip and none of us will ever forget what youve done  i dont want you to remember what happened while i was boss of the regulators  we never think of it now do you believe it is possible to go to the camp and back by noon  itll be a tight squeeze even allowin that we ride a good part of the way but well pull through somehow  then if tim has run off all your work will have been for nothing  it cant be helped if things turn that way but i think hes too much frightened by the disappearance of gus to leave a good hidingplace  at this moment the officer emerged from the stable in an open wagon drawn by a powerfullooking horse and skip shouted as he clambered in  well be back by noon  then the two were whirled rapidly away and fred walked slowly to mr hunters office depressed by a sense of impending evil  the lawyer was absent and not caring to stroll around the town where he might meet acquaintances from farleys the boy remained alone until late in the afternoon when joe and sam arrived  the trial is to come off tomorrow he cried mentioning first that subject which was nearest his heart  and you couldnt find skip joe added mournfully but his face lighted up wonderfully on being told of what had occurred during his absence  well come out of the scrape all right if one of the young scoundrels can be produced so you an sam may as well look cheerful  is there anything new at farleys fred asked  wright is goin around like a bear with a sore head but i didnt hear anything about his servin the warrant on you i reckon neither him nor that blessed cashier fancy havin the trial come off so soon  how is bill  chipper as a chicken your mother has sent some clean clothes an wed better mosey over to the hotel to make ourselves comfortable like  before any objection could be offered to this plan mr hunter entered but he did not delay the partners very long after asking a few questions and jotting down the answers he dismissed them with the caution to be at the office by eleven oclock next morning  during the evening joe tried very hard to appear jolly and perfectly at ease but the boys could not simulate cheerfulness and the hours passed wearily despite their companions efforts  at an early hour fred and sam were on the road down which skip had driven waiting for his return but when the appointed time for them to go to mr hunters office arrived they had watched in vain  now the suspense was positively painful the lawyer exhibited the utmost impatience because the constable did not come while his clients were on the verge of despair  at halfpast eleven when the train from farleys arrived the boys saw mr wright and the cashier pass on their way to the courtroom and a few moments later mr hunter said  we cant wait any longer very likely tim had left his hidingplace when the officer got there and the latter is so foolish as to try to find him i should have warned them that skip must return at all hazards for by sending him away we lose a most important witness  the boys arose to their feet in silence and joe was positively despondent in the face of what seemed very like defeat  on arriving at the court the partners were given seats within the enclosure reserved for attorneys and very near the superintendent but he paid no attention to them  the cashier glared fiercely at sam for an instant and then turned to look steadily in another direction  the court was occupied with another case and in answer to sams question mr hunter said that his trial would not begin until it was finished  if itll hold on till tomorrow sos to give skip a fair chance of gettin here ill be willin to sit in this chair all night joe whispered to fred  it cant be delayed very long or mr hunter would tell us was the mournful reply  spose i slip out an watch for him he wont know where to come if theres nobody in the office  this fred thought was a very good idea and he suggested it to the lawyer who said  the constable knows that he is needed here therefore they will put in an appearance immediately after arriving  five minutes later sam was called upon to plead and he answered firmly  not guilty  then the cashier was summoned to the stand and told his story correctly except as to the latter portion when he said that fred appeared very nervous during the time his friend was absent he also declared that the two boys made mysterious signs to each other and in a variety of ways appeared guilty  the teller of the bank mr wright the constable who made the arrest and one or two others gave evidence and when the prosecution closed matters looked very black for the prisoner  then sam himself was called to the stand and for half an hour underwent a most searching examination he described very minutely the journey to blacktown related every particular connected with his receiving the money and explained why he chose to walk home when by waiting a short time it would have been possible to ride on the cars  that he had the money two or three moments before reaching the newlydiscovered vein he was very positive he had not intended to go to sleep when he laid down to rest on awakening it was several moments before the loss was discovered and then he searched in every direction  over and over again he told what is already known and when the testimony was finished it could be seen from the faces of those around that the story was not generally believed  then fred was called upon to tell of the chase and capture after which joe took the stand  had skip been there the prisoners case would have been strengthened just so much but he yet remained absent and even mr hunter looked disheartened  the miner was kept on the stand as long as possible in the hope the missing one might come and then the defense had been exhausted  unless skip appeared within a few seconds sam would be deprived of his liberty     chapter xxxii  acquitted   if skip had been an actor in a pantomime and rehearsed the scene every day for a week he could not have arrived more precisely than when he made his appearance at the very moment mr hunter was about to declare the defense closed  sam and fred sprang to their feet as he entered the door and joe actually shouted so great was his joy and relief but he was speedily made to understand by the officers that another breach of decorum as flagrant would result in his expulsion from the courtroom  following skip came the constable leading tim who looked frightened and pale mr hunter at once called the prisoner to the witness stand  not knowing that gus had denied having seen the money tim soon said enough to convict himself and in a few moments was ready to confess his share in the matter  i didnt take it he said whiningly gus showed me the money here in town an told as how hed sneaked it out of the pocket of a feller what he found asleep on the mountain he agreed that i could have half if id go off somewhere with him  where is he now mr hunter asked  i dont know when i went for some grub he was watchin fred byram what we caught followin us  what had been done with the money  he had all that was left but ten dollars an i was goin to spend that  what had fred byram done to you  tried to get the stuff sos his chum wouldnt be sent to jail  how did he know you had the bills  thats what puzzles me less gus give himself away to skip miller  have you seen your friend since you left him to go in search of provisions  if i had hed been used up pretty bad for runnin off with the cash after coaxin me to leave town with him  very little more in the way of evidence was needed and in a short time sam was told by the judge that there was nothing to show he was at fault in the matter except so far as being careless in lying down to sleep while having such an amount of money in his pocket  with this slight reprimand he was discharged from custody and tim sent to jail  when the partners were in the street once more joe found it almost impossible to keep his joy within bounds he acted in the most extravagant manner until fred reminded him that the people might think he was intoxicated  well telegraph to bill anyhow he cried and straightway the following message was sent       william thomas farleys pa       skip miller has fixed everything sam is free hurrah for      skip                                            joe  there he said after writing the telegram a task of no mean magnitude for him that puts the credit jest where it belongs i aint sayin the lawyer didnt do his share but hed been snowed under if tim hadnt been brought in the nick of time  skip was radiant with delight as he had every reason to be since now he felt certain his past misdeeds were atoned for and the partners repeated over and over again that they owed him a debt which could never be repaid  mr hunter insisted that the owners of the mine should remain in blacktown until he learned whether sufficient money could be raised with which to defend the suit brought against them but joe was bent on going to the depot for the purpose of witnessing mr wrights departure  i want to see how he an and his precious cashier look after failin in convictin an innocent boy of stealin what never oughter been put in his charge  fred did not care to indulge in such questionable triumph but the miner was so persistent that he could not well refuse and the three stood on the platform when their accusers boarded the cars  neither of the men glanced toward the little group but a bystander who had been present at the trial said loud enough to be heard by both  it looks like pretty poor business for a big corporation to try to send a boy to jail in order that he may be robbed of his property  youre a sensible man joe cried approvingly as he insisted on shaking hands with the stranger an if the time ever comes when me or my mate can do you a good turn well be glad  after this the four walked to the hotel for skip was sadly in need of food and joe said in a tone of satisfaction  im willin to bet considerable that when we get back to farleys well find as how wright has gone somewhere on business an the cashier is takin a vacation bill will show my telegram to everybody what comes in and the whole town will be agin em  if the company wins the suit mr wright wont care very much about what is said for with two mines he will be the boss of this section sam replied i dont bother with anything at farleys jest now the company can run matters to please themselves if they fail to cheat us out of our property  now that one cause for anxiety was removed the partners devoted more time to discussing the question of title and before nightfall had succeeded in making themselves feel decidedly uncomfortable  during the evening mr hunter called with cheering news  among the subscribers i have found four gentlemen of means who will advance the funds necessary for defending the suit provided they are allowed a certain additional amount of stock in case of success the four owners of the property must sign an agreement to that effect and the business is settled  how will that affect our interest fred asked  i think an equitable arrangement would be to give you jointly onehalf the amount of stock issued and with the remainder there will be no difficulty in raising sufficient to open and operate the mine  is that a fair division we know very little about such things  if there had been no trouble your share would be larger but under the circumstances i think the proposition a generous one  then we are satisfied joe replied bring on your documents so we can sign em for i want to get back tomorrow  i will write the agreement and go to farleys with you on the first train money for your personal expenses is to be advanced and here is an installment when it is gone come to me for more  a hundred dollars joe exclaimed as he counted the bills we cant complain but that your subscribers are doing the thing in good style  so they should since a large amount of money is to be made if we are successful with the suit  then mr hunter left the partners and skip who was already looked upon as a member of the new company and they found ample material for conversation until it was time to retire  next morning the party started for farleys in company with the lawyer and one of the gentlemen who proposed to advance the capital  there were only a few people at the depot but from them sam received a most cordial welcome men whom he had never spoken to before congratulated him upon the happy result of the trial and many were the harsh words spoken against the superintendent and cashier  after he ran home to see his mother for a moment the four partners assembled in bills chamber and there the necessary documents were drawn up  i have already applied for a charter mr hunter said when all had signed and it only remains to win the case before opening the mine  youll keep us posted about what is goin on bill asked and the lawyer replied in the affirmative when he and the prospective stockholder took their departure leaving the boys and joe to gratify the invalids curiosity concerning the happenings at blacktown  on this day fred saw chunky for the first time since the discovery of the vein and the breaker boy expressed his satisfaction at the result of the trial  i knowed sam wouldnt steal money he said emphatically but it looked one spell as if theyd prove it on him  if it hadnt been for skip matters never would have been made so plain and even if he was acquitted some folks might have thought him guilty  yes skip did a good job there chunky said reflectively its funny he made such great friends with you fellers after bein so wild to serve you out hes left the regulators too an now i can be captain if i want to  why i thought that foolish business had all been done away with  not much it aint we can get along without skip an not half try  dont have anything to do with such fellows chunky youll only get into trouble and the time is sure to come when like skip youll be sorry for ever having had any connection with them  he didnt run the concern sames im goin to do if i get to be captain chunky replied with a mysterious gesture and then he hurried away in the direction of the breaker  during the week which followed sams acquittal nothing of especial interest occurred bill was getting along as well as could have been expected but both he and his partners were decidedly dejected as to the result of mr wrights claim  as the days passed they grew more despondent until mrs byram insisted that nothing more be said about the suit in the presence of the invalid because his extreme nervousness tended to excite fever  then came the day on which a telegram was received from mr hunter requesting one or more of the partners to call at his office and joe and fred made ready to answer the summons  dont keep me waiting for the news bill said sharply i cant help thinkin wright will spring some kind of a game on us if he thinks theres any chance this scheme might fail  if were wanted on that business you shall hear the minute we know about it joe replied and then he and fred started preferring to walk rather than wait for the train  contrary to braces belief both mr wright and the cashier had remained at farleys after the trial it is possible they heard a few unwelcome truths but as a rule those who were forced to work under them did not dare to speak too plainly  neither joe nor fred had seen the gentlemen since they stepped on board the cars at blacktown but now they were met face to face when the travelers arrived at the outcropping vein  the superintendent nodded carelessly much as he would have done toward a stranger while his companion deliberately turned his back upon the newcomers  joe whistled as he passed on to show how little concern he felt at meeting the two whom he considered enemies but he whispered to fred when they were farther down the mountain  i want to know what them fellers are doin out here it looks as if some crooked work was goin on  they cant run away with the vein fred replied laughingly and i dont see how their being in this vicinity can hurt us  nor i but it wont do any harm to watch em theyre none too honest to play any kind of a mean trick  its too late to turn now for theyd surely know what we were up to  we can keep on a little farther an then double back under cover of the trees  all right i dont suppose it will make much difference if we loaf a bit  joe walked straight ahead until they were within shelter of a line of foliage and then turning sharply to the left circled around the side of the mountain to a point just above the vein where the two men could be plainly seen while the watchers were hidden among the bushes  mr wright and the cashier at first sight appeared to be walking aimlessly to and fro as if calculating the width of the coal mine and now and then the former stooped to pull up a stake which he placed in another position  it looks as if they was figgerin how wide the slope would have to be joe whispered i reckon weve wasted our time sneakin over here  they are moving the stakes driven by the surveyors fred exclaimed after a brief pause  but what good will that do em  i dont know of course the lines can be run again by any one but there must be a scheme in it for mr wright wouldnt be out here unless something could be gained by it  theyve got no right on our land an ill warn them off joe said as he arose excitedly to his feet  dont so much as show yourself well hurry on to see mr hunter hell know what is up  come on then an be quick about it for theres no tellin when these tricks are dangerous  the miner and the boy literally ran down the hill slackening not the pace until forced to do so and both were nearly breathless when they neared the lawyers office  before mr hunter could speak joe told what had been seen and that gentleman grew quite as excited as were the others  i learned yesterday that wright had bought a strip of land near yours regardless of the fact that he claims to own this side of the mountain and has ordered a force of workmen there immediately we now know he is changing the surveyors stakes in order to erect buildings on our tract and thus force us to become plaintiffs instead of defendants  how would that benefit him  in several ways which i have not time to explain wait here until i return  then mr hunter left the office in great haste and fred and joe looked at each other in dismay     chapter xxxiii  victorious   the lawyer did not return for several hours and then he said  i have sent for surveyors and we will run our own lines early tomorrow morning after which an officer shall be stationed there to warn him from encroaching you must be on the spot as early as possible to attend to matters  hell find us when the sun comes up was this why you sent the telegram  i wanted to discover what he meant by the hiring of carpenters and the ordering of lumber but that you have already done  when will the case be tried  next week i think but that is of minor importance just now the supposed location of the purchase is to be pointed out to the surveyors therefore one of you must remain here until they arrive  when do you expect them  on the first train tomorrow  fred can wait for em an ill leave in time to get there by daylight  very well make your preparations to stay until i send word that it is no longer necessary  joe and fred left the office to purchase such provisions as might be needed while holding possession of the disputed property and when this had been done the question arose as to how word could be sent to bill  the story is too long for a telegram fred said so suppose we say by wire that there is nothing particularly new and write a letter  go ahead i aint much of a fist with a pen so while youre tellin the yarn ill send the message  joe retired early in order to be in readiness for the journey and fred was not awake when shortly after midnight he slipped out of the house  it was not an easy matter to find his way in the darkness but he finally succeeded after straying from the right course several times and was thoroughly astonished at finding half a dozen men already in possession  a small amount of lumber was scattered here and there as if placed in readiness to be used and a temporary camp had been erected close beside the coal vein  the men had but just awakened when he arrived and in reply to his angry question of why they were there one of them asked impudently  what business is it of yours  i happen to own a quarter of this land an itll be hot for all hands if theres any attempt at puttin up a building  itll take us about two minutes to clean you out an well do it if you so much as yip again  joe was literally trembling with rage he fancied a portion of his title to the tract would be lost if he did not drive the intruders away and before the spokesman had time to defend himself against an attack the miner knocked him headlong with one welldirected blow then picking up an axe which lay near by he made such a furious onslaught upon the remainder of the party that they scattered in every direction  instead of following he chopped and tore at the camp until it was demolished and then destroyed all the provisions it had contained in addition to pounding into shapeless masses the tin cooking utensils  by this time the carpenters got their scattered forces together and were marching in a body against the man who had put them to flight  in the immediate vicinity of the camp were stored nearly all the tools and standing over these joe shouted  as true as my names brace ill kill the first man who comes here and he brandished the axe above his head  dont be a fool some one cried what can you do against the crowd  split open the head of the first who comes within strikin distance after that has been done you may manage to get the best of me but one is sure to go downwhich shall it be  none of the party cared to prove the truth of joes threat and they fell back a short distance giving him an opportunity to intrench himself behind the fragments of the camp  the miner took care to gather the tools around him so they could not be seized in case a sudden rush was made and then as he afterward said read the riot act to the trespassers  matters were in this condition when fred and the surveyors arrived  the carpenters were seated on the ground a short distance away while joe remained perched on the ruins of the hut calmly smoking his pipe but prepared for any attack however sudden  go back to blacktown and tell the lawyer to send some officers the miner cried these beauties are countin on buildin a house right here ill hold em off till they can be arrested  oh yes you will one of the party shouted wait till the crowd get here from farleys an then well see who runs this place  joe brandished his axe as an intimation of what he was prepared to do and cried to fred who stood in silent astonishment a few paces away  hurry on lad theres no time to be lost  this roused fred to a sense of the necessity for immediate action and he started off at full speed  the surveyors thinking quite naturally that they were not included in the hostilities made ready to perform the work for which they had been engaged but no sooner were the instruments set up than the carpenters made a dash at them crying  if we have to lay still you shall do the same stand back an wait till mr wright comes  stick to your job an if one will help me ill get rid of the whole boiling joe cried as he advanced  look here my friend the elder of the surveying party said in a low tone i understand something about this fight and dont propose to get mixed up in what isnt really any of my business well run the lines if nobody molests us but wont put ourselves out to do it  then i cant count on you  not at all this is too serious business for us to be involved in if you want to buy a good revolver though ill sell one cheap and take my pay when we meet in blacktown  youre a brick joe cried enthusiastically give me the shooter an ill guarantee to pay any price for it  the weapon was delivered and the miner left his fortification marching directly toward the enemy  i give you a fair warnin to clear out he said leveling the revolver this is my land an i order every one to leave these surveyors are here to run the lines for my partners an me the first who interferes with em will get a ball i aint talkin foolish for you know the law will uphold me in defendin my own now begin the job he added to the surveying party an well see who wants to have trouble  this argument was understood by mr wrights adherents and they kept at a respectful distance while the others did their work  new stakes were set up without any regard to those already in position and the labor had but just been completed when the superintendent and two members of his company arrived  why are you not at work he asked one of the carpenters  for reply the man pointed toward joe who was pacing to and fro on what he believed to be the boundary line of his property  get those timbers up mr wright cried angrily  you may drag them off but the first one who dares so much as raise a joist for any other purpose shall suffer joe shouted  knock that fellow down what business has he here and the superintendents voice trembled with suppressed fury  im where i belong an seeins how your men dont dare do the knockin down spose you take a hand at it  mr wright advanced as if to act upon the suggestion but before he reached the imaginary line the miner shouted  if you put a foot on this land ill shoot send your crowd home and then if you want to tackle me ill throw the revolver down an meet you half way  the superintendent paid no attention to this remark save to halt on the safe side of the danger line where he whispered a few words to one of his men and the latter started at full speed for farleys  i reckon my jig is about up joe muttered to himself hes sent for help an theyre bound to bring whatll be of more service than this revolver  the surveyors evidently believing there was no especial reason why they should stay now matters were nearing a crisis took their departure and the miner was once more left alone to defend his rights ten minutes later fred appeared from among the trees followed by five determined looking men and joes cheers were not ended when mr hunter came in view  the lawyer shook hands with the miner as he said  youve saved us what might have been a bad mess now we have a reasonably large force and can hold out until an injunction is procured  are you likely to get one soon  a clerk will bring it in a short time the application has been granted and the only delay is while the papers can be made out  im glad of that for wright has sent after more help an when it comes things are likely to be hot  mr hunter now advanced and held a long conversation with the superintendent and his friends at the conclusion of which he ordered joe to have the lumber dragged from the tract staked out by the surveyors  in this work fred assisted while the miner stood guard with his revolver to prevent any interference and when the task was finished the former whispered to his partner  did they scare you joe  well i dont mind ownin to you that they did but not one in the gang knew it i was bound to stick as long as i could an a big lot of bluff helped me through  mr hunter says that if the injunction can be served on mr wright before the men begin work it will be all right  is that the only thing he knows of to stop matters  it will be enough  id rather trust to my fist than any paper that was ever written  after a time fred succeeded in making the miner understand what kind of a document it was they depended upon to prevent the superintendent from trespassing and the explanation had but just been made as mr hunters clerk arrived with the important document  when this had been served on mr wright the matter was settled temporarily and the lawyer said to fred and joe  you can return home and the next summons will be for the trial this move of wrights has been a foolish one and will i think prejudice his case     chapter xxxiv  the new mine   it is unnecessary to give the details of the long trial to establish the title of that certain tract of land known as louders slope  suffice it to say that all the claimants were there with the exception of bill thomas and the case was finally settled in favor of the defendants  the farmer who sold the property to joe was literally frightened into telling the truth and although the company showed a deed for the land no record could be found for the same  the general opinion of those who understood the case was that mr wright had attempted to play a desperate game and failed because it was impossible to corrupt certain parties in the recorder of deeds office in fact a very ugly rumor gained circulation immediately after the trial to the effect that a large sum of money had been offered a clerk if he would change a number of figures on the books to correspond with the deed which was exhibited in court  when joe fred and sam returned home absolute owners of the valuable tract the walk from the depot to mrs byrams house was a regular ovation  those who rejoiced when it seemed certain the boys would not benefit by the discovery were apparently as well pleased as the partners warmest friends and during the evening following the announcement of the verdict farleys was in a high state of excitement  among the last who called to offer congratulations was skip and he said emphatically as he and fred stood by the side of bills bed  im as glad as if some of the luck was mine you say ive squared accounts an thats enough to make me feel mighty good of course youll have to hire breaker boys an id like a job at the new mine cause it aint likely things herell be very pleasant for me  fred an me have figgered out a place for you lad the old miner replied as he took skips hand in his our mine wont be open for two or three months an durin that time the firm are goin to send you to school when the store is openedfor of course well need oneyoure to go into it an the day skip miller can take hold of the accounts hes goin to have full charge  the excaptain of the regulators looked from one to the other in silence several seconds and then he asked in a hesitating way  you aint makin fun of a feller eh  not a bit of it lad an if you run over to blacktown tomorrow an ask mr hunter hell show that the money has been paid for your schooling  skip did not trust himself to reply but after shaking each of his friends by the hand he hurriedly left the house and chunky who entered a few moments later said to fred  i reckon skip wishes he was you i met him jest now an he was cryin reglar tears an wouldnt stop to listen when i told him the fellers had chose me for captain  nothing was seen of either mr wright or his cashier until nearly two weeks after the case had been ended and then the former called at mrs byrams cottage to offer his congratulations  it is not well that there should be any hard feelings between us since we are to be neighbors he said what i did was in the interests of the company which i represent and any other course would have been impossible  to this remark fred made no reply but he was willing to be on apparently friendly terms with the superintendent which was more than can be said of the elder partners  bill bluntly told mr wright what he thought of his conduct and expressed the hope in very plain words that it would not be necessary for the new firm to have any business relations with the old company  four months later the byramthorpe works were formally opened with bill as mine boss fred and sam as superintendents and joe in charge of the shipments  it must not be understood that the two boys were fully qualified for their responsible positions bill and joe acted as advisers and if one years work is any criterion the quartette have administered the affairs most wisely for in all the middle field there are no better or more contented miners than can be found at the byramthorpe works  in one year skip was pronounced competent to take full charge of the store and today it would be difficult to select a fellow better liked than he on the blacktown side of the mountain every one speaks of him in the most flattering terms and at farleys he is held up to breaker boys as an example of how one may live down a bad reputation  chunky still works under donovan he could not make up his mind to resign from the regulators and today his record is by no means as good as it should be neither fred nor sam cared to take him with them for both knew by bitter experience the aim of his association and did not wish to introduce anything of the kind at the new mine  gus dobson was arrested about a month after sam had been pronounced innocent on running away from mr wrights house he hid in the woods near where tim was found but four weeks of this kind of a life was sufficient  he presented a most deplorable appearance when he returned home one morning his clothes were in tatters the shoes literally hanging from his feet and the pangs of hunger printed on his face imprisonment was a far less severe punishment than starvation and as he said the judge couldnt give him any sentence worse than sneaking around the mountains without food or shelter  the new mine has only been in operation about a year but that is time enough to show that the vein is much richer than the one at farleys instead of being forced to spend money making a shaft or slope coal of good quality has been taken out from the first and already do the original owners consider themselves wealthy it is true the united amount in bank would not be thought large by many but their income is considerably in excess of all necessary expenses and what is better yet perfect content
