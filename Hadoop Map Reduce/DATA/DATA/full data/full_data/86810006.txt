friend in need   a light breeze scented with the smell of the firs was blowing down the inlet and the tiny ripples it chased across the water splashed musically against the bows of the canoe they met her endon sparkling in the warm sunset light gurgled about her sides and trailed away astern in two divergent lines as the paddles flashed and fell there was a thud as the blades struck the water and the long light hull forged onward with slightly lifted birdshead prow while the two men swung forward for the next stroke with a rhythmic grace of motion they knelt facing forward in the bottom of the craft and dissimilar as they were in features and to some extent in character the likeness between them was stronger than the difference both bore the unmistakable stamp of a wholesome life spent in vigorous labor in the open their eyes were clear and like those of most bushmen singularly steady their skin was clean and weatherdarkened and they were leanly muscular  on either side of the lane of green water giant firs cedars and balsams crept down the rocky hills to the whitened driftwood fringe they formed part of the great coniferous forest which rolls west from the wet coast range of canadas pacific province and overleaping the straits spreads across the rugged and beautiful wilderness of vancouver island ahead clusters of little frame houses showed up here and there in openings among the trees and a small sloop toward which the canoe was heading lay anchored near the wharf  the men had plied the paddle during most of that day from inclination rather than necessity for they could have hired siwash indians to undertake the labor for them had they been so minded they were though their appearance did not suggest it moderately prosperous but their prosperity was of recent date they had been accustomed to doing everything for themselves as are most of the men who dwell among the woods and ranges of british columbia  vane who knelt nearest the bow was twentyseven years of age nine of those years he had spent chopping trees driving cattle poling canoes and assisting in the search for useful minerals among the snowclad ranges he wore a wide gray felt hat which had lost its shape from frequent wettings an old shirt of the same color and blue duck trousers rent in places but the light attire revealed a fine muscular symmetry he had brown hair and brown eyes and a certain warmth of coloring which showed through the deep bronze of his skin hinted at a sanguine and somewhat impatient temperament as a matter of fact the man was resolute and usually shrewd but there was a vein of impulsiveness in him and while he possessed considerable powers of endurance he was on occasion troubled by a shortness of temper  his companion carroll had lighter hair and gray eyes and his appearance was a little less vigorous and a little more refined though he too had toiled hard and borne many privations in the wilderness his dress resembled vanes but dilapidated as it was it suggested a greater fastidiousness  the two had located a valuable mineral property some months earlier and though this does not invariably follow had held their own against city financiers during the negotiations that preceded the floating of a company to work the mine that they had succeeded in securing a good deal of the stock was largely due to vanes pertinacity and said something for his acumen but both had been trained in a very hard school  as the wooden houses ahead rose higher and the sloops gray hull grew into sharper shape upon the clear green shining of the brine vane broke into a snatch of song  had i the wings of a dove i would fly just for tonight to the old country  he stopped and laughed  its nine years since ive seen it but i cant get those lines out of my head perhaps its because of the girl who sang them somehow i felt sorry for her she had remarkably fine eyes  seablue suggested his companion i dont grasp the connection between the last two remarks  neither do i admitted vane i suppose there isnt one but they werent seablue unless you mean the depth of indigo when you are out of soundings theyre irish eyes  youre not irish theres not a trace of the celt in you except perhaps your habit of getting indignant with the people who dont share your views  no sir by birth im north countryengland i mean over there were descendants of the saxons scandinavians danesteutonic stock at bottom anyhow and weve inherited their unromantic virtues were solid and cautious respectable before everything and smart at getting hold of anything worth having as a matter of fact you ontario scotsmen are mighty like us  you certainly came out well ahead of those city men who put up the money agreed carroll i guess its in the blood though i fancied once or twice that they would take the mine from you  vane brought his paddle down with a thud  just for tonight to the old country  he hummed and added  it sticks to one  what made you leave the old country i dont think you ever told me  vane laughed  thats a blamed injudicious question to ask anybody as you ought to know but in this particular instance you shall have an answer there was a row at homei was a sentimentalist then and just eighteenand as a result of it i came out to canada his voice changed and grew softer i hadnt many relatives and except one sister theyre all gone now that reminds meshes not going to lecture for the county education authorities any longer  the sloop was close ahead and slackening the paddling they ran alongside vane glanced at his watch when they had climbed on board  supper will be finished at the hotel he remarked you had better get the stove lighted its your turn and that rascally siwash seems to have gone off again if hes not back when were ready well sail without him  supper is served at the hotels in the western settlements as soon as work ceases for the day and the man who arrives after it is over must wait until the next days breakfast is ready carroll accordingly prepared the meal and when they had finished it they lay on deck smoking with a content not altogether accounted for by a satisfied appetite they had spent several anxious months during which they had come very near the end of their slender resources arranging for the exploitation of the mine and now at last the work was over vane had that day made his final plans for the construction of a road and a wharf by which the ore could be economically shipped for reduction or as an alternative to this for the erection of a small smelting plant they had bought the sloop as a convenient means of conveyance and shelter as they could live in some comfort on board and now they could take their ease for a while which was a very unusual thing to both of them  i suppose youre bent on sailing this craft back carroll remarked at length we could hire a couple of siwash to take her home while we rode across the island and got the train to victoria besides theres that steamboat coming down the coast tonight  either way would cost a good deal extra  thats true carroll agreed with an amused expression but you could charge it to the company  vane laughed  you and i have a big stake in the concern and i havent got used to spending money unnecessarily yet ive been mighty glad to earn a couple dollars by working from sunup until dark though i didnt always get it afterward so have you  how are you going to dispose of your money then you have a nice little balance in cash besides the shares  it has occurred to me that i might spend a few months in the old country have you ever been over there  i was across some time ago but if you like ill go along with you we could start as soon as weve arranged the few matters left open in vancouver  vane was glad to hear it he knew little about carrolls antecedents but his companion was obviously a man of education and they had been staunch comrades for the last three years they had plodded through leagues of rainswept bush had forded icy rivers had slept in wet fern and sometimes slushy snow and had toiled together with pick and drill during that time they had learned to know and trust each other and to bear with each others idiosyncrasies  filling his pipe again as he lay in the fading sunlight vane looked back on the nine years he had passed in canada and allowing for the periods of exposure to cold and wet and the almost ceaseless toil he admitted that he might have spent them more unpleasantly he had a stout heart and a muscular body and the physical hardships had not troubled him what was more he had a quick almost instinctive judgment and the faculty for seizing an opportunity  having quarreled with his relatives and declined any favors from them he had come to canada with only a few pounds and had promptly set about earning a living with his hands when he had been in the country several years a friend of the family had however sent him a small sum and the young man had made judicious use of the money the lot he bought outside a wooden town doubled in value and the share he took in a new orchard paid him well but he had held aloof from the cities and his only recklessness had been his prospecting journeys into the wilderness prospecting for minerals is at once an art and a gamble skill acquired by long experience or instinctiveand there are men who seem to possess the lattercounts for much but chance plays a leading part provisions tents and packhorses are expensive and though a placer mine may be worked by two partners a reef or lode can be disposed of only to men with means sufficient to develop it even in this delicate matter in which he had had keen wits against him vane had held his own but there was one side of life with which he was practically unacquainted  there are no social amenities on the rangeside or in the bush where women are scarce vane had lived in spartan simplicity practising the ascetic virtues as a matter of course he had had no time for sentiment his passions had remained unstirred and now he was seven and twenty sound and vigorous of body and as a rule level of head at length however there was to be a change he had earned an interlude of leisure and he meant to enjoy it without so he prudently determined making a fool of himself  presently carroll took his pipe from his mouth  are you going ashore again to the show tonight  yes vane answered its a long while since ive struck an entertainment of any kind and that yellowhaired mites dancing is one of the prettiest things ive seen  youve been twice already carroll hinted the girl with the blue eyes sings her first song rather well  i think so vane agreed with a significant absence of embarrassment in this case a good deal depends on the singingthe interpretation isnt it the things on the border and ive struck places where theyd have made it gross but the girl only brought out the mischief strikes me she didnt see there was anything else in it  thats curious considering the crowd she goes about with arent you cultivating a critical faculty  vane disregarded the ironical question  shes irish that accounts for a good deal  he paused and looked thoughtful  if i knew how to do it id like to give five or ten dollars to the child who dances it must be a tough life and her motherthe woman at the pianolooks ill i wonder whatever brought them to a place like this  struck a cold streak at nanaimo the storekeeper told me anyway since were to start at sunup im staying here then he smiled has it struck you that your attendance in the front seats is liable to misconception  vane rose without answering and dropped into the canoe thrusting her off he drove the light craft toward the wharf with vigorous strokes of the paddle and carroll shook his head whimsically as he watched him  anybody except myself would conclude that hes waking up at last he commented  a minute or two later vane swung himself up onto the wharf and strode into the wooden settlement there were one or two hydraulic mines and a pulp mill in the vicinity and though the place was by no means populous a company of thirdrate entertainers had arrived there a few days earlier on reaching the rude wooden building in which they had given their performance and finding it closed he accosted a lounger  whats become of the show he asked  busted didnt take the boys fancy the crowd went out with the stage this afternoon though i heard that two of the women stayed behind somebody said the hotelkeeper had trouble about his bill  vane turned away with a slight sense of compassion more than once during his first year or two in canada he had limped footsore and weary into a wooden town where nobody seemed willing to employ him an experience of the kind was unpleasant to a vigorous man but he reflected that it must be much more so in the case of a woman who probably had nothing to fall back upon however he dismissed the matter from his mind having been kneeling in a cramped position in the canoe most of the day he decided to stroll along the waterside before going back to the sloop  great firs stretched out their somber branches over the smooth shingle and now that the sun had gone their clean resinous smell was heavy in the dewcooled air here and there brushwood grew among outcropping rock and mossgrown logs lay fallen among the brambles  catching sight of what looked like a strip of woven fabric beneath a brake vane strode toward it then he stopped with a start for a young girl lay with her face hidden from him in an attitude of dejected abandonment he was about to turn away softly when she started and looked up at him her long dark lashes glistened and her eyes were wet but they were of the deep blue he had described to carroll and he stood still  you really shouldnt give way like that he said  it was all he could think of but he spoke without obtrusive assurance or pronounced embarrassment and the girl shaking out her crumpled skirt over one little foot with a swift sinuous movement choked back a sob and favored him with a glance of keen scrutiny as she rose to a sitting posture she was quick at reading characterthe life she led had made that necessaryand his manner and appearance were reassuring he was on the whole a wellfavored mangoodlooking seemed the best word for itthough what impressed her most was his expression it indicated that he regarded her with some pity not as an attractive young woman which she knew she was but merely as a human being the girl however said nothing and sitting down on a neighboring boulder vane took out his pipe from force of habit  well he added in much the same tone he would have used to a distressed child whats the trouble  she told him speaking on impulse  theyve gone off and left me the takings didnt meet expenses there was no treasury  thats bad responded vane gravely do you mean theyve left you alone  no its worse than that i suppose i could gosomewherebut theres mrs marvin and elsie  the child who dances  the girl assented and vane looked thoughtful he had already noticed that mrs marvin whom he supposed to be the childs mother was worn and frail and he did not think there was anything she could turn her hand to in a vigorous mining community the same applied to his companion though he was not greatly astonished that she had taken him into her confidence the reserve that characterizes the insular english is less common in the west where the stranger is more readily taken on trust  the three of you stick together he suggested  of course mrs marvins the only friend i have  then i suppose youve no idea what to do  no she confessed and then explained not very clearly that it was the cause of her distress and that they had had bad luck of late vane could understand that as he looked at her her dress was shabby and he fancied that she had not been bountifully fed  if you stayed here a few days you could go out with the next stage and take the train to victoria he paused and continued diffidently it could be arranged with the hotelkeeper  she laughed in a halfhysterical manner and he remembered what she had said about the treasury and that fares are high in that country  i suppose you have no money he added with blunt directness i want you to tell mrs marvin that ill lend her enough to take you all to victoria  her face crimsoned he had not quite expected that and he suddenly felt embarrassed it was a relief when she broke the brief silence  no she replied i cant do that for one thing it would be too late when we got to victoria i think we could get an engagement if we reached vancouver in time to get to kamloops by  vane knit his brows when he heard the date and it was a moment or two before he spoke  theres only one way you can do it theres a little steamboat coming down the coast tonight i had half thought of intercepting her anyway and handing the skipper some letters to post in victoria he knows meim likely to have dealings with his employers thats my sloop yonder and if i put you on board the steamer youd reach vancouver in good time we should have sailed at sunup anyhow  the girl hesitated and turned partly from him he surmised that she did not know what to make of his offer though her need was urgent in the meanwhile he stood up  come along and talk it over with mrs marvin he urged id better tell you that im wallace vane of the clermont mine of course i know your name from the program  she rose and they walked back to the hotel once more it struck him that the girl was pretty and graceful though he had already deduced from several things that she had not been regularly trained as a singer nor well educated on reaching the hotel he sat down on the veranda while she went in and a few minutes later mrs marvin came out and looked at him much as the girl had done he grew hot under her gaze and repeated his offer in the curtest terms  if this breeze holds well put you on board the steamer soon after daybreak he explained  the womans face softened and he recognized now that there had been strong suspicion in it  thank you she said simply well come  there was a moments silence and then she added with an eloquent gesture  you dont know what it means to us  vane merely took off his hat and turned away but a minute or two later he met the hotelkeeper  do these people owe you anything he asked  five dollars they paid up part of the time i was wondering what to do with them guess theyve no money they didnt come in to supper though we would have stood them that made me think they were straight folks the other kind wouldnt have been bashful  vane handed him a bill  take it out of this and make any excuse you like im going to put them on board the steamboat  the man made no comment and vane striding down to the beach sent a hail ringing across the water carroll appeared on the sloops deck and answered him  hallo he cried whats the trouble  get ready the best supper you can manage for three people as quick as you can  supper for three people  vane caught the astonished exclamation and came near losing his temper  for three people he shouted dont ask any fool questions youll see later on  then he turned away in a hurry wondering somewhat uneasily what carroll would say when he grasped the situation     chapter ii  a breeze of wind   there were signs of a change in the weather when vane walked down to the wharf with his passengers for a cold wind which had sprung up struck an eerie sighing from the somber firs and sent the white mists streaming along the hillside there was a watery moon in the sky and when they reached the waters edge vane fancied that the singer hesitated but mrs marvin laid her hand on the girls arm reassuringly and she got into the canoe a few minutes later vane ran the craft alongside the sloop and saw the amazement in carrolls face by the glow from the cabin skylight he fancied however that his comrade would rise to the occasion and he helped his guests up  my partner carroll mrs marvin and her daughter miss kitty blake you have seen them already theyre coming down with us to catch the steamer  carroll bowed and vane thrust back the cabin slide and motioned the others below the place was brightly lighted by a nickeled lamp though it was scarcely four feet high and the centerboard trunk occupied the middle of it a wide cushioned locker ran along either side a foot above the floor and a swingtable fixed above the trunk filled up most of the space between there was no cloth on the table but it was invitingly laid out with canned fruit coffee hot flapjacks and a big lake trout for in the western bush most men can cook  you must help yourselves while we get sail upon the boat said vane cheerily the saloons at your disposalmy partner and i have the forecastle you will notice that there are blankets yonder and as well have smooth water most of the way you should get some sleep perhaps youd better keep the stove burning and if you should like some coffee in the early morning youll find it in the top locker  he withdrew closing the slide and went forward with carroll to shorten in the cable but when they stopped beside the bitts his companion broke into a laugh  is there anything amusing you vane asked curtly  well drawled carroll this country of course isnt england but for all that its desirable that a man who expects to make his mark in it should exercise a certain amount of caution it strikes me that youre making a rather unconventional use of your new prosperity and it might be prudent to consider how some of your friends in vancouver may regard the adventure  vane sat down upon the bitts and took out his pipe  one trouble in talking to you is that i never know whether youre in earnest or not you trot out your coldblooded worldly wisdomi suppose it is wisdomand then you grin at it  it seems to me thats the only philosophic attitude carroll replied its possible to grow furiously indignant with the restraints stereotyped people lay on one but on the whole its wiser to bow to them and chuckle after all theyve some foundation  vane looked up at him sharply  youve been right in the advice you have given me more than once you seem to know how prosperous and what you call stereotyped people look at things but youve never explained where you acquired the knowledge  oh thats quite another matter laughed carroll  anyway theres one remark of yours id like to answer you would no doubt consider that i made a legitimate use of my money when i entertained that crowd of city peoplesome of whom would have plundered me if they could have managed itin vancouver i didnt grudge it of course but i was a little astonished when i saw the wine and cigar bill it struck me that the best of them scarcely noticed what they goti think theyd been up against it at one time as we have and it would have done the rest of the guzzlers good if theyd had to work with the shovel all day on pork and flapjacks but well let that go what have you and i done that we should swill in champagne while a girl with a face like that one below and a child who dances like a fairy havent enough to eat you know what i paid for the last cigars what confounded hogs we are  carroll laughed outright there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon his comrade who was hardened and toughened by determined labor with rare exceptions which included the occasions when he had entertained or had been entertained in vancouver his greatest indulgence had been a draught of strong green tea from a blackened pannikin though he had at times drunk nothing but river water the term hog appeared singularly inappropriate as applied to him  well replied carroll youll no doubt get used to the new conditions by and by and in regard to your latest exploit theres a motto on your insignia of the garter which might meet the case but hadnt we better heave her over her anchor  they seized the chain and a sharp musical rattle rang out as it ran below for the hollow hull flung back the metallic clinking like a soundingboard when the cable was shortup they grasped the halyards and the big gaffmainsail rose flapping up the mast they set it and turned to the headsails for though strictly speaking a sloop carries only one the term is loosely applied in places and as vane had changed her rig there were two of them to be hoisted  its a fair wind and i dare say well find more weight in it lower down commented carroll well let the staysail lie and run her with the jib  when they set the jib and broke out the anchor vane took the helm and the sloop slanting over until her deck on one side dipped close to the frothing brine drove away into the darkness the lights of the settlement faded among the trees and the black hills and the climbing firs on either side slipped by streaked by sliding vapors a crisp splashing sound made by the curling ripples followed the vessel the canoe surged along noisily astern and the frothing and gurgling grew louder at the bows they were running down one of the deep forestshrouded inlets which resembling the norwegian fiords pierce the pacific littoral of canada though there are no scandinavian pines to compare with the tremendous conifers which fill all the valleys and climb high to the snowline in that wild and rugged land  there was no sound from the cabin and vane decided that his guests had gone to sleep the sloop was driving along steadily with neither lift nor roll but when increasing her speed she piled the foam up on her lee side and the canoe rode on a great white wave he glanced toward his companion  i wonder how the wind is outside he questioned  carroll looked around and saw the white mists stream athwart the pines on a promontory they were skirting  thats more than i can tell in these troughs among the hills it either blows straight up or directly down and i dare say well find it different when we reach the sound one things certaintheres some weight in it now  vane nodded agreement though an idea that troubled him crept into his mind  i understand that the steamboat skipper will run in to land some siwash hes bringing down it will be awkward in the dark if the winds onshore  carroll made no comment and they drove on as they swept around the point the sloop slanting sharply dipped her lee rail in the froth ahead of them the inlet was flecked with white and the wail of the swaying firs came off from the shadowy beach and mingled with the gurgling of the water  well have to tie down a reef and get the canoe on board suggested carroll  here take the tiller a minute  scrambling forward vane rapped on the cabin slide and then flung it back mrs marvin lay upon the leeward locker with a blanket thrown over her and with the little girl at her feet miss blake sat on the weather side with a book in her hand  were going to take some sail off the boat he explained you neednt be disturbed by the noise  when do you expect to meet the steamer miss blake inquired  not for two or three hours anyway  vane fancied that the girl noticed the hint of uncertainty in his voice and he banged the slide to as he disappeared  down helm he shouted to carroll  there was a banging and thrashing of canvas as the sloop came up into the wind they held her there with the jib aback while they hauled the canoe on board which was not an easy task and then with difficulty they hove down a reef in the mainsail it was heavy work because there was nobody at the helm and the craft falling off once or twice while they leaned out upon the boom with toes on her depressed lee rail threatened to hurl them into the frothing water neither of them was a trained sailor but on that coast with its inlets and sounds and rivers the wanderer learns readily to handle sail and paddle and canoepole  they finished their task and when vane seized the helm carroll sat down under the shelter of the coaming out of the flying spray  well probably have some trouble putting your friends on board the steamer even if she runs in he remarked what are you going to do if theres no sign of her  its a question ive been shirking for the last halfhour vane confessed  it would be very slow work beating back up this inlet and even if we did so there isnt a stage across the island for several days no doubt you remember that you have to see that contractor on thursday and theres the directors meeting too  its uncommonly awkward vane answered dubiously  carroll laughed  it strikes me that your guests will have to stay where they are whether they like it or not but theres one consolationif this wind is from the northwest which is most likely it will be a fast run to victoria guess ill try to get some sleep  he disappeared down a scuttle forward leaving vane somewhat disturbed in mind he had contemplated taking his guests for merely a few hours run but to have them on board for perhaps several days was a very different thing besides he was far from sure that they would understand the necessity for keeping them and in that case the situation might become difficult in the meanwhile the sloop drove on until at last toward morning the beach fell back on either hand and she met the long swell tumbling in from the pacific the wind was from the northwest and blowing moderately hard there was no light as yet in the sky above the black heights to the east and the onrushing swell grew higher and steeper breaking white here and there the sloop plunged over it wildly hurling the spray aloft and it cost vane a determined effort to haul in his sheets as the wind drew ahead shortly afterward the beach faded altogether on one hand and the sea piled up madly into foaming ridges it seemed most improbable that the steamer would run in to land her indian passengers but vane drove the sloop on with showers of stinging brine beating into her wet canvas and whirling about him  as the pacific opened up he found it necessary to watch the seas that came charging down upon her they were long and high and most of them were ridged with seething foam with a quick pull on the tiller he edged her over them and a cascade swept her forward as she plunged across their crests though there were driving clouds above him it was not very dark and he could see for some distance the long ranks of tumbling combers did not look encouraging and when the plunges grew sharper and the brine began to splash across the coaming that protected the well he wished that they had hauled down a second reef he could not shorten sail unassisted however nor could he leave the helm to summon carroll who was evidently sleeping soundly in the forecastle without rousing his passengers which he did not desire to do  a little while later he noticed that a stream of smoke was pouring from the short funnel of the stove and soon afterward the cabin slide opened miss blake crept out and stood in the well gazing forward while she clutched the coaming  day was now breaking and vane could see that the girls thin dress was blown flat against her there was something graceful in her pose and it struck him again that her figure was daintily slender she wore no hat and it was evident that the wild plunging had no effect on her he waited uneasily until she turned and faced him  we are going out to sea she said wheres the steamer  it was a question vane had dreaded but he answered it honestly  i cant tell you its very likely that she has gone straight on to victoria  he saw the suspicion in her suddenly hardening face but the quick anger in it pleased him he had not expected her to be prudish but it was clear that the situation did not appeal to her  you expected this when you asked us to come on board she cried  no vane replied quietly on my honor i did nothing of the kind there was only a moderate breeze when we left and when it freshened enough to make it unlikely that the steamer would run in i was as vexed as you seem to be as it happened i couldnt go back i must get on to victoria as soon as possible  she looked at him searchingly but he fancied that she was slightly comforted  cant you put us ashore  it might be possible if i could find a sheltered beach farther on but it wouldnt be wise you would find yourselves twenty or thirty miles from the nearest settlement and you could never walk so far through the bush  then what are we to do  there was distress in the cry and vane answered it in his most matteroffact tone  so far as i can see you can only reconcile yourselves to staying on board well have a fresh fair wind for victoria once were round the next head and with moderate luck we ought to get there late tonight  youre sure  vane felt sorry for her  im afraid i cant even promise that it depends upon the weather he replied but you mustnt stand there in the spray youre getting wet through  she still clung to the coaming but he fancied that her misgivings were vanishing and he spoke again  how are mrs marvin and the little girl i see you have lighted the stove  the girl sat down shivering in the partial shelter of the coaming and at last a gleam of amusement which he felt was partly compassionate shone in her eyes  im afraid theyrenot well that was why i kept the stove burning i wanted to make them some tea there is some in the lockeri thought you wouldnt mind  everythings at your service as i told you you must make the best breakfast you can the nicest things are at the back of the locker  she stood up looking around again the light was growing and the crests of the combers gleamed a livid white their steep breasts were losing their grayness and changing to dusky blue and slatey green but their blurred coloring was atoned for by their grandeur of form they came on ridge on ridge in regularly ordered tumbling phalanxes  its glorious she exclaimed to his astonishment arent you carrying a good deal of sail  well ease the peak down when we bring the wind farther aft in the meanwhile youd better get your breakfast and if you come out again put on one of the coats youll find below  she disappeared and vane felt relieved though the explanation had proved less difficult than he had anticipated he was glad that it was over and the way in which she had changed the subject implied that she was satisfied with it half an hour later she appeared again carrying a loaded tray and he wondered at the ease of her movements for the sloop was plunging viciously  ive brought you some breakfast you have been up all night  vane laughed  as i can take only one hand from the helm you will have to cut up the bread and canned stuff for me draw out that box and sit down beneath the coaming if you mean to stay  she did as he told her the well was about four feet long and the bottom of it about half that distance below the level of the deck as a result of this she sat close at his feet while he balanced himself on the coaming gripping the tiller he noticed that she had brought out an oilskin jacket with her  hadnt you better put this on first theres a good deal of spray she said  vane struggled into the jacket with some difficulty and she smiled as she handed him up a slice of bread and canned meat  i suppose you can manage only one piece at a time she laughed  thank you thats about as much as you could expect one to be capable of even allowing for the bushmans appetite im a little surprised to see you looking so fresh  oh i used to go out with the mackerel boats at homewe lived at the ferry it was a mile across the lough and with the wind westerly the sea worked in  the lough i told carroll that you were from the green isle  it struck him that this was perhaps imprudent as it implied that they had been discussing her but on the other hand he fancied that the candor of the statement was in his favor  have you been long out here he added  the girls face grew wistful  four years i came out with larryhes my brother he was a forester at home and he took small contracts for clearing land then he marriedand i left him  vane made a sign of comprehension  i see wheres larry now  he went to oregon there was no answer to my last letter ive lost sight of him  and you go about with mrs marvin is her husband living  sudden anger flared up in the girls blue eyes though he knew that it was not directed against him  yes its a pity he is men of his kind always seem to live  it occurred to vane that miss blake who evidently had a spice of temper could be a staunch partizan and he also noticed that now that he had inspired her with some degree of trust in himself her conversation was marked by an ingenuous candor  another piece or some tea she asked  tea first please  they both laughed when she handed him a second slice of bread  these sandwiches strike me as unusually nice he informed her its exceptionally good tea too i dont remember ever getting anything to equal them at a hotel  the blue eyes gleamed with amusement  you have been in the cold all nightbut i was once in a restaurant she watched the effect of this statement on him you know i really cant singi was never taught anywaythough there were some of the settlements where we did rather well  vane hummed a few bars of a song  i dont suppose you realize what one ballad of yours has done id almost forgotten the old country but the night i heard you i felt i must go back and see it again whats more carroll and i are going shortlyits your doing  this was a matter of fact but kitty blake had produced a deeper effect on him although he was not yet aware of it  its a shame to keep you handing me things to eat he added disconnectedly still id like another piece  she smiled delightfully as she passed the food to him  you cant help yourself and steer the boat besidesafter the restauranti dont mind waiting on you  vane made no comment but he watched her with satisfaction while he ate there was no sign of the others they were alone on the waste of tumbling water in the early dawn the girl was pretty and there was a pleasing daintiness about her what was more she was a guest of his dependent for her safety upon his skill with the tiller so far as he could remember it was a year or two since he had breakfasted in a womans company it was certain that no woman had waited on him so prettily then as he remembered many a lonely camp in the dark pine forest or high on the bare rangeside it occurred to him for the first time that he had missed a good deal of what life had to offer he wondered what it would have been like if when he had dragged himself back to his tent at night worn with heavy toil as he had often done there had been somebody with blue eyes and a delightful smile to welcome him  kitty blake belonged to the peoplethere was no doubt of that but then he had a strong faith in the people nativeborn and adopted of the pacific slope it was from them that he had received the greatest kindnesses he could remember they were cheerful optimists indomitable grapplers with forest and flood who did almost incredible things with ax and saw and giantpowder they lived in lonely ranch houses tents and rudely flungup shacks driving the new roads along the rangeside or risking life and limb in wildcat adits they were quick to laughter and reckless in hospitality  then with an effort he brushed the hazy thoughts away kitty blake was merely a guest of his in another day he would land her in victoria and that would be the end of it he was assuring himself of this when carroll crawled up through the scuttle forward and came aft to join them in spite of his prudent reflections vane was by no means certain that he was pleased to see him     chapter iii  an afternoon ashore   half the day had slipped by the breeze freshened further and the sun broke through the sloop was then rolling wildly as she drove along with the peak of her mainsail lowered down before a big following sea the combers came up behind her foaming and glistening blue and green with seamy white streaks on their hollow breasts and broke about her with a roar then they surged ahead while she sank down into the hollow with sluicing deck and tilted stern vanes face was intent as he gripped the helm three or four miles away a head ran out from the beach he was following and he would have to haul the boat up to windward to get around it this would bring the combers upon her quarter or worse still abeam kitty blake was below and mrs marvin had made no appearance yet vane looked at carroll who was standing in the well  the seas breaking more sharply and wed get uncommonly wet before we hammered round yonder head theres an inlet on this side of it where we ought to find good shelter  the trouble is that if you stay there long youll be too late for the directors meeting besides im under the impression that ive seen you run an open seacanoe before as hard a breeze as this  they cant have the meeting without me and if its necessary they can wait vane answered impatiently ive had to many an hour ive spent cooling my heels in corridors and outer offices before the head of the concern could find time to attend to me no doubt it was part of the game done to impress me with a due sense of my unimportance  its possible carroll laughed  besides you can drive one of those big siwash craft as hard as you can this sloop that is so long as you keep the sea astern of her  yes i dare say you can after all you hadnt any passengers on the occasion i was referring to i suppose you feel you have to consider them  vane colored slightly  naturally id prefer not to land mrs marvin and the child in a helpless condition and i understand theyre feeling the motion pretty badly  kitty blake made her appearance in the cabin entrance and vane smiled at her  were going to give you a rest he announced theres an inlet close ahead where we should find smooth water and well put you all ashore for a few hours until the wind drops  there was no suspicion in the girls face now she gave him a grateful glance before she disappeared below with the consoling news  a quarter of an hour later vane closed with the beach and a break in the hillside which was dotted with windstunted pines opened up while the two men struggled with the mainsheet the big boom and the sail above it lurched madly over the sloop rolled down until half her deck on one side was in the sea but she hove herself up again and shot forward wet and gleaming into a space of smooth green water behind a head soon afterward vane luffed into a tiny bay where she rode upright in the sunshine with loose canvas flapping softly in a faint breeze while the cable rattled down they got the canoe over and when they had helped mrs marvin and her little girl both of whom looked very wobegone and the worse for the voyage into her vane glanced around  isnt miss blake coming he asked  shes changing her dress explained mrs marvin with a smile she glanced at her own crumpled attire as she added im past thinking of such things as that  they waited some minutes and then kitty appeared in the entrance to the cabin vane called to her  wont you look in the locker and bring along anything you think would be nice well make a fire and have supper on the beachif it isnt firstrate youll be responsible  a few minutes later they paddled ashore and vane landed them on a strip of shingle beyond it a wall of rock arose with dark firs clinging in the rifts and crannies the sunshine streamed into the hollow the wind was cut off and not far away a crystal stream came splashing down a ravine  theres a creek at the top of the inlet vane told them as he and carroll thrust out the canoe and were going to look for a trout you can stroll about or rest in the sun for a couple of hours and if the wind drops after supper well make a start again  they paddled away with a fishingrod and a gun in the canoe and it was toward six oclock in the evening when they came back with a few trout vane made a fire of resinous wood and carroll and kitty prepared a bountiful supper when it was finished carroll carried the plates away to the stream mrs marvin and the little girl followed him and vane and kitty were left beside the fire she sat on a log of driftwood and he lay on the warm shingle with his pipe in his hand the clear green water splashed and tinkled upon the pebbles close at his feet and a faint elfin sighing fell from the firs above them it was very old music the song of the primeval wilderness and though he had heard it often it had a strange unsettling effect on him as he languidly watched his companion there was no doubt that she was pleasant to look upon but although he did not clearly recognize this it was to a large extent an impersonal interest that he took in her she was not so much an attractive young woman with qualities that pleased him as a type of something that had so far not come into his life something which he vaguely felt that he had missed one could have fancied that by some deepsunk intuition she recognized this fact and felt the security of it  so you believe you can get an engagement if you reach vancouver in time he asked at length  yes  how long will it last  i cant tell perhaps a week or two it depends upon how the boys are pleased with the show  vane frowned he felt very compassionate toward her and toward all friendless women compelled to wander here and there as she was forced to do it seemed intolerable that she should depend for daily bread upon the manner in which a crowd of rude miners and choppers received her song though there was as he knew a vein of primitive chivalry in most of them  suppose it only lasts a fortnight what will you do then  i dont know said kitty simply  it must be a hard life vane broke out you must make very littlescarcely enough i suppose to carry you on from one engagement to another after all werent you as well off at the restaurant didnt they treat you properly  she colored a little at the question  oh yes at least i had no fault to find with the man who kept it or with his wife  vane made a hasty sign of comprehension he supposed that the difficulty had arisen from the conduct of one or more of the regular customers he felt that he would very much like to meet the man whose undesired attentions had driven his companion from her occupation  did you never try to learn keeping accounts or typewriting he asked  i tried it once i could manage the figures but the mill shut down  vane made his next suggestion casually though he was troubled by an inward diffidence  ive an idea that i could find you a post it looks as if im going to be a person of some little influence in the future whichhe laughedis a very new thing to me  he saw a tinge of warmer color creep into the girls cheeks she had as he had already noticed a beautifully clear skin  no she said decidedly it wouldnt do  vane knit his brows though he fancied that she was right  well he replied i dont want to be officiousbut how can i help  you cant help at all  vane saw that she meant it and he broke out with quick impatience  ive spent nine years in this country in the hardest kind of work but all the while i fancied that money meant power that if i ever got enough of it i could do what i liked now i find that i cant do the first simple thing that would please me what a cramped hidebound world it is  kitty smiled in a curious manner  yes its a very cramped world to some of us but complaining wont do any good she paused with a faint sigh dont spoil this evening you and mr carroll have been very kind its so quiet and calm herethough it was pleasant on board the yachtand soon well have to go to work again  vane once more was stirred by a sense of pity which almost drove him to rash and impulsive speech but her manner restrained him  then you must be fond of the sea he suggested  i love it i was born beside itwhere the big green hills drop to the head of the water and you can hear the atlantic rumble on the rocks all night long  ah exclaimed vane dont you long for another sight of it now and then  the girl smiled in a way that troubled him  im wearying for it always and some day perhaps ill win back for another glimpse at the old place  you wouldnt go to stay  that would be impossible what would i do yonder after this other life once you leave the old land you can never quite get back again  vane lay smoking in silence for a minute or two on another occasion he had felt the thrill of the exiles longing that spoke through the girls song and now he recognized the truth of what she said one changed in the west acquiring a new outlook which diverged more and more from that held by those at home only a wistful tenderness for the motherland remained still alien in thought and feeling as he had become he was going back there for a time and she as she had said must resume her work a feeling of anger at his impotence to alter this came upon him  then carroll came up with mrs marvin and elsie and he felt strongly stirred when the little girl walked up to him shyly with a basket filled with shells and bright fircones he drew her down beside him with an arm about her waist while he examined her treasures glancing up he met kittys eyes and felt his face grow hot with an emotion he failed to analyze the little mite was frail and delicate life he surmised had scanty pleasure to offer her but now she was happy  theyre so pretty and there are such lots of them she exclaimed cant we stay here just a little longer and gather some more  yes answered vane conscious that carroll who had heard the question was watching him you shall stay and get as many as you want im afraid you dont like the sloop  no i dont like it when it jumps after i woke up it jumped all the time  never mind little girl the boat will keep still tonight and i dont think therell be any waves to roll her about tomorrow well have you ashore the first thing in the morning  he talked to her for a few minutes and then strolled along the beach with carroll until they could look out upon the pacific the breeze was falling though the sea still ran high  why did you promise that child to stay here carroll asked  because i felt like doing so  i neednt remind you that youve an appointment with horsfield about the smelter and theres a meeting of the board next day if we started now and caught the first steamer across you wouldnt have much time to spare  thats correct i shall have to wire from victoria that ive been detained  carroll laughed expressively  do you mean to put off the meeting and keep your directors waiting to please a child  i suppose thats one reason anyway i dont propose to hustle the little girl and her mother on board the steamer while theyre helpless with seasickness a gleam of humor crept into his eyes as i think i told you ive no great objections to letting the gentlemen you mentioned await my pleasure  but they found you the shareholders and set the concern on its feet  just so on the other hand they got excellent value for their servicesand i found the mine whats more during the preliminary negotiations most of them treated me very casually  well  theres going to be a difference now ive a board of directorsone way or another ive had to pay for the privilege pretty dearly but its not my intention that they should run the clermont mine  carroll glanced at him with open amusement there had been a marked change in vane since he had located the mine though it was one that did not astonish his comrade carroll had long suspected him of latent capabilities which had suddenly sprung to life  you ought to see horsfield before you meet the board he advised him  im not sure vane answered in fact im uncertain whether ill give horsfield the contract even if we decide about the smelter he was offensively patronizing once upon a time and tried to bluff me besides he has already a stake in the concern i dont want a man with too firm a holdup against me  but if he put his money in partly with the idea of getting certain pickings  he didnt explain his intentions and i made no promises hell get his dividends or he can sell his stock at a premium and that ought to satisfy him  if you submitted the whole case to a business man hed probably tell you that you were going to make a hash of things  thats your own idea  carroll grinned  oh ill reserve my opinion its possible you may be right time will show  they rejoined the others and when the white mists crept lower down from the heights above and the chill of the dew was in the air vane launched the canoe  its getting late and theres a long run in front of us tomorrow he informed his passengers the sloop will lie as still as if moored in a pond and youll have her all to yourselves carroll and i are going to camp ashore  he paddled them off to the boat coming back with some blankets he cut a few armfuls of spruce twigs in a ravine and spread them out beside the fire then sitting down just clear of the scented smoke he lighted his pipe and asked an abrupt question  what do you think of kitty blake  shes attractive in person and manners  anybody could see that at a glance  well carroll added cautiously i must confess that ive taken some interest in the girlpartly because you were obviously doing so in a general way what i noticed rather surprised me it wasnt what i expected  you smart folks are as often wrong as the rest of us i suppose you looked for coldblooded assurance tempered by what one might call experienced coquetry  something of the kind carroll agreed as you say i was wrong there are only two ways of explaining miss blake and the firsts the one that would strike most people that is shes acting a part possibly with an object holding her natural self in check and doing it cleverly  vane laughed scornfully  ive lived in the woods for nine years but i wouldnt have entertained that idea for five seconds  then theres the other explanation its simply that the girls life hasnt affected her somehow she has kept fresh and wholesome i think thats the correct view  theres no doubt of it declared vane  you offered to help her in some way  i did i dont know how you guessed it i said id find her a situation she wouldnt hear of it  she was wise vancouver isnt a very big place yet and the girl has more sense than you have what did you say  im afraid i lost my temper because there was nothing i could do  carroll grinned  there are limitationseven to the power of the dollar youll probably run up against more of them later on  i suppose so yawned vane well im going to sleep  he rolled himself up in his blanket and lay down among the soft spruce twigs but carroll sat still in the darkness and smoked out his pipe then he glanced at his comrade who lay still breathing evenly  no doubt youd be considered fortunate he said apostrophizing him half aloud youve had power and responsibility thrust upon you what will you make of it  then he too lay down and only the soft splash of the tiny ripples broke the silence while the fire sank lower  they sailed the next morning and when they arrived in victoria the boat which crossed the straits had gone but the breeze was fair from the westward and after despatching a telegram vane sailed again the sloop made a quick passage and most of the time her passengers lounged in the sunshine on her gently slanted deck it was evening when they ran through the narrows into vancouvers landlocked harbor and saw the roofs of the city rise tier on tier from the waterfront somber forest crept down to the skirts of it and across the glistening water black hills ran up into the evening sky with the blink of towering snow to the north of them  half an hour later vane landed his passengers and it was not until he had left them that they discovered he had thrust a roll of paper currency into the little girls hand then he and carroll set off for the cpr hotel although they were not accustomed to a hostelry of that sort     chapter iv  a change of environment   on the evening after his arrival in vancouver vane paid a visit to one of his directors and in accordance with the invitation he and carroll reached the latters dwelling some little time before the arrival of several other guests whose acquaintance it was considered advisable he should make in the business parts of most western cities iron and stone have now replaced the native lumber but on their outskirts wood is still employed with admirable effect as a building material and nairns house was an example of the judicious use of the latter it stood on a rise above the inlet picturesque in outline with its artistic scrollwork its wooden pillars its lattice shutters and its balustraded verandas virgin forest crept up close about it and there was no fence to the sweep of garden which divided it from the road  vane and his companion were ushered into a small room with an uncovered floor and simple hardwood furniture it was obviously a working room for as a rule the work of the western business man goes on continuously except when he is asleep but a somewhat portly lady with a goodhumored face reclined in a rocking chair a gaunt elderly man of rugged appearance rose from his seat at a writingtable as his guests entered  so ye have come at last he said i had ye shown in here because this room is mine and i can smoke when i like the rest of the house is mrs nairns and it seems that her friends do not appreciate the smell of my cigars im no sure that i can blame them  mrs nairn smiled placidly  alic she explained leaves them lying everywhere and i do not like the stubs of them on the stairs but sit ye down and he will give ye one  vane felt at home with both of them he had met people of their kind before and allowing for certain idiosyncrasies considered them the salt of the dominion nairn had done good service to his adopted country developing her industrieswith some profit to himself for he was of scottish extraction but while close at a bargain he could be generous afterward in the beginning he had fought sternly for his own hand and it was supposed that mrs nairn had helped him not only by sound advice but by such practical economies as the making of his working clothes those he wore on the evening in question did not fit him well though they were no longer the work of her capable fingers when his guests were seated he laid two cigar boxes on the table  those he said pointing to one of them are mine i think ye had better try the others theyre for visitors  vane had already noticed the aroma of the cigar that was smoldering on a tray and he decided that nairn was right so he dipped his hand into the second box which he passed to carroll  now declared nairn we can talk comfortably clara will listen afterwards its possible she will favor me with her opinion  mrs nairn smiled at them encouragingly and her husband proceeded  one or two of my colleagues were no pleased at ye for putting off the meeting  the sloop was small and it was blowing rather hard vane explained  maybe for all that the tone of your message was no altogether what one would call conciliatory it informed us that ye would arrange for the postponed meeting at your earliest convenience ye did not mention ours  i pointed that out to him and he said it didnt matter carroll interrupted with a laugh  nairn spread out his hands in expostulation but there was dry appreciation in his eyes  young blood must have its way he paused and looked thoughtful ye will no have said anything definite to horsfield yet about the smelter  no so far im not sure that it would pay us to put up the plant and the other mans terms are lower  maybe nairn answered and he made the single word very expressive ye have had the handling of the thing but henceforward it will be necessary to get the sanction of the board however ye will meet horsfield tonight we expect him and his sister  vane thought he had been favored with a hint but he fancied also that his host was not inimical and was merely reserving his judgment with caledonian caution nairn changed the subject  so yere going to england for a holiday ye will have friends wholl be glad to see ye yonder  ive one sister but no other near relatives but i expect to spend some time with people you know the chisholms are old family friends and as you will remember it was through them that i first approached you  then obeying one of the impulses which occasionally swayed him he turned to mrs nairn  im grateful to them for sending me the letter of introduction to your husband because in many ways im in his debt he didnt treat me as the others did when i first went round this city with a few mineral specimens  he had expected nothing when he spoke but there was a responsive look in the ladys face which hinted that he had made a friend as a matter of fact he owed a good deal to his host there is a vein of human kindness in the scot and he is often endowed with a keen halfinstinctive judgment of his fellows which renders him less likely to be impressed by outward appearances and the accidental advantages of polished speech or tasteful dress than his southern neighbors vane would have had even more trouble in floating his company had not nairn been satisfied with him  so ye are meaning to stay with chisholm the latter exclaimed we had evelyn here two years ago and clara said something about her coming out again  its nine years since i saw evelyn  then theres a surprise in store for ye i believe theyve a bonny placeand theres no doubt chisholm will make ye welcome  the slight pause was expressive it implied that nairn who had a somewhat biting humor could furnish a reason for chisholms hospitality if he desired and vane was confirmed in this supposition when he saw the warning look which his hostess cast at her husband  its likely that well have evelyn again in the fall she said hastily its a very small world mr vane  its a far cry from vancouver to england vane replied how did you first come to know chisholm  nairn answered him  our acquaintance began with business a concern that he was chairman of had invested in british columbian mining stock and hes some kind of connection of colquhouns  colquhoun was a man of some importance who held a crown appointment and vane felt inclined to wonder why chisholm had not sent him a letter to him afterward he guessed at the reason which was not flattering to himself or his host nairn and he chatted a while on business topics until there was a sound of voices below and going down in company with mrs nairn they found two or three new arrivals in the entrance hall more came in and when they sat down to supper vane was given a place beside a young lady whom he had already met  jessy horsfield was about his own age tall and slight in figure with regular features a rather colorless face and eyes of a cold light blue there was however something striking in her appearance and vane was gratified by her graciousness to him her brother sat almost opposite them a tall spare man with a somewhat expressionless countenance except for the aggressive hardness in his eyes vane had noticed this look and it had aroused his dislike but he had not observed it in the eyes of miss horsfield though it was present now and then nor did he realize that while she chatted she was unobtrusively studying him she had not favored him with much notice when she was in his company on a previous occasion he had been a man of no importance then  he was now dressed in ordinary attire and the wellcut garments displayed his lean athletic figure his face miss horsfield decided was a good one not exactly handsome but attractive in its frankness and she liked the way he had of looking steadily at the person he addressed though he had been as she knew a wandering chopper a survey packer and for a time an unsuccessful prospector there was no coarsening stamp of toil on him indeed the latter is not common in the west where as yet the division of employments is not practised to the extent it is in older countries specialization has its advantages but it brands a mans profession upon him and renders it difficult for him to change it except for the clear bronze of his skin vane might just have left a government office or have come out from london or montreal he was moreover a man whose acquaintance might be worth cultivating  i suppose you are glad you have finished your work in the bush she remarked presently it must be nice to get back to civilization  vane smiled as he glanced round the room it ran right across the house and through the open windows came the clank of a locomotive bell down by the wharf and the rattle of a steamers winch the sounds appealed to him they suggested organized activity the stir of busy life and it was pleasant to hear them after the silence of the bush the gleam of snowy linen dainty glass and silver caught his eye and the hum of careless voices and the light laughter were soothing  yes its remarkably nice after living for nine years in the wilderness with only an occasional visit to some little wooden town  a fresh dish was laid before him and his companion smiled  you didnt get things of this kind among the pines  no laughed vane in fact cookery is one of the bushmans trials anyway when hes working for himself you come back dead tired and often very wet to your lonely tent and then theres a fire to make and supper to get before you can rest it happens now and then that youre too played out to trouble and you go to sleep instead  dreadful sympathized the girl but you have been in vancouver before  except on the last occasion i stayed down near the waterfront we were not provided with luxurious quarters or with suppers of this kind there  its romantic and though youre glad its over there must be some satisfaction in feeling that you owe the change to your own efforts i mean it must be nice to think one has captured a fair share of the good things of life instead of having them accidentally thrust upon one doesnt it give you a feeling that in some degree youre master of your fate i should like that  it was subtle flattery and there were reasons why it appealed to the man he had worked for others sometimes for inadequate wages and had wandered about the province dusty and footsore in search of employment besides being beaten down at many a small bargain by richer or more fortunately situated men now however he had resolved that there should be a difference instead of begging favors he would dictate terms  i should have imagined it he laughed in answer to her last remark and he was right for jessy horsfield was a clever woman who loved power and influence  vane dropped his napkin and was stooping to pick it up when an attendant handed it back to him he noticed and responded to the glimmer of amusement in his companions eyes  we are not accustomed to being waited on in the bush he explained it takes some time to get used to the change when we wanted anything there we got it for ourselves  is that in its wider sense a characteristic of most bushmen  i dont quite follow  the girl laughed  i suppose one could divide men into two classes those who are able to get the things they desire for themselveswhich implies the possession of certain eminently useful qualitiesand those who have them given to them in canada the former are the more numerous  theres a third division vane corrected her with a trace of grimness i mean those who want a good many things and have to learn to do without it strikes me theyre the most numerous of all  its no doubt excellent discipline retorted his companion  she looked at him boldly for she was interested in the man and was not afraid of personalities  in any case you have now passed out of that division  vane sat silent for the next few moments up to the age of eighteen most of his reasonable wishes had been gratified then had come a startling change and he had discovered in the dominion that he must lead a life of spartan selfdenial he had had the strength to do so and for nine years he had resolutely banished most natural longings amusements in some of which he excelled the society of women all the small amenities of life were things which must be foregone and he had forced himself to be content with food and as a rule very indifferent shelter this as his companion suggested had proved a wholesome discipline since it had not soured him now though he did not overvalue them he rejoiced in his new surroundings and the girls comeliness and quickness of comprehension had their full effect  it was you who located the clermont mine wasnt it she went on i read something about it in the papersi think they said it was copper ore  this vagueness was misleading for her brother had given her a good deal of definite information about the mine  yes replied vane willing to take up any subject she suggested its copper ore but theres some silver combined with it of course the value of any ore depends upon two thingsthe percentage of the metal and the cost of extracting it  her interest was flattering and he added  in both respects the clermont product is promising  after that he did not remember what they talked about but the time passed rapidly and he was surprised when mrs nairn rose and the company drifted away by twos and threes toward the veranda left by himself a moment he came upon carroll sauntering down a corridor  ive had a chat with horsfield carroll remarked  well  he may merely have meant to make himself agreeable and he may have wished to extract information about you if the latter was his object he was not successful  ah nairns straight anyway and to be relied on i like him and his wife  so do i though they differ from some of the others theres not much gilding on either of them  its not needed theyre sterling metal  thats my own idea  carroll moved away and vane strolled out onto the veranda where horsfield joined him a few minutes later  i dont know whether its a very suitable time to mention it but may i ask whether you are any nearer a decision about that smelter candidly id like the contract  i am not vane answered i cant make up my mind and i may postpone the matter indefinitely it might prove more profitable to ship the ore out for reduction  horsfield examined his cigar  of course i cant press you but i may perhaps suggest that as well have to work together in other matters i might be able to give you a quid pro quo  that occurred to me on the other hand i dont know how much importance i ought to attach to the consideration  his companion laughed with apparent goodhumor  oh well i must wait until youre ready  he strolled away and presently joined his sister  how does vane strike you he asked you seem to get on with him  ive an idea that you wont find him easy to influence answered the girl looking at her brother pointedly  im inclined to agree with you in spite of that hes a man whose acquaintance is worth cultivating  he passed on to speak to nairn and shortly afterward vane sat down beside jessy in a corner of a big room looking out across the veranda he could see faroff snowy heights tower in cold silver tracery against the green of the evening sky voices and laughter reached him and now and then some of the guests strolled through the room it was pleasant to lounge there and feel that miss horsfield had taken him under her wing which seemed to describe her attitude toward him she was handsome and he noticed how finely the soft neutral tinting of her attire which was neither blue nor altogether gray matched the azure of her eyes and emphasized the deadgold coloring of her hair  as mrs nairn tells me you are going to england i suppose we shall not see you in vancouver for some months she said presently this city really isnt a bad place to live in  vane felt gratified she had implied that he would be an acquisition and had included him among the number of her acquaintances  i fancy that i shall find it a particularly pleasant place he responded indeed im inclined to be sorry that ive made arrangements to leave it very shortly  that is pure goodnature laughed his companion  no its what i really feel  jessy let this pass  mrs nairn mentioned that you know the chisholms  id better say that i used to do so they have probably changed out of my knowledge and they can scarcely remember me except by name  but you are going to see them  i expect to spend some time with them  jessy changed the subject and vane found her conversation entertaining she appealed to his artistic perceptions and his intelligence and it must be admitted that she laid herself out to do so she said nothing of any consequence but she knew how to make a glance or a changed inflection expressive he was sorry when she left him but she smiled at him before she moved away  if you and mr carroll care to call i am generally at home in the afternoon she said  she crossed the room and vane joined nairn and remained near him until he took his departure  late the next afternoon an hour or two after an empress liner from china and japan had arrived he and carroll reached the cpr station the atlantic train was waiting and an unusual number of passengers were hurrying about the cars they were for the most part prosperous people business men and tourists from england going home that way and when vane found mrs marvin and kitty he once more was conscious of a stirring of compassion the girls dress which had struck him as becoming on the afternoon they spent on the beach now looked shabby in mrs marvins case the impression was more marked and standing amid the bustling throng with the child clinging to her hand she looked curiously forlorn kitty smiled at him diffidently  you have been so kind she began and pausing added with a tremor in her voice but the tickets  pshaw interrupted vane if it will ease your mind you can send me what they cost after the first full house you draw  how shall we address you  clermont mineral exploitation i dont want to think im going to lose sight of you  kitty looked away from him a moment and then looked back  im afraid you must make up your mind to that she said  vane could not remember his answer though he afterward tried but just then an official strode along beside the cars calling to the passengers and when a bell began tolling vane hurried the girl and her companions onto a platform mrs marvin entered the car elsie held up her face to kiss him before she disappeared and he and kitty were left alone she held out her hand and a liquid gleam crept into her eyes  we cant thank you properly she murmured goodby  no vane protested you mustnt say that  yes answered kitty firmly but with signs of effort its goodby youll be carried on in a moment  vane gazed down at her and afterward wondered at what he did but she looked so forlorn and desolate and the pretty face was so close to his stooping swiftly he kissed her and had a thrilling fancy that she did not recoil then the cars lurched forward and he swung himself down they slid past him clanking while he stood and gazed after them turning around he was by no means pleased to see that nairn was regarding him with quiet amusement  been seeing the train away the latter suggested its a popular diversion with idle folk  i was saying goodby to somebody i met on the west coast vane explained  weel chuckled nairn she has bonny een     chapter v  the old country   a month after vane said goodby to kitty he and carroll alighted one evening at a little station in northern england brown moors stretched about it for the heather had not bloomed yet rolling back in long slopes to the high ridge which cut against leaden thunderclouds in the eastern sky to the westward they fell away and across a wide green valley smoothbacked heights gave place in turn to splintered crags and ragged pinnacles etched in gray and purple on a vivid saffron glow the road outside the station gleamed with water and a few big drops of rain came splashing down but there was a bracing freshness in the mountain air  the train went on and vane stood still looking about him with a poignant recollection of how he had last waited on that platform sick at heart but gathering his youthful courage for the effort that he must make it all came back to himthe dejection the sense of lonelinessfor he was then going out to the western dominion in which he had not a friend now he was returning moderately prosperous and successful but once again the feeling of loneliness was with himmost of those whom he had left behind had made a longer journey than he had done then he noticed an elderly man in rather shabby livery approaching and he held out his hand with a smile of pleasure  you havent changed a bit jim he exclaimed have you got the young gray in the new cart outside  t owd gray was shot twelve months since the man replied broke his leg comin down hartop bank new car was sold off done two or tree years ago  thats bad news anyway youre the same  a bit stiffer in the joints and maybe a bit sourer was the answer then the mans wrinkled face relaxed im main glad to see thee mr wallace master wad have come only hed t gan t manchester suddenly  vane helped him to place their baggage into the trap and then bade him sit behind and as he gathered up the reins he glanced at the horse and harness the one did not show the breeding of the gray he remembered and there was no doubt that the other was rather the worse for wear they set off down the descending road which wound unconfined through the heather where the raindrops sparkled like diamonds farther down they ran in between rough limestone walls with gleaming spar in them smothered here and there in trailing brambles and clumps of fern while the streams that poured out from black gaps in the peat and flowed beside the road flashed with coppery gold in the evening light it was growing brighter ahead of them though inky clouds still clung to the moors behind  by and by ragged hedges rent and twisted by the winds climbed up to meet them and clattering down between the straggling greenery they crossed a river sparkling over banks of gravel after that there was a climb for the country rolled in ridge and valley and the crags ahead growing nearer rose in more rugged grandeur against the paling glow carroll gazed about him in open appreciation as they drove  this little compact country is really wonderful in its way he exclaimed theres so much squeezed into it even leaving out your towns parts of it are like ontariothe southern strip i meanwith the plowland orchards and homesteads sprinkled among the woods and rolling ground then your midlands are like the prairie only that theyre greenertheres the same sweep of grass and the same sweep of sky and thishe gazed at the rugged hills rent by winding dalesis british columbia on a miniature scale  yes agreed vane it isnt monotonous  now you have hit it thats the precise difference weve three belts of country beginning at labrador and running westrock and pine scrub level prairie and ranges piled on ranges beyond the rockies hundreds of leagues of each of them and within their limits all the same but this countrys mixed you can get what you likewoods smooth grassland mountainsin a few hours ride  vane smiled  our people and their speech and habits are mixed too theres more difference between county and county in thirty miles than there is right across your whole continent youre cast in the one mold  im inclined to think its a good one laughed carroll whats more it has set its stamp on you the very way your clothes hang proclaims that youre a westerner  vane laughed goodhumoredly but as they clattered through a sleepy hamlet with its little squaretowered church overhanging a brawling river his face grew grave pulling up the horse he handed the reins to carroll  this is the first stage of my pilgrimage i wont keep you five minutes  he swung himself down and the groom motioned to him  west of the tower mr wallace just before you reach the porch  vane passed through the wicket in the lichened limestone wall and there was a troubled look in his eyes when he came back and took the reins again  i went away in bitternessand im sorry now he said the real trouble was unimportant i think it was forgotten every now and then the letters came but the written word is cold there are things that can never be set quite right in this world  carroll made no comment though he knew that if it had not been for the bond between them his comrade would not have spoken so they drove on in silence for a while and then as they entered a deep wooded dale vane turned to him again  ive been taken right back into the old days tonight days in england and afterward those when we worked on the branch road beneath the range theres not a boy among the crowd in the sleepingshack i cant recallfirst wild larry who taught me how to drill and hid my rawness from the construction boss  he lent me his gumboots when the muskeg stiffened into halffrozen slush carroll interrupted him  and was smashed by the snowslide vane went on then there was tom from the boundary country he packed me back a league to camp the day i chopped my right foot and went down in the lumber schooner off flattery black pete too who held on to you in the rapid when we were running the bridgelogs through it was in firing a short fuse that he got his discharge he raised his free hand with a wry smile gone onwith more of their kind after them a goodly company why are we left prosperous what have we done  carroll made no response the question was unanswerable and after a while vane abruptly began to talk about their business in british columbia it passed the time and he had resumed his usual manner when he pulled up where a stile path led across a strip of meadow  you can drive round well be there before you he said to the groom as he got down  carroll and he crossed the meadow passing around a clump of larches they came suddenly into sight of an old gray house with a fir wood rolling down the hillside close behind it the building was long and low weatherworn and stained with lichens where the creepers and climbing roses left the stone exposed the bottom row of mullioned windows opened upon a terrace and in front of the terrace ran a low wall with a broad coping on which were placed urns bright with geraniums it was pierced by an opening approached by shallow stairs on which an iridescent peacock stood and in front of all that stretched a sweep of lawn  a couple of minutes later a lady met them in the wide hall and held out her hand to vane she was middleaged and had once been handsome but now there were wrinkles about her eyes which had a hint of hardness in them and her lips were thin carroll noticed that they closed tightly when she was not speaking  welcome home wallace she said effusively it should not be difficult to look upon the dene as thatyou were here so often once upon a time  thank you was the response i felt tempted to ask jim to drive me round by low wood i wanted to see the place again  im glad you didnt the house is shut up and going to pieces it would have been depressing tonight  vane presented carroll mrs chisholms manner was gracious but for no particular reason carroll wondered whether she would have extended the same welcome to his comrade had the latter not come back the discoverer of a profitable mine  tom was sorry he couldnt wait to meet you but he had to leave for manchester on some urgent business she apologized  just then a girl with disordered hair and an unusual length of stocking displayed beneath her scanty skirt came up to them  this is mabel said mrs chisholm i hardly think you will remember her  ive carried her across the meadow  the girl greeted the strangers demurely and favored vane with a critical gaze  so youre wallace vanewho floated the clermont mine though i dont remember you ive heard a good deal about you lately very pleased to make your acquaintance  vanes eyes twinkled as he shook hands with her her manner was quaintly formal but he fancied that there was a spice of mischief hidden behind it carroll watching his hostess surmised that her daughters remarks had not altogether pleased her she chatted with them however until the man who had driven them appeared with their baggage when they were shown their respective rooms  vane was the first to go down reaching the hall he found nobody there though a clatter of dishes and a clink of silver suggested that a meal was being laid out in an adjoining room sitting down near the hearth he looked about him the house was old a wide stairway with a quaintly carved balustrade of dark oak ran up one side and led to a landing also fronted with ponderous oak rails the place was shadowy but a stream of light from a high window struck athwart one part of it and fell upon the stairs  vanes eyes rested on many objects that he recognized but as his glance traveled to and fro it occurred to him that much of what he saw conveyed a hint that economy was needful part of the rich molding of the jacobean mantel had fallen away and patches of the key pattern bordering the panels beneath it had broken off though he decided that a clever cabinetmaker could have repaired the damage in a day there were one or two choice rugs on the floor but they were threadbare the heavy hangings about the inner doors were dingy and motheaten and though all this was in harmony with the drowsy quietness and the faint smell of decay it had its significance  presently he heard footsteps and looking up he saw a girl descending the stairs in the fading stream of light she was clad in trailing white which gleamed against the dark oak and rustled softly as it flowed about a tall finely outlined and finely poised figure she had hair of dark brown with paler lights in its curling tendrils gathered back from a neck that showed a faintly warmer whiteness than the snowy fabric below it it was her face though that seized vanes attention the level brows the quiet deep brown eyes the straight cleanlycut nose and the subtle suggestion of steadfastness and pride which they all conveyed he rose with a cry that had pleasure and eagerness in it  evelyn  she came down moving lightly but with a rhythmic grace and laid a firm cool hand in his  im glad to see you back wallace she said how you have changed  im not sure thats kind smiled vane in some ways you havent changed at all i would have known you anywhere  nine years is a long time to remember any one  vane had seen few women during that period but he was not a fool and he recognized that this was no occasion for an attempt at gallantry there was nothing coquettish in evelyns words nor was there any irony she had answered in the tranquil matteroffact manner which as he remembered usually characterized her  its a little while since you landed isnt it she added  a week i had some business in london and then i went on to look up lucy she had just gone up to townto a congress i believeand so i missed her i shall go up again to see her as soon as she answers my letter  it wont be necessary shes coming here for a fortnight  thats very kind whom have i to thank for suggesting it  does it matter it was a natural thing to ask your only sisterwho is a friend of mine there is plenty of room and the place is quiet  it didnt used to be if i remember your mother generally had it full part of the year  things have changed said evelyn quietly  vane was baffled by something in her manner evelyn had never been effusivethat was not her waybut now while she was cordial she did not seem disposed to resume their acquaintance where it had been broken off after all he could hardly have expected this  mabel is like you as you used to be he observed it struck me as soon as i saw her but when she began to talk there was a difference  evelyn laughed softly  yes i think youre right in both respects mopsy has the courage of her convictions shes an open rebel  there was no bitterness in her laugh evelyns manner was never pointed but vane fancied that she had said a meaning thingone that might explain what he found puzzling in her attitude when he held the key to it  mopsy was dubious about you before you arrived but im pleased to say she seems reassured she laughed  carroll came down and a few moments later mrs chisholm appeared and they went in to dinner in a lowceilinged room during the general conversation mabel suddenly turned to vane  i suppose you have brought your pistols with you  i havent owned one since i was sixteen vane laughed  the girl looked at him with an excellent assumption of incredulity  then you have never shot anybody in british columbia  carroll laughed as if this greatly pleased him but vanes face was rather grave as he answered her  no im thankful to say that i havent in fact ive never seen a shot fired except at a grouse or a deer  then the west must be getting what the archdeaconhes floras husband you knowcalls decadent the girl sighed  shes incorrigible mrs chisholm interposed with a smile  carroll leaned toward mabel confidentially  in case you feel very badly disappointed ill let you into a secret when we feel real real savage we take the ax instead  evelyn fancied that vane winced at this but mabel looked openly regretful  can either of you pick up a handkerchief going at full gallop on horseback she inquired  im sorry to say that i cant and ive never seen wallace do so carroll laughed  mrs chisholm shook her head at her daughter  miss clifford complained of your inattention to the study of english last quarter she reproved severely  mabel made no answer though vane thought it would have relieved her to grimace  presently the meal came to an end and an hour afterward mrs chisholm rose from her seat in the lamplit drawingroom  we keep early hours at the dene but you will retire when you like she said as tom is away i had better tell you that you will find syphons and whisky in the smokingroom i have had the lamp lighted  thank you vane replied with a smile im afraid you have taken more trouble on our account than you need have done except on special occasions we generally confine ourselves to strong green tea  mabel looked at him in amazement  oh she cried the west is certainly decadent you should be here when the otter hounds are out why it was only  she broke off abruptly beneath her mothers withering glance  when vane and carroll were left alone they strolled out pipe in hand upon the terrace they could see the fells tower darkly against the soft sky and a tarn that lay in the blackness of the valley beneath them was revealed by its pale gleam a wonderful mingling of odors stole out of the still summer night  i suppose you could put in a few weeks here vane remarked  i could carroll replied theres an atmosphere about these old houses that appeals to me perhaps because we have nothing like it in canada the tranquillity of age is in itits restful as a change besides i think your friends mean to make things pleasant  im glad you like them  carroll knew that his comrade would not resent a candid expression of opinion  i do the girls in particular they interest me the younger ones of a type thats common in our country though its generally given room for free development into something useful there mabels chafing at the curb it remains to be seen whether shell kick presently and hurt herself in doing so  vane remembered that evelyn had said something to the same effect but he had already discovered that carroll possessed a keen insight in certain matters  and her sister he suggested  you wont mind my saying that im inclined to be sorry for her she has learned repressionbeen driven into line that girl has character but its being cramped and stunted you live in walledin compartments in this country  doesnt the same thing apply to new york montreal or toronto  not to the same extent we havent had time yet to number off all the little subdivisions and make rules for them nor to elaborate the niceties of an immutable system no doubt well come to it  he paused with a deprecatory laugh  mrs chisholm believes in the system she has been modeled on itits got into her blood and thats why shes at variance with her daughters no doubt the things necessary im finding no fault with it you must remember that were outsiders with a different outlook weve lived in the new west  vane strolled on along the terrace thoughtfully he was not offended he understood his companions attitude like other men of education and good upbringing driven by unrest or disaster to the untrammeled life of the bush carroll had gained sympathy as well as knowledge facing facts candidly he seldom indulged in decided protest against any of them on the other hand vane was on occasion liable to outbreaks of indignation  well said vane at length i guess its time to go to bed     chapter vi  upon the heights   vane rose early the next morning as he had been accustomed to do and taking a towel he made his way across dewy meadows and between tall hedgerows to the tarn stripping where the rabbitcropped sward met the mossy boulders he swam out joyously breasting the little ripples which splashed and sparkled beneath the breeze that had got up with the sun coming back where the water lay in shadow beneath a larchwood which as yet had not wholly lost its vivid vernal green he disturbed the paddling moorhens and put up a mallard from a clump of swaying reeds then he dressed and turned homeward glowing beside a sluggish stream which wound through a waste of heather where the curlew were whistling eerily he had no cares to trouble him and it was delightful to feel that he had nothing to do except to enjoy himself in what he considered the fairest country in the world at least in summertime  scrambling over a limestone wall tufted thick with parsley fern he noticed mabel stooping over an object which lay among the heather where a rough cartroad approached a wooden bridge on joining her he saw that she was examining a finelybuilt canoe with a hole in one bilge she looked up at him ruefully  its sad isnt it that stupid little did it with his clumsy cart  i think it could be mended vane replied  old beavanhes the wheelwrightsaid it couldnt and dad said i could hardly expect him to send the canoe back to kingston he bought it for me at an exhibition  then a thought seemed to strike her and her eyes grew eager  perhaps you had something to do with light canoes in canada  yes i used to pole one loaded with provisions up a river and carry the lot round several falls if i remember i made eight shillings a day at it and i think i earned it youre fond of paddling  i love it i used to row the fishingpunt but its too old to be safe and now that the canoes smashed i cant go out at all  well well walk across and see what we can find in beavans shop  he took a few measurements making them on a stick and they crossed the heath to a tiny hamlet nestling in a hollow of a limestone crag there vane made friends with the wheelwright who regarded him dubiously at first and obtained a piece of larch board from him the grizzled north countryman watched him closely as he set a plane which is a delicate operation and he raised no objections when vane made use of his workbench when the board had been sawed up vane borrowed a few tools and copper nails and he and mabel went back to the canoe on the way she glanced at him curiously  i wasnt sure old beavan would let you have the things she remarked it isnt often hell even lend a hammer but he seemed to take to you i think it was the way you handled his plane  its strange what little things win some peoples good opinion isnt it  oh dont exclaimed mabel thats the way the archdeacon talks i thought you were different  the man acquiesced in the rebuke and after an hours labor at the canoe he scraped the red lead he had used off his hands and sat down beside the craft the sun was warm now the dew was drying and a lark sang riotously overhead vane became conscious that his companion was regarding him with what seemed to be approval  i really think youll do and well get on she informed him if you had been the wrong kind you would have worried about your red hands still you could have rubbed them on the heather instead of on your socks  i might have thought of that vane laughed but you see ive been accustomed to wearing old clothes anyway youll be able to launch the canoe as soon as the joints dry  theres one thing i should have told you the girl replied dad would have sent the canoe away to be mended if it hadnt been so far hes very good when things dont ruffle him but he hasnt been fortunate lately the lead mine takes a good deal of money  vane admired her loyalty and he refrained from taking advantage of her candor though there were one or two questions he would have liked to ask when he was last in england chisholm had been generally regarded as a man of means though it was rumored that he was addicted to hazardous speculations mabel without noticing his silence went on  i heard stevenshes the gamekeepertell beavan that dad should have been a rabbit because hes so fond of burrowing no doubt that meant that he couldnt keep out of mines  vane made no comment and mabel breaking off for a moment looked up at the rugged fells to the west and then around at the moors which cut against the blue of the morning sky  its all very pretty but it shuts one in she cried you feel you want to get out and cant i suppose you really couldnt take me back with you to canada  im afraid not if you were about ten years older it might be possible  mabel grimaced  oh dont thats the kind of thing some of geralds smart friends say and it makes one want to slap them besides she added naively glancing down at her curtailed skirt im by no means so young as i appear to be the fact is im not allowed to grow up yet  why  the girl laughed at him  oh youve lived in the woods if you had stayed in england you would understand  im afraid ive been injudicious vane answered with a show of humility but dont you think its getting on toward breakfast time  breakfast wont be for a good while yet we dont get up early evelyn used to but its different now we used to go out on the tarn every morning even in the wind and rain but i suppose thats not good for ones complexion though bothering about such things doesnt seem to me to be worth while aunt julia couldnt do anything for evelyn though she had her in london for some time flora is our shining light  what did she do  she married the archdeacon and he isnt so very dried up ive seen him smile when i talked to him  im not astonished at that mabel laughed vane  his companion looked up at him  my names not mabelto you im mopsy to the family but my special friends call me mops youre one of the few people one can be natural with and im getting sickyou wont be shockedof having to be the opposite if youll come along ill show you the setter puppies  it was half an hour later when vane who had seldom had to wait so long for breakfast sat down with an excellent appetite the spacious room pleased him after the cramped quarters to which he had been accustomed the sunlight that streamed in sparkled on choice old silver and glowed on freshly gathered flowers and through the open windows mingled fragrances flowed in from the gardens all that his gaze rested on spoke of ease and taste and leisure evelyn sitting opposite him looked wonderfully fresh in her white dress mopsy was as amusing as she dared to be but vane felt drawn back to the restless world again as he glanced at his hostess and saw the wrinkles round her eyes and a hint of cleverly hidden strain in her expression he fancied that a good deal could be deduced from the fragments of information her younger daughter had given him  it was mabel who suggested that they should picnic upon the summit of a lofty hill from which there was a striking view and as this met with the approval of mrs chisholm who excused herself from accompanying them they set out an hour later the day was bright with glaring sunshine and a moderate breeze drove up wisps of ragged cloud that dappled the hills with flitting shadow towering crag and shingly scree showed blue and purple through it and then flashed again into brilliancy while the long grassy slopes gleamed with silvery gray and ocher  on leaving the head of the valley they climbed leisurely up easy slopes slipping on the crisp hill grass now and then by and by they plunged into tangled heather on a bolder ridge rent by black gullies down which at times wild torrents poured this did not trouble either of the men who were used to forcing a passage over more rugged hillsides and through leagues of matted brush but vane was surprised at the ease with which evelyn threaded her way across the heath she wore a short skirt and stout laced boots and he noticed the supple grace of her movements and the delicate color the wind had brought into her face it struck him that she had somehow changed since they had left the valley she seemed to have flung off something and her laugh had a gay ring but while she smiled and chatted with him he was still conscious of a subtle reserve in her manner  climbing still they reached the haunts of the cloudberries and brushed through broad patches of the snowy blossoms that open their gleaming cups among the moss and heather vane gathered a handful and gave them to evelyn  you should wear these they grow only far up on the heights  she flashed a swift glance at him but she smiled as she drew the fragile stalks through her belt and he felt that had it been permissible he could have elaborated the idea in his mind they are stainless flowers passionlessly white that grow beyond the general reach of man where the air is keen and pure and in spite of her graciousness there was a coldness and a calm which instead of repelling appealed to him strongly about this girl mabel laughed mischievously  if you want to give me flowers it had better be marshmarigolds she said they grow low down where its slushybut they blaze  carroll laughed  mabel he remarked a few moments later to vane is unguarded in what she says but she now and then shows signs of being considerably older than her years  they left the black peatsoil behind them and the heather gave place to thin and more fragile ling beaded with its unopened buds while fangs of rock cropped out here and there then turning the flank of a steep ascent they reached the foot of a shingly scree and sat down to lunch in the warm sunshine where the wind was cut off by the peak above beneath them a great rift opened up among the rocks and far beyond the blue lake in the depths of it they could catch the silver gleam of the distant sea  the fishing creel in which the provisions had been carried was promptly emptied and when mabel afterward took carroll away to climb some neighboring crags vane lay resting on one elbow not far from evelyn she was looking down the long hollow with the sunshine which lighted a golden sparkle in her brown eyes falling upon her face  you didnt seem to mind the climb  i enjoyed it evelyn declared glancing at the cloudberry blossom in her belt i really am fond of the mountains and i have to thank you for a day among them  on the surface the words offered an opening for a complimentary rejoinder but vane was too shrewd to seize it he had made one venture and he surmised that a second one would not please her  theyre almost at your door one would imagine that you could indulge in a scramble among them whenever it pleased you  there are a good many things that look so close and still are out of reach evelyn answered with a smile that somehow troubled him then her manner changed you are content with this  vane gazed about him purple crags lay in shadow glistening threads of water fell among the rocks and long slopes lay steeped in softest color under the cloudflecked summer sky  content is scarcely the right word for it he assured her if it werent so still and serene up here id be riotously happy there are reasons for this quite apart from the scenery for one its remarkably pleasant to feel that i need do nothing but what i like during the next few months  the sensation must be unusual i wonder if even in your case it will last so long  vane laughed and stretched out one of his hands it was lean and brown and she could see the marks of old scars on the knuckles  in my case he answered it has come only once in a lifetime and if it isnt too presumptuous i think ive earned it he indicated his battered fingers thats the result of holding a wet and slippery drill and those arent the only marks i carry about with methough ive been more fortunate than many fine comrades  evelyn noticed something that pleased her in his voice as he concluded  i suppose one must get hurt now and then she responded after all a bruise thats only skindeep doesnt trouble one long and no doubt some scars are honorable its slow corrosion thats the deadliest  she broke off with a laugh  moralizings out of place on a day like this she added and such days are not frequent in the north thats their greatest charm  vane nodded he knew the sad gray skies of his native land when its lonely heights are blurred by driving snowcloud or scourged by bitter rain for weeks together though now and then they tower serenely into the blue heavens steeped in ethereal splendor once more it struck him that in their latter aspect his companion resembled them made finely of warm flesh and blood she was yet ethereal too there was something aloof and intangible about her that seemed in harmony with the hills among which she was born  yes he agreed on the face of it the north is fickle though to those who know it thats a misleading term to some of us its always the same and its dark grimness makes one feel the radiance of its smile for all that i think were going to see a sudden change in the weather  long wisps of leaden cloud began to stream across the crags above intensifying until it seemed unnatural the glow of light and color on the rest  i wonder if mopsy is leading mr carroll into any mischief they have been gone some time said evelyn she has a trick of getting herself and other people into difficulties i suppose he is an old friend of yours as you brought him over unless perhaps hes acting as your secretary  vanes eyes twinkled  if he came in any particular capacity its as bearleader you see there are a good many things ive forgotten in the bush and as i left this country young there are no doubt some that i never learned  and so you make mr carroll your confidential adviser how did he gain the necessary experience  that is more than i can tell you but im inclined to believe he has been at one of the universitiestoronto most likely anyhow on the whole he acts as a judicious restraint  but dont you really know anything about him  only what some years of close companionship have taught me though i think thats enough for the rest i took him on trust  evelyn looked surprised and he spread out his hands in a humorous manner  a good many people have had to take me in that way and they seemed willing to do sothe things not uncommon in the west why should i be more particular than they were  just then mabel and carroll appeared the latters garments were stained in places as if he had been scrambling over mossy rocks and his pockets bulged mabels skirt was torn while a patch of white skin showed through her stocking  weve found some sundew and two ferns i dont know as well as all sorts of other things she announced  thats correct vouched carroll dryly ive got them i guess theyre going to fill up most of the creel  mabel superintended their transfer and then addressed the others generally  i think we ought to go up the pike now when we have the chance it isnt much of a climb from here and well have rain before tomorrow besides the quickest way back to the road is across the top and down the other side  evelyn agreed and they set out following a sheep path which skirted the screes until they left the bank of sharp stones behind and faced a steep ascent parts of it necessitated a breathless scramble and the sunlight faded from the hills as they climbed while thicker wisps of cloud drove across the ragged summit they reached the top at length and stopped bracing themselves against a rush of chilly breeze while they looked down upon a wilderness of leadencolored rock long trails of mist were creeping in and out among the crags and here and there masses of it gathered round the higher slopes  i think the pikes grandest in this weather mabel declared look below mr carroll and youll see the mountains like a starfish it has prongs running out from it  carroll did as she directed him and noticed three diverging ridges springing off from the shoulders of the peak their crests which were narrow led down toward the valley but their sides fell in rent and fissured crags to great black hollows  you can get down two of them mabel went on the first is the nearest to the road but the thirds the easiest it takes you to the hausethats the gap between it and the next big hill you must be a climber to try the middle one  a few big drops began to fall and evelyn cut her sisters explanations short  it strikes me that wed better make a start at once she said  they set out mabel and carroll leading and drawing farther away from the two behind the rain began in earnest as they descended rock slope and scattered stones were slippery and vane found it difficult to keep his footing on some of their lichened surfaces he was relieved however to see that his companion seldom hesitated and they made their way downward cautiously until near the spot where the three ridges diverged they walked into a belt of drifting mist the peak above them was suddenly blotted out and evelyn bade vane hail carroll and mabel who had disappeared he sent a shout ringing through the vapor and caught a faint and unintelligible answer a flock of sheep fled past and dislodged a rush of sliding stones vane heard the stones rattle far down the hillside and when he called again a blast of chilly wind whirled his voice away there was a faint echo above him and then silence  it looks as if they were out of hearing and the slope ahead of us seems uncommonly steep by the way those stones went down do you think mabel has taken carroll down the stanghyll ridge  i cant tell answered evelyn its comforting to remember that she knows it better than i do i think we ought to make for the hause theres only one place thats really steep keep up to the left a little the scale crags must be close beneath us  they moved on circumspectly skirting what seemed to be a pit of profound depth in which dim vapors whirled while the rain growing thicker beat into their faces     chapter vii  stormstayed   the weather was not the only thing that troubled vane as he stumbled on through the mist any unathletic tourist from the cities could have gone up without much difficulty by the way they had ascended but it was different coming down on the opposite side of the mountain there their route led across banks of sharppointed stones that rested lightly on the steep slope interspersed with outcropping rocks which were growing dangerously slippery and a wilderness of crags pierced by three great radiating chasms lay beneath  after half an hours arduous scramble he decided that they must be close upon the top of the last rift and he stood still for a minute looking about him the mist was now so thick that he could see scarcely thirty yards ahead but the way it drove past him indicated that it was blowing up a hollow on one hand a rampart of hillside loomed dimly out of it in front there was a dark patch that looked like the face of a dripping rock and between that and the hill a boggy stretch of grass ran back into the vapor vane glanced at his companion with some concern her skirt was heavy with moisture and the rain dripped from the brim of her hat but she smiled at him reassuringly  its not the first time ive got wet she said cheeringly and youre not responsibleits mopsys fault  vane felt relieved on one account he had imagined that a woman hated to feel draggled and untidy and he was willing to own that in his case fatigue usually tended toward shortness of temper though the scramble had scarcely taxed his powers he fancied that evelyn had already done as much as one could expect of her  i must prospect about a bit scardales somewhere below us but if i remember its an awkward descent to the head of it and im not sure of the right entrance to the hause  ive only once been down this way and that was a long while ago evelyn replied  vane left her and plodded away across the grass sinking ankledeep in the spongy moss among the roots of it when he had grown scarcely distinguishable in the haze he turned and waved his hand  i know where we arealmost to the head of the beck he called  evelyn joined him at the edge of a trickle of water splashing in a peaty hollow and they followed it down seeing only odd strips of hillside amid the vapor at length the ground grew softer and vane going first sank among the long green moss almost to his knees it made a bubbling sucking sound as he drew out his feet  that wont do stand still please ill try a little to the right  he tried in one or two directions but wherever he went he sank over his boots coming back he informed his companion that they would better go straight ahead  i know theres no bog worth speaking ofthe hause is a regular tourist track  he stopped and stripped off his jacket  first of all you must put this on im sorry i didnt think of it before  evelyn demurred and vane rolled up the jacket  you have to choose between doing what i ask and watching me pitch it into the beck im a rather determined person it would be a pity to throw the thing away particularly as the rain hasnt got through it yet  she yielded and he held the jacket while she put it on  theres another thing he added im going to carry you for the next hundred yards or possibly farther  no replied evelyn firmly on that point my determination is as strong as yours  vane made a sign of acquiescence  you may have your way for a minute i expect that will be long enough  he was correct evelyn moved forward a pace or two and then stopped with the skirt she had gathered up brushing the quivering emerald moss and her boots which were high ones hidden in the mire she had some difficulty in pulling them out then vane coolly picked her up  all you have to do is to keep still for the next few minutes he informed her in a most matteroffact voice  evelyn did not move though she recognized that had he shown any sign of selfconscious hesitation she would at once have shaken herself loose as it was the fact that he appeared perfectly at ease and unaware that he was doing anything unusual was reassuring then as he plodded forward she wondered at his steadiness for she remembered that when she had once fallen heavily when nailing up a clematis her father who was a vigorous man had found it difficult to carry her upstairs vane had never carried any woman in his arms before but he had occasionally had to packas it is termed in the westhundredandfortypound flour bags over a rocky portage and though the comparison did not strike him as a happy one he thought the girl was not quite so heavy as that he was conscious of a curious thrill and a certain stirring of his blood but this he decided must be sternly ignored his task was not an easy one and he stumbled once or twice but he accomplished it and set the girl down safely on firmer ground  now he said theres only the drop to the dale but we must endeavor to keep out of the beck  his voice and air were unembarrassed though he was breathless and evelyn fancied that in this and the incident of the jacket he had at last revealed the forceful natural manners of the west it was the first glimpse she had had of them and she was not displeased the man had merely done what was most advisable with practical sense  a little farther on a shoot of falling water swept out of the mist above and came splashing down a crag spread out in frothing threads it flowed across their path reunited in a deep gully and then fell tumultuously into the beck which was now ten or twelve feet below them they clung to the rock as they traced it downward stepping cautiously from ledge to ledge and from slippery stone to stone at times a stone plunged into the mist beneath them and vane grasped the girls arm and held out a steadying hand but he was never fussy nor needlessly concerned when she wanted help it was offered at the right moment but that was all had she been alarmed her companions manner would have been more comforting than persistent solicitude he was she decided one who could be relied upon in an emergency  you are surefooted she remarked when they stopped a minute or two for breath  vane laughed as he glanced into the vaporrilled depths beneath they stood on a ledge two or three yards in width with a tall crag behind them and the beck which had rapidly grown larger leaping half seen from rock to rock in the rift in front  i was born among these fells and i have helped to pack various kinds of mining truck over much rougher mountains  have you ever gone up as steep a place as this with a load  if i remember rightly the top of the hause drops about three hundred feet and well probably spend half an hour in reaching the valley there was one western divide that it took us several days to cross dragging a tent camp gear and provisions in relays its foot was wrapped in tangled brush that tore most of our clothes to rags and the last pitch was two thousand feet of rock where the snow lay waistdeep in the hollows  two thousand feet that dwarfs our little drop to the hause what were you doing so far up in the ranges  looking for a copper mine  and you found one  no not that time as a rule the mineral trail leads poor men to greater poverty and sometimes to a grave but once you have set your feet on it you follow it again the thing becomes an obsession you feel forced to go  even if you bring nothing back  vane laughed  one always brings back somethingfrostbite bruises a bag of specimens that assayers and mineral development men smile at theyre the palpable results but in most cases you pick up an intangible something else  and that is  a thing beyond definition a germ that lies in wait in the lonely places and breeds fantasies when it gets into your blood anyway you can never quite get rid of it  evelyn was interested the man was endowed with a trick of quaint and almost poetical imagination which she had not suspected him of possessing  it conduces to unrest she suggested  yes one feels that theres a rich claim waiting beyond the thick timber through which one can hardly scramble across the icy rivers or over the snowline  but you found one  at last i found it easily after ranging the wildest solitudes we struck it in a sheltered valley near the warm west coast curious isnt it  but didnt that banish the unrest and leave you satisfied  the man looked at her with a flicker of grim amusement in his eyes  as i explained it cant be banished theres always a richer claim somewhere that you havent found our prospectors dream of it as the mother lode and some spend half their lives in search of it it was called el dorado three hundred years ago after all the ideas a deeper thing than a miners fantasy in one shape or another its inherent in optimistic human nature are you sure the microbe hasnt bitten you and mopsy  he was too shrewd turning from him she looked down at the eddying mist for several years she had chafed at her surroundings and the restraints they laid upon her with a restless longing for something wider and better a freer sunnier atmosphere where her nature could expand at times she fancied there was only one sun which could warm it to a perfect growth but that sun had not risen and scarcely seemed likely to do so  vane broke the silence deprecatingly  now that youre rested wed better get on im sorry ive kept you so long  though caution was still necessary the rest of the descent was easier and after a while they reached a winding dale they followed it downward splashing through water part of the time and at length came into sight of a cluster of little houses standing between a river and a big fir wood  it must be getting on toward evening mopsy and carroll probably went down the ridge and as it runs out lower down the valley theyll be almost at home  its six oclock replied vane glancing at his watch you cant walk home in the rain and its a long while since lunch if adam bell and his wife are still at the golden fleece well get something to eat there and borrow you some dry clothes ive no doubt hell drive us back afterward  evelyn made no objections she was very wet and was beginning to feel weary and they were some distance from home she returned his jacket and a few minutes later they entered an old hostelry which like many others among those hills was a farm as well as an inn the landlady recognized vane with pleased surprise when she had attended to evelyn she provided vane with some of her husbands clothes then she lighted a fire and when she had laid out a meal in the guestroom evelyn came in attired in a dress of lilac print  its maggie bells she explained demurely her mothers things were rather large adam is away at a sheep auction and they have only the trap he went in but they expect him back in an hour or so  then we must wait smiled vane worse misfortunes have befallen me  they made an excellent meal and then vane drew up a wicker chair to the fire for evelyn and sat down opposite her the room was low and shadowy and partly paneled against one wall stood a black oak sideboard with a platerack above it and a great chest of the same material with ponderous handforged hingestraps stood opposite it a clock with an engraved metal dial and a sixfoot case polished to a wonderful luster by the hands of several generations ticked in one corner and here and there the firelight flickered upon utensils of burnished copper there was little in the place that looked less than a century old for there are nooks in the north that have still escaped the ravages of the collector outside the rain dripped from the massy flagstone eaves and the song of the river stole in monotonous cadence into the room  evelyn was silent and vane said nothing for a while he had been in the air all day and though this was nothing new to him he was content to sit lazily still and leave the opening of conversation to his companion in the meanwhile it was pleasant to glance toward her now and then the paletinted dress became her and he felt that the room would have looked less cheerful had she been away though this by no means comprised the whole of his sensations after living almost entirely among men he had of late met three women who had impressed him in different ways and they had all been pleasant to look upon  first there was kitty blake little graceful and in a way alluring and it was she who had first roused in him a vague desire for a companion who could be more to him than a man could be beyond that pretty as she was she had only moved him to chivalrous pity and a wider sympathy  then he had met jessy horsfield whom he admired she was a clever woman and a handsome one but she had scarcely stirred him at all  last he had met evelyn as well endowed with physical charm as either and there was no doubt that the effect she had on him was different again it was one that was difficult to analyze though he lazily tried she appealed to him by the grace of her carriage the poise of her head her delicate coloring and the changing lights in her eyes but behind these points there was something stronger and deeper expressed through them he fancied that she possessed qualities he had not hitherto encountered which would become more precious when they were fully understood he thought of her as steadfast and wholesome in mind one who sought for the best but beyond this there was an ethereal something that could not be defined then a simile struck him she was like the snow that towered high into the empyrean in british columbia in this however he was wrong for there was warm human passion in the girl though as yet it was sleeping  he realized suddenly that he was getting absurdly sentimental and instinctively he fumbled for his pipe then stopped evelyn noticed this and smiled  you neednt hesitate the dene is redolent of cigars and gerald smokes everywhere when he is at home  is he likely to turn up vane asked its ever so long since ive seen him  im afraid not in fact geralds rather under a cloud just now i may as well tell you this because you are sure to hear of it sooner or later he has been extravagant and so he assures us extraordinarily unlucky  stocks suggested vane he was acquainted with some of the family tendencies  evelyn hesitated a moment  that would more readily have been forgiven him i believe he has speculated on the turf as well  vane was surprised he understood that gerald chisholm was a barrister and betting on the turf was not an amusement he would have associated with that profession  i must run up and see him by and by he said thoughtfully  evelyn felt sorry she had spoken gerald needed help which his father was not in a position to offer evelyn was not censorious of other peoples faults but it was impossible to be blind to some aspects of her brothers character and she would have preferred that vane should not meet gerald while the latter was embarrassed by financial difficulties she abruptly changed the subject  several of the things you have told me about your life in canada interest me it must have been bracing to feel that you depended upon your own efforts and stood on your own feet free from the hampering customs that are common here  the position has its disadvantages you have no family influence behind younothing to fall back on if you cant make good your footing you must go down its curious that just before i came over here a lady i met in vancouver expressed an opinion very much like yours she said it must be pleasant to feel that one is to some extent at least master of ones fate  then she merely explained my meaning more clearly than i have done  one could have imagined that she had everything she could reasonably wish for if im not transgressing so have you its strange you should both harbor the same idea  evelyn smiled  i dont think its uncommon among young women nowadays theres a grandeur in the thought that ones fate lies in the hands of the high unseen powers but to allow ones life to be molded by the prejudices and preconceptions of onesneighbors is a different matter besides if unrest and human striving were sent was it only that they should be repressed  vane sat silent a moment or two he had noticed the brief pause and fancied that she had changed one of the words that followed it he did not think that it was the opinions of her neighbors against which she chafed most  its something that ive never experienced he replied at length in a general way ive done what i wanted  which is a privilege that is denied us  evelyn spoke without bitterness  what do women who are left to their own resources do in western canada she asked presently  some of them marry i suppose thats the most natural thing answered vane with an air of reflection that amused her anyway they have plenty of opportunities theres a preponderating number of unattached young men in the newly opened parts of the dominion  things are different here or perhaps we require more than they do across the atlantic what becomes of the others  they are waitresses in the hotels they learn stenography and typewriting and go into offices and stores  and earn just enough to live upon meagerly if their wages are high they must pay out more that follows doesnt it  to some extent  is there nothing better open to them  no not unless theyre trained for it and become specialized that implies peculiar abilities and a systematic education with one end in view you cant enter the arena to fight for the higher prizes unless youre properly armed the easiest way for a woman to acquire power and influence is by a judicious marriage no doubt its the same here  it is laughed evelyn a man is more fortunately situated  probably but if hes poor hes rather walled in too he breaks through now and then and in the newer countries he gets an opportunity  vane abstractedly examined his pipe which he had not lighted yet it was clear that the girl was dissatisfied with her surroundings and had for some reason temporarily relaxed the restraint she generally laid upon herself but he felt that if she were wise she would force herself to be content she was of too fine a fiber to plunge into the struggle that many women had to wage though he did not doubt her courage she had not been trained for it he had noticed that among men it was the cruder and less developed organizations that proved hardiest in adverse situations one needed a strain of primitive vigor there was it seemed only one means of release for evelyn and that was a happy marriage but a marriage could not be happy unless the suitor should be all that she desired and evelyn would be fastidious though her family would no doubt look only for wealth and station vane imagined that this was where the trouble lay and he felt a protective pity for her he would wait and keep his eyes open  presently there was a rattle of wheels outside and the landlord came in and greeted them with rude cordiality shortly afterward vane helped evelyn into the rig and bell drove them home through the rain     chapter viii  lucy vane   bright sunshine streamed down out of a cloudless sky one afternoon shortly after the ascent of the pike vane stood talking with his sister upon the terrace in front of the dene he leaned against the low wall frowning for lucy hitherto had avoided a discussion of the subject which occupied their attention and now as he would have said he could not make her listen to reason  she stood in front of him with the point of her parasol pressed firmly into the gravel and her lips set though in her eyes there was a smile which suggested forbearance lucy was tall and spare of figure a year younger than her brother and of somewhat determined and essentially practical character she earned her living in a northern manufacturing town by lecturing on domestic economy for the public authorities vane understood that she also received a small stipend as secretary to some womens organization and that she took a part in suffrage propaganda she had a thin forceful face seldom characterized by repose  after all vane broke out what im urging is a very natural thing i dont like to think of your being forced to work as you are doing and ive tried to show you that it wouldnt cost me any selfdenial to make you an allowance theres no reason why you should be at the beck and call of those committees any longer  lucys smile grew plainer  i dont think that quite describes my position  its possible vane agreed with a trace of dryness no doubt you insist that the chairman or lady president give way to you but this doesnt affect the question you have to work anyway  but i like it and it keeps me in some degree of comfort  the man turned impatiently and glanced about him the front of the old gray house was flooded with light and the mossy sward below the terrace glowed luminously green the shadows of the hollies and cypresses were thin and unsubstantial but where a beech overarched the grass evelyn and mrs chisholm attired in light draperies reclined in basket chairs carroll in thin gray tweed stood near them talking to mabel and chisholm sat on a bench with a newspaper in his hand he looked half asleep and a languorous stillness pervaded the whole scene beyond it the tarn shone dazzlingly and in the distance ranks of rugged fells towered dim and faintly blue all that the eye rested on spoke of an unbroken tranquillity  wouldnt you like this kind of thing as well vane asked of course i mean what it impliesthe power to take life easy and get as much enjoyment as possible out of it it wouldnt be difficult if youd only take what id be glad to give you he indicated the languid figures in the foreground you could for instance spend your time among people of this sort after all its what you were meant to do  would that appeal to you  oh i like it in the meantime he evaded  well lucy returned curtly i believe im more at home with the other kind of peoplethose in poverty squalor and ignorance ive an idea that they have a stronger claim on me but thats not a point i can urge the fact is ive chosen my career and there are practical reasons why i shouldnt abandon it i had a good deal of trouble in getting a footing and if i fell out now it would be harder still to take my place in the ranks again  but you wouldnt require to do so  i cant be sure i dont want to hurt you but after all your success was sudden and one understands that it isnt wise to depend on an income derived from mining properties  vane frowned  none of you ever did believe in me  i suppose theres some truth in that you really did give us trouble you know somehow you were differentyou wouldnt fit in though i believe the same thing applied to me for that matter  and now you dont expect my prosperity to last  the girl hesitated but she was candid by nature  perhaps id better answer you have it in you to work determinedly and when its necessary to do things that men with less courage would shrink from but im doubtful whether yours is the temperament that leads to success you havent the hucksters instincts youre not coldblooded enough you wouldnt cajole your friends nor truckle to your enemies  if i adopted the latter course it would certainly be against the grain vane confessed  lucy laughed  well i mean to go on earning my living but you may take me up to london for a few days if you want to and buy me some hats and things then i dont mind your giving something to the emancipation society  i am not sure that i believe in emancipation but you may have ten guineas  thank you  lucy glanced around toward carroll who was approaching them with mabel  ill give you a piece of advice she added stick to that man hes cooler and less headstrong than you are hell prove a useful friend  what are you two talking about asked carroll you look animated  wallace has just promised me ten guineas to assist the movement for the emancipation of women lucy answered pointedly our societys efforts are sadly restricted by the lack of funds  vane is now and then a little inconsequential in his generosity carroll rejoined i didnt know he was interested in that kind of thing but as i dont like to be outdone by my partner ill subscribe the same by the way why do you people reckon these things in guineas  thanks smiled lucy making an entry in a notebook in a businesslike manner as you said it was a subscription youll hear from us next year in answer to your question its an ancient custom and it has the advantage that you get in the extra shillings  they strolled along the terrace together and as they went down the steps to the lawn carroll turned to her with a smile  have you tackled chisholm yet  i never waste powder and shot lucy replied tersely a man of his restricted views would sooner subscribe handsomely to a movement to put us down  are you regretting the ten guineas vane carroll questioned laughingly you dont look pleased  the fact is i wanted to do something that wasnt allowed ive met with the same disillusionment here as i did in british columbia  lucy looked up at her brother  did you attempt to give somebody money there  i did its not worth discussing and anyway she wouldnt listen to me  they strolled on vane frowning while carroll noticing signs of suppressed interest in lucys face smiled unobserved neither he nor the others thought of mabel who was following them  some time after they joined the others carroll lay back in a deep chair with his halfclosed eyes turned in lucys direction  are you asleep or thinking hard mrs chisholm asked him  not more than half asleep he laughed i was trying to remember a dream of fair women its a suitable occupation for a drowsy summer afternoon in a place like this but i must confess that it was miss vane who put it into my head she reminded me of one or two of the heroines when she was championing the cause of the suffragist  you mustnt imagine that englishwomen in general sympathize with her or that such ideas are popular at the dene  carroll smiled reassuringly  i shouldnt have imagined the latter for a moment but as i said on an afternoon of this kind one may be excused for indulging in romantic fancies dont you see what brought those oldtime heroines into my mind i mean the elusive resemblance to their latterday prototype  mrs chisholm looked puzzled  no she declared one of them was greek another early english and the finest of all was the hebrew maid as they couldnt have been like one another how could they collectively have borne a resemblance to anybody else  thats logical on the surface to digress why do you most admire jephthahs daughter the gentle gileadite  his hostess affected surprise  isnt it evident when one remembers her patient sacrifice her fine sense of family honor  carroll felt that this was much the kind of sentiment one could have expected from her and he did her the justice to believe that it was genuine and that she was capable of living up to her convictions his glance rested on vane for a moment and the latter was startled as he guessed carrolls thought  evelyn sat near him reclining languidly in a wicker chair she had been silent and now that her face was in repose the signs of reserve and repression were plainer than ever there was however pride in it and vane felt that she was endowed with a keener and finer sense of family honor than her thinlipped mother her brothers career was threatened by the results of his own imprudence and though her father could hardly be compared with the gileadite warrior there was vane fancied a disturbing similarity between the two cases it was unpleasant to contemplate the possibility of this girls being called upon to bear the cost of her relatives misfortunes or follies  carroll looked across at lucy with a smile  you wont agree with mrs chisholm he suggested  no answered lucy firmly leaving out the instance in question there are too many people who transgress and then expect somebody elsea woman generallyto serve as a sacrifice  i dont agree either mabel broke in id sooner have been cleopatra or joan of arconly she was burned poor thing  that was only what she might have expected an unpleasant fate generally overtakes people who go about disturbing things mrs chisholm said severely  the speech was characteristic and the others smiled it would have astonished them had mrs chisholm sympathized with the rebel idealist whose beckoning visions led to the clash of arms  arent you getting off the track vane asked carroll i dont see the drift of your previous remarks  well drawled carroll there must be i think a certain distinctive stamp upon those who belong to the leader typei mean the people who are capable of doing striking and heroic things apart from this ive been studying you englishive been over here beforeand it has struck me that theres occasionally something imperious or rather imperial in the faces of your women in the most northern counties i cant define the thing but its therein the line of nose in the mouth and i think most marked in the brows its not saxon nor norse nor danish id sooner call it roman  vane was slightly astonished he had seen that look in evelyns face and now for the first time he recognized it in his sisters  perhaps you have hit it he said with a laugh you can reach the wall from here in a days ride  the wall  the roman wall hadrians wall i believe one authority states that they had a garrison of one hundred thousand men to keep it  chisholm joined the group he was a tall rather floridfaced man with a formal manner and was dressed immaculately in creaseless clothes  the point wallace raises is interesting he remarked while i dont know how long it takes for a strain to die out there must have been a large civil population living near the wall and we know that the characteristics of the teutonic peoples who followed the romans still remain on the other hand some of the followers were vexillaries from the bounds of the empire gauls for example or iberians  when later on the group broke up evelyn was left alone for a few minutes with mabel  gerald should have been sent to canada instead of to oxford the younger girl declared then he might have got as rich as wallace vane and mr carroll  what makes you think theyre rich evelyn asked with reproof in her tone  mabel grimaced  oh we all knew they were rich before they came they were giving lucy guineas for the suffragists an hour ago they must have a good deal of money to waste it like that besides i think wallace wanted her to take some more and he seemed quite vexed when he said hed tried to give money to somebody else in canada who wouldnt have it as he said she it must have been a woman but i dont think he meant to mention that it slipped out  you had no right to listen evelyn retorted severely but the information sank into her mind and she afterward remembered it  she rose when the sunshine creeping farther across the grass fell upon her and vane carried her chair as well as those of the others who were strolling back toward them into the shadow this she thought was typical of the man he seemed happiest when he was doing something by and by a chance remark of her mothers once more set carroll to discoursing humorously  after all he contended its difficult to obey a purely arbitrary rule of conduct several of the philosophers seem to have decided that the origin of virtue is utility  utility chisholm queried  yes utility to ones neighbors or the community at large for instance i desire an apple growing on somebody elses treeone of the big red apples that hang over the roadside in ontario now the longing for the fruit is natural and innocent in itself the trouble is that if it were indulged in and gratified by every person who passed along the road the farmer would abandon the cultivation of his orchard he would neither plant nor prune his trees except for the expectation of enjoying what they yield the offense accordingly concerns everybody who enjoys apples  mrs chisholm smiled assent  i believe that idea is the basis of our minor social and domestic codes even when theyre illogical in particular cases theyre necessary in general  evelyn looked across at vane as if to invite his opinion and he knit his brows  i dont think carrolls correct the traditional view which as i understand it is that the sense of right is innate ingrained in mans nature seems more reasonable ill give you two instances there was a man in charge of a little mine he had had the crudest education and no moral training but he was an excellent miner well he was given a hint that it was not desirable the mine should turn out much paying ore  but why wasnt it required to produce as much as possible evelyn asked  i believe that somebody wanted to break down the value of the shares and afterward quietly buy them up anyway though he knew it would result in his dismissal the man i mentioned drove the boys his hardest he worked savagely taking risks he could have avoided by spending a little more time in precautions in a badly timbered tunnel he didnt reasonhe was hardly capable of itbut he got the most out of the mine  it was fine of him evelyn exclaimed  the engineer of a collier figures in the next case vane went on the engines were clumsy and badly finished but the man spent his care and labor on them until i think he loved them his only trouble was that he was sent to sea with secondrate oils and stores after a while they grew so bad that he could hardly use them and he had reasons for believing that a person who could dismiss or promote him was getting a big commission on the goods he was a plain unreasoning man but he would not cripple his engines and at last he condemned the stores and made the skipper purchase supplies he could use at double the usual prices in a foreign port there could be only one result he was driving a pump in a mine when i last met him  he paused and added quietly  it wasnt logic it wasnt even conventional morality that impelled these men it was something that was part of them whats more men of their type are more common than the cynics believe  carroll smiled goodhumoredly and when the party sauntered toward the house he walked beside evelyn  theres one point that wallace omitted to mention in connection with his tales he remarked the things he narrated are precisely those which on being given the opportunity he would have pleasure in doing himself  why pleasure i could understand his doing them but id expect him to feel some reluctance  carrolls eyes twinkled  he gets indignant now and then virtuous people are generally content to resist temptation but wallace is apt to attack the tempter i dare say it isnt wise but thats the kind of man he is  ah one couldnt find fault with the type but i wonder why you have taken the trouble to tell me this  really i dont know somehow i have an impression that i ought to say what i can in wallaces favor if only because he brought me here and i feel like talking when i can get a sympathetic listener  i shouldnt have imagined the latter was indispensable laughed evelyn is this visit all you owe wallace  no indeed in many ways i owe him a good deal more he has no idea of this but it doesnt lessen my obligation by the way it struck me that in many respects miss vane is rather like her brother  lucy is opinionative and now and then embarrassingly candid but she leads a life that most of us would shrink from it isnt necessary that she should do sofamily friends would have arranged things differentlyand the tasks shes paid for are less than half her labors i believe she generally gets abuse as a reward for the rest  then mabel joined them and took possession of carroll and evelyn strolled on alone thinking of what he had told her     chapter ix  chisholm proves amenable   vane spent a month at the dene with quiet satisfaction and when at last he left for london and paris he gladly promised to come back for another few weeks before he sailed for canada he stayed some time in paris because carroll insisted on it but it was with eagerness that he went north again late in the autumn for one reasonand he laid some stress upon thishe longed for the moorland air and the rugged fells though he admitted that evelyns society enhanced their charm for him  at last shortly before he set out on the journey he took himself to task and endeavored to determine precisely the nature of his feelings toward her but he signally failed to elucidate the point it was clear only that he was more contented in her presence and that apart from her physical comeliness she had a stimulating effect upon his mental faculties then he wondered how she regarded him and to this question he could find no answer she had treated him with a quiet friendliness and had to some extent taken him into her confidence for the most part however there was a reserve about her that he found more piquant than deterrent and he was conscious that while willing to talk with him freely she was still holding him off at arms length  on the whole he could not be absolutely sure that he desired to get much nearer though he failed to recognize this clearly his attitude was largely one of respectful admiration tinged with a vein of compassion evelyn was unhappy and out of harmony with her relatives and he could understand this more readily because their ideas occasionally jarred on him  one morning about a fortnight after they returned to the dene vane and carroll walked out of the hamlet where the wheelwrights shop was sitting down on the wall of a bridge vane opened the telegram in his hand  i think you have nairns code in your wallet he said well decipher the thing  carroll laid the message on a smooth stone and set to work with a pencil  situation highly satisfactory  he broke off to chuckle a comment  it must be if nairn paid for an extra wordhighlys not in the code  then he went on with the deciphering  result of reduction exceeds anticipations stock thirty premium your presence not immediately required  thats distinctly encouraging declared vane now that they are getting farther in the ore must be carrying more silver  it strikes me as fortunate i ran through the bank account last night and theres no doubt that you have spent a good deal of money it confirms my opinion that you have mighty expensive friends  vane frowned but carroll continued undeterred  you want pulling up after the way you have been indulging in a reckless extravagance which i feel compelled to point out is new to you the check drawn in favor of gerald chisholm rather astonished me have you said anything about it to his relatives  i havent  then judging by the little i saw of him i should consider it most unlikely that he has made any allusion to the matter the next check was even more surprisingi mean the one you gave his father  they were both loans chisholm offered me security  unsalable stock or a mortgage on property that carries another charge have you any idea of getting the money back  what has that to do with you  carroll spread out his hands  only this it strikes me that you need looking after we cant stay here indefinitely hadnt you better get back to vancouver before your english friends ruin you  ill go in three or four weeks not before  carroll sat silent a minute or two and then looked his companion squarely in the face  is it your intention to marry evelyn chisholm  i dont know what has put that into your mind  i should be a good deal astonished if it hadnt suggested itself to her family carroll retorted  vane looked thoughtful  im far from sure that its an idea they would entertain with any great favor for one thing i cant live here  carroll laughed  try them and see show them nairns telegram when you mention the matter  vane swung himself down from the wall during the past two weeks he had seen a good deal of evelyn and his regard for her had rapidly grown stronger now that news that his affairs were prospering had reached him he suddenly made up his mind  its very possible that i may do so he informed his comrade well get along  his heart beat a little more rapidly than usual as they turned back toward the house but he was perfectly composed when some time later he sat down beside chisholm who was lounging away the morning on the lawn  ive been across to the village for a telegram i expected he said handing chisholm the deciphered message it occurred to me that you might be interested the news is encouraging  chisholm read it with inward satisfaction when he laid it down he had determined on the line he meant to follow  youre a fortunate man theres probably no reasonable wish that you cant gratify  there are things one cant buy with money vane replied  that is very true theyre often the most valuable on the other hand some of them may now and then be had for the asking besides when one has a sanguine temperament and a determination its difficult to believe that anything one sets ones heart on is quite unattainable  vane wondered whether he had been given a hint chisholms manner was suggestive and carrolls remarks had had an effect on him he sat silent and chisholm continued  if i were in your place i should feel that i had all that i could desire within my reach  vane was becoming sure that his comrade had been right chisholm would not have harped on the same idea unless he had intended to convey some particular meaning but the mans methods roused vanes dislike he could face opposition and he would rather have been discouraged than judiciously prompted  then if i offered myself as a suitor for evelyn you would not think me presumptuous  chisholm was somewhat astonished at his abruptness but he smiled reassuringly  no i cant see why i should do so you are in a position to maintain a wife in comfort and i dont think anybody could take exception to your character he paused a moment i suppose you have some idea of how evelyn regards you  not the faintest thats the trouble  would you like mrs chisholm or myself to mention the matter  no answered vane decidedly in fact i must ask you not to do anything of the kind i only wished to make sure of your good will and now that im satisfied on that point id rather wait and speakwhen it seems judicious  chisholm nodded  i dare say that would be wisest there is nothing to be gained by being precipitate  vane thanked him and waited he fancied that the transactionthat seemed the best name for itwas not completed yet but he meant to leave the matter to his companion he would not help the man  theres something that had better be mentioned now distasteful as it is chisholm said at length i can settle nothing upon evelyn as you must have guessed my affairs are in a far from promising state indeed im afraid i may have to ask your indulgence when the loan falls due and i dont mind confessing that the prospect of evelyns making what i think is a suitable marriage is a relief to me  vanes feelings were somewhat mixed but contempt figured prominently among them he could find no fault with chisholms desire to safeguard his daughters future but he was convinced that the man looked for more than this he felt that he had been favored with a delicate hint to which his companion expected an answer he was sorry for evelyn and was ashamed of the position he was forced to take  well he replied curtly you need not be concerned about the loan im not likely to prove a pressing creditor to go a little farther i should naturally take an interest in the welfare of my wifes relatives i dont think i can say anything more in the meanwhile  when he saw chisholms smile he felt that he might have spoken more plainly without offense but the elder man looked satisfied  those are the views i expected you to hold he declared i believe that mrs chisholm will share my gratification if you find evelyn disposed to listen to you  vane left him shortly afterward with a sense of shame he felt that he had bought the girl and that if she ever heard of it she would find it hard to forgive him for the course he had taken when he met carroll he was frowning  ive had a talk with chisholm he said it has upset my temperi feel mean theres no doubt that you were right  carrolls smile showed that he could guess what was in his comrades mind  i shouldnt worry too much about the thing the girl probably understands the situation its not altogether pleasant but i dare say shes more or less resigned to it she cant help herself  vane gazed at him with anger  does that make it any better is it any comfort to me  take her out of it if she has any liking for you shell thank you for doing so  vane strode away and nobody saw him again for an hour or two in the afternoon however at mrs chisholms suggestion he and carroll set out with the girls for a hill beyond the tarn  it was a perfect day of late autumn a pale golden haze softened the rugged outlines of crag and fell which towered in purple masses against a sky of stainless azure warm sunshine flooded the valley glowing on the gold and crimson that flecked the lower beech sprays and turning the leaves of the brambles to points of ruby flame here and there white limestone ridges flung back the light and the tarn gleamed like molten silver when a faint puff of wind traced a dark blue smear athwart its surface the winding road was thick with dust and a deep stillness brooded over everything  by and by however a couple of whipcracks rose from beyond a dip of the road and were followed by a shout in a womans voice and a sharp clatter of iron on stone  oh cried mabel when they reached the brow of the descent the poor thing cant get up what a shame to give it such a load  the road fell sharply between ragged hedgerows and near the foot of the hill a pony was struggling vainly to move a cart the vehicle was heavily loaded and while the animal strained and floundered a woman struck it with a whip  its mrs hoggarth her husbands the carrier mabel explained come on we must stop her she mustnt beat the pony like that  vane strode down the hill and when they approached the cart mabel called indignantly to the woman  stop you oughtnt to do that the loads too heavy wheres hoggarth  vane seized one rein close up to the bit and turned the pony until the cart was across the road when he had done so the woman looked around at mabel  wheel went over his foot last night he canna get on his boot im none fond of beating pony but banks steep and we mun gan up the folks mun have their things  vane glanced at the pony which stood with lowered head and heaving flank it was evident that the animal could do no more  theres only one way out of the trouble he said we must pack some of this truck to the top whats in those bags  ones oats answered the woman its four bushel other ones linseed cake those slates for bells new stable are the heaviest  carroll came up with evelyn just then and vane spoke to him  come here and help me with this bag  they had it ready at the back of the cart in a few moments and evelyn who knew that a fourbushel bag of oats is difficult to move was astonished at the ease with which they handled it vane got the bag upon his back and walked up the hill with it the veins stood out on his forehead and his face grew red but he plodded steadily on and came back for another load  ill take an armful of the slates this time carroll you can tackle the cake  the cake was heavy though the bag was not full and when they returned carroll was breathing hard and there were smears of blood on one of vanes hands the old woman gazed at him in amazed admiration  thank you sir she said theres not many men wad carry four bushel up a bank like that  vane laughed  im used to it now i think that we can face the hill  he seized the rein and after a flounder or two the pony started the load and struggled up the ascent leaving the woman at the top voluble with thanks vane came down and sauntered on again with mabel  i made sure you would drop that bag until i saw how you got hold of it and then i knew you would manage she informed him you see ive watched the men at scarside mill i didnt want you to drop it  i wonder why laughed vane  if you do you must be stupid were friends arent we i like my friends to be able to do anything that other folks can thats partly why i took to you  vane made her a ceremonious bow and they went on chatting lightly when they came to a sweep of climbing moor they changed companions for mabel led carroll off in search of plants and ferns farther on evelyn sat down upon a heathy bank and vane found a place on a stone beside a trickling rill  its pleasant here and i like the sun she explained besides its still a good way to the top and i generally feel discontented when i get there there are other peaks much higherone wants to go on  vane smiled in comprehension  yes he agreed on and always on its the feeling that drives the prospector we seem to have the same thoughts on a good many points  evelyn did not answer this  i was glad you got that cart up the hill what made you think of it  the pony was played out though it was a plucky beast i suppose i felt sorry for it ive been driven hard myself  the girls eyes softened she had seen him use his strength though it was she imagined the strength of determined will and disciplined body rather than bulk of muscle for the man was hard and lean the strength also was associated with a gentleness and a sympathy with the lower creation that appealed to her  how hard were you driven she asked  sometimes until i could scarcely crawl back to my tent or the sleepingshack at night out yonder construction bosses and contractors foremen are skilled in getting the utmost value of every dollar out of a man ive had my hands worn to raw wounds and half my knuckles bruised until it was almost impossible to bend them  were you compelled to work like that  i thought so it seemed to be the custom of the country one had to get used to it  evelyn hesitated a moment though she was interested  but was there nothing easier had you no money  very little as a rule and what i had i tried to keep it was to give me a start in life it was hard to resist the temptation to use some of it now and then but i held out he laughed grimly after all i suppose it was excellent discipline  the girl made a sign of comprehending sympathy there was a romance in the mans career which had its effect on her and she could recognize the strength of will which had held him to the laborious tasks he might have shirked while the money lasted then a stain on the sleeve of his jacket caught her eye  you have hurt your hand she exclaimed  vane glanced down at his hand which was reddened all over  it looks like it those slates must have cut it  hadnt you better wash it and tie it up it seems a nasty cut  he dipped his hand into the rill and was fumbling awkwardly with his handkerchief when she stopped him  that wont do let me fix it for you  rolling up her own handkerchief she wet it and laid it on his palm across which a red gash ran he had moved close to her stooping down and a disturbing thrill ran through him as she held his hand once more however he was troubled by a sense of compunction as he recalled his interview with chisholm  thank you he said abruptly when she finished  there were signs of tension in his face and she drew a little away from him when he sat down again for a few moments he struggled with himself they were alone he had her fathers consent and he knew that what he had done half an hour ago had appealed to her but he felt that he could not plead his cause just then with her parents on his side she was at a disadvantage and he shrank from the thought that she might be forced upon him against her will this was not what he desired and she might hate him for it afterward she was very alluring there had been signs of an unusual gentleness in her manner and the light touch of her cool fingers had stirred his blood but he wanted time to win her favor aided only by such gifts as he had been endowed with it cost him a determined effort but he made up his mind to wait and it was a relief to him when the approach of mabel and carroll rendered any confidential conversation out of the question     chapter x  with the otter hounds   a week or two had slipped away since vane cut his hand he lounged one morning upon the terrace chatting with carroll it was a heavy black morning the hills were hidden by wrappings of leaden mist and the still air was charged with moisture  suddenly a long faint howl came up the valley and was answered by another in a deeper note then a confused swelling clamor broke out softened by the distance and slightly resembling the sound of chiming bells carroll stopped and listened  what in the name of wonder is that he asked the first of it reminded me of a coyote howling but the rests more like the noise the timber wolves make in the bush at night  you havent made a bad shot vane laughed its a pack of otter hounds hot upon the scent  the sound ceased as suddenly as it had begun and a few moments later mabel came running toward the men  i knew the hounds met at patten brig but jim was sure theyd go downstream she cried breathlessly theyre coming up i think theyre at the pool below the village get two polesyoull find some in the toolshedand come along at once  she climbed into the house through a window calling for evelyn and carroll smiled  we have our orders i suppose wed better go  its one of the popular sports up here vane replied you may as well see it  they set out a few minutes later accompanied by evelyn while mabel hurried on in front and reproached them for their tardiness sometimes they heard the hounds sometimes a hoarse shouting that traveled far through the still air and then sometimes there was only the tremulous song of running water at length after crossing several wet fields they came to a rushy meadow on the edge of the river which spread out into a wide pool fringed with alders which had not yet lost their leaves and the barer withes of osiers there was a swift stream at the head of it and a long rippling shallow at the tail and scattered along the bank and in the water was a curiously mixed company  a redcoated man with whip and horn stood in the tail outflow and three or four more with poles in their hands were spread out across the stream behind him these and one or two in the head stream appeared by their dress to belong to the hunt but the rest among whom were a few women were attired in everyday garments and were of different walks in life artisans laborers people of leisure and a late tourist or two  three or four big hounds were swimming aimlessly up and down the pool a dozen more trotted to and fro along the waters edge stopping to sniff and give tongue in an uncertain manner now and then but there was no sign of an otter  carroll looked round with a smile when his companions stopped  it strikes me therell be very little work done in this neighborhood today he remarked id no idea there were so many people in the valley with time to spare the only thing thats missing is the beast theyre after  an otter is an almost invisible creature evelyn explained you very seldom see one unless its hard pressed by the dogs there are a good many in the river but even the trout fishers who are about at sunrise in the hot weather and wade in the dusk rarely come across them are you going to take a share in the hunt  no replied carroll glancing humorously at his pole i dont know why i brought this thing unless it was because mopsy sent me for it id rather stay and watch with you splashing through a river after a little beast that i dont suppose theyd let an outsider kill doesnt interest me i dont see why i should want to kill it anyway some of you english people have sporting ideas i cant understand i struck a young man the other daya welleducated man by the looks of himwho was spending the afternoon happily with a ferret by a corn stack killing rats with a club he seemed uncommonly pleased with himself because hed got four of them  oh chided mabel youre as bad as the silly people who call killing things cruel i wouldnt have thought it of you  vane laughed  ive seen him drop a deer with a singleshot rifle when it was going through thick brush almost as fast as a locomotive and i believe that he once assisted in killing a panther in a thicket where you couldnt see two yards ahead the point is that he meant to eat the deerand the panther had been taking a ranchers hogs  im sorry i brought him mabel pouted hes not a sportsman  i really think theres some excuse for the more vigorous sports evelyn maintained of course you cant eliminate a certain amount of cruelty but admitting that isnt it just as well that men who live in a luxurious civilization should be willing to plod through miles of heather after grouse risk their limbs on horseback or spend hours in cold water these are bracing things they imply some moral discipline it really cant be nice to ride at a dangerous fence or to flounder down a rapid after an otter when youre stiff with cold the effort to do so must be wholesome  a sure thing carroll agreed the only trouble is that when youve got your fox or otter it isnt worth anything a good many of the people in the newer lands every day have to make something of the kind of effort you describe in their case the results are wagon trails valleys cleared for orchards or new branch railroads i suppose its a matter of opinion but if id put in a seasons risky work id rather have a piece of land to grow fruit on or a share in a mineral claimyou get plenty of excitement in prospecting for thatthan a foxs tail  he strolled along the bank with evelyn following the hunt upstream suddenly he looked around  mopsys gone and i dont see vane  after all hes one of us evelyn laughed if youre born in the north country its hard to keep out of the river when you hear the otter hounds  but mopsys not going in  im afraid i cant answer for her  they took up their station behind a growth of alders and for a while the dogs went trotting by in twos and threes or swam about the pool but nothing else broke the surface of the leadencolored water then there was a cry an outbreak of shouting a confused baying and half a dozen hounds dashed past more followed heading upstream along the bank with a tiny brown terrier panting behind them evelyn stretched out her hand  look  carroll saw a small gray spotthe top of the otters headmoving across the slacker part of the pool with a very slight wedgeshaped ripple trailing away from it it sank the next moment a bubble or two rose and then there was nothing but the smooth flow of water  a horn called shrilly a few whipcracks rang out like pistolshots and the dogs took the water swimming slowly here and there men scrambled along the bank some entering the river reinforced the line spread out across the head rapid while others joined the second row wading steadily upstream and splashing about as they advanced with irontipped poles nothing rewarded their efforts the dogs suddenly turned and went downstream and then everybody ran or waded toward the tail outflow a clamor of shouting and baying broke out and floundering men and swimming dogs went down the stream together in a confused mass there was a brief silence the hounds came out and trotted to and fro along the bank and dripping men clambered after them  evelyn laughed as she pointed to vane among the leading group he looked even wetter than the others  i dont suppose he meant to go in its in the blood  theres no reason why he shouldnt if it amuses him carroll replied when i first met him hed have been more careful of his clothes  a little later the dogs were driven in again and this time the whole of the otters head was visible as it swam upstream the animal was flagging and on reaching shoaler water it sprang out altogether now and then rising and falling in the stronger stream with a curious serpentine motion in fact as head and body bent in the same sinuous curves it looked less like an animal than a plunging fish the men guarding the rapid stood ready with their poles and more were wading and splashing up both sides of the pool the otters pace was getting slower sometimes it seemed to stop and now and then it vanished among the ripples carroll saw that evelyns face was intent though there were signs of shrinking in it  ill tell you what you are thinking he said you want that poor little beast to get away  i believe i do evelyn confessed and you  im afraid im not much of a sportsman in this sense  they watched with strained attention the girl could not help it though she dreaded the climax her sympathies were now with the hardpressed exhausted creature that was making a desperate fight for its life the pursuers were close upon it the swimming dogs leading them and ahead lay a foaming rush of water which seemed less than a foot deep with men spread out across it the shouting from the bank had ceased and everybody waited in tense expectancy when the otter disappeared the dogs reached the rapid where they were washed back a few yards before they could make headway upstream men who came splashing close upon them left the water to scramble along the bank and then they stopped abruptly while the dogs swam in an uncertain manner about the still reach beyond they came out in a few minutes and scampered up and down among the stones evidently at fault for there was no sign of the otter anywhere incredible as it seemed the hunted creature an animal that would probably weigh about twentyfour pounds had crept up the rush of water among the feet of those who watched for it and vanished unseen into the sheltering depths beyond  evelyn sighed with relief  i think it will escape she said the rivers rather full after the rain which is against the dogs and there isnt another shallow for some distance shall we go on  they strolled forward behind the dogs which were again moving upstream but they turned aside to avoid a bit of woods and it was some time later when they came out upon a rocky promontory dropping steeply to the river just there the water flowed through a deep gorge down the sides of which great oaks and ashes straggled in front of carroll and his companion a ragged face of rock fell about twenty feet but there was a little soil among the stones below and a dense growth of alders interspersed with willows fringed the waters edge the stream swirled in deep black eddies beneath their drooping branches though a little farther on it poured tumultuously between scattered boulders into the slacker pool the rock sloped on one side and there was a bank of underbrush near the foot of the descent  the hunt was now widely scattered about the reach men crept along slippery ledges above the water and moved over dangerously slanting slopes half hidden among the trees a few were in the river three or four of the dogs were swimming the others spread out in twos and threes trotted in and out among the undergrowth  presently a figure creeping along the foot of the rock not far away seized carrolls attention  its mopsy he exclaimed the foothold doesnt look very safe among those stones and there seems to be deep water below  he called out in warning but the girl did not heed the willows were thinner at the spot she had reached and squeezing herself through them she leaned down clinging to an alder branch  hes gone to holt among the roots she cried  three or four men running along the opposite bank apparently decided that she was right for the horn was sounded and here and there a dog broke through the underbrush just as the firstcomers reached the rapid there was a splash it was a moment or two before evelyn or carroll who had been watching the dogs realized what had happened then the blood ebbed from the girls face mabel had disappeared  running a few paces forward carroll saw what looked like a bundle of outspread garments swing round in an eddy it washed in among the willows and he heard a faint cry  helpquick ive caught a branch  he could not see the girl now but an alder branch was bending sharply and he flung a rapid glance around him the summit of the rock on which he stood rose above the trees had there been a better landing he would have faced the risky fall but it seemed impossible to alight among the stones without a broken leg even if he came down uninjured there was a barrier of tangled branches and densely growing withes between him and the river and the opening through which mabel had fallen was some distance away farther downstream he might reach the water by a reckless jump as the promontory sloped toward it there but he would not be able to swim back against the current his position was a painful one there was nothing that he could do  the next moment men and dogs went scrambling and swimming down the rapid they were in hot pursuit of the otter which had left its hiding place and it was evident that the girl clinging to a branch beneath the willows had escaped their attention carroll shouted savagely as his comrade appeared among the tail of the hunt below the others were too much occupied to heed or perhaps they concluded that he was urging them on  help mabel carroll shouted again and again gesticulating wildly in his desperation  vane waistdeep in the water seemed to catch the girls name and understand in a few moments he was swimming down the pool along the edge of the alders then carroll saw that evelyn expected him to take some part in the rescue  get down before its too late she cried  carroll spread out his hands as if to beg her forbearance while every impulse urged him to the leap he endeavored to keep his head he fancied that he would be wanted later and it was obvious that he would not be available if he lay upon the rocks below with broken bones  i cant do any good just now he tried to explain knowing that he was right and yet feeling horribly ashamed shes holding on and wallace will reach her in a moment or two  evelyn broke out at him in an agony of fear and anger  you coward will you let her drown  she turned and ran forward but carroll dreading that she meant to attempt the descent seized her shoulder and held her fast while he grappled with her vanes voice rose from below and he let his hands drop  wallace has her theres no more danger he said quietly  evelyn suddenly recovered a small degree of calm even amid the stress of her terror she recognized the assurance in the mans tone he had blind confidence in his comrades prowess and his next words made this impression clearer  dont be afraid hell never let go until he brings her out  standing breathless a pace or two apart they saw vane and the girl appear from beneath the willows and wash away downstream the man was swimming but he was hampered by his burden and once he and mabel sank almost from sight in a whirling eddy carroll said nothing turning he ran along the sloping ridge until the fall was less and the trees were thinner then he leaped out into the air he broke through the alders amid a rustle of bending boughs and disappeared but a moment or two later his shoulders shot out of the water close beside vane and the two men went down the stream with mabel between them  evelyn scrambled wildly along the ridge and when she reached the foot of it vane was helping mabel up the sloping bank of gravel the girls drenched garments clung about her and her wet hair was streaked across her face but she seemed able to stand the hunt had swept on through shoaler water but there was a cheer from the stragglers across the river evelyn clutched her sister half laughing half sobbing and incoherently upbraided her mabel shook herself free and her first remark was characteristic  oh dont make a silly fuss im only wet through wallace take me home  she tried to shake out her dripping skirt and vane picked her up as she seemed to expect it the others followed when he pushed through the underbrush toward a neighboring meadow evelyn however was still a little unnerved and when they reached a gap in a wall she stopped and leaned heavily against the stones  i think im more disturbed than mopsy is she said to carroll what i felt must be some excuse for me you were right of course im sorry for what i said it was unjustifiable  carroll laughed lightly  anyway it was perfectly natural but i must confess that i felt some temptation to make a spectacular fool of myself i might have jumped into those alders but its most unlikely that i could have got out of them  evelyn looked at him with a new respect he had not troubled to point out that he had not flinched from the jump when it seemed likely to be of service  how could you have the sense to think of that she asked  i suppose its a matter of practise one cant work among the ranges and rivers without learning to make the right decision rapidly when you dont you get badly hurt with most of us the thing has to be cultivated its not instinctive  evelyn was struck by the explanation this acquired coolness was a finer thing and undoubtedly more useful than hotheaded gallantry though she admired the latter she was young and physical prowess appealed to her besides it had been displayed in saving her sisters life carroll and his comrade were men of varied and romantic experience and they possessed she fancied qualities not shared by all their fellows  wallace was splendid in the water she exclaimed uttering part of her thoughts aloud  i thought rather more of him in the city carroll replied that kind of thing was new to him and im inclined to believe that id have let the people he had to negotiate with have the mine for a good deal less than he eventually got for it but ive said something about that before and after all im not here to play boswell  the girl was surprised at the apt allusion it was not what she would have expected from the man as she had not wholly recovered her composure she forgot what vane had told her about him and her comment was an incautious one  how did you hear of him  carroll parried this with a smile  you dont suppose you can keep those old fellows to yourselvestheyre international but hadnt we better be getting on let me help you through the gap  they reached the dene some time later and mabel very much against her wishes was sent to bed shortly afterward carroll came across vane who had changed his clothes and was strolling up and down among the shrubberies  what are you doing here he asked  vane looked embarrassed  for one thing im keeping out of mrs chisholms way shes inclined to be effusive for another im trying to think out what i ought to do well have to pull out very shortly and i had meant to have an interview with evelyn today thats why i feel uncommonly annoyed with mopsy for falling in  carroll made a grimace  if thats how it strikes you any advice i could offer would be wasted a sensible man would consider it a promising opportunity  and trade upon it as you know there wasnt the slightest risk with branches that one could get hold of and a shelving bank almost within reach  do you really want the girl  that impressions firmly in my mind vane said curtly  then youd better pitch your quixotic notions overboard and tell her so  vane frowned but made no answer and carroll recognizing that his comrade was not inclined to be communicative left him pacing up and down     chapter xi  vane withdraws   dusk was drawing on but there was still a little light in the western sky when vane strolled along the terrace in front of the dene in the distance the ranks of fells rose black and solemn out of filmy trails of mist but the valley had faded to a trough of shadow a faint breeze was stirring and the silence was broken by the soft patter of withered leaves which fluttered down across the lawn vane noticed it all by some involuntary action of his senses for although at the time he was oblivious to his surroundings he afterward found that he could recall each detail of the scene with vivid distinctness he was preoccupied and eager but fully aware of the need for coolness for it was quite possible that he might fail in the task he had in hand  presently he saw evelyn for whom he had been waiting cross the opposite end of the terrace moving forward he joined her at the entrance to a shrubbery walk a big clipped yew with a recess in which a seat had been placed stood close by  i have been sitting with mopsy said evelyn she seems very little the worse for her adventurethanks to you she hesitated and her voice grew softer i owe you a heavy debti am very fond of mopsy  its a great pity she fell in vane declared curtly  evelyn looked at him in surprise she scarcely thought he could regret the efforts he had made on her sisters behalf but that was what his words implied he noticed her change of expression  the trouble is that the thing might seem to give me some claim on you and i dont want that he explained it cost me no more than a wetting i hadnt the least difficulty in getting her out  his companion was still puzzled she could find no fault with him for being modest about his exploit but that he should make it clear that he did not require her gratitude struck her as unnecessary  for all that you did bring her out she persisted even if it causes you no satisfaction the fact is of some importance to us  i dont seem to be beginning very fortunately what i mean is that i dont want to urge my claim if i have one id rather be taken on my merits he paused a moment with a smile thats not much better is it but it partly expresses what i feel leaving mopsy out altogether let me try to explaini dont wish you to be influenced by anything except your own idea of me im saying this because one or two points that seem in my favor may have a contrary effect  evelyn made no answer and he indicated the seat  wont you sit down i have something to say  the girl did as he suggested and his smile died away  would you be astonished if i were to ask you to marry me  he leaned against the smooth wall of yew looking down at her with an impressive steadiness of gaze she could imagine him facing the city men from whom he had extorted the full value of his mine in the same fashion and in a later instance so surveying the eddies beneath the osiers when he had gone to mabels rescue it was borne in upon her that they would better understand each other  no she answered if i must be candid i am not astonished then the color crept into her cheeks as she met his gaze i suppose it is an honor and it is undoubtedly atemptation  a temptation  yes said evelyn mustering her courage to face a crisis she had dreaded it is only due you that you should hear the truththough i think you suspect it besidesi have some liking for you  that is what i wanted you to own vane broke in  she checked him with a gesture her manner was cold and yet there was something in it that stirred him more than her beauty  after all she explained it does not go very far and you must try to understand i want to be quite honest and what i have to say isdifficult in the first place things are far from pleasant for me here i was expected to make a good marriage and i had my chance in london i refused to profit by it and now im a failure i wonder whether you can realize what a temptation it is to get away  vane frowned  yes he responded it makes me savage to think of it i can at least take you out of all this if you hadnt had a very fine courage you wouldnt have told me  evelyn smiled a curious wry smile  it has only prompted me to behave as most people would consider shamelessly but there are times when one must get above that point of view besides theres a reason for my candorhad you been a man of different stamp its possible that i might have been driven into taking the risk we should both have suffered for a time but we might have reached an understandingnot to intrude on each otherthrough open variance as it is i could not do you that injustice and i should shrink from marrying you with only a little cold liking  the man held himself firmly in hand her calmness had infected him and he felt that this was not an occasion for romantic protestations even had he felt capable of making them which was not the case as a matter of fact such things were singularly foreign to his nature  even that would go a long way with me if i could get nothing better he declared besides you might change i could surround you with some comfort i think i could promise not to force my company upon you i believe i could be kind  yes assented evelyn i shouldnt be afraid of harshness from you but it seems impossible that i should change you must see that you started handicapped from the beginning had i been free to choose it might have been different but i have lived for some time in shame and fear hating the thought that some one would be forced on me  he said nothing and she went on  must i tell you you are the man  his face grew hard and for a moment he set his lips tight it would have been a relief to express his feelings concerning his host just then  if you dont hate me for it now im willing to take the risk he said at length it will be my fault if you hate me in the future ill try not to deserve it  he fancied that she was yielding but she roused herself with an effort  no love on one side may go a long way if it is strong enoughbut it must be strong to overcome the many clashes of thought and will yoursshe looked at him steadilywould not stand the strain  vane started  you are the only woman i ever wished to marry he declared vehemently  he paused and spread out his hands  what can i say to convince you  im afraid its impossible if you had wanted me greatly you would have pressed the claim you had in saving mopsy and i should have forgiven you that you would have urged any and every claim as it is i suppose i am prettyher lips curled scornfullyand you find that some of your ideas and mine agree it isnt half enough shall i tell you that you are scarcely moved as yet  it flashed upon vane that he was confronted with the reality her beauty had appealed to him and her other qualitiesher reserved graciousness with its tinge of dignity her insight and her comprehensionhad also had their effect but they had only awakened admiration and respect he desired her as one desires an object for its rarity and preciousness but this as she had told him was not enough behind her physical and mental attributes and half revealed by them there was something deeper the real personality of the girl it was elusive mystic with a spark of immaterial radiance which might brighten human love with its transcendent glow but as he dimly realized if he won her by force it might recede and vanish altogether he could not with strong ardor compel its clearer manifestation  i think i am moved as much as it is possible for me to be  evelyn shook her head  no you will discover the difference some day and then you will thank me for leaving you your liberty now i beg you to leave me mine and let me go  vane stood silent a minute or two for the last appeal had stirred him to chivalrous pity he was shrewd enough to realize that if he persisted he could force her to come to him her father and mother were with him she had nothingno commonplace usefulness nor trained abilitiesto fall back on if she defied them but it was unthinkable that he should brutally compel her  well he yielded at length i must try to face the situation i want to assure you that it is not a pleasant one to me but theres another pointim afraid ive made things worse for you your people will probably blame you for sending me away  evelyn did not answer this and he broke into a grim smile  well he added i think i can save you any trouble on that scorethough the course im going to take isnt flattering if you look at it in one way i want you to leave me to deal with your father  he took her consent for granted and leaning down laid a hand lightly on her shoulder  you will try to forgive me for the anxiety i have caused you the time ive spent here has been very pleasant but im going back to canada in a day or two perhaps youll think of me without bitterness now and then  he turned away and evelyn sat still glad that the strain was over thinking earnestly the man was gentle and considerate as well as forceful and to some extent she liked him indeed she admitted that she had not met any man she liked as much but that was not going very far then she began to wonder at her candor and to consider if it had been necessary it was curious that this was the only man she had ever taken into her confidence it struck her that her next suitor would probably be a much less promising specimen on the other hand since her views on the subject differed from those her parents held it was consoling to remember that eligible suitors for the daughter of an impoverished gentleman were likely to be scarce  it had grown dark when she rose and entering the house went up to mabels room the girl looked at her sharply as she came in  so you have got rid of him she said i think youre very silly  how did you know evelyn asked with a start  i heard him walking up and down the terrace and i heard you go out you cant walk over raked gravel without making a noise he went along to join you and it was a good while before you came back at different times ive been waiting for this the last day or two  evelyn sat down with a rather strained smile  well i have sent him away  mabel regarded her indignantly  youll never get another chance like this one if id been in your place id have had wallace if it had cost me no end of trouble to get him he said something about its being a pity i wasnt older one day and i told him that i wasnt by any means as young as i looked if you had only taken him i could have worn decent frocks nobody could call the last one that  this was a favorite grievance and evelyn ignored it but mabel had more to say  i suppose she went on you dont know that wallace has been getting gerald out of trouble  are you sure of that  yes ill tell you what i know wallace saw gerald in londonhe told us thatand we all know that gerald couldnt pay his debts a little while ago you remember he came down to kendall and went on and stayed the next night with the claytons it isnt astonishing that he didnt come here after the row there was on the last occasion  go on prompted evelyn impatiently what has his visit to the claytons to do with it  well you dont know that i saw gerald in the afternoon after all hes the only brother ive got and as jim was going to the station with the trap i made him take me the claytons were in the garden we were scattered about and i heard frank and gerald who had strolled off from the others talking gerald was telling him about some things hed boughtthey must have been expensive because frank asked him where he got the money gerald laughed and said hed had an unexpected stroke of luck that had set him straight again now of course gerald got no money from home and if hed won it he would have told frank how he did so gerald always would tell a thing like that  evelyn was filled with confusion and hot indignation she had little doubt that mabels surmise was correct  i wonder whether he has told anybody though its scarcely likely  mabel laughed  of course he hasnt we all know what gerald is before i came home i asked him what he thought of wallace he said he was a good sort or something like that and i saw that he had a reason for saying it but he must go on in his patronizing style that wallace was rather colonial though he hadnt drifted too farnot beyond reclamation after all wallace was one ofusbefore he went out and if carrolls colonial hes the kind of man i like i was so angry with gerald i wanted to slap him  there was no doubt that mabel was a staunch partizan and evelyn sympathized with her she was of course acquainted with her brothers character and she was filled with indignant contempt for him it was intolerable that he should have allowed vane to discharge his debts and then have alluded to him in terms of indulgent condescension  it strikes me wallace ought to get his money back now that you have sent him away mabel added but of course thats most unlikely it wouldnt take gerald long to waste it  evelyn rose and making some excuse left the room she could feel her face growing hot and mabel had unusually keen eyes and precocious powers of deduction a suspicion which had troubled her more than geralds conduct had lately crept into her mind and it now thrust itself upon her attention several things pointed to the fact that her father had taken the same course her brother had done she felt that had she heard mabels information before the interview with vane she might have yielded to him in an agony of humiliation mabel had summed up the situation with stinging candor and crudityvane who had been defrauded was entitled to recover his money for a few moments evelyn was furiously angry with him and then growing calmer she recognized that this was unreasonable she could not imagine any idea of a compact originating with the man and he had quietly acquiesced in her decision  soon after she left her sister vane walked into the room which chisholm reserved for his own use it was handsomely furnished and the big lightoak writingtable and glassfronted cabinets were examples of artistic handicraft the sight of them jarred on vane who had already surmised that it was the women of the chisholm family who were expected to practise selfdenial chisholm was sitting at the table with some papers in front of him and a cigar in his hand and vane drew out a chair and lighted his pipe before he addressed him  ive made up my mind to sail on saturday instead of next week he said abruptly  you have decided rather suddenly havent you chisholm suggested  vane knew that what his host wished to know was the cause of the decision and he meant to come to the point he was troubled by no consideration for the man  the last news i had indicated that i was wanted he replied after all there is only one reason why i have abused mrs chisholms hospitality so long  well  you will remember what i asked you some time ago i had better say that i retire from the positionabandon the idea  chisholm started and his florid face grew redder while vane in place of embarrassment was conscious of a somewhat grim amusement it seemed curious that a man of chisholms stamp should have any pride  what am i to understand by that chisholm asked with some asperity  i think that what i said explained it bearing in mind your and mrs chisholms influence ive an idea that evelyn might have yielded if id strongly urged my suit but that was not by any means what i wanted id naturally prefer a wife who married me because she wished to do so thats why after thinking the thing over ive decided towithdraw  chisholm straightened himself in his chair in fiery indignation which he made no attempt to conceal  you mean that after asking my consent and seeing more of evelyn you have changed your mind cant you understand that its an unpardonable confessionone which i never fancied a man born and brought up in your station could have brought himself to make  vane looked at him with an impassive face  it strikes me as largely a question of termsi may not have used the right one now that you know how the matter stands you can describe it in any way that sounds nicest in regard to your other remark ive been in a good many stations and i must admit that until lately none of them were likely to promote much delicacy of sentiment  so it seems chisholm was almost too hot to sneer but cant you realize how your action reflects upon my daughter  vane held himself in hand he had only one object to divert chisholms wrath from evelyn to himself and he fancied that he was succeeding in this for the rest he was conscious of a strong resentment against the man evelyn had told him that he had started handicapped  it cant reflect upon her unless you talk about it and both you and mrs chisholm have sense enough to refrain from doing that he answered dryly i cant flatter myself that evelyn will grieve over me then his manner changed now well get down to business i dont purpose to call in that loan which will no doubt be a relief to you  he rose leisurely and strolled out of the room  shortly afterward he met carroll in the hall and the latter glanced at him sharply  what have you been doing he inquired theres a look in your eyes i seem to remember  vane laughed  i suppose ive been outraging the rules of decency but i dont feel ashamed ive been acting the uncivilized westerner though its possible that i rather strained the part to come to the point however we pull out for the dominion first thing tomorrow  carroll asked no further questions he did not think it would serve any purpose he contented himself with making arrangements for their departure which they took early on the morrow vane had a brief interview with mabel and then by her contrivance he secured a word or two with evelyn alone  it is possible he told her that you may hear some hard things of meand i count upon your not contradicting them after all i think you owe me that favor theres just another matternow that i wont be here to trouble you wont you try to think of me leniently  he held her hand for a moment and then turned away and a few minutes later he and carroll left the dene     chapter xii  in vancouver   about a fortnight after vanes return to vancouver he sat one evening on the veranda of nairns house in company with his host and carroll lazily looking down upon the inlet the days were growing shorter the air was clear and cool and the snow upon the heights across the still blue water was creeping lower down the clatter of a steamers winches rose sharply from the wharf and the sails of two schooners gleamed against the dark pines that overhang the narrows  in some respects vane was glad to be back in the western city at first the ease and leisure at the dene had their charm for him but by degrees he came to chafe at them the green english valley hemmed in by its sheltering hills was steeped in too profound a tranquillity the stream of busy life passed it by with scarcely an entering ripple to break its drowsy calm one found its atmosphere enervating dulling to the faculties in the new west however one was forcibly thrust into contact with a strenuous activity life was free and untrammeled there it flowed with a fierce joyousness in natural channels and one could feel the eager throb of it  yet the man was not content he had been to the mine and in going and coming he had ridden far over a very rough trail but the physical effort had not afforded a sufficient outlet for his pentup energies he had afterward lounged about the city for nearly a week and he found this becoming monotonous  nairn presently referred to one of the papers in his hand  horsfield has been bringing up that smelter project again and theres something to be said in favor of his views he remarked were paying a good deal for reduction  we couldnt keep a smelter going at present vane objected  there are two or three lowgrade mineral properties in the neighborhood of the clermont that have had very little development work done on them they cant pay freight on their raw product but im thinking that wed encourage their owners to open up the mines and wed get their business if we had a smelter handy  it wouldnt amount to much vane replied besides theres another objectionwe havent the money to put up a thoroughly efficient plant  horsfields ready to find part of it and to do the work  i know he is vane frowned it strikes me hes suspiciously anxious the arrangement he has in view would give him a pretty strong hold upon the company and there are ways in which he could squeeze us  its possible but looking at it as a purely personal matter there are inducements he could offer ye horsfields a man who has the handling of other folks money if he has no that much of his own it might be wise to stand in with him  so he hinted vane answered dryly  your argument was about the worst you could have used mr nairn carroll laughed  weel drawled nairn goodhumoredly im no urging it i would not see your partner make enemies for the want of a warning  hed probably do so in any case its a gift of his on the other hand its fortunate that he has a way of making friends the two things sometimes go together  vane turned to nairn with signs of impatience  it might save trouble if i state that while im a director of the clermont i expect to be content with a fair profit on my stock in the company  hes modest carroll commented what he means is that he doesnt propose to augment that profit by taking advantage of his position  its a creditable idea though im no sure its as common as might be desired while i have to thank ye for it i would not consider the explanation altogether necessary nairns eyes twinkled for a moment and then he turned seriously to vane now we come to another pointthe companys a small one the mine is doing satisfactorily and the moments favorable for the floating of mineral properties if we got an option on the halfdeveloped claims near the clermont and went into the market its likely that an issue of new stock would meet with the favor of investors  i suppose so vane responded ill support such a scheme when i can see how an increased capital could be used to advantage and am convinced about the need for a smelter at present thats not the case  i mentioned it as a dutyyell hear more of it for the rest im inclined to agree with ye  a few minutes later nairn went into the house with carroll and as they entered he glanced at his companion  in the present instance mr vanes views are sound he said but i see difficulties before him in his business career  so do i smiled carroll when he grapples with them it will be by a frontal attack  a bit of compromise is judicious now and then  in a general way its not likely to appeal to vane when he cant get through by direct means therell be something wrecked youd better understand what kind of man he is  nairn made a sign of concurrence  its no the first time ive been enlightened upon the point  shortly after they had disappeared miss horsfield came out of another door and vane rose when she approached him he had always found her a pleasant companion  mrs nairn told me i would find you and the others on the veranda she informed him she said she would join you presently it is too fine an evening to stay in  im alone as you see nairn and carroll have just deserted me but i cant complain what pleases me most about this house is that you can do what you like in it andwithin limitsthe same thing applies to this city  jessy laughed as she sank gracefully into the chair he drew forward she was as a rule deliberate in her movements and her pose was usually an effective one  yes she replied i think that would please you but how long have you been back  a fortnight yesterday  there was a hint of reproach in jessys glance  then i think mrs nairn might have brought you over to see us  vane wondered whether she meant that she was surprised that he had not come of his own accord he felt mildly flattered she was interesting and knew how to listen sympathetically as well as how to talk and she was also a lady of station in the western city  i was away at the mine a good deal of the time he explained  i wonder if you are sorry to get back  turning a little vane indicated the climbing city rising tier on tier above its waterfront and then the broad expanse of blue inlet and the faint white line of towering snow  wouldnt anything i could say in praise of vancouver be a trifle superfluous he asked  jessy recognized that he had parried her question neatly but this did not deter her she was anxious to learn whether he had felt any regret at leaving england or to be more concise if there was anybody in that country from whom he had reluctantly parted she admitted that the man attracted her there was a breezy freshness about him which he had brought from the rocks and woods and though she was acquainted with a number of young men whose conversation was characterized by snap and sparkle they needed toning down this miner was set apart from them by something which he had doubtless acquired in youth in the older land  that wasnt quite what i meant she returned we dont always want to be flattered im in search of information you told me that you had been eight or nine years in this country and life must be rather different yonder how did it and the people you belong to strike you after the absence  its difficult to explain vane replied with an air of amused reflection which hinted that he meant to get away from the point on the whole i think im more interested in the question as to how i struck them its curious that whereas some people here insist on considering me english ive a suspicion that they looked upon me as a typical colonial there  one wouldnt like to think you resented it  how could i this land sheltered me when i was an outcast it provided me with a living widened my views and set me on my feet  ah murmured jessy you are the kind we dont mind taking in the others go back and try to forget us or abuse us but you havent given me very much information yet  well drawled vane the best comparison is supplied by my first remarkthat in this city you can do what you like youre rather fenced in yonder if youre of a placid disposition that no doubt is comforting because it shuts out unpleasant things on the other hand if you happen to be restless and active the fences are inconvenient for you cant always climb overand it is not considered proper to break them down still having admitted that im proud of the old land if one has means and will conform its the finest country in the world its only the fences that irritate me  fences would naturally be obnoxious to you but we have some here  theyre generally built loose of splitrails and not nailed an energetic man can pull off a bar or two and stride over if its necessary he can afterward put them up again and theres no harm done  would you do the latter  vanes expression changed  no i think if there were anything good on the other side id widen the gap so that the less agile and the needy could crawl through he smiled at her you see i owe some of them a good deal they were the only friends i had when i first tramped jaded and footsore about the province  jessy was pleased with his answer she had heard of the free hospitality of the bush choppers and she thought it was a graceful thing that he should acknowledge his debt to them she was also pleased that she could lead him on to talk unreservedly  now at last youll be content to rest a while she suggested i dare say you deserve it  its strange that you should say that because just before you came out of the house i was thinking that id sat still long enough its a thing that gets monotonous one must keep going on  take care that you dont walk over a precipice some day when you have left all the fences behind but ive kept you from your meditations and i had better see if mrs nairn is coming  he was sitting alone lighting a cigar when he noticed a girl whose appearance seemed familiar in the road below moving along the veranda he recognized her as kitty and hastily crossed the lawn toward her she was accompanied by a young man whom vane had once or twice seen in the city and she greeted him with evident pleasure  tom she introduced when they had exchanged a few words this is mr vane turning to vane she added mr drayton  vane liked the mans face and manner he shook hands with him and then looked back at kitty  what are you doing now and how are little elsie and her mother  kittys face clouded  mrs marvins dead elsies with some friends at spokane and i think shes well looked after ive given up the stage tomshe explained shylydidnt like it now im with some people at a ranch near the fraser on the westminster road there are two or three children and im very fond of them  she wont be there long drayton interposed ive wanted to meet you for some time mr vane they told me at the office that you were away  vane smiled comprehendingly  i suppose my congratulations will not be out of place wont you ask me to the wedding  kitty blushed  will you come  try  theres nobody we would rather see declared drayton im heavily in your debt mr vane  pshaw rejoined vane come to see me any timetomorrow if you can manage it  drayton said that he would do so and shortly afterward he and kitty moved away vane turned back across the lawn but he was not aware that jessy horsfield had watched the meeting from the veranda and had recognized kitty whom she had once seen at the station she had already ascertained that the girl had arrived in vancouver in vanes company and in view of the opinion she had formed of him this somewhat puzzled her but she decided that one must endeavor to be charitable besides having closely watched the little group she was inclined to believe from the way vane shook hands with the man that there was no danger to be apprehended from kitty     chapter xiii  a new project   vane was sitting alone in the room set apart for the clermont company in nairns office when drayton was shown in he took the chair vane indicated and lighted a cigar the latter gave him  now he began with some diffidence you cut me off short when i met you the other day and one of my reasons for coming over was to get through with what i was saying then its just thisi owe you a good deal for taking care of kitty shes very grateful and thinks no end of you i want to say ill always feel that you have a claim on me  vane smiled at him it was evident that kitty had taken her lover into her confidence with regard to her trip aboard the sloop and that she had done so said a good deal for her he thought one might have expected a certain amount of halfjealous resentment or even faint suspicion on the mans part but there was no sign of this drayton believed in kitty and that was strongly in his favor  it didnt cost me any trouble vane replied we were coming to vancouver anyway  draytons embarrassment became more obvious  it cost you some moneythere were the tickets now i feel that i have to  nonsense when you are married to miss blake you can pay me back if it will be a relief to you whens the wedding to be  in a couple of months answered drayton he saw that it would be useless to protest im a clerk in the winstanley mills and as one of the staff is going ill get a move up then we are to be married as soon as i do  he said a little more on the same subject and then after a few moments silence he added  i wonder if the clermont business keeps your hands full mr vane  it doesnt its a fact im beginning to regret  drayton appeared to consider  well he said people seem to regard you as a rising man with snap in him and theres a matter i might perhaps bring before you let me explain im a clerk on small pay but ive taken an interest outside my routine work in the lumber trade of this province and its subsidiary branches i figured any knowledge i could pick up might stand me in some money some day so farhe smiled ruefullyit hasnt done so  go on prompted vane his curiosity was aroused  it has struck me that pulping sprucepaper spruceis likely to be scarce presently the supplys not unlimited and the worlds consumption is going up by jumps  theres a good deal of timber you could use for pulp in british columbia alone vane interposed  sure but theres not a very great deal that could be milled into highgrade paper pulp and its getting rapidly worked out in most other countries then as a rule its mixed up with firs cedars and cypresses and that means the cutting of logging roads to each cluster of milling trees theres another pointa good deal of the spruce lies back from water or a railroad and in some cases it would be costly to bring in a milling plant or to pack the pulp out  thats obvious anyway where you would have to haul every pound of freight over a breakneck divide  drayton leaned forward confidentially  then if one struck highgrade paper sprucea whole valley full of itwith water power and easy access to the sea there ought to be money in the thing  yes vane answered with growing interest that strikes me as very probable  i believe i could put you on the track of such a valley  vane looked at him thoughtfully  wed better understand each other do you want to sell me your knowledge and have you offered it to anybody else  his companion answered with the candor he expected  kitty and i arent going to find it easy to get alongrents are high in this city i want to give her as much as i can but im willing to leave you to do the square thing the winstanley people have their hands full and wont look at any outside matter and the one or two people ive spoken to dont seem anxious to consider it its mighty hard for a little man to launch a project  it is vane agreed sympathetically  then drayton continued the ideas not my own it was a mineral prospectora relative of minewho struck the valley on his last trip hes an old man and he came down played out and sick now i guess hes slowly dying he paused a moment would you like to see him  ill go with you now if its convenient vane replied  drayton said that he might spare another halfhour without getting into trouble and they crossed the city to where a row of squalid frame shacks stood on its outskirts in the one they entered a gaunt man with grizzled hair lay upon a rickety bed a glance showed vane that the man was very frail and the harsh cough that he broke into as the colder air from outside flowed in made the fact clearer drayton hastily shutting the door and explaining the cause of the visit motioned vane to sit down  ive heard of you said the prospector fixing his eyes on vane youre the man who located the clermontand put the project through you had the luck ive been among the ranges half my lifeand you can see how much ive made of it when i struck a claim that was worth anything somebody else got the money  vane had reasons for believing that this was not an uncommon experience  well the man continued you look straightand ive got to take some chances its my last stake well get down to business ill tell you about that spruce  he spoke for a few minutes and then asked abruptly  what are you going to offer  vane had not been certain that he would make any offer at all but as had befallen him once or twice before the swift decision flashed instinctively into his mind  if i find that the timber and its location come up to your account of it ill pay you so many dollars downwhatever we can agree onwhen i get my lease from the land office then ill make another equal payment the day we start the mill but i dont bind myself to record the timber or to put up a mill unless im convinced that its worth while  id rather take less money and have a small share in the concern and drayton must stand in  its a question of terms vane replied ill consider your views  they discussed it for a while and when they had at length arrived at a provisional understanding the prospector made a sign of acquiescence  well let it go at that but the thing will take time and ill never get the money if you exercise your option youll sure pay it down to seely  celias his daughter drayton explained he has no one else shes a waitress at the  house he named a hotel of no great standing in the city comes home at nights and looks after him as best she can  vane glanced round the room it was evident that celias earnings were small but he noticed several things which suggested that she had lavished loving care upon the sick man probably at the cost of severe selfdenial this was what he would have expected for he had spent most of his nine years in canada among the people who toil the hardest for the least reward  yes he answered ill promise that but as i pointed out while we have agreed on the two payments i reserve the right of deciding what share your daughter and drayton are to have within the limits sketched out i cant fix it definitely until ive seen the timberyoull have to trust me  the prospector once more looked at him steadily and then implied by a gesture that he was satisfied he was not in a position to dictate terms but his confidence had its effect on the man in whom he reposed it  theres another thing youll do all you can to find that spruce  yes vane promised  the man fumbled under his pillow and produced a piece cut out from a map of the province with rough pencil notes on the back of it  it was on my last prospecting trip i found the spruce he said id been looking round and i figured id strike down to the coast over the range the creeks were full up with snowwater and as i was held up here and there before i could get across provisions began to run short then i fell down a gulch and hurt my knee and as i had to leave my tent and it rained most of the while i lay in the wet at nights halffed with my knee getting worse by and by i fell sick but i had to get out of the mountains and i was pushing on for the straits when i struck the valley where the spruce is after that i got kind of muddled in the head but i went down a long valley on an easy grade and struck some siwash curing the last of the salmon the trouble is i was too sick to figure exactly where the small inlet they were camped by lies they took me back with them to their rancherieyou could find thatand sailed me across to comox i came down on a steamboat and the doctor told me id made my last journey  vane could sympathize the narrative had been crudely matteroffact but he had been out on the prospecting trail often enough to fill in the details the sick man omitted he had slept in the rain very scantily fed and he could picture the starving man limping along in an agony of pain and exhaustion with an injured knee over boulders and broken rock and through dense tangles of underbrush strewed with mighty fallen logs  how far was the valley from the inlet he asked  i cant tell you i think i was three days on the trail but it might have been more i was too sick to remember anyway there was a creek you could run the logs down  well how far was the inlet from the rancherie  i was in the canoe part of one night and some of the next day i cant get it any clearer we had a fair breeze guess thirty miles wouldnt be far out  thats something to go upon how much does your daughter earn  it was an abrupt change of subject but the man answered as vane had expected the girls wages might maintain her economically but it was difficult to see how she could provide for her sick father the latter seemed to guess vanes thoughts for he spoke again  if id known i was done for when i was up in the bush i wouldnt have pushed on quite so fast he said with expressive simplicity  vane rose  if drayton will come along with me ill send him back with a hundred dollars its part of the first payment your getting it now should make things a little easier for celia  but you havent located the spruce yet  im going to locate it if the things anyway possible vane shook hands with the man i expect to get off up the straits very shortly  the prospector looked at him with relief and gratitude in his eyes  youre whiteand i guess youd be mighty hard to beat  when they reached the rutted street which was bordered on one side by great fir stumps drayton glanced at vane with open admiration  im glad i brought you across you have a way of getting hold of peoplemaking them believe in you hartley hasnt a word in writing but he knows you mean to act square with him kitty felt the same thingit was why she came down in the sloop with you  vane smiled though there was a trace of embarrassment in his manner  now that you mention it i dont think hartley was wise and you were equally confiding we have only arrived at a rather indefinite understanding about your share  well leave it at that i havent struck anybody else in this city who would hear about the thing anyway id prefer a few shares in the concern as mentioned instead of money if you get the thing on foot i guess it will go  wont they raise trouble at the mill about your staying out vane inquired we have still to go for that hundred dollars  drayton owned that it might be advisable to hurry and they set off for the business quarter of the city  during the remainder of the day vane was busy on board the sloop but in the evening he walked over to horsfields house with mrs nairn and found jessy and her brother at home horsfield presently took vane to his smokingroom  about that smelter he began havent you made up your mind yet the things been hanging fire a long while  isnt it a matter for the board vane asked suggestively there are several directors  horsfield laughed  well face the fact theyll do what you decide on  vane did not reply to this  well he said at present we couldnt keep a smelter big enough to be economical going and im doubtful whether we would get much ore from the other properties you were talking about to nairn  did he say it was my idea  he didnt id reasons for assuming it those properties however are of no account  horsfield made no comment but waited expectantly and vane went on  if it seems possible that we can profitably increase our output later on by means of further capital well put up a smelter but in that case it might be economical to do the work ourselves  who would superintend it  i would if necessary with the assistance of an engineer used to such plant  horsfield smiled in a significant manner  arent you inclined to take hold of too much when you have plenty in your hands its good policy to leave a little for somebody else sometimes the person who benefits is willing to reciprocate  the hint was plain and nairn had said sufficient on another occasion to make it clearer but vane did not respond  if we gave the work out it would be on an open tender he declared there would be no reason why you shouldnt make a bid  horsfield found it difficult to conceal his disgust he had no desire to bid on an open tender which would prevent his obtaining anything beyond the market price  the question must stand over until i come back vane went on im going up the west coast shortly and may be away some time  they left the smokingroom shortly afterward and when they strolled back to the others vane sat down near jessy  i hear you are going away she began  yes im going to look for pulping timber  but what do you want with pulping timber  it can sometimes be converted into money  isnt there every prospect of your obtaining a good deal already are you never satisfied  i suppose im open to take as much as i can get  vane answered with an air of humorous reflection the reason probably is that ive had very little until lately still i dont think its altogether the money that is driving me  if its the restlessness you once spoke of you ought to put a check on it and try to be content theres danger in the longing to be always going on  its a common idea that a small hazard gives a thing a spice  jessy shot a swift glance at him and she had as he noticed expressive eyes  be careful she advised after all its wiser to keep within safe limits and not climb over too many fences she paused and her voice grew softer you have friends who would be sorry if you got hurt  the man was stirred she was alluring physically while something in her voice had its effect on him evelyn however still occupied his thoughts and he smiled at his companion  thank you i like to believe it  then mrs nairn and horsfield crossed the room toward them and the conversation became general     chapter xiv  vane sails north   on the evening of vanes departure he walked out of nairns room just as dusk was falling his host was with him and when they entered an adjacent room the elder mans face relaxed into a smile as he saw jessy horsfield talking to his wife vane stopped a few minutes to speak to them and it was jessy who gave the signal for the group to break up  i must go she said to mrs nairn ive already stayed longer than i intended ill let you have those patterns back in a day or two  mair patterns nairn exclaimed with dry amusement its the second lot this week yere surely industrious jessy womenhe addressed vanehave curious notions of economy they will spend a month knitting a thing to give to somebody who does no want it when they could buy it for half a dollar done better by machinery im no saying however that it does no keep them out of mischief  jessy laughed  i dont think many of us are industrious in that way now after all isnt it a pity that so many of the beautiful old handicrafts are dying out no loom for instance could turn out some of the things your wife makes theyre matchless  she has an aumrieye can translate it bureaufull of them its no longer customary to scatter them over the house if ye mean to copy the lot ye have a task that will take ye most a lifetime  mrs nairns smile was half a sigh  there were no books and no many amusements when i was young we sat through the long winter forenights counting stitches in the old gray house at burnfoot under the scottish moors that my dear was thirty years ago  she shook hands with vane as he left the house with jessy and standing on the stoop she watched them cross the lawn  im thinking yell no see so much of jessy for the next few weeks nairn remarked dryly has she shown ye any of yon knickknacks when she has finished them  his wife shook her head at him reproachfully  alic she admonished yere now and then hasty in jumping at conclusions  maybe im no infallible but the fault ye mention is no common in the land where we were born im no denying that jessy has enterprise but how far it will carry her in this case is mair than i can tell  he smiled as he recalled a scene at the station some time ago and mrs nairn looked up at him  what is amusing you alic  it was just a bit idea no worth the mentioning i think it would no count he paused and added with an air of reflection a young mans heart is whiles inconstant and susceptible  mrs nairn ignoring the last remark went into the house in the meanwhile jessy and vane walked down the road until they stopped at a gate jessy held out her hand  im glad i met you tonight she said you will allow me to wish you every success  there was a softness in her voice which vane wholly failed to notice though he was aware that she was pretty and artistically dressed this was possibly why she made him think of evelyn  thank you he replied its nice to feel that one has the sympathy of ones friends  he turned away and jessy stood watching him as he strode down the road noticing though it was getting dark the free vigor of his movements there was she thought something in his fine poise and swing that set him apart from other men she knew none of them walked or carried himself as vane did she was however forced to recognize that although he had answered her courteously there had been no warmth in his words as a matter of fact vane just then was conscious of a slight relief he admired jessy and he liked nairn and his wife but they belonged to the city and he was glad on the whole to leave it behind he was going back to the shadowy woods where men lived naturally the lust of fresh adventure was strong in him  on reaching the wharf he found kitty with celia hartley whom he had not met hitherto awaiting him with carroll and drayton a boat lay at the steps and he and carroll rowed the others off to the sloop the moon was just rising from behind the black firs at the inner end of the inlet and a little cold wind that blew down across them faintly scented with resinous fragrance stirred the water into tiny ripples that flashed into silvery radiance here and there lights gleamed on the forestays of vessels whose tall spars were etched in high black tracery against the dusky blue of the sky athwart which there streamed the long smoke trail of a steamer passing out through the narrows  kitty urged by drayton broke into a little song with a smooth swinging cadence that went harmoniously with the measured splash of oars and vane enjoyed it all the city was dropping behind him he felt himself at liberty carroll was a tried comrade the others were simple people whose views were more or less his own besides it was a glorious night and kitty sang charmingly  a soft glow shone out from the skylights to welcome them as they approached the sloop when laughing gaily they clambered on board carroll led the way to the tiny saloon which just held them all it was brightly lighted by two nickeled lamps flowers were fastened against the paneling and clusters of them stood upon the table which was covered with a spotless cloth what was even more unusual it was daintily set out with good china and silver vane took the head of it and carroll modestly explained that only part of the supper had been prepared by himself the rest he had obtained in the city out of regard for the guests who he added had not lived in the bush presently vane who had been busy talking to the others turned to celia  now that we can see each other better i think you ought to recognize me miss hartley  the girl was young and attractive and she blushed prettily  i do of course but i thought id wait until i saw whether you remembered me  why should you wait  celia looked confused  its two or three years since ive seen you and ive left that place  vane laughed he had made her acquaintance at a workmans hotel where she was engaged when he was differently situated and he fancied that she was diffident about recalling the fact now that he was obviously prosperous  well he responded its only fair that i should give you supper for once ive always had an idea that you brought me more dessert than i was really entitled to  it was because you werecivil celia explained though her expression suggested that the word did not convey all she meant still i cant complain of the rest of the boys  i wonder if you remember how astonished you were the first time you brought me supper  celia smiled and vane turned to the others  id just come in on a schooner wed had wild weather during which the galley fire was generally washed out and the cook had some difficulty in getting us anything to eat miss hartley brought me a double supply she must have thought i needed it  there was mighty little left the girl retorted  the others laughed but vane went on in a reminiscent manner  i was wearing a pair of old gumboots with one toe torn off and my jacket was split right up the back when i went uptown the next day people looked at me suspiciously the trade of the province is pretty bad when you see men in vancouver dressed as i was the fact that sticks in my mind most clearly however is that on the following morning when id arranged to see a man who might give me a job miss hartley offered to sew up the tear for me i was uncommonly glad to let her  celia colored again but it was evident that she was not displeased kitty smiled at him and there was appreciation in draytons eyes  were you surprised when she offered to sew it kitty inquired  now you have helped me on to what i wanted to say i wasnt surprisedhow could i be the kind of people id met out here had seldom much money or much of anything but i had generally less and they held out a hand when i needed it and gave me what they had it stirs me in a way that almost hurts to think of it  then carroll started the general chatter which went on after the meal was finished and nobody appeared to notice that kitty sat with her hand in draytons amid the happy laughter even celia who had her grief to grapple with smiled bravely vane had given them champagne the best in the city though they drank sparingly and at last when celia made a move to rise drayton stood up with his glass in his hand  we must go but theres something to be done he announced its to thank our host and wish him success its a little boat hes sailing in but shes carrying a big freight if our good wishes count for anything  they emptied the glasses and vane replied  my success is yours you have all a stake in the venture and that piles up my responsibility if the spruce is still in existence ive got to find it  and youre going to find it declared drayton its a sure thing  vane divided the flowers between celia and kitty but when they went up on deck kitty raised one bunch and kissed it  tom wont mind she laughed take that one back from celia and mefor luck  they got down into the boat and carroll handed them a basket of crockery and table linen which drayton promised to have delivered at the hotel then while the girls called back to vane drayton rowed away and the boat was fading out of sight when kittys voice once more reached the men on board she was singing a wellknown jacobite ballad  carroll laughed softly  it strikes me as appropriate he said considering what his highland followers suffered on his account and what the women thought of him some of the virtues they credited the young chevalier with must have been real he raised his hand you may as well listen  vane stood still a moment with the blood hot in his face as the refrain rang more clearly across the sparkling water  better loed ye cannot be will ye no come back to me  i dont know whether you feel flattered but ive an idea that kitty and celia would go through fire for you and drayton seems to share their confidence carroll went on in his most matteroffact tone  celia mended my jacket vane replied i got a months work as a result of it then he began to shake the mainsail loose i believe we both went rather far in our talk tonight but we have got to find the spruce  so you have said already hadnt you better heave the boom up with the topping lift  they got the mainsail onto her broke out the anchor and set the jib and as the boat slipped away before a freshening breeze vane sat at the helm while carroll stood on the foredeck coiling up the gear the moon was higher now the broad sail gleamed a silvery gray the ripples which were getting bigger flashed and sparkled as they streamed back from the bows and the lights of the city dropped fast astern vane was conscious of a keen exhilaration he had started on a new adventure he was going back to the bush and he knew that no matter how his life might change the wilderness would always call to him in spite of this however he was as he had said conscious of an unusual responsibility hitherto he had fought for what he could get for himself but now kittys future partly depended on his efforts and his success would be of vast importance to celia  he had a very friendly feeling toward both the girls indeed all the women he had met of late had attracted him in different ways it was hard to believe that any of them possessed unlovable qualities though there was not one among them to compare with evelyn whatever he liked most in the othersintelligence beauty tenderness couragereminded him of her kitty he thought belonged to the hearth she personified gentleness and solace it would be her part to diffuse cheerful comfort in the home jessy would make an ambitious mans companion a clever counselor who would urge him forward if he lagged celia he had not placed yet but evelyn stood apart from all  she appealed less to his senses and intellect than she did to a sublimated something in the depths of his nature and it somehow seemed fitting that her image should materialize before his mental vision as the sloop drove along under the cloudless night sky while the moonlight poured down glamour on the shining water evelyn harmonized with such things as these  it was true that she had repulsed him but that he felt was what he deserved for entering into an alliance against her with her venial father he was glad now that he had acquiesced in her dismissal of him since to have stood firm and broken her to his will would have brought disaster upon both of them he felt that she had not wholly escaped him after all by and by he would go back and seek her favor by different means then she might perhaps forgive him and listen  the breeze came down fresher as they drove out through the narrows carroll had gone below and brushing his thoughts aside vane busied himself hauling in some of the mainsheet while the water splashed more loudly beneath the bows the great black firs rolled by in somber masses over his port hand and presently the last of the lights were blotted out he was alone flitting swiftly and smoothly across the glittering sea     chapter xv  the first misadventure   the breeze freshened fiercely with the red and fiery dawn vane who had gone below was advised of it by being flung off the locker in the saloon where he sat with coffee and crackers before him the jug overturning spilled its contents upon him and the crackers were scattered but he picked himself up in haste and scrambled out into the well he found the sloop slanted over with a good deal of her lee deck submerged in rushing foam and carroll bracing himself against the strain upon the tiller to windward the sea looked as if it had been strewed with feathers for there were flecks and blurs of white everywhere  ill let her come up when youre ready carroll shouted wed better get some sail off her if we mean to hold on to the mast  he thrust down his helm and the sloop forging round to windward rose upright with her heavy mainboom banging to and fro after that they were desperately busy for a few minutes vane wished that they had engaged a hand in vancouver instead of waiting to hire a siwash somewhere up the coast there was the headsail to haul to windward which was difficult and the mainsheet to get in then the two men standing on the slippery inclined deck struggled hard to haul the canvas down to the boom the jerking spar smote them in the ribs once or twice the reefing tackle beneath it was torn from their hands but they mastered the sail tying two reefs in it to reduce its size and the craft drove away with her lee rail just awash  youd better go down and get some crackers vane advised his comrade youll find them rolling up and down the floor i spilled the coffee but perhaps the kettles still on the stove anyhow you may not have an opportunity later  it looks like that carroll agreed the winds backing northward and that means more of it before long you can call if you want me  he disappeared below and vane sat at the helm with a frown on his face an angry coppery glare streamed down upon the whiteflecked water which gleamed in the lurid light it was very cold but there was a wonderful quality that set the blood tingling in the nipping air even upon the high peaks and in the trackless bush one fails to find the bracing freshness that comes with the dawn at sea  vane however knew that the breeze would increase and draw ahead which was unfortunate because they would have to beat fighting for every fathom they slowly made there was no help for it and he buttoned his jacket against the spray by the time carroll came up the sloop was plunging sharply pitching showers of stinging brine all over her when the bows went down they drove her at it stubbornly most of the day making but little to windward while the seas got bigger and whiter until they had some trouble to keep the light boat they carried upon the deluged deck at last when she came bodily aft amid a frothing cascade which poured into the well vane brought the sloop round and they stretched away to eastward until they could let go the anchor in smooth water beneath a wall of rock they were very wet and were stiff with cold for winter was drawing near  well get supper said vane if the breeze drops a little at dusk which is likely well go on again  having eaten little since dawn they enjoyed the meal and carroll would have been content to remain at anchor afterward the tiny saloon was comfortably warm and he thought it would be pleasanter to lounge away the evening on a locker with his pipe than to sit amid the bitter spray at the helm the breeze had fallen a little but the firs in a valley ashore were still wailing loudly vane however was proof against his companions hints  with a head wind well be some time working up to the rancherie and then we have thirty miles of coast to search for the inlet hartley reached after that theres the valley to locate he was uncertain how far it lay from the beach  it couldnt be very far you wouldnt expect a man who was sick and badly lame to make any great pace  i can imagine a man who knew he must reach the coast before he starved making a pretty vigorous effort if he were workedup and desperate the pain might turn him savage and drive him on instead of stopping him do you remember the time we crossed the divide in the snow  i could remember it if i wanted to carroll answered with a shiver as it happens thats about the last thing im anxious to do  the trouble is that there are a good many valleys in this strip of country and we may have to try a number before we strike the right one winters not far off and i cant spend very much time over this search as soon as the man we put in charge of the mine has tried his present system long enough to give us something to figure on i want to see what can be done to increase our output we havent marketed very much refined metal yet  theres no doubt that it would be advisable carroll answered thoughtfully as ive pointed out you have spent a good deal of the cash you got when you turned the clermont over to the company in fact thats one reason why i didnt try to head off this timberhunting scheme you cant spend much over the search and if the spruce comes up to expectations you ought to get it back it would be a fortunate change after your extravagance in england  vane frowned  thats a subject i dont want to talk about well go up and see what the weathers like  carroll shivered when they stood in the well it was falling dusk and the sky was a curious cold shadowy blue a nipping wind came down across the darkening firs ashore but there was no doubt that it had fallen somewhat and carroll resigned himself when vane began to pull the tiers off the mainsail  in a few minutes they were under way the sloop heading out toward open water with two reefs down in her mainsail a gray and ghostly shape of slanted canvas that swept across the dim furrowed plain of sea by midnight the breeze was as strong as ever but they had clear moonlight and they held on the craft plunging with flooded decks through the white combers while carroll sat at the helm battered by spray and stung with cold  when vane came up an hour or two later the sea was breaking viciously carroll would have put up his helm and run for shelter had the decision been left to him but he saw his comrades face in the moonlight and refrained from any suggestion of that nature there was a spice of dogged obstinacy in vane which although on the whole it made for success occasionally drove him into needless difficulties they held on and soon after day broke with its first red flush ominously high in the eastern sky they stretched in toward the land with a somewhat sheltered bay opening up beyond a foamfringed point ahead of them carroll glanced dubiously at the white turmoil in the midst of which black fangs of rock appeared  will she weather the point on this tack he asked  shell have to well have smoother water to work through once were round and the tides helping her  they drove on though it occurred to carroll that they were not opening up the bay very rapidly the light was growing and he could now discern the orderly phalanxes of whitetopped combers that crumbled into a chaotic spouting on the points outer end it struck him that the sloop would not last long if she touched bottom there but once more after a glance at vanes face he kept silent after all vane was leader and when he looked as he did then he usually resented advice the mouth of the bay grew wider until carroll could see most of the forestgirt shore on one side of it but the surf upon the point was growing unpleasantly near wisps of spray whirled away from it and vanished among the scrubby firs clinging to the fissured crags behind the sloop however was going to windward for vane was handling her with nerve and skill she had almost cleared the point when there was a rattle and a bang inside of her carroll started  its the centerboard coming up it must have touched a boulder  then jump down and lift it before it strikes another and bends cried vane shes far enough to windward to keep off the beach without it  carroll went below and hove up the centerboard which projected several feet beneath the bottom of the craft but he was not satisfied that the sloop was far enough off the beach as vane seemed to be and he got out into the well as soon as possible  the worst of the surf was abreast of their quarter now and lesstroubled water stretched away ahead carroll had hardly noticed this however when there was a second heavy crash and the sloop stopped suddenly the comber to windward that should have lifted her up broke all over her flinging the boat on deck upon the saloon skylight and pouring inches deep over the coaming into the well vane was hurled from the tiller his wet face was smeared with blood from a cut on his forehead but he seized a big oar to shove the sloop off when she swung upright moved and struck again the following sea hove her up there was a third less violent crash and as vane dropped the oar and grasped the helm she suddenly shot ahead  shell go clear he shouted jump below and see if shes damaged  carroll got no farther than the scuttle for the saloon floorings on the depressed side were already awash and he could hear an ominous splashing and gurgling  its pouring into her he cried  then youll have to pump  we passed an opening some miles to lee wouldnt it be better if you ran back there carroll suggested  no i wont run a yard theres another inlet not far ahead and well stand on until we reach it id put her on the beach here only that shed go to pieces with the first shift of the wind to westward  carroll agreed with this opinion but there is a great difference between running to leeward with the sea behind the vessel and thrashing to windward when it is ahead and he hesitated  get the pump started were going on vane said impatiently  fortunately the pump was a powerful one of the semirotary type and they had nearly two miles of smoother water before they stretched out of the bay upon the other tack when they did so carroll glancing down again through the scuttle could not flatter himself that he had reduced the water it was comforting however to see that it had not increased though he did not expect that state of affairs to last when they drove out into broken water he found it difficult to work the crank the plunges threw him against the coaming and the sea poured in over it continually there are not many men who feel equal to determined toil before their morning meal and the physical slackness is generally more pronounced if they have been up most of the preceding night but carroll recognized that he had no choice there was too much sea for the boat even if they could have launched her and he could make out no spot on the beach where it seemed possible to effect a landing if they ran the sloop ashore as a result of this it behooved him to pump  after half an hour of it he was breathless and exhausted and vane took his place the sea was higher the sloop wetter than she had been and there was no doubt that the water was rising fast inside of her carroll wondered how far ahead the inlet lay and the next two hours were anxious ones to both of them turn about they pumped with savage determination and went back gasping to the helm to thrash the boat on they drove her remorselessly and she swept through the combers tilted and streaming while the spray scourged the helmsmans face as he gazed to weather the mens arms and shoulders ached from working in a cramped position but there was no help for it they toiled on furiously until at last the crest of a crag for which they were heading sloped away in front of them  a few minutes later they drove past the end of it into a broad lane of water the wind was suddenly cut off the combers fell away and the sloop crept slowly up the inlet which wound green and placid among the hills with long ranks of firs dropping steeply to the edge of the water vane loosed the pump handle and striding to the scuttle looked down at the flood which splashed languidly to and fro below  it strikes me as fortunate that were in he commented another halfhour would have seen the end of her let her come up a little theres a smooth beach to yonder cove  she slid in quietly scarcely rippling the smooth surface of the tiny basin and carroll laid her on the beach  now advised vane well drop the boom on the shore side to keep her from canting over and then well get breakfast well see where shes damaged when the tide ebbs  as most of their stores had lain in the flooded lockers from which there had been no time to extricate them the meal was not an appetizing one they were however glad to have it and rowing ashore afterward they lay on the shingle in the sunshine while the sloop was festooned with their drying clothes there was no wind in that deep hollow and they were thankful for the weather was already getting cold  if she has only split a plank or two we can patch her up vane remarked there are all the tools well want in the locker  where will you get new planks carroll inquired i dont think we have any spikes that would go through the frames  that is the trouble i expect ill have to make a trip across to comox for them in a sea canoe were sure to come across a few siwash somewhere in the neighborhood then he knit his brows i cant say that this expedition is beginning fortunately  theres no doubt on that point carroll agreed  well the sloop has to be patched up and until i find that spruce im going onanyway as long as the provisions hold out if were not through with the business then well come back again  carroll made no comment it was not worth while to object when vane was obviously determined     chapter xvi  the bush   it was a quiet evening nearly a fortnight after the arrival of the sloop pale sunshine streamed into the cove and little glittering ripples lapped lazily along the shingle the placid surface of the inlet was streaked with faint blue lines where wandering airs came down from the heights above and now and then an elfin sighing fell from the ragged summits of the firs when it died away the silence was broken only by the pounding of a heavy hammer and the crackle of a fire  carroll sat beside the latter alternately holding a stout plank up to the blaze and dabbling its hot surface with a dripping mop his face was scorched and he coughed as the resinousscented smoke drifted about his head and floated in heavy blue wisps halfway up the giant trunks behind him a big sea canoe lay drawn up not far away and one of its copperskinned siwash owners lounged on the shingle stolidly watching the white men his comrade was then inside the sloop holding a big stone against one of her frames while vane crouched outside swinging a hammer her empty hull flung back the thud of the blows which rang far across the trees  vane was barearmed and stripped to shirt and trousers he had arrived from comox across the straits at dawn that morning it was a long trip and they had had wild weather on the journey but he had set to work with characteristic energy as soon as he landed now though the sun was low he was working harder than ever with the flood tide which would shortly compel him to desist creeping up to his feet  it is a difficult matter to fit a new plank into the rounded bilge of a boat particularly when one is provided with inadequate appliances one requires a good eye for curves for the planks need much shaping they must also be driven into position by force two or three stout shores were firmly wedged against the side of the boat and these encumbered vane in the free use of his arms his face was darkly flushed and he panted heavily and now and then flung vitriolic instructions to the siwash inside the craft carroll watching him with quiet amusement was on the whole content that the tide was rising for his comrade had firmly declined to stop for dinner and he was conscious of a sharpened appetite it was comforting to reflect that vane would be unable to get the plank into place before the evening meal for if there had been any prospect of his doing so he would certainly have postponed his dinner  presently he stopped a moment and turned to carroll  if you were any use in an emergency youd be holding up for me instead of that wooden image inside he will back the stone against any frame except the one im nailing  the difficulty is that i cant be in two places at the same time carroll retorted goodnaturedly shall i leave this plank you cant get it in tonight  im going to try vane answered grimly  he turned around to direct the siwash and then cautiously hammered in one of the wedges a little farther swinging back the hammer he struck a heavy blow the result was disastrous for there was a crash and one of the shores shot backward striking him on the knee he jumped with a savage cry and the next moment there was a sharp snapping and the end of the plank sprang out then another shore gave way and when the plank fell clattering at his feet vane whirled the hammer round his head and hurled it violently into the bush this appeared to afford him some satisfaction and he strode up the beach with the blood dripping from the knuckles of one hand  thats the blamed siwashs fault he muttered i couldnt get him to back up when i put the last spike in  hadnt you better tell him to come out carroll suggested  no thundered vane if he hasnt sense enough to see that he isnt wanted he can stay where he is all night are you going to get supper or must i do that too  carroll merely smiled and set about preparing the meal which the two siwash partook of and afterward departed with some paper currency then vane walking down the beach came back with the plank lighting his pipe he pointed to one or two broken nails in it the water was now rippling softly about the sloop and the splash of canoe paddles came up out of the distance in rhythmic cadence  thats the cause of the trouble he explained it cost me a weeks journey to get the package of galvanized spikesi could have managed to split a plank or two out of one of these firs the storekeeper fellow assured me they were specially annealed for heading up if i knew who the manufacturers were id have pleasure in telling them what i think of them if they set up to make spikes they ought to make them and empty every keg that wont stand the test out on to the scrapheap  carroll smiled the course his partner had indicated was the one he would have adopted he was characterized by a somewhat grim idea of efficiency and never spared his labor to attain it though the latter fact now and then had its inconveniences for those who cooperated with him as carroll had discovered the latter had no doubt that vane would put the planks in if he spent a month over the operation  i wouldnt have had this trouble if youd been handier with tools vane went on i cant see why you never took the trouble to learn how to use them  my abilities arent as varied as yours and the thing strikes me as bad economy carroll replied skill of the kind you mention is worth about three dollars a day  you were getting two dollars for shoveling in a mining ditch when i first met you  i was carroll assented goodhumoredly i believe another month or two of it would have worn me out its considerably pleasanter and more profitable to act as your understudy but a fairly proficient carpenter might have bungled the matter  vane looked embarrassed  let it pass ive a pernicious habit of expressing myself unfortunately anyhow well start again on those planks the first thing tomorrow  he stretched out his aching limbs beside the fire and languidly watched the firs grow dimmer and the mists creep in ghostly trails down the steep hillside presently carroll broke the silence  wallace he advised wouldnt it be wiser if you met that fellow horsfield to some extent  no vane answered decidedly i have no intention of giving way an inch it would only encourage the man to press me on another point if i did im going to have trouble with him and it seems to me that the sooner it comes the better theres room for only one controlling influence in the clermont mine  carroll smoked in silence for a while his comrade had successfully carried out most of the small projects he had undertaken in the bush and though fortune had perhaps favored him he had every reason to be satisfied with the result of his efforts as a prospector he had afterward held his own in the city mainly by simple unwavering determination carroll however realized that to guard against the wiles of a clever man like horsfield who was unhampered by any scruples might prove a very different thing  in that case it might be as well to stay in vancouver as much as possible and keep your eye on him he suggested  the same idea has struck me since we sailed the trouble is that until ive decided about the pulp mill hell have to go unwatchedfor the same reason that prevented you from holding up for me and steaming the plank  if any unforeseen action of horsfields made it necessary you could let this pulp project drop  you ought to understand why thats impossible drayton kitty and hartley count on my exertions the matter was put into my hands only on the condition that i did all that i could theyre poor people and i cant go back on them if we cant locate the spruce or it doesnt seem likely to pay for working up theres nothing to prevent my abandoning the undertaking but im not at liberty to do so just because it would be a convenience to myself hartley got my promise before he told me where to search  carroll changed the subject  it might have been better if you had made the directors qualification higher you would have been more sure of horsfield then because he would have been less likely to do anything that might depreciate the value of his stock  i had to get a few good names to make it easier for men of standing to join me they wouldnt have been willing to subscribe for too many shares until they saw how the thing would go anyhow so long as hes a director horsfield must hold a stipulated amount of stock hes actually holding a good deal  the limits rather a low one suppose he sold out down to it he wouldnt mind having the value of the rest knocked down if he could make more than the difference by some jobbery of course were only a small concern and well have to raise more capital sooner or later ive an idea that horsfield might find his opportunity then  if he does we must try to be ready for him vane replied i sat up most of last night with the spritsail sheet in my hand and im going to sleep  he strolled away to the tent they had pitched on the edge of the bush but carroll sat a while smoking beside the fire with a thoughtful face he was suspicious of horsfield and foresaw trouble more particularly now that his comrade had undertaken a project which seemed likely to occupy a good deal of his attention hitherto vane had owed part of his success to his faculty of concentrating all his powers upon one object  they rose at dawn the next morning and by sunset had fitted the new planks two days later they sailed northward and eventually they found the rancherie hartley mentioned they had expected to hire a guide there but the rickety wooden building was empty vane decided that its siwash owners who made long trips in search of fish and furs had left it for a time and he pushed on again  he had now to face an unforeseen difficulty there were a number of openings in that strip of coast and hartleys description was of no great service in deciding which was the right one during the next day or two they looked into several bights and seeing no valleys opening out of them went on again one evening however they ran into an inlet with a forestshrouded hollow at the head of it here they moored the sloop close in with a sheltered beach and after a nights rest got ready their packs for the march inland carroll regretted they had not hired the indians with whom his comrade had crossed the straits  we would have traveled a good deal more comfortably if you had brought those siwash along to pack for us he observed  if you had been with them on the canoe trip you might think differently vane answered with a laugh besides theyre in the habit of going to cornox and might put some enterprising lumber men on our trail  theres one thing im going to insist on carroll declared well leave enough provisions on board to last us until we get back to civilization even if we have a head wind ive made one or two journeys on short rations  vane agreed to this and after rowing ashore and hiding the boat among the undergrowth they proceeded to strap their packs about them there is an art in this for the weight must be carried where it will be felt and retard ones movements least they had a light tent without poleswhich could be cut when wantedtwo blankets an ax and one or two cooking utensils besides their provisions a newcomer from the cities would probably not have carried his share for half a day but in that rugged land mineral prospector and survey packer are accustomed to travel heavily burdened and the men had followed both these vocations  in front of them a deep trough opened up in the hills but it was filled with giant forest through which no track led and only those who have traversed the dim recesses of the primeval bush can fully understand what this implies the west winds swept through that gateway reaping as they went and here and there tremendous trees lay strewed athwart one another with their branches spread abroad in impenetrable tangles some had fallen amid the wreckage left by previous gales which the forest had partly made good and there was scarcely a rod of the way that was not obstructed by halfrotted trunks then there were thick bushes and an undergrowth of willows where the soil was damp with thorny brakes and matted fern in between in places the growth was almost like a wall and the men skirting the inlet were glad to scramble forward among the rough boulders and ragged driftwood at the waters edge for some minutes at a time until it was necessary to leave the beach behind  after the first few minutes there was no sign of the gleaming water they had entered a region of dim green shade where the moist air was heavy with resinous smells the trunks rose about them in tremendous columns thorns clutched their garments and twigs and brittle branches snapped beneath their feet the day was cool but the sweat of tense effort dripped from them and when they stopped for breath at the end of an hour vane estimated that they had gone a mile  ill be content if we can keep this up he said  it isnt likely carroll replied with a trace of dryness glancing down at a big rent in his jacket  a little farther on they waded with difficulty through a large stream and carroll stopped and glanced round at a deep rift in a crag on one side of them  i dont know whether that could be considered a valley but we may as well look at it  they scrambled forward and reaching gravelly soil where the trees were thinner vane surveyed the opening it was very narrow and appeared to lose itself among the rocks the size of the creek which flowed out of it was no guide for those ranges are scored by running water  we wont waste time over that ravine vane concluded i noticed a wider one farther on well see what its like though hartley led me to understand that he came down a straight and gently sloping valley the one were in answers the description  it was two hours before they reached the second opening and then vane unstrapping his pack clambered up the steep face of a crag when he came back his face was thoughtful he sat down and lighted his pipe  this search seems likely to take us longer than i expected he said to begin with there are a number of inlets all of them pretty much alike along this part of the coast but i neednt go into the reasons for supposing that this is the one hartley visited taking it for granted that were right were up against another difficulty so far as i could make out from the top of that rock theres a regular series of ravines running back into the hills  hartley told you he came straight down to tidewater didnt he  thats not much of a guide the slope of every fissure seems to run naturally from the inland watershed to this basin hartley was sick and it was raining all the time and coming out of any of these ravines hed only have to make a slight turn to reach the water whats more he could only tell me that he was heading roughly west allowing that there was no sun visible that might have meant either northwest or southwest which gives us the choice of searching the hollows on either side of the main valley now it strikes me as most probable that he came right down the main valley itself but we have to face the question as to whether we should push straight on or search every opening that might be called a valley  whats your idea carroll rejoined  that we ought to go into the thing systematically and look at every ravine we come to  carroll nodded agreement  i guess youre right  they strapped their packs about them and struggled on again stopping half an hour for dinner they plodded all the afternoon up a long hollow which rose steadily in front of them it was narrow and in places the bottom of it was so choked with fallen trunks that they were forced for the sake of a clearer passage to take to the creek where they alternately stumbled among big boulders and splashed through shallow pools the water which was mostly melted snow was very cold  the light was fading down in the deep rift when winding round a spur through a tangle of clinging underbrush they saw the timber thin off ahead in a few minutes vane stopped with an exclamation and carroll overtaking him loosened his pack they stood upon the edge of the timber but in front of them a mass of soil and stones ran up almost vertically to a great outcrop of rock high above  if hartley had come down that hed have remembered it vane remarked grimly  its obvious carroll agreed sitting down with a sigh of weariness well try the next one tomorrow i dont move another step tonight  vane laughed  ive no wish to urge you theres hardly a joint in my body that doesnt ache he flung down his pack and stretched himself with an air of relief thats what comes of civilization and soft living it would be nice to sit still now while somebody brought me my supper  as there was nobody to do so he took up the ax and set about hewing chips off a fallen trunk while carroll made a fire then he cut the tent poles and a few armfuls of twigs for a bed and in half an hour the camp was pitched and a meal prepared darkness closed down on them while they ate and they afterward lay a while smoking and saying little beside the sinking fire while the red light flickered upon the massy trunks and fell away again then they crawled into the tent and wrapped their blankets round them     chapter xvii  vane postpones the search   when vane rose early the next morning there was frost in the air the firs glistened with delicate silver filigree and thin spears of ice stretched out from behind the boulders in the stream the smoke of the fire thickened the light haze that filled the hollow and when breakfast was ready the men ate hastily eager for the exertion that would put a little warmth into them  weve had it a good deal colder on other trips i suppose ive been getting luxurious for i seem to resent it now observed vane theres no doubt that winters beginning earlier that i expected up here as soon as you can strike the tent well get a move on  carroll made no comment he had a vivid recollection of one or two of those other journeys during which they had spent arduous days floundering through slushy snow and had slept in saturated blankets and sometimes shelterless in bitter frost carroll had endured these things without complaint though he had never attained to the cheerfulness his comrade usually displayed he was willing to face hardship when it promised to lead to a tangible result but he failed to understand the curious satisfaction vane assumed to feel in ascertaining exactly how much weariness and discomfort he could force his flesh to bear  vane however was not singular in this respect there are men in the newer lands who if they do not actually seek it will seldom make an effort to avoid the strain of overtaxed muscles and exposure to wild and bitter weather they have imbibed the pristine vigor of the wilderness and conflict with the natural forces braces instead of daunting them one recognizes them by their fixed and steady gaze their direct and deliberate speech and the proficiency that most display with ax and saw and rifle but the effect of this spartan training is not merely physical the men who leave the bush and the ranges as a rule come to the forefront in commerce and industry endurance swiftness of action and stubborn tenacity are apt to carry their possessor far anywhere  vane and his comrade needed these qualities during the following week the valley grew more wild and rugged as they proceeded in places its bottom was filled with muskegs cumbered with halfsubmerged decaying trunks of fallen trees and when they could not spring from one crumbling log to another they sank in slime and water to the knee then there were effluents of the main river to be waded through and every now and then they were forced back by impenetrable thickets to the hillside where they scrambled along a talus of frostshattered rock they entered transverse valleys and after hours of exhausting labor abandoned the search of each in turn and plodded back to the one they had been following their boots and clothing suffered their packs were rent upon their backs and their provisions diminished rapidly  at length one lowering afternoon they were brought to a standstill by the river which forked into two branches one of which came foaming out of a cleft in the rocks this would have mattered less had it flowed across the level but just there it had scored itself out a deep hollow from which the roar of its turmoil rose in long reverberations carroll aching all over stood upon the brink and gazed ahead he surmised from the steady ascent and the contours of the hills that the valley was dying out and that they should reach the head of it in another days journey the higher summits however were veiled in leaden mist and there was a sting in the cold breeze that blew down the hollow and set the ragged firs to wailing then carroll glanced dubiously at the dim green water which swirled in deep eddies and boiled in white confusion among the fangs of rock sixty or seventy feet below not far away the stream was wider and he supposed in consequence shallower though it ran furiously  it doesnt look encouraging and we have no more food left than will take us back to the sloop if were economical do you think its worth while going on  i havent a doubt about it vane declared we ought to reach the head of the valley and get back here in two or three days  carroll fancied they could have walked the distance in a few hours on a graded road but the roughness of the ground was not the chief difficulty  three days will make a big hole in the provisions he pointed out  then well have to put up with short rations  carroll nodded in rueful acquiescence  if youre determined we may as well get on  he stepped cautiously over the edge of the descent and went down a few yards with a run while loosened soil and stones slipped away under him then he clutched a slender tree and proceeded as far as the next on his hands and knees after that it was necessary to swing himself over a ledge and he alighted safely on one below from which he could scramble down to the narrow strip of gravel between rock and water he was standing breathless looking at the latter when vane joined him the stones dipped sharply and two or three large boulders ringed about with froth rose near the middle of the stream which seemed to be running slacker on the other side of them  there was nothing to show how deep it was and carroll did not relish the idea of being compelled to swim burdened with his pack no trees grew immediately upon the brink of the chasm and to chop a goodsized log and get it down to the water in order to ferry themselves across on it would cost more time than vane was likely to spare for the purpose seeing no other way out of it carroll braced himself for an effort and sturdily plunged in  two steps took him up to the waist and he had trouble in finding solid bottom at the next for the gravel rolled and slipped away beneath his feet in the strong stream the current dragged hard at his limbs and he set his lips tight when it crept up to his ribs then he lost his footing and was washed away plunging and floundering with now and then one toe resting momentarily upon the bottom sweeping rapidly down the stream he was hurled against the first of the boulders with a crash that almost drove the little remaining breath out of his body he clung to it desperately gasping hard then with a determined struggle he contrived to reach the second stone but the stream pressed him violently against this and he was unable to find any support for his feet a moment later vane was washed down toward him and grabbing at the boulder held on by it they said nothing to each other but they looked at the sliding water between them and the opposite bank carroll was getting dangerously cold and he felt the power ebbing out of him he realized that if he must swim across he would better do it at once  launching himself forward he felt the flood lap his breast but as his arms went in he struck something with his knee and found that he could stand on a submerged ledge this carried him a yard or two but the next moment he had stepped suddenly over the end of the ledge into deeper water floundering forward he staggered up a strip of shelving shingle and lay there breathless waiting for vane then together they scrambled up the slope ahead the work warmed them slightly and they needed it but as they strode on again keeping to the foot of the hillside where the timber was less dense a cold rain drove into their faces it grew steadily thicker the straps began to gall their wet shoulders and their saturated clothing clung heavily about their limbs in spite of this they struggled on until nightfall when with difficulty they made a fire and after a reduced supper found a little humid warmth in their wet blankets  the next days work was much the same only that they crossed no rivers it rained harder however and when evening came carroll who had burst one boot was limping badly they made camp among the dripping firs which partly sheltered them from the bitter wind and shortly after their meager supper carroll fell asleep vane to his annoyance found that he could not follow his friends example he was overstrung and the knowledge that the morrow would show whether the spruce he sought grew in that valley made him restless the flap of the tent was flung back and resting on one elbow he looked out upon shadowy ranks of trunks which rose out of the gloom and vanished again as the firelight grew and sank he could smell the acrid smoke and could hear the splash of heavy drops upon the saturated soil while the hoarse roar of the river came up in fitful cadence from the depths of the valley  in place of being deadened by fatigue his imagination seemed quickened and set free it carried him back to the lonely heights and the rugged dales of his own land and once more in vivid memory he roamed the upland heath with evelyn she had attracted him strongly when he was in her visible presence but now he thought he understood her better than he had ever done then he had he felt not grasped the inner meaning of much that she said words might convey but little in their literal sense and yet give to a sympathetic listener an insight into the depths of the speakers nature or hint at a thought too finely spun and delicate for formal expression  the same thing applied to her physical personality contours coloring features were things that could be defined and appraised but there was besides in evelyns case an aura that only now and then could dimly be perceived by senses attuned to it it enveloped her in a mystic light again he remembered how he had sought her with crude longing and cold appreciation he had failed to comprehend her the one creditable thing he had done was the renouncing of his claim then the halfformed idea grew plainer that she would understand and sympathize with what he was doing now it was to keep faith with those who trusted him that he meant stubbornly to prosecute his search and if the present journey failed to come back again that evelyn would ever hear of his undertaking appeared most improbable but this did not matter he knew now that it was the remembrance of her that had largely animated him to make the venture and to go on in the face of all opposing difficulties was something he could do in her honor then by degrees his eyes grew heavy and when he sank down in his wet blankets sleep came to him perhaps he had been fancifulhe was undoubtedly overstrungbut through such dreams as he indulged in passing glimpses of strange and splendid visions that transfigure the toil and clamor of a material world are now and then granted to wayfaring men  at noon the next day they reached the head of the valley it was still raining and heavy mists obscured the summits of the hills but above the lower slopes of rock glimmering snow ran up into the woolly vapor there were firs a few balsams and hemlocks but no sign of a spruce  now carroll commented dryly perhaps youll be satisfied  vane smiled he was no nearer to owning himself defeated than he had been when they first set out  we know theres no spruce in this valleyand thats something he replied when we come back again well try the next one  it has cost us a good deal to make sure of the fact  vanes expression changed  we havent ascertained the cost just yet as a rule you dont make up the bill until youre through with the undertaking and it may be a longer one than either of us think well we might as well turn upon our tracks  carroll recalled this speech afterward just then however he hitched his burden a little higher on his aching shoulders as he plodded after his comrade down the rainswept hollow they had good cause to remember the march to the inlet it rained most of the while and their clothes were never dry parts of them indeed flowed in tatters about their aching limbs and before they had covered half the distance their boots were dropping to pieces what was more important their provisions were rapidly running out and they marched on a few handfuls of food carefully apportioned twice daily at last they lay down hungry with empty bags one night to sleep shelterless in the rain for they had thrown their tent away carroll had some difficulty in getting on his feet the next morning  i believe i can hold out until sundown though im far from sure of it he said youll have to leave me behind if we dont strike the inlet then  well strike it in the afternoon vane assured him  they reslung their packs and set out wearily carroll limping and stumbling along was soon troubled by a distressful stitch in his side he managed to keep pace with vane however and some time after noon a twinkling gleam among the trees caught their eye then the shuffling pace grew faster and they were breathless when at last they stopped and dropped their burdens beside the boat it was only at the third or fourth attempt that they got her down to the water and the veins were swollen high on vanes flushed forehead when he sat down panting heavily on her gunwale  we ran her up quite easily though we had the slope to face then he remarked  you could scarcely expect to carry boats about without trouble after a march like the one weve made  they ran her in and pulled off to the sloop when at last they sat down in the little saloon vane got a glimpse of himself in the mirror  i knew you looked a deadbeat he laughed but id no idea i was quite so bad anyhow well get the stove lighted and some dry things on the next question iswhat shall we have for supper  thats easy everything thats most tempting and the whole of it  shortly afterward they flung their boots and rent garments overboard and sat down to a feast the plates were empty when they rose and in another hour both of them were wrapped in heavy slumber     chapter xviii  jessy confers a favor   the next morning it was blowing fresh from the southeast which was right ahead and vanes face was hard when he and carroll got the boat on deck and set about tying down two reefs in the mainsail  bad luck seems to follow us he grumbled  carroll smiled  theres no doubt of that but i suppose the fact wont have much effect on you  no returned vane decidedly we had our troubles in other ventures and somehow we got over themi dont see why we shouldnt do the same again now that weve seen the country we ought to get some useful information out of hartleywell know what to ask him  i shouldnt count too much on his help carroll answered with a thoughtful air  they got sail upon the sloop and drove her out into a confused head sea through which she labored with flooded decks making very little to windward when night came a deluge killed the breeze and the next day she lay rolling wildly in a heavy calm while light mist narrowed in the horizon and a persistent drizzle poured down upon the smoothly heaving sea then they had light variable winds and their provisions were once more running out when they drew abreast of a little coaling port carroll suggested running in and going on to victoria by train but they had hardly decided to do so when the fickle breeze died away and the tidestream bore them past to the south they had no longer a stitch of dry clothing and they were again upon reduced rations  still bad fortune dogged them for that night a fresh head wind sprang up and held steadily while they thrashed her south swept by stinging spray their tempers grew shorter under the strain and their bodies ached from the chill of their sodden garments and from sitting hour by hour at the helm at last the breeze fell and shortly afterward a trail of smoke and a halfseen strip of hull emerged from the creeping haze astern of them  a lumber tug observed vane she seems to have a raft in tow and it will probably be for draytons people if youll edge in toward her ill send him word that were on the way  there was very little wind just then and presently the tug was close alongside pitching her bows out of the slow swell while a great mass of timber wonderfully chained together surged along astern the dim slategreen sea washing over it a shapeless oilskinned figure stood outside her pilothouse balancing itself against the heave of the bridge which slanted and straightened  winstanley vane shouted  the figure waved an arm as if in assent and vane raised his voice again  report us to mr drayton well come along as fast as we can  the man turned and pointed to the misty horizon astern  youll get it from the north before tomorrow he called  then the straining tug and the long wet line of working raft drew ahead while the sloop crawled on closehauled toward the south late that night however the mist melted away and a keen rushing breeze that came out of the north crisped the water the vessel sprang forward when the ripples reached her the flapping canvas went to sleep and while each slack rope tightened a musical tinkle broke out at the bows it grew steadily louder and when the sun swung up red above the eastern hills she had piled the white froth to her channels and was driving forward merrily with little sparkling seas tumbling foamtipped after her the wind fell light as the sun rose higher but the swinging sloop ran on all day with blurred hills and forests sliding past and the western sky was still blazing with a wondrous green when she stole into vancouver harbor  carroll gazed at the city with open appreciation it rose girded with many wires and giant telegraph poles roof above roof up a low rise on the crest of which towering pines still lifted their ragged spires against the evening sky lower down big white lights were beginning to blink and the forests up the inlet beyond the smoke of the mills had already faded to a belt of shadow  quebec he remarked looks fine from the river clustering round and perched upon its heights and montreal at the foot of its mountain strikes your eye from most points of view but i cant remember ever entering either with the pleasure ive experienced in reaching this city  you probably arrived at the others traveling in a pullman or in a luxurious sidewheel steamboat it wouldnt be any great change from them to a smart hotel  that may explain the thing carroll agreed with an air of humorous reflection i guess the way you regard a city depends largely on the condition youre in when you reach it and on what you expect to get out of it in the present case vancouver stands for rest and comfort and enough to eat  vane laughed  im as glad to be back as you are but youd better make the most of any leisure that you can get as soon as ive arranged things here well go north again  the light faded as they crept across the inlet before a faint breeze but when they got the anchor over and the boat into the water carroll made out two dim figures standing on the wharf  its drayton i think he said waving a hand to them kittys with him  they pulled ashore and drayton and kitty greeted them  ive been looking out for you since noon drayton told them what about the spruce  there was eagerness in his voice and vanes face clouded  we couldnt find a trace of it  draytons disappointment was obvious though he tried to hide it  well he said resignedly ive no doubt you did all you could  of course kitty broke in were quite sure of that  vane thanked her with a glance he felt sorry for her and drayton they were strongly attached to each other and he had reasons for believing that even with the advanced salary the man expected to get they would find it needful to study strict economy it was easy to understand that a small share in a prosperous enterprise would have made things easier for them  im going to make another attempt i expect some of our difficulties will vanish after ive had a talk with hartley  thats impossible kitty explained softly hartley died a week ago  vane started the prospector had given him very little definite information and it was disconcerting to recognize that he must now rely entirely upon his own devices  im sorry he said hows celia  shes very ill there was concern in kittys voice hartley got worse soon after you left and she sat up all night with him after her work for the last few weeks now shes broken down and she seems to worry for fear they will not take her back again at the hotel  i must go to see her declared vane but wont you and drayton come with us and have dinner  drayton explained that this was out of the question kittys employer who had driven in that afternoon was waiting with his team they left the wharf together and a few minutes later vane shook hands with the girl and her companion  dont lose heart he said encouragingly were far from beaten yet  some time afterward vane rejoicing in the unusual luxury of clean dry clothes walked across to call on nairn the house struck him as larger more commodious and better lighted than it had been when he left it although he supposed that was only the result of his having lived on board the sloop and in the bush he was shown into a room where jessy horsfield was sitting and she rose with a slight start when he came in but her manner was reposeful and quietly friendly when she held out her hand  so you have come back have you succeeded in your search  vane was gratified it was pleasant to feel that she was interested in his undertaking  no he confessed for the time being im afraid i have failed  there was reproach in jessys voice when she answered  then you have disappointed me  it was delicate flattery as she had conveyed the impression that she had expected him to succeed which implied that she held a high opinion of his abilities still she did not mean him to think that he had forfeited the latter  after all you must have had a good deal against you she added consolingly wont you sit down and tell me about it mr nairn i understand is writing some letters and he sent for mrs nairn just before you came in i dont suppose she will be back for a few minutes  she indicated a chair beside the open hearth and vane sat down opposite her where a low screen cut them off from the rest of the room a shaded lamp above their heads cast down a soft radiance which lighted a sparkle in the girls hair and a red wood fire glowed cheerfully in front of them vane still stiff and aching from exposure to the cold and rain reveled in the unusual sense of comfort in addition to this his companions pose was singularly graceful and the ease of it and the friendly smile with which she regarded him somehow implied that they were on excellent terms  its very nice to be here again he said languidly  jessy looked up at him he had as she recognized spoken as he felt on impulse and this was more gratifying than an obvious desire to pay her a compliment would have been  i suppose you didnt get many comforts in the bush she suggested  no comforts of any kind are remarkably scarce up yonder as a matter of fact i cant imagine a country where the contrasts between the luxuries of civilization andthe other thingare sharper you can step off a firstclass car into the wilderness where no amount of money can buy you better fare than pork potatoes and dried apples and if you want to travel you must shoulder your pack and walk but that wasnt exactly what i meant  then what did you mean  i dont know that its worth explaining we have rather luxurious quarters at the hotel but this room is somehow different its restfuli think its homelyin fact as i said its nice to be here  jessy made no comment she understood that he had been attempting to analyze his feelings and had failed clearly to recognize that her presence contributed to the satisfaction of which he was conscious she had no doubt that if he were a man of average susceptibility which seemed to be the case the company of a welldressed and attractive woman would have some effect on him after his sojourn in the wilds but whether she had produced any deeper effect than that or not she could not determine though she was curious upon the point it did not appear judicious to prompt him unduly  but wont you tell me your adventures she begged  it required a few leading questions to start him but at length he told the story in a manner that compelled her interest  you see he concluded it was the lack of definite knowledge as much as the natural obstacles that brought us backand ive been troubled about the thing since we landed  jessys manner invited his confidence  i wonder she said softly if you would care to tell me why  vane knit his brows  hartleys dead and i understand that his daughter has broken down after nursing him its doubtful whether her situation can be kept open and it may be some time before shes strong enough to look for another he hesitated in a way i feel responsible for her  you really arent responsible in the least jessy declared still i can understand the ideas troubling you  shes left without a cent and unable to workand i dont know what to do in an affair of this kind im handicapped by being a man  would you like me to help you  i can hardly ask it but it would be a relief to me vane answered with obvious eagerness  then if youll tell me her address ill go to see her and well consider what can be done  vane leaned forward impulsively  you have taken a weight off my mind its difficult to thank you properly  oh i dont suppose it will give me any trouble of course it must be embarrassing to you to feel that you have a helpless young woman on your hands  then a thought flashed into her mind as she remembered what she had seen at the station some months ago  i wonder whether the situation is an altogether unusual one to you she queried have you never let your pity run away with your judgment before  you wouldnt expect me to proclaim my charities vane parried with a laugh  i think you are trying to put me off you havent given me an answer  well perhaps i was able to make things easier for somebody else not very long ago vane confessed reluctantly but without embarrassment i now see that i might have done harm without meaning to do so its sometimes extraordinarily difficult to help peopleand that makes me especially grateful for your offer  for the next few moments jessy sat silent it was clear that she had misjudged him for although she was not one who demanded too much from human nature the fact that kitty blake had arrived in vancouver in his company had undoubtedly rankled in her mind now she acquitted him of any blame and it was a relief to do so she changed the subject abruptly  i suppose you will make another attempt to find the timber  yes in a week or two  he had hardly spoken when mrs nairn came in and welcomed him with her usual friendliness  im glad to see ye though yere looking thin she said whats the way ye did not come straight to us instead of going to the hotel ye would have got as good a supper as they would give ye there  i havent a doubt of it vane declared on the other hand i hardly think that even one of your suppers would quite have put right the defect in my appearance you mentioned you see the cause of it has been at work for some time  mrs nairn regarded him with halfamused compassion  if yell come over every evening well soon cure that i would have been down sooner if alic had not kept me hes writing letters and there was a matter or two he wanted to ask my opinion on  i think that was very wise of him vane commented  his hostess smiled  for one thing we had a letter from evelyn chisholm this afternoon shell be out to spend some time with us in about a month  evelyns coming here vane exclaimed with a sudden stirring of his heart  why should she no i told ye some time ago that we partly expected her ye were no astonished then  she appeared to expect an explanation of the change in his attitude and as he volunteered none she drew him a few paces aside  if im no betraying a confidence evelyn writesim no sure of the exact wordsthat shell be glad to get away a while now ive been wondering why she should be anxious to leave home  she looked at him fixedly and to his annoyance he felt his face grow hot mrs nairn had quick perceptions and now and then she was painfully direct  it struck me that evelyn was not very comfortable there he replied she seemed out of harmony with her peopleshe didnt belong the same thing he went on lamely applies to mopsy  mrs nairn glanced at him with a twinkle in her eyes  its no unlikely the reason may servefor the want of a better then she changed her tone yell away up to alic he told me to send ye  vane went out of the room but he left jessy in a thoughtful mood she had seen his start at the mention of evelyn and it struck her as significant for she had heard that he had spent some time with the chisholms on the other hand there was the obvious fact that he had been astonished to hear that evelyn was coming out which implied that their acquaintance had not progressed far enough to warrant the girls informing him besides evelyn would not arrive for a month and jessy reflected that she would probably see a good deal of vane in the meanwhile she now felt glad that she had promised to look after celia hartley for that no doubt would necessitate her consulting with him every now and then she endeavored to dismiss the matter from her mind however and exerted herself to interest mrs nairn in a description of a function she had lately attended     chapter xix  vane foresees trouble   nairn was sitting at a writingtable when vane entered his room and after a few questions about his journey he handed the younger man one of the papers that lay in front of him  its a report from the mine ye can read and think it over while i finish this letter  vane carefully studied the document and then waited until nairn laid down his pen  it only brings us back to our last conversation on the subject he said when his host glanced at him inquiringly we have the choice of going on as we are doing or extending our operations by an increase of capital in the latter case our total earnings might be larger but i hardly believe there would be as good a return on the money actually sunk taking it all round i dont know what to think of course if it appeared that there was a moral certainty of making a satisfactory profit on the new stock i should consent  nairn chuckled  a moral certainty is no a very common thing in mining  horsfields in favor of the scheme how far would you trust that man  about as far as i could fling a bull by the tail the same thing applies to both of them  he has some influence no doubt hed find supporters  nairn saw that the meaning of his last remark which implied that he had no more confidence in jessy than he had in her brother had not been grasped by his companion but he did not consider it judicious to make it plainer instead he gave vane another piece of information  he and winter work into each others hands  but winter has no interest in the clermont  nairn smiled sourly  he holds no shares in the mine but theres no much in the shape of mineral developments yon man has no an interest in since ye do no seem inclined to yield horsfield a point or two it might pay ye to watch the pair of them  vane was aware that winter was a person of some importance in financial circles and he sat thoughtfully silent for a couple of minutes  now he explained at length every dollar we have in the clermont is usefully employed and earning a satisfactory profit of course if we put the concern on the market we might get more than it is worth from investors but that doesnt greatly appeal to me  its unnecessary to point out that a directors interest is no invariably the same as that of his shareholders nairn rejoined  its an unfortunate fact yet id be no better off if i got only the same actual return on a larger amount of what would be watered stock  theres sense in that im no urging the schemethere are other points against it  well ill go up and look round the mine and then well have another talk about the matter  vane walked back to his hotel in a thoughtful frame of mind finding carroll in the smokingroom he related his conversation with nairn  im a little troubled about the situation he confessed the clermont finances are now on a sound basis but it might after all prove advantageous to raise further capital although in such a case we would perhaps lie open to attack nairns inclined to be cryptic in his remarks but he seems to hint that it would be advisable to make horsfield some concessionin other words to buy him off  which is a course you have objections to  very decided ones  in a general way nairns advice strikes me as quite sensible wherever mining and other schemes are floated there are men who make a good living out of the operations theyre trained to the business theyve control of the money and when a new things put on the market they consider theyve the first claim on the pickings as a rule that notion seems to be justified  you neednt elaborate the point vane broke in impatiently  you made your appearance in this city as a poor and unknown man with a mine to sell carroll went on disregarding tactful hints you laid down your terms and stuck to them launching your venture without considering their views you did the gentlemen ive mentioned out of their accustomed toll and ive no doubt that some of them were indignant its a thing you couldnt expect them to sanction now however one who probably has others behind him is making overtures to you you ought to consider it a compliment a recognition of ability the question isdo you mean to slight these advances and go on as you have begun  thats my present intention vane answered  then you neednt be astonished if you find yourself up against a determined opposition  i think my friends will stand by me  vane looked at him steadily and carroll laughed  thanks ive merely been pointing out what you may expect and hinting at the most judicious coursethough the latters rather against my natural inclinations id better add that ive never been particularly prudent and the opposite policy appeals to me if were forced to clear for action well nail the flag to the mast  it was spoken lightly because the man was serious but vane knew that he had an ally who would support him with unflinching staunchness  im far from sure that it will be needful he replied  they talked about other matters until they strolled off to their rooms the next week vane was kept occupied in the city and then once more they sailed for the north they pushed inland until they were stopped by snow among the ranges without finding the spruce the journey proved as toilsome as the previous one and both men were worn out when they reached the coast vane was determined on making a third attempt but he decided to visit the mine before proceeding to vancouver they had heavy rain during the voyage down the straits and when on the day after reaching port the jaded horses they had hired plodded up the sloppy trail to the mine a pitiless deluge poured down on them the light was growing dim among the dripping firs and a deeptoned roar came throbbing across their shadowy ranks vane turned and glanced back at carroll  ive never heard the river so plainly before he said it must be unusually swollen  the mine was situated on a narrow level flat between the hillside and the river and carroll understood the anxiety in his comrades voice urging the wearied horses they pressed on a little faster it was almost dark however when they reached the edge of an opening in the firs and saw a cluster of ironroofed wooden buildings and a tall chimneystack in front of which the unsightly oredump extended wet chilled and worn out as the men were there was comfort in the sight but vane frowned as he noticed that a shallow lake stretched between him and the buildings on one side of it there was a broad strip of tumbling foam which rose and fell in confused upheavals and filled the forest with the roar it made vane drove his horse into the water and dismounting among the stumps before the oredump he found a wet and soilstained man awaiting him a long trail of smoke floated away from the iron stack behind him and through the sound of the river there broke the clank and thud of harddriven pumps  you have got a big head of steam up salter he remarked  the man nodded  we want it its a taking me all my time to keep the water out of the workings and the boys are over their ankles in the new drift leave your horsesill send along for themand ill show you what weve been doing after supper  id rather go now while im wet vane answered we came straight on as soon as we landed and i probably shouldnt feel like turning out again when id had a meal  salter made a sign of assent and a few minutes later they went down into the mine the approach to it looked like a canal and they descended the shallow shaft amid a thin cascade the tunnel slanted for the lode dipped and the pale lights that twinkled here and there among the timbering showed shadowy halfnaked figures toiling in water which rose well up their boots further streams of it ran in from fissures and vanes face grew grave as he plodded through the flood with a lamp in his hand he spent an hour in the workings asking salter a question now and then and afterward went back with him to one of the ironroofed sheds where he put on dry clothes and sat down to a meal  when it was over and the table had been cleared he lay in a canvas chair beside the stove listening to the resinous billets snapping and crackling cheerfully the little brightly lighted room was pleasantly warm and vane was filled with a languid sense of physical comfort after long exposure to rain and bitter wind the deluge roared upon the iron roof the song of the river rose and fell filling the place with sound and now and then the pounding and clanking of the pumps broke in  vane examined the sheet of figures salter handed him and lighted a fresh cigar when he had laid it down then he carefully turned over some of the pieces of stone which partly covered the table  theres no doubt that those specimens arent quite so promising he said at length and the cost of extraction is going up ill have a talk with nairn when i get back but in the meanwhile it looks as if we were going to have trouble with the water  its a thing ive been afraid of for some time salter answered we can keep down any leakage that comes in through the rock though it means driving the pumps hard but an inrush from the river would beat us a rise of a foot or so would turn the flood into the workings he paused and added significantly drowning out a mines a costly matter my idea is that you ought to double our pumping power and cut down the rock in the riverbed near the rapid that would take off three or four feet of water  it would mean a mighty big wages bill  salter nodded gravely  to do the thing properly would cost a pile of money but its an outlay that youll surely have to face  vane let the matter drop and an hour later retired to his wooden berth the roar of the rain upon the vibrating roof was like the roll of a great drum and the sound of the rivers turmoil throbbed through the frail wooden shack but the man had lain down at night near many a rapid and thundering fall and in a few minutes he was fast asleep he was awakened by a new shrill note which he recognized as the whistle of the pumping engine it was sounding the alarm the next moment vane was struggling into his clothing then the door swung open and salter stood in the entrance lantern in hand with water trickling from him there was keen anxiety in his expression  floods lapping the bank top now he gasped theres a jam in the narrow place at the head of the rapid and the waters backing up im going along with the boys  he vanished as suddenly as he had appeared and vane savagely jerked on his jacket if the mine were drowned it would entail a heavy expenditure in pumping plant to clear out the water and even then operations might be stopped for a considerable time what was more it would precipitate a crisis in the affairs of the company and necessitate an increase of its capital  vane was outside in less than a minute and stood still looking about him while the deluge lashed his face and beat his clothing against his limbs he could make out only a blurred mass of climbing trees on one side and a strip of foam cutting through the black level which he supposed was water in front of him his trained ears however gave him a little information for the clamor of the flood was broken by a sharp snapping and crashing which he knew was made by a mass of driftwood driving furiously against the boulders in that region the river banks are encumbered here and there with great logs partly burned by forest fires reaped by gales or brought down from the hillsides by falls of frostloosened soil a flood higher than usual sets them floating and on subsiding sometimes leaves them packed in a gorge or stranded in a shallow to wait for the next big rise now they were driving down and as salter had said jamming at the head of the rapid  suddenly a column of fierce white radiance leaped up lower downstream and vane knew that a big compressed airlamp had been carried to the spot where the driftwood was gathering even at a distance the brightness of the blaze dazzled him and he could see nothing else when he headed toward it he stumbled against a fir stump and the next minute the splashing about his feet warned him that he was entering the water having no wish to walk into the main stream he floundered to one side getting nearer to the blaze he soon made out a swarm of shadowy figures scurrying about beneath it some of them had saws or axes for he caught the gleam of steel he broke into a splashing run and presently carroll whom he had forgotten came up calling to him     chapter xx  the flood   when he reached the blastlamp which was raised on a tall tripod vane stood with his back to the pulsating gaze while he grasped the details of a somewhat impressive scene a little upstream of him the river leaped out of the darkness breaking into foaming waves and a wall of dripping firs flung back the roar it made the first rows of serried trunks standing out hard and sharp in the fierce white light nearer the spot where he stood a projecting spur of rock narrowed in the river which boiled tumultuously against its foot while about halfway across the top of a giant boulder rose above the flood  vane could just see it because a mass of driftwood which was momentarily growing stretched from bank to bank a big log drifting down sidewise had brought up against the boulder and once fixed had seized and held fast each succeeding trunk some had been driven partly out upon those that had preceded them some had been drawn beneath and catching the bottom had jammed then the rest had been wedged by the current into the gathering mass trunks branches and brushwood all finding a place when the stream is strong a jam usually extends downward as well as rises as the water it pens back increases in depth until it forms an almost solid barrier from surface to bed if it occurs during a logdrive the river is choked with valuable lumber  bent figures were at work with handspikes and axes at the shoreward end of the mass others had crawled out along the logs in search of another point where they could advantageously be attacked but vane watching them with practised eye decided that they were largely throwing their toil away then he glanced downstream but powerful as the light was it did not pierce far into the darkness and the rain and the mad white rush of the rapid vanished abruptly into the surrounding gloom he caught the clink of a hammer on a drill and seeing salter not far away he strode toward him  how are you getting to work he asked  salter pointed to the foot of the rock on which they stood  i reckoned that if we could put a shot in yonder we might cut out stone enough to clear the butts of the larger logs that are keying up the jam  youre wasting timestarting at the wrong place  its possible but what am i to do id rather split that boulder or chop down to the king log therebut the boys cant get across  have they tried vane demanded i will if its necessary  salter expostulated  i want to point out that youre the boss director of this company i dont know what youre making out of it but you can hire men to do that kind of work for three dollars a day  well let the boys try it if theyre willing  vane raised his voice  are any of you open to earn twenty dollars ill pay that to the man wholl put a stick of giantpowder in yonder boulder and another twenty to any one who can find the king log and chop it through  three or four of them crept cautiously along the driftwood bridge it heaved and worked beneath them the foam sluiced across it and the stream forced the thinner tops of shattered trees above the barrier it was obvious that the men were risking life and limb and there was a cry from the others when one of them went down and momentarily disappeared he scrambled to his feet again but those behind him stopped bracing themselves against the stream nearly waistdeep in rushing froth most of them had followed rough and dangerous occupations in the bush but they were not professional riverjacks trained to high proficiency in logdriving and one of them turning shouted to the watchers on the bank  this jams not solid he explained above the roar of the water shes working open and shutting and you cant tell where the breaks are  he stooped and rubbed his leg and vane understood him to add  figured i had it smashed  vane swung round toward carroll  well give them a lead  salter ventured another expostulation  stay where you are how are you going to manage if the boys cant tackle the thing  they havent as much at stake as i have was vanes reply im a director of the company as you pointed out give me two sticks of giantpowder some fuse and detonators  salter yielded when he saw that vane meant to be obeyed and cramming the blasting material into his pocket vane turned to carroll  are you coming with me  since i cant stop you i suppose id better go  as they sprang down the bank salter addressed one of the miners at work near him  ive seen a few company bosses in my time but this ones different from the rest i cant imagine any of the others wanting to cross that jam  vane crawled out on the groaning timber with carroll a few feet behind him the perilous bridge they traversed rolled beneath their feet but they had joined the other men before they came to any particularly troublesome opening then the clustering wet figures were brought up by a gap filled with leaping foam in the midst of which brushwood swung to and fro and projecting branches ground on one another whether there was solid timber a foot or two beneath or only the entrance to some cavity by which the stream swept through the barrier there was nothing to show but vane set his lips and leaped he alighted on something that bore him and when the others followed floundering and splashing the deliberation which hitherto had characterized their movements suddenly deserted them they had reached the limit beyond which it was no longer needful  there is courage which springs from knowledge often painfully acquired of the threatened dangers and the best means of avoiding them but it carries its possessor only so far beyond that point he must face the risk he cannot estimate and blindly trust to chance at sea when canvas is still the propelling power and in the wilderness man at grips with the elemental forces must now and then rise above bodily shrinking and disregard the warnings of reason there are tasks which cannot be undertaken in cold blood and when they had crossed the gap vane and those behind him blundered on in hot berserker fury they had risen to the demand on them and the curious psychic change had come now they must achieve success or face annihilation but in this there was nothing unusual it is the alternative offered many a logdriver miner and sailorman  neither vane nor carroll nor any of those who assisted them had a clear recollection of what they did somehow they reached the boulder somehow they plied ax or ironhooked peevy while the unstable foamlapped platform rocked beneath their feet every movement entailed a peril no one could calculate but they toiled savagely on when vane began to swing a hammer above a drill or from whom he got it he did not know any more than he remembered when he had torn off and thrown away his jacket although the sticks of giantpowder which had been in his pocket lay near him upon the stone sparks leaped from the drill which carroll held and fell among the coils of snaky fuse but that did not trouble them and it was only when vane was breathless that he changed places with his companion they heard neither the turmoil of the flood nor the crashing of the timber and the foam that lapped their long boots whirled unheeded by  about them bowed figures that breathed in stertorous gasps grappled desperately with the grinding smashing timber sometimes they were forced up in harsh distinctness by a dazzling glare sometimes they faded into blurred shadows as the pulsating flame upon the bank sank a little or was momentarily blown aside but all the while gorged veins rose on bronzed foreheads and toilhardened muscles were taxed to the utmost at last when a trunk rolled beneath him carroll missed a stroke and realized with a shock of dismay that it was not the drill he had struck with his hammer  i couldnt help it he gasped where did i hit you  get on vane cried hoarsely i can hold the drill  carroll struck for a few more minutes and then flung down the hammer and inserted the giantpowder into the holes sunk in the stone he lighted the fuse and warning the others they hastily recrossed the dangerous bridge they had reached the edge of the forest when a flash leaped up amid the foam and a sharp crash was followed by a deafening drawnout uproar rending grinding smashing the jam broke up it hammered upon the partly shattered boulder and carrying it away or driving over it washed in tremendous ruin down the rapid when the wild clamor had subsided salter gave the men some instructions and then as they approached the lamp he noticed vanes reddened hand  that looks a nasty smash you want to get it seen to he advised  ill get it dressed at the settlement well make an early start tomorrow we were lucky in breaking the jam but youll have the same trouble over again any time a heavy flood brings down an unusual quantity of driftwood  its what id expect  then something will have to be done to prevent it ill go into the matter when i reach the city  carroll and vane walked back to the shack where the latter bound up his comrades injured hand when he had done so vane managed to light a cigar and lying back still very wet he looked thoughtful  we cant risk having the workings drowned but im afraid the cost of the remedy will force me into sanctioning some scheme for increasing our capital  its a very common procedure carroll rejoined ive wondered why you had so strong an objection to it of course ive heard your business reasons  vane smiled  i have some of a different kindwell call them sentimental onesthough i dont think i quite realized it until lately  youre not given to introspection go on i think i know whats coming  to put the thing into words may help me to formulate my ideas theyre rather hazy well ostensibly i left england as the result of a difference of opinionwhich ive regretted ever sincethough i know now that really it was from another cause i wanted room i wanted freedom and i got them bothfreedom either to do work that nearly broke my heart and wore the flesh off me or to starve  the experience is not an unusual one  eventually vane proceeded i managed to get on my feet i suppose i got rather proud of myself when i beat the city men over the floating of the mine and i began to think of going back to the sphere of life in which i was bornexcuse the phrase  it looked nice from a distance carroll suggested  it was tolerable in vancouver anyway while i could go straight ahead and interest myself in the development of the mine i began to expect a good deal from my english visit  carroll laughed softly before he helped him out  and you were bitterly disappointed its a very old tale you had cut looseand you couldnt get back when you wanted to  i suppose id changed the bush had got hold of me the ways and views of the people over yonder didnt seem to be those i remembered they couldnt look at things from my standpoint i wouldnt adopt theirs you and i have had to facerealities  hunger corrected carroll softly wet snow to sleep in bodily exhaustion they probably teach one something or at any rate they alter ones point of view when youve marched for days on half rations some things dont seem so importanthow you put on your clothes for instance or how your dinners served but i dont see yet what bearing this has on your reluctance to extend the clermont operations  i could act as director with such men as nairn when it was a question of running a mine but its doubtful if id make a successful financial juggler its hard to keep ones hands off some of the professional tricksters bluff assumption makebelievepshaw ive had enough of them better stick to the ax and crosscut thats what i feel tonight  now that youve relieved your mind ill show you where you were wrong you said that you had changed in the wildernessyou havent your kind are foreloopers born your place is with the vedettes ahead of the massed columns but theres a point that strikes oneis your objection to financial scheming due to honesty or pride  vane laughed  i suspect a good deal of its bad temper anyhow ive felt that rather than truckle with that fellow horsfield id like to pitch him down the stairs but all this is pretty random talk  it is carroll agreed you havent said whether you intend to authorize that extension of capital  i suppose it will have to be done and now its very late and im going to sleep  they retired to the wooden bunks salter had placed at their disposal and early the next morning they left the mine vane got his hand dressed when they reached the little mining town at the head of the railroad and on the following day they arrived in vancouver     chapter xxi  vane yields a point   the short afternoon was drawing toward its close when vane came out of a large building in the city glancing at his watch he stopped on the steps  the meeting went pretty satisfactorily taking it all round he remarked to carroll  i think so agreed his companion but im far from sure that horsfield was pleased with the stockholders decision  vane smiled in a thoughtful manner after returning from the mine he had gone inland to examine a new irrigation property in which he had been asked to take an interest and had got back only in time for a meeting of the clermont shareholders which nairn had arranged in his absence the meeting of the kind that is sometimes correctly described as extraordinary was just over and though vane had been forced to yield to a majority on some points he had secured the abandonment of a proposition he considered dangerous  though i dont see what the man could have gained by it im inclined to believe that if nairn and i had been absent hed have carried his total reconstruction scheme that wouldnt have pleased me  i thought it injudicious  it was only because we must raise more money that i agreed to the issue of the new block of shares vane went on we ought to pay a fair dividend on the moderate sum in question  you think youll get it  ive not much doubt  carroll made no reply to this vane was capable and forceful but his abilities were of a practical rather than a diplomatic order and he was occasionally addicted to somewhat headstrong action knowing that he had a very cunning antagonist intriguing against him his companion had misgivings  shall we walk back to the hotel he suggested  no answered vane ill go across and see how celia hartleys getting on im afraid ive been forgetting her  then ill come too you may need me there are matters which youre not to be trusted to deal with alone  just then nairn came down the steps and waved his hand to them  ye will no forget that mrs nairn is expecting both of ye this evening  he passed on and they set off together across the city toward the district where celia lived though the quarter in question may have been improved out of existence since a few years ago rows of lowrented shacks stood upon mounds of sweating sawdust which had been dumped into a swampy hollow leaky frail and fissured they were not the kind of places anyone who could help it would choose to live in but vane found the sick girl still installed in one of the worst of them she looked pale and haggard but she was busily at work upon some millinery and the light of a tin lamp showed drayton and kitty blake sitting near her there were cracks in the thin boarded walls from which a faint resinous odor exuded but it failed to hide the sour smell of the wet sawdust upon which the shack was built the room which was almost bare of furniture felt damp and unwholesome  you oughtnt to be at work you dont look fit vane said to celia he paused a moment hesitating before he added im sorry we couldnt find that spruce but as i told drayton were going back to try again  the girl smiled bravely  then youll find it the next time im glad im able to do a little it brings in a few dollars  but what are you doing  making hats i did one for miss horsfield and afterward some friends of hers sent me two or three more to trim she said shed try to get me work from one of the big stores  but youre not a milliner are you asked vane feeling grateful to jessy for the practical way in which she had kept her promise to assist  celias something better kitty broke in shes a genius  isnt that a slight on the profession vane laughed  he was anxious to lead the conversation away from miss horsfields action he shrank from figuring as the benefactor who had prompted her  im not quite sure he continued what genius really is  i dont altogether agree with the definition of it as the capacity for taking infinite pains carroll guessing his companions thoughts remarked with mock sententiousness in miss hartleys case it strikes me as the instinctive ability to evolve a finished work of art from a few fripperies without the aid of technical training give her two or three feathers a yard of ribbon and a handful of mixed sundries and shell magically transmute them intothis  he took up a hat from the table and surveyed it with an air of critical intelligence  it was innate genius that set this plume at the one artistic angle had it been done by less capable hands the thing would have looked like a decorated beehive  the others laughed and he led them on to general chatter under cover of which vane presently drew drayton to the door  the girl looks far from fit he said has the doctor been over lately  two or three days ago answered drayton weve been worried about celia its out of the question that she should go back to the hotel and she can only manage to work a few hours daily theres another thingthe clerk of the fellow who owns these shacks has just been along for his rent its overdue  wheres he now  drayton laughed for the sounds of a vigorous altercation rose from farther up the unlighted street  i guess hes yonder having some more trouble with his collecting  ill fix that matter anyway  vane disappeared into the darkness and it was some time later when he reentered the shack he waited until a remark of celias gave him a lead  youre really a partner in the lumber scheme he told her i cant see why you shouldnt draw part of your share in the proceeds beforehand  the first payment isnt to be made until you find the spruce and get your lease the girl reminded him youve already paid a hundred dollars that we had no claim on  that doesnt matter im going to find it  yes agreed celia with a look of confidence i think you will buta flicker of color crept into her thin facei cant take any more money until it is found  vane failing in another attempt to shake her resolution dropped the subject and soon afterward he and carroll took their departure they were sitting in their hotel waiting for dinner when carroll looked up lazily from his luxurious chair  what are you thinking about so hard he inquired  vane glanced meaningly round the elaborately furnished room  theres a contrast between all this and that rotten shack did you notice that celia never stopped sewing while we were there though she once or twice leaned back rather heavily in her chair  i did i suppose youre going to propound another conundrum of a kind ive heard beforewhy you should have so many things you dont particularly need while miss hartley must go on sewing when shes hardly able for it in her most unpleasant shack i dont know whether the fact that you found a mine answers the question but if it doesnt the things beyond your philosophy  come off vane bade him with signs of impatience there are times when your moralizing gets on ones nerves anyhow i straightened out one difficultyi found the rent man whod been round worrying her and got rid of him  carroll groaned in mock dismay which covered some genuine annoyance with himself but vane frowned  whats the matter he inquired do you want a drink  ill get over it carroll informed him it isnt the first time ive suffered from the same complaint but id like to point out that your chivalrous impulses may be the ruin of you some day why didnt you let drayton settle with the man you gave him a check i suppose  sure id only a few loose dollars with me vane frowned again now i see what youre driving at and i want to say that any little reputation i possess can pretty well take care of itself  just so no doubt it will be necessary but it doesnt seem to have struck you that youre not the only person concerned  it didnt vane confessed with a further show of irritation but whos likely to hear or take any notice of the thing  i cant tell but you make enemies as well as friends and youre walking in slippery places which youre not altogether accustomed to you cant meet your difficulties with the ax here  thats true assented vane its rather a pity anyhow im not to be scared out of my interest in celia hartley  what is your interest in her its a question that may be asked  as you pretend that you dont know ill have pleasure in telling you again when i first struck this city played out and ragged she was waitress at a little hotel and she brought me a double portion of the nicest things at supper whats more she sewed up some of my clothes and i struck a job on the strength of looking comparatively decent its the kind of thing youre apt to remember one doesnt meet with too much kindness in this blamed censorious world  id expect you to remember carroll smiled  they went in to dinner and when the meal was over they walked across to nairns they were ushered into a room in which several other guests were assembled and vane sat down beside jessy horsfield a place on the sofa she occupied was invitingly empty he did not know of course that she had adroitly got rid of her previous companion as soon as he came in  i want to thank you i was over at miss hartleys this afternoon he began  i understood that you were at the mining meeting  so i was your brother would tell you that  vane broke off remembering that he had defeated horsfield but jessy laughed encouragingly  he did soyou were opposed to him but it doesnt follow that i share all his views perhaps i ought to be a stauncher partizan  if youll be just to both of us ill be satisfied  jessy reflected that while this was no doubt a commendable sentiment he might have made a better use of the opening she had given him by at least hinting that he would value her sympathy  i suppose that means that youre convinced of the equity of your cause she suggested  i dare say i deserve the rebuke but arent you trying to switch me off the subject vane retorted with a laugh its celia hartley that i want to talk about  he did her an injustice jessy felt that she had earned his gratitude and she had no objection to his expressing it  it was a happy thought of yours to give her hats and things to make im ever so much obliged to you he went on i felt that you could be trusted to think of the right thing an ingenious idea of that kind would never have occurred to me  jessy smiled up at him  it was very simple she said sweetly i noticed a hat and dress of hers which she admitted she had made the girl has some talent im only sorry i cant keep her busy  couldnt you give her an order for a dozen hats id be glad to be responsible  jessy laughed  the difficulty would be the disposal of them they would be of no use to you and i couldnt allow you to present them to me  i wish i could vane declared you certainly deserve them  this was satisfactory so far as it went though jessy would have preferred that his desire to bestow the favor should have sprung from some other motive than a recognition of her services to celia hartley she was however convinced that his only feeling toward the girl was one of compassion then she saw that he was looking at her with halfhumorous annoyance in his face  are you really grieved because i wont take those hats she asked lightly  i am vane confessed and then proceeded to explain with rather unnecessary ingenuousness im still more vexed with the state of things that its typical ofi suppose i mean the restrictedness of this civilized life when you want to do anything in the bush you take the ax and set about it but here youre continually running up against some quite unnecessary barrier  one understands that its worse in england jessy returned dryly but in regard to miss hartley ill recommend her to my friends as far as i can  vane made an abrupt movement and jessy realized by his expression that he had suddenly become oblivious of her presence she had no doubt about the reason for just then evelyn chisholm had entered the room the lamplight fell upon her as she crossed the threshold and jessy recognized unwillingly that she looked surprisingly handsome handsome however was not the word vane would have used he thought evelyn looked exotic highly cultivated strangely refined as though she had grown up in a rarefied atmosphere in which nothing rank could thrive exactly what suggested this it was difficult to define but the man felt that she had brought along with her the clean chill air of the heights where the cloudberries bloom she was a flower of the dim and misty north which has nevertheless its flashes of radiant ethereal beauty though evelyn had her faults the impression she made on vane was perhaps more or less justifiable  then he remembered that the girl had been offered to him and he had refused the gift he wondered how he had exerted the necessary strength of will for he was conscious that admiration respect pity had now changed and melted into sudden passion his blood tingled and he felt strangely happy  laying a check upon his thoughts he resumed a desultory conversation with jessy but he betrayed himself several times during it for no change of his expression was lost upon the girl at length she let him go it was some time however before he secured a place beside evelyn a little apart from the others he was now unusually quiet and selfcontained  nairn promised me an astonishment this evening but it exceeds all my expectations he said how are your people  evelyn informed him that their health was satisfactory and added watching him the while  gerald sent his best remembrances  thank you vane responded in a casual manner i am glad to have them  evelyn was now convinced that mabel had been correct in concluding that he had assisted gerald financially though she was aware that nothing would induce either of the men to acquaint her with the fact  and mopsy he inquired  i left her in tears because she could not come she sent you so many confused messages that im afraid ive forgotten them  vanes face grew gentle  dear little girl its a pity you couldnt have brought her mopsy and i are great friends  evelyn smiled at him the tenderness of the man appealed to her and she knew that to be the friend of anyone meant a good deal to him  you are her hero she told him i dont think it is because you pulled her out of the water either in fact i think you won her regard when you mended her canoe you have a reputation to keep up with mopsy  there was no answering smile in vanes eyes  well i shouldnt like to disappoint her but isnt it curious what effect some things have a patch on mopsys canoe for instanceand ive known a piece of cold pie carry with it a big obligation  the last was somewhat cryptic and evelyn looked at him with surprise until it dawned on her that he had merely been halfconsciously expressing a wandering thought aloud  i understood from mrs nairn that you were away in the bush she said  that was the case and im shortly going off again perhaps its fortunate that i may be away some time it will leave you more at ease  the last remark was more of a question than an assertion evelyn knew that the man could be direct and she esteemed candor  no she answered i shouldnt wish you to think thatand i shouldnt like to believe that i had anything to do with driving you away  vane saw a faintly warmer tone show through the clear pallor of her skin but while his heart beat faster than usual he recognized that she meant just what she said and nothing more he must proceed with caution and this on the whole was foreign to him shortly afterward he left her  when he had gone evelyn sat thinking about him she had shrunk from the man in rebellious alarm when her parents would have bestowed her hand on him but even then and undoubtedly afterward she had felt that there was something in his nature which would have attracted her had she been willing to allow it to do so now though he had said nothing to rouse it the feeling had grown stronger then she remembered with a curious smile her fathers indignation when vane had withdrawn from the field he had done this because she had appealed to his generosity and she had been grateful to him but unreasonable as she admitted the faint resentment she was conscious of to be the recollection of the fact that he had yielded to her wishes was somehow bitter  in the meanwhile carroll had taken his place by jessys side  i understand that you steered your comrade satisfactorily through the meeting today she began  no objected carrol i cant claim any credit for doing so in matters of that kind vane takes full control and im willing to own that he drove us all including your brother on the course he chose  jessy laughed goodhumoredly  then its in other matters you exercise a little judicious pressure on the helm  the man looked at her in wellassumed admiration of her keenness  i dont know how you guessed it but i suppose its a fact its an open secret however that vanes now and then unguardedly ingenuous indeed there are respects in which hes a babe by comparison with well say either of us  thats rather a dubious compliment by the way what do you think of miss chisholm i suppose you saw a good deal of her in england  carrolls eyes twinkled  i spent a month or two in her company so did vane i fancy shes rather like him in several ways and there are reasons for believing that he thinks a good deal of her  having watched vane carefully when evelyn came in jessy was inclined to agree with him she glanced round the room one or two people were moving about and the others were talking in little groups but there was nobody very near and she fancied that she and her companion were safe from interruption  what are some of the reasons she asked boldly  carroll had expected some question of this description and had decided to answer it plainly it seemed probable that jessy would get the information out of him in one way or another anyway and he had also another reason which he thought a commendable one jessy had obviously taken a certain interest in vane but it could not have gone very far as yet and vane did not reciprocate it his comrade however was impulsive while jessy was calculating and clever and carroll foresaw that complications might follow any increase of friendliness between her and vane he thought it might be wise to warn her to leave vane alone  well he answered since you have asked ill try to tell you  he proceeded to recount what had passed at the dene and jessy listened sitting perfectly still with an expressionless face  so he gave her upbecause he admired her she said at length  thats my view of it of course it sounds unlikely but i dont think it is so in my partners case  jessy made no comment but he felt that she was hit hard and that was not what he had anticipated he began to wonder whether he had acted judiciously he glanced about the room as it did not seem considerate to study her expression just then a few moments later she turned to him with a smile in which there was the faintest hint of strain  i dare say you are right but there are one or two people to whom i havent spoken  she moved away from him and a little while afterward mrs nairn came upon carroll standing for the moment alone  its no often one sees ye looking moody she said was jessy no gracious  that replied carroll smiling is not the difficulty im an unsusceptible and a somewhat inconspicuous personnot worth powder and shot so to speak for which im sometimes thankful i believe it saves me a good deal of trouble  then is it something vane has done that is on your mind doubtless ye feel him a responsibility  hes what youd call all that carroll declared still you see ive constituted myself his guardian i dont know why hed probably be very vexed if he suspected it  the gods give ye a good conceit of yourself mrs nairn laughed  i need it this afternoon i let him do a most injudicious thing and now ive done another which i fear is worse on the whole i think id better take him away to the bush hed be safer there  ye will no no just now declared his hostess firmly  carroll made a sign of resignation  oh well he agreed if you say so im quite willing to stand out and let things alone too many cooks are apt to spoil the kale  mrs nairn left him but she afterward glanced thoughtfully once or twice at vane and evelyn who had again drawn together     chapter xxii  evelyn goes for a sail   vane sat in nairns office with a frown on his face specimens of ore lately received from the mine were scattered about a table and nairn had some papers in his hand  weel inquired the scotchman when vane after examining two or three of the stones abruptly flung them down  the ores running poorer on the other hand i partly expected this theres better stuff in the reef were a little too high for one thing i look for more encouraging results when we start the lower heading  he went into details of the new operations and when he finished nairn looked up from the figures he had been jotting down  yon workings will cost a good deal he pointed out ye will no be able to make a start until were sure of the money  we ought to get it  nairn looked thoughtful  a month or two ago i would have agreed with ye but general investors are kittle folk and the applications for the new stock are no numerous  howitson promised to subscribe largely and bendle pledged himself to take a considerable block  im no denying it but we have no been favored with their formal applications yet  you had better tell me if you have anything particular in your mind vane said bluntly  an unqualified affirmation is not strictly in accordance with the scottish character and nairn was seldom rash  i would have ye remember what i told ye about the average investor he replied he has no often the boldness to trust his judgment nor the sense to ken a good thing when he sees ithe waits for a lead and then joins the rush when other folk are going in what makes a mineral or other stock a favorite for a time is now and then no easy to determine but well allow that it becomes soye will see men who should have mair sense thronging to buy and running the price up like sheep they come in each following the other and like sheep they run out if anything scares them its no difficult to start a panic  the plain english of it is that the mine is not so popular as it was retorted vane impatiently  im thinking something of the kind nairn agreed then he proceeded with a cautious explanation the result of the first reduction and the way ye forced the concern on the market secured ye notice folk put their money on ye looking for sensational developments and when the latter are no forthcoming they feel a bit sore and disappointed  theres nothing discouraging in our accounts even if the ore all ran as poor as thatvane pointed to the specimens on the tablethe mine could be worked on a reasonably satisfactory paying basis we have issued no statements that could spread alarm  just so what was looked for was more than reasonable satisfactionye have no come up to expectations forby its my opinion that damaging reports have somehow leaked out from the mine just now i see clouds on the horizon  bendle pledged himself to take up a big block of the shares repeated vane if howitson does the same as he said he would our position would be secure as soon as it was known that they were largely interested others would follow them  now ye have it in a nutshellit would put a wet blanket on the project if they both backed down in the meanwhile we canna hurry them ye will have to give them time  vane rose  well leave it at that ive promised to take mrs nairn and miss chisholm for a sail  by the time he reached the waterfront he had got rid of the slight uneasiness the interview had occasioned him he found mrs nairn and evelyn awaiting him with carroll in attendance and in a few minutes they were rowing off to the sloop as they approached her the elder lady glanced with evident approval at the craft which swam a gleaming ivory shape upon the shining green brine  ye have surely been painting the boat she exclaimed was that for us  vane disregarded the question  she wanted it and paints comparatively cheap it has been good drying weather the last few days  it was a little thing but evelyn was pleased the girls had not been greatly considered at the dene and it was flattering to recognize that the man had thought it worth while to decorate his craft in her honor she supposed it had entailed a certain amount of work she did not ask herself if he had wished to please her he had invited her for a sail some days ago and he was thorough in everything he did he helped her and mrs nairn on board and when they sat down in the well he and carroll proceeded to hoist the mainsail it looked exceedingly large as it thrashed and fluttered above their heads and there seemed to be a bewildering quantity of ropes but evelyn was interested chiefly in watching vane  he was wonderfully quick but no movement was wasted his face was intent his glances sharp and she liked the crisp curt way in which he spoke to carroll the mans task was in one sense not important but he was absorbed in it then while carroll slipped the moorings vane ran up the headsails and springing aft seized the tiller as the boat slanting over commenced to forge through the water it was the first time evelyn had ever traveled under sail and receptive as she was of all new impressions she sat silent a few minutes rejoicing in the sense of swift and easy motion the inlet was crisped by small white ripples and the boat with her boom broad off on her quarter drove through them with a wedge of foam on her lee bow and a stream of froth sluicing past her sides overhead the great inclined sail cut sharply white against the dazzling blue of the midmorning sky  evelyn glanced farther around wharves stacked with lumber railroad track clustering roofs smoking mills were flitting fast astern ahead a big sidewheel steamer was forging foamringed toward her with the tall spars of a fourmaster towering behind and stately pines that apparently walled in the harbor a little to one side to starboard beyond the wide stretch of whiteflecked water mountains ran back in ranks with the chilly gleam of snow which had crept lower since her arrival upon their shoulders it was a sharp contrast the noisy rawnew city and so close at hand the fringe of the wilderness  they swept out through the gate of the narrows and vane luffed the boat up to a moderately fresh breeze  its off the land and well have fairly smooth water he explained how do you like sailing  evelyn watched the white ridges which were larger than the ripples in the inlet smash in swift succession upon the weather bow and hurl the glittering spray into the straining mainsail there was something fascinating in the way the gentlyswaying boat clove through them  its glorious she cried looking first ahead then back toward the distant snow if anything more were wanted there are the mountains too  vane smiled but there was a suggestive sparkle in his eyes  yes we have them both and thats something to be thankful for the sea and the mountainsthe two grandest things in this world  if you think that how did you reconcile yourself to the city  im not sure that ive done so he indicated the gleaming heights anyway im going back up yonder very soon  mrs nairn glanced at carroll who affected to be busy with a rope then she turned to vane  it will no be possible with winter coming on  its not really so bad then vane declared besides i expect to get my work done before the hardest weathers due  but ye canna leave vancouver until ye have settled about the mine  i dont want to vane admitted thats not quite the same thing  it is with a good many people carroll interposed with a smile  evelyn fancied that there was something behind all this but it did not directly concern her and she made no inquiry in the meanwhile they were driving on to the southward opening up the straits with the forests to port growing smaller and the short seas increasing in size the breeze was cold but the girl was warmly clad and the easy motion in no way troubled her the rush of keen salt air stirred her blood and all round her were spread wonderful harmonies of silverlaced blue and green through which the straining fabric that carried her swept on the mountains were majestic but except when tempests lashed their crags or torrents swept their lower slopes they were wrapped in eternal repose the sea was filled with ecstatic motion  the hills have their fascination its a thing i know she said to draw the helmsman out i think i should like the sea too but at first sight its charm isnt quite so plain  you have started him interposed carroll he wont refuse that challenge  vane accepted it with a smile which meant more than goodhumored indulgence  well he declared the seas the same everywhere unbridled unchanging a force that remains as it was in the beginning once youre out of harbor under sail you have done with civilization it has possibly provided you with excellent gear but it can do no more you stand alone stripped for the struggle with the elements  is it always a struggle  always the seas as treacherous as the winds that vex it pitiless murderous when you have only sail to trust to you can never relax your vigilance you must watch the varying drift of clouds and the swing of the certain tides theres nothing and nobody to fall back upon when the breeze pipes its challenge you have sloughed off civilization and must stand or fall by the raw natural powers with which man is born and chief among them is the capacity for brutal labor the thrashing sail must be mastered the tackle creaking with the strain must be hauled in perhaps thats the charm of it for some of us whose lives are pretty smoothit takes one back as i said to the beginning  but havent human progress and machines made life more smooth for everybody  vane laughed somewhat grimly  oh no i think that can never be done so far somebody pays for the others ease at sea in the mine and in the bush man still grapples with a rugged naked world  the girl was pleased she had drawn him out and she thought that in speaking he had kept a fair balance between too crude a mode of colloquial expression and poetic elaboration there was she knew a vein of poetic conception in him and the struggle he had hinted at could be described fittingly only in heroic language it was in one sense a pity that those who had the gift of it and cultivated imagination had for the most part never been forced into the fight but that was perhaps not a matter of much importance there were plenty of men such as her companion endowed with steadfast endurance who if they seldom gave their thoughts free rein rejoiced in the struggle and by them the worlds sternest work was clone  after all she went on we have the mountains in civilized england  vane did not respond with the same freedom this time he was inclined to think he had spoken too unrestrainedly  yes he agreed smiling you can walk about themwhere you wont disturb the grouseand theyre grand enough but if you look down you can see the motor dust trails and the tourist coaches in the valleys  but why shouldnt people enjoy themselves in that way  i cant think of any reason no doubt most of them have earned the right to do so but you cant rip up those hills with giantpowder where you feel inclined or set to work to root out some miles of forest the government encourages that kind of thing here  and thats the charm  yes i suppose it is  id better explain carroll interposed men of a certain temperament are apt to fall a prey to fantasies in the newer lands any common sense they once possessed seems to desert them after that theyre never happy except when theyre ripping thingssuch as big rocks and treesto pieces and though theyll tell you its only to get out minerals or to clear a ranch theyre wrong once they get the mine or ranch they dont care about it they set to work wrecking things again isnt that true mrs nairn  there are such crazy bodies agreed the lady i know one or two but if i had my way with them they should find one mine or build one sawmill  and then supplied carroll you would chain them up for good by marrying them  i would like to try but im no sure it would act in every case i have come across some women as bad as the men they would drive their husbands on  she smiled in a half wistful manner  maybe she added its as well to do something worth the remembering when ye are young theres a long while to sit still in afterward  half in banter and half in earnest they had given evelyn a hint of the master passion of the true colonist whose pride is in his burden afterward mrs nairn led the conversation until carroll laid out in the saloon a somewhat elaborate lunch which he had brought from the hotel then the others went below leaving vane at the helm when they came up again carroll looked at his comrade ruefully  im afraid miss chisholms disappointed he said  no declared evelyn that would be most ungrateful i only expected a more characteristic example of sea cookery after what mr vane told us a lunch like the one you provided with glass and silver struck me as rather an anachronism  its better to be broken in to sea cookery gently vane interposed with some dryness  evelyn laughed  its a poor compliment to take it for granted that were afraid of a little hardship besides i dont think youre right  vane left the helm to carroll and went below  he wont be long carroll informed the girl with a smile he hasnt got rid of all his primitive habits yet ill give him ten minutes  when vane came up he glanced about him before he resumed the helm and noticed that it was blowing fresher they were also drawing out from the land and the short seas were getting bigger but he held on to the whole sail and an hour or so afterward a white iron bark light in ballast with her rusty loadline high above the water came driving up to meet them she made a striking picture evelyn thought with the great curve of her forecourse which was still set stretching high above the foam that spouted about her bows and tier upon tier of gray canvas diminishing aloft with the wind upon her quarter she rode on an even keel and the long iron hull gleaming snowily in the sunshine drove on majestic through a field of whiteflecked green and azure abreast of one quarter a propeller tug that barely kept pace with her belched out a cloud of smoke  her skippers been up here beforehes no doubt coming for salmon vane explained then he turned to carroll wed better pass to lee of her  carroll let a foot or two of a rope run out and the sloops bows swung round a little her rail was just awash and she was sailing very fast then her deck slanted more sharply and the low rail became submerged in rushing foam  well heave down a reef when were clear of the bark vane said  the vessel was now to windward and coming up rapidly to shorten sail they must first round up the boat for which they no longer had room a few moments later a fiercer blast swept suddenly down and the water boiled white between the bark and the sloop the latters deck dipped deeper until the lower part of it was lost in streaming froth carroll made an abrupt movement  shall i drop the peak  no theres the propeller close to lee  the tug was hidden by the inclined sail but evelyn clinging tightly to the coaming understood that they were running into the gap between the two vessels and in order to avoid collision with one or the other must hold on as they were through the stress of the squall how much more the boat would stand she did not know but it looked as if it were going over bodily then a glance at the helmsmans face reassured her it was fixed and expressionless but she somehow felt that whatever was necessary would be promptly done he was not one to lose his nerve or vacillate in a crisis and his immobility appealed to her because she knew that if occasion arose it would be replaced by prompt decisive action  in the meanwhile the slant of sail and deck increased one side of the sloop was hove high out of the sea it was all the girl could do to hold herself upright and mrs nairn had fallen against and was only supported by the coaming to leeward then the wind was suddenly cut off and the sloop rose with a bewildering lurch as the tall iron hull to weather forged by hurling off the sea she passed and while vane called out something and carroll scrambled forward the sloop swayed violently down again everything in her creaked the floorings sloped away beneath evelyns feet and now the madlywhirling froth poured in across the coaming the veins stood out on the helmsmans forehead his pose betrayed the tension on his arms but the sloop was swinging round and she fell off before the wind when the upper half of the great sail collapsed  rising more upright she flung the water off her deck and for some moments drove on at a bewildering speed then there was a mad thrashing as vane brought her on the wind again the two men desperately busy mastered the fluttering sail and in a few more minutes they were running homeward with the white seas splashing harmlessly astern it was now difficult to believe they had been in any danger but evelyn felt that she had had an instance of the seas treachery what was more she had witnessed an exhibition of human nerve and skill vane with his halfformulated thoughts which yet had depth to them and his flashes of imagination had interested her but now he had been revealed in his finer capacity as a man of action  id have kept to weather of the bark where wed have had room to luff if id expected that burst of wind he explained did you hurt yourself against the coaming mrs nairn  the lady smiled reassuringly  its no worth mentioning and im no altogether unused to it alic once kept a boat and would have me out with him  the remainder of the trip proved uneventful and as they ran homeward the breeze gradually died away the broad inlet lay still in the moonlight when they crept across it with the water lapping very faintly about the bows and it was over a mirrorlike surface they rowed ashore nairn was waiting at the foot of the steps and evelyn walked back with him feeling she could not tell exactly why that she had been drawn closer to the sloops helmsman     chapter xxiii  vane proves obdurate   vane spent two or three weeks very pleasantly in vancouver for evelyn of whom he saw a good deal was gracious to him the embarrassment both had felt on their first meeting in the western city had speedily vanished they had resumed their acquaintance on what was ostensibly a purely friendly footing and since both avoided any reference to what had taken place in england it had ripened into a mutual confidence and appreciation  this would have been less probable in the older country where they would have been continually reminded of what the chisholm family expected of them but the past seldom counts for much in the new and changeful west where men look forward to the future indeed there is something in its atmosphere which banishes regret and retrospection and when evelyn looked back at all she felt inclined to wonder why she had once been so troubled by the mans satisfaction with her company she decided that this could not have been the result of any aversion for him and that it was merely an instinctive revolt against the part her parents had wished to force upon her chisholm and his wife had blundered as such people often do for it is possible that had they adopted a perfectly neutral attitude everything would have gone as they desired their mistake was nevertheless a natural one somewhat exaggerated reports of vanes prosperity had reached them but while they coveted the advantages his wealth might offer their daughter in their secret hearts they looked upon him as a raw colonial and something of a barbarian and the opinions he occasionally expressed in their hearing did not dispel this idea both feared that evelyn regarded him in the same light and it accordingly became evident that a little pressure might be required in spite of their prejudices they did not shrink from applying it  in the meanwhile several people in vancouver watched the increase of friendliness between the girl and vane mrs nairn and her husband did so with benevolent interest and it was by mrs nairns adroit management which even evelyn did not often suspect that they were thrown more and more into each others company jessy horsfield however looked on with bitterness she was a strongwilled young woman who hitherto had generally contrived to obtain whatever she had set her heart on and she had set it on this man indeed she had fancied that he returned the feeling but disillusionment had come on the evening when he had unexpectedly met evelyn her smoldering resentment against the girl grew steadily stronger until it threatened to prove dangerous on opportunity  there were however days when vane was disturbed in mind winter was coming on and although it is rarely severe on the southern seaboard it is by no means the season one would choose for an adventure among the ranges of the northern wilderness unless he made his search for the spruce very shortly he might be compelled to postpone it until the spring at the risk of some hardy prospectors forestalling him but there were two reasons which detained him he thought that he was gaining ground in evelyns esteem and he feared the effect of absence and there was no doubt that the new issue of the clermont shares was in very slack demand to leave the city might cost him a good deal in several ways but he had pledged himself to go  that fact was uppermost in his mind one evening when he set off to call on celia hartley as it happened evelyn and mrs nairn were driving past as he turned off from a busy street toward the quarter in which she lived it had been dark for some time but the street was well lighted and evelyn had no difficulty in recognizing him indeed she watched him for a few moments while he passed on into a more shadowy region where the gloom and dilapidation of the first small frame houses were noticeable beyond them there was scarcely a light at all the neighborhood looked mysterious and she wondered what kind of people inhabited it she did not think that mrs nairn had noticed vane  you have never taken me into the district on our left she said  im no likely to were no proud of it  evelyn was a little astonished she had seen no signs of squalor or dissipation since she entered canada and had almost fancied that they did not exist  i suppose the chinese and other aliens live there  they do was the dry answer im no sure however that theyre the worst  but one understands that you havent a criminal population  we have folk whore on the fringe of it only we see that they live all together folk who would be respectable live somewhere else except maybe a few who have to consider cheapness theres no great difference in human nature wherever ye find it and i do no suppose were very much better than the rest of the world but its no a recommendation to be seen going into yon quarter after dark  this left evelyn thoughtful for she had undoubtedly seen vane going there she considered herself a judge of character and generally trusted her intuitions and she believed that the mans visit to the neighborhood in question admitted of some satisfactory explanation on the other hand she felt that her friends should be beyond suspicion taking it all round she was rather vexed with vane and it cost her some trouble to drive the matter out of her mind  she did not see vane the next day but the latter called upon nairn at his office during the afternoon  have you had any more applications for the new stock he asked  i have no neither bendle nor howitson has paid up yet though ive seen them about it once or twice  investors are shy thats a fact vane confessed its unfortunate ive already put off my trip north as long as possible i wanted to see things arranged on a satisfactory basis before i went  a very prudent wish i should advise ye to carry it out  what do you mean by that  something like thisif the moneys no forthcoming we may be compelled to fall back upon a different plan and unless yere to the fore the decision of a shareholders meeting might no suit ye considering the position and the stock ye hold any views ye might express would carry more weight than mine would do in your absence  vane drummed with his fingers on the table  i suppose thats the case but ive got to make the journey with moderately good fortune it shouldnt take me long  ye would be running some risk if anything delayed ye and we had to call a meeting before ye got back  vane frowned  i see that but it cant be helped i expect to be back before im wanted anyway i could leave you authority to act on my behalf  after a further attempt to dissuade him nairn spread out one hand resignedly  he who will to cupar maun be left to gang he said whiles i have wondered why any one should be so keen on getting there but doubtless a douce scottish town has mair attractions for a sensible person than the rugged northwest in the wintertime  vane smiled and shortly afterward went out and left him and when nairn reached home he briefly recounted the interview to his wife over his evening meal evelyn listened attentively  yon man will no hear reason nairn concluded hes thrawn  evelyn had already noticed that her host for whom she had a strong liking spoke broader scotch when he was either amused or angry and she supposed that vanes determination disturbed him  but why should he persist in leaving the city when its to his disadvantage to do so as you lead one to believe it is she asked  if the latters no absolutely certain its very likely  you have answered only half my question  mrs nairn smiled  alic she explained is reserved by nature but if yere anxious for an answer i might tell ye  anxious hardly describes it  then well say curious the fact is that vane made a bargain with a sick prospector in which he undertook to locate some timber the man had discovered away among the mountains he was to pay the other a share of its value when he got his government license  is the timber very valuable  no broke in nairn one might make a fair business profit out of pulping it though the things far from certain  then why is mr vane so determined on finding it  the question gave mrs nairn a lead but she decided to say no more than was necessary  the prospector died but that bound the bargain tighter in vanes opinion the man died without a dollar leaving a daughter worn out and ill with nursing him according to the arrangement his share will go to the girl  then said evelyn mr vane is really undertaking the search which may involve him in difficulties in order to keep his promise to a man who is dead and he will not even postpone it because if he did so this penniless girl might perhaps lose her share isnt that rather fine of him  on the whole ye understand the position nairn agreed if ye desire my view of the matter i would merely say that yons the kind of man he is  evelyn made no further comment though the last common phrase struck her as a most eloquent tribute she had heard vane confess that he did not want to go north at present and she now understood that to do so might jeopardize his interests in the mine but he was undoubtedly going he meant to keep his promise in its fullest and widest meaningthat was what one would expect of him  one mild afternoon a few days later he took her for a drive among the stanley pines and though she knew that she would regret his departure she was unusually friendly vane rejoiced at it but he had already decided that he must endeavor to proceed with caution and to content himself in the meanwhile with the part of trusted companion for this reason he chatted lightly which he felt was safer during most of the drive but once or twice when by chance or design she asked a leading question he responded without reserve he did so when they were approaching a group of giant conifers  i wonder whether you ever feel any regret at having left england for this country she asked  i did so pretty often when i first came out he answered with a smile in those days i had to work in icy water and carry massive lumps of rock  i dare say regret was a natural feeling then but that wasnt quite what i meant  so i supposed vane confessed well id better own that when id spent a week or two in englandat the denei began to think id missed a good deal by not staying at home it struck me that the life you led had a singular charm everything went so smoothly there among the sheltering hills one felt that care and anxiety could not creep in somehow the place reminded me of avalon  the impression was by no means correct smiled evelyn but i dont think you have finished wont you go on  then if i get out of my depth you mustnt blame me by and by i discovered that charm wasnt the right wordthe place was permeated with a narcotic spell  narcotic do you think the terms more appropriate  i do narcotics one understands are insidious things if you take them regularly in small doses they increase their hold on you until you become wrapped up in dreams and unrealities if however you get too big a dose of them at the beginning it leads to a vigorous revulsion its natures warning and remedy  youre not flattering but i almost fancy youre right  we are told that man was made to struggleto use all his powers if he rests too long beside the still backwaters of life in fairylike dales theyre apt to atrophy and he finds himself slack and nerveless when he goes out to face the world again  evelyn nodded for she had felt and striven against the insidious influence of which he spoke she had now and then left the drowsy dale for a while but the life of which she had then caught glimpses was equally shelteredone possible only to the favored few even the echoes of the real tense struggle seldom passed its boundaries  but you confessed not long ago that you loved the western wilderness she said you have spent a good deal of time in it and you expect to do so again after all isnt that only exchanging one beautiful tranquil region for another the bush must be even quieter than the english dales  perhaps i havent made the point quite clear when one goes up into the bush its not to lounge and dream there but to make war upon it with ax and drill  he pulled up his team and pointed to the clump of giant trees  look there thats natures challenge to man in this country  evelyn recognized that it was an impressive one the great trunks ran up far aloft tremendous columns before their brighter portions were lost in the vaulted roof of somber greenery they dwarfed the rig and team she felt herself a pygmy by comparison  theyre a little larger than the average her companion explained still thats the kind of thing you run up against when you buy land to start a ranch or clear the ground for a mine chopping sawing up splitting those giants doesnt fill one with languorous dreams the only dreams that our axmen indulge in materialize its an unending bracing struggle there are leagues and leagues of trees shrouding the valleys in a shadow that has lasted since the world was young but you see the dawn of a wonderful future breaking in as the long ranks go down  once more without clearly intending it he had stirred the girl he had not spoken in that rather fanciful style to impress her she knew that trusting in her comprehension he had merely given his ideas free rein but in doing so he had somehow made her hear the trumpetcall to action which for such men rings through the roar of the river and the song of the tall black pines  ah she murmured it must be a glorious life in many ways but its bound to have its drawbacks doesnt the flesh shrink from them  the flesh he laughed in this land the flesh takes second placeexcept perhaps in the cities he turned and looked at her curiously why should you talk of shrinking the bush couldnt daunt you you have courage  the girls eyes sparkled but not at the compliment his words rang with freedom the freedom of the heights where heroic effort was the rule in place of luxury she longed now as she had often done to escape from bondage to break away  ah well she said smiling half wistfully perhaps its fortunate that such courage as i have may never be put to the test  though reticence was difficult vane made no comment he had already spoken unguardedly and he decided that caution would be desirable as he started the team an automobile came up and he looked around as he drove on  its curious that i never heard the thing he remarked  i didnt either replied evelyn i was too much engrossed in the trees but i think miss horsfield was in it  was she responded vane in a very casual manner and evelyn for no reason that she was willing to recognize was pleased  she had not been mistaken jessy horsfield was in the automobile and she had had a few moments in which to study vane and his companion the mans look and the girls expression had struck her as significant and her lips set in an ominously tight line as the car sped on she felt that she almost hated vane and there was no doubt that she entirely hated the girl at his side it would be soothing to humiliate her to make her suffer and though the exact mode of setting about it was not very clear just yet she thought it might be managed her companion wondered why she looked preoccupied during the rest of the journey     chapter xxiv  jessy strikes   it was the afternoon before vanes departure for the north and evelyn sitting alone for the time being in mrs nairns drawingroom felt disturbed by the thought of it she sympathized with his object as it had been briefly related by her hostess but she supposed there was a certain risk attached to the journey and that troubled her in addition to this there was another point on which she was not altogether pleased she had twice seen him acknowledge a bow from a very pretty girl whose general appearance suggested that she did not belong to evelyns own walk in life and that very morning she had noticed him crossing a street in the young womans company vane as it happened had met kitty blake by accident and had asked her to accompany him on a visit to celia evelyn did not think she was of a jealous disposition and jealousy appeared irrational in the case of a man whom she had dismissed as a suitor but the thing undoubtedly rankled in her mind while she was considering it jessy horsfield entered the room  im here by invitation to join mr vanes other old friends in giving him a good sendoff she explained only mrs nairn told me to come over earlier  evelyn noticed that jessy laid some stress upon her acquaintance with vane and wondered whether she had any motive for doing so  i suppose you have known him for some time  oh yes was the careless answer my brother was one of the first to take him up when he came to vancouver  the phrase jarred on evelyn it savored of patronage besides she did not like to think that vane owed anything to the horsfields  though i dont know much about it i understood that they were opposed to each other she said coldly  jessy laughed  their business interests dont coincide but it doesnt follow that they should disagree about anything else my brother did all he could to dissuade mr vane from going on with his search for the timber until the winter is over  this was true inasmuch as horsfield had spoken to vane about the subject though it is possible that he would not have done so had he expected the latter to yield to his reasoning vane was one whom opposition usually rendered more determined  i think it is rather fine of him to persist in it evelyn declared  jessy smiled though she felt venomous just then  yes she agreed one undoubtedly feels that besides the things so characteristic of him the mans impulsively generous and not easily daunted he possesses many of the rudimentary virtues as well as some of the corresponding weaknesses which is very much what one would look for  what do you mean by that evelyn inquired with a trace of asperity though she was not prepared to pose as vanes advocate she was conscious of a growing antagonism toward her companion  its difficult to explain and i dont know that the subjects worth discussing answered jessy however what i think i meant was thismr vanes of a type thats not uncommon in the west and its a type one finds interesting hes forcibly elementary which is the only way i can express it the restraints the rest of us submit to dont bind himhe breaks through them  this evelyn fancied was more or less correct indeed the mans fearless disregard of hampering customs had pleased her but she recognized that some restraints are needful her companion followed the same train of thought  when one breaks down or gets over fences its necessary to discriminate she went on men of the berserker type however are more addicted to going straight through the lot in a way theyre consistenthaving smashed one barrier why should they respect the next  jessy as she was quite aware was playing a dangerous game one that might afterward be exposed the latter possibility however was of less account for detection would come too late if she were successful she was acquainted with the salient points of evelyns character  theyre consistent if not always very logical she concluded after a pause one endeavors to make allowances for men of that description  something in her tone roused evelyn to sudden imperious anger it was intolerable that this woman should offer excuses for vane  what particular allowances do you feel it needful to make in mr vanes case she asked haughtily  now that she was faced by the direct question jessy hesitated as a rule she was subtle but she could be ruthlessly frank and she was possessed by a passionate hatred of the girl beside her  you have forced me to an explanation she smiled the fact is that while he has a room at the hotel he has anestablishmentin a different neighborhood unfortunately such places are a feature of some western towns  it was a shock to evelyn one that she found hard to face though she was not convinced the last piece of information agreed with something mrs nairn had told her but although she had on one occasion had the testimony of her eyes in support of it jessys first statement seemed incredible  its impossible  jessy smiled in a bitter manner  its unpleasant but it cant be denied he undoubtedly pays the rent of a shack in the neighborhood i mentioned  evelyn sat tensely still for a moment or two she dare not give rein to her feelings for she would not betray herself but composure was extremely difficult  if that is true she demanded how is it that he is received everywhereat your house and by mrs nairn he is coming here tonight  jessy shrugged her shoulders  people in general are more or less charitable in the case of a successful man apart from that mr vane has a good many excellent qualities as i said one has to make allowances  just then to evelyns relief mrs nairn came in and though the girl suffered during the time it was half an hour before she could find an excuse for slipping away alone then sitting in the gathering darkness in her own room she set herself to consider as dispassionately as possible what she had heard it was exceedingly difficult to believe the charge but jessys assertion was definite enough and one which if incorrect could readily be disproved nobody would say such a thing unless it could be substantiated and that led evelyn to consider why jessy had given her the information she had obviously done so with at least a trace of malice but it could hardly have sprung from jealousy evelyn could not think that a woman would vilify a man for whom she had any tenderness besides she had seen vane entering the part of the town indicated where he could not have had any legitimate business hateful as the suspicion was it could not be contemptuously dismissed then she recognized that she had no right to censure the man he was not accountable to her for his conductbut calm reasoning carried her no farther she was once more filled with intolerable disgust and burning indignation somehow she had come to believe in vane and he had turned out an impostor  about an hour later vane and carroll entered the house with nairn and proceeded to the latters room where he offered them cigars  so yere all ready to sail the morn  vane nodded and handed him a paper  theres your authority to act in my name if its required if we have moderately fine weather i expect to be back before theres much change in the situation but ill call at nanaimo where you can wire me if anything turns up during the two or three days it may take us to get there the winds ahead at present  i suppose theres no use in my saying anything more now but i cant help pointing out that as head of the concern you have a certain duty to the shareholders which you seem inclined to disregard carroll remarked  vane smiled  ive no doubt that their interests will be as safe in nairns hands as in mine what i stand to risk is the not getting my personal ideas carried out which is a different matter though ill own that it wouldnt please me if they were overruled  i fail to see why ye could no have let the whole thing stand over until the spring grunted nairn the spruce will no run away  id have done so had it been a few years earlier but the whole country is overrun with mineral prospectors and timber righters now every months delay gives somebody else a chance for getting in ahead of me  weel responded nairn resignedly i can only wish ye luck but should ye be detained up yonder if one of ye could sail across to comox to see if theres any mail there it would be wise to do so he waved his hand no more of that well consider what tactics i had better adopt in case of delay  an hour had passed before they went down to join the guests who were arriving for the evening meal as a rule the western business man who is more or less engrossed in his occupation except when he is asleep enjoys little privacy and nairns friends sometimes compared his dwelling to the rotunda of a hotel the point of this was that people of all descriptions who have nothing better to do are addicted to strolling into the combined bazaar and lounge which is attached to many canadian hostelries  vane was placed next to evelyn at the table but after a quiet reply to his first observation she turned and talked to the man at her other side as the latter who was elderly and dull had only two topicsthe most efficient means of desiccating fruit and the lack of railroad facilitiesvane was somewhat astonished that she appeared interested in his conversation and by and by he tried again he was not more successful this time and his face grew warm as he realized that evelyn was not inclined to talk to him being a very ordinary mortal and not particularly patient he was sensible of some indignation which was not diminished when on looking around jessy horsfield favored him with a compassionate smile however he took his part in the general conversation and the meal was over and the guests were scattered about the adjoining rooms when after impatiently waiting for the opportunity he at last found evelyn alone she was standing with one hand on a table looking rather thoughtful  ive come to ask what ive done  evelyn was not prepared for this blunt directness and she felt a little disconcerted but she broke into a chilly smile  the questions rather indefinite isnt it do you expect me to be acquainted with all your recent actions  then ill put the thing in another waydo you mind telling me how i have offended you  the girl almost wished that she could do so appearances were badly against him but she felt that if he declared himself innocent she could take his word in the face of overwhelming testimony to the contrary unfortunately however it was unthinkable that she should plainly state the charge  do you suppose i should feel warranted in forming any opinion upon your conduct she retorted  it strikes me that you have formed one and it isnt favorable  the girl hesitated a moment but she had the courage of her convictions and she felt impelled to make some protest  that she said looking him in the eyes is perfectly true  he seemed more puzzled than guilty and once more she chafed against the fact that she could give him no opportunity for defending himself  well he responded im sorry but it brings us back to my first question  the situation was becoming painful as well as embarrassing and evelyn perhaps unreasonably grew more angry with the man  im afraid that you either are clever at dissembling or have no imagination  vane held himself in hand with an effort  i dare say youre right on the latter point its a fact im sometimes thankful for it leaves one more free to go straight ahead now as i see the driedfruit man coming in search of you and you evidently dont mean to answer me i cant urge the matter  he turned away and left her wondering why he had abandoned his usual persistency unless it was that an uneasy conscience had driven him from the field it did not occur to her that the man had under strong provocation merely yielded to the prompting of a somewhat hasty temper in the meanwhile he crossed the room in an absentminded manner and presently found himself near jessy who made room for him at her side  it looks as if you were in disgrace tonight she said sweetly and waited with concealed impatience for his answer if evelyn had been sufficiently clever or bold to give him a hint as to what he was suspected of jessy foresaw undesirable complications  i think i am he owned without reflection the trouble is that while i may deserve it on general grounds im unconscious of having done anything very reprehensible in particular  jessy was sensible of considerable relief the man was sore and resentful he would not press evelyn for an explanation and the breach would widen in the meanwhile she must play her cards skillfully  then that fact should sustain you she smiled we shall miss you after tomorrowmore than one of us of course its too late to tell you that you are not altogether wise in resolving to go  everybody has been telling me the same thing for the last few weeks he laughed  then ill only wish you every success its a pity that bendle and the other man havent paid up yet  she met his surprised look with an engaging smile  you neednt be astonished theres not very much goes on in the city that i dont hear about you know how men talk business here and its interesting to look on even when one cant actually take a hand in the game its said that the watchers sometimes see the most of it  to tell the truth its the uncertainty as to what those two men might do that has chiefly been worrying me  of course i believe that i understand the positiontheyve been hanging fire havent they but ive reasons for believing theyll come to a decision before very long  vane looked troubled  thats interesting but i ought to warn you that your brother  jessy stopped him with a smile  ive no intention of giving him away and as a matter of fact i think you are a little prejudiced against him after all hes not your greatest danger theres a cabal against you among your shareholders  the man knit his brows but she knew by the way he looked at her that he admired her acumen  yes he responded ive suspected that  there are two courses open to youthe first is to put off your expedition  the answer was to the effect she had anticipated  thats impossible for several reasons  the other is to call at nanaimo and wait until well say next thursday if theres need for you to come back i think it will arise by then but it might be better if you called at comox tooafter you leave the latter youll be unreachable if it seems necessary ill send you a warning if you hear nothing you can go on  vane reflected hastily jessy as she had told him had opportunities for picking up valuable information about the business done in that city and he had confidence in her  thank you he said it will be the second service you have done me and i appreciate it anyway i promised nairn id call at nanaimo in case there should be a wire from him  its a bargain and now well talk of something else  jessy drew him into an exchange of badinage noticing however that evelyn once or twice glanced at her with some astonishment she presently got rid of him she could understand evelyns attitude and she did not wish her friendliness with the offender to appear unnatural after what she had said about him  at length the guests began to leave and most of them had gone when vane rose to take his departure his host and hostess went with him to the door but though he once or twice glanced round eagerly there was no sign of evelyn he lingered a few moments on the threshold after mrs nairn had given him a kindly sendoff but nobody appeared in the lighted hall and after another word with nairn he went moodily down the steps to join jessy and carroll who were waiting for him below as the group walked down the garden path mrs nairn looked at her husband  i do not know what has come over evelyn this night she remarked  nairn followed jessys retreating figure with distrustful eyes  weel he drawled im thinking yon besom may have had a hand in the thing  a few minutes later jessy standing where the light of a big lamp streamed down upon her through the boughs of a leafless maple bade vane farewell at her brothers gate  if my good wishes can bring you success it will most certainly be yours she said and there was something in her voice which faintly stirred the man who was feeling very sore  thank you  she did not immediately withdraw the hand she had given him he was grateful to her and thought she looked unusually pretty with the sympathy shining in her eyes  you will not forget to wait at nanaimo and comox she reminded him  no if you recall me ill come back at once if not ill go on with a lighter heart knowing that i can safely stay away  jessy said nothing further and he moved on she felt that she had scored and she knew when to stop the man had given her his full confidence  soon afterward vane entered his hotel where he turned impatiently upon carroll  you can go into the rotunda or the smokingroom and talk to any loafer who thinks it worth while to listen to your cryptic remarks he said as we sail as soon as its daylight tomorrow im going to sleep     chapter xxv  the intercepted letter   the wind was fresh from the northwest when vane drove the sloop out through the narrows in the early dawn and saw a dim stretch of whiteflecked sea in front of him landlocked as they are by vancouver island the long roll of the pacific cannot enter those waters but they are now and then lashed into short tumbling seas sufficient to make passage difficult for a craft no larger than the sloop carroll frowned when a comber smote the weather bow and a shower of stinging spray lashed his face  right ahead again he remarked but as i suppose youre going on wed better stretch straight across on the starboard tack well get smoother water along the island shore  they let her go and vane sat at the helm hour after hour drenched with spray hammering her mercilessly into the frothy seas they could have done with a second reef down for the deck was swept and sluicing and most of the time the lee rail was buried deep in rushing foam but vane showed no intention of shortening sail nor did carroll who saw that his comrade was disturbed in temper suggest it resolute action had he knew a soothing effect on vane as a matter of fact vane needed soothing of late he had felt that he was making steady progress in evelyns favor and now she had most inexplainably turned against him there was no doubt that as jessy had described it he was in disgrace but rack his brain as he would he could not discover the reason that he was conscious of no offense only made the position more galling  in the meanwhile the boat engrossed more and more of his attention and though he was by no means careful of her he spared no effort to get her to windward it was a relief to drive her hard at some whitetopped sea and watch her bows disappear in it with a thud while it somehow eased his mind to see the smashedup brine fly half the height of her drenched mainsail there was also satisfaction in feeling the strain on the tiller when swayed down by a fiercer gust she plunged through the combers with the froth swirling perilously close to the coaming along her halfsubmerged deck in all their moods men of his kind find pleasure in such things the turmoil the rush the need for quick resolute action stirs the blood in them  the day was cold the man who was compelled to sit almost still in a nipping wind was soon wet through but this in some curious way further tended to restore his accustomed optimism and goodhumor he had partly recovered both when as the sloop drove through the whiter turmoil whipped up by a vicious squall there was a crash forward  down helm shouted carroll the bobstays gone  he scrambled toward the bowsprit which having lost its principal support swayed upward in peril of being torn away by the sagging jib vane first rounded up the boat into the wind and then followed him and for several minutes they had a savage struggle with the madlyflapping sail before they flung it bundled up into the well then they ran in the bowsprit and vane felt glad that although the craft had been rigged in the usual western fashion as a sloop he had changed that by giving her a couple of headsails in place of one  shell trim with the staysail if we haul down another reef he suggested  it cost them some labor but they were warmer afterward and when they drove on again vane glanced at the bowsprit  well try to get a bit of galvanized steel in nanaimo he said i cant risk another smash  carroll laughed  youd better be prepared for one if you mean to drive her as you have been doing he flung back the saloon scuttle youd have swamped her in another hour or twothe cabin floorings are all awash  then hadnt you better pump her out retorted vane after that you can light the stove its beginning to dawn on me that its a long while since i had anything worth speaking of to eat the kind of lunch you brought along in the basket isnt sustaining  they made a bountiful if somewhat primitive meal in turn sitting in the dripping saloon which was partly filled with smoke and carroll sighed for the comforts he had abandoned he did not however mention his regrets because he did not expect his comrades sympathy vane seldom noticed what he was eating when he was on board his boat  the craft being under reduced sail drove along more easily during the rest of the afternoon and they ran into a little colliery town late on the following day there vane replaced the broken bobstay with a solid piece of steel and then sat down to write a letter while carroll stretched his cramped limbs ashore  the letter was addressed to evelyn and he found it difficult to express himself as he desired the spoken word as he had discovered is now and then awkward to use but the written one is more evasive and complex still and he shook his head ruefully over the production when he laid down his pen this was perhaps unnecessary for having grown calm he had framed a terse and forcible appeal to the girls sense of justice which would in all probability have had its effect on her had she received it though he hardly realized it the few simple words were convincing  having had no news from nairn or jessy they sailed again in a day or two bound for comox farther along the coast where there was a possibility of communications overtaking them but in the meanwhile matters which concerned them were moving forward in vancouver  it was rather early one afternoon when jessy called on one of her friends and found her alone mrs bendle was a young and impulsive woman from one of the eastern cities and she had not made many friends in vancouver yet though her husband whom she had lately married was a man of some importance there  im glad to see you she said greeting jessy eagerly its a week since anybody has been in to talk to me and toms away again its a trying thing to be the wife of a western business manyou so seldom see him  jessy made herself comfortable in an easychair before she referred to one of her companions remarks  where has mr bendle gone now she asked  into the bush to look at a mine he left this morning and it will be a week before hes back then hes going across the selkirks with that clavering man about some irrigation scheme  this suggested one or two questions which jessy desired to ask but she did not frame them immediately mrs bendle was incautious and discursive but there was nothing to be gained by being precipitate  it must be dull for you she sympathized  i dont mean to complain toms reasonable the last time i said anything about being left alone he bought me a pair of ponies he said i could have either them or an automobile and i took the ponies i thought them safer  jessy smiled  youre fortunate in several ways there are not a great many people who can make such presents but while everybody knows your husband has been successful lately im a little surprised that hes able to go into claverings irrigation scheme its a very expensive one and i understand that they intend to confine it to a few which means that those interested will have to subscribe handsomely  tom explained her companion likes to have a number of different things in hand he told me it was wiser when i said that i couldnt tell my friends back east what he really is because he seemed to be everything at once but your brothers interested in a good many things too isnt he  i believe so answered jessy still im pretty sure he couldnt afford to join clavering and at the same time take up a big block of shares in mr vanes mine  but tom isnt going to do the latter now  jessy was startled this was valuable information which she could scarcely have expected to obtain so easily there was more that she desired to ascertain but she had no intention of making any obvious inquiries  its generally understood that mr vane and your husband are on good terms she said you know him dont you  ive met him once or twice and i like him but when i mention him tom smiles he says its unfortunate mr vane can see only one thing at a time and that the one which lies right in front of his eyes for all that he once owned that the man is likable  then its a pity hes unable to stand by him now  mrs bendle looked thoughtful  i really believe toms half sorry he cant do so he said something last night that suggested iti cant remember exactly what it was of course i dont understand much about these matters but howitson was here talking business until late  jessy was satisfied her hostesss previous incautious admission had gone a long way but to this was added the significant information that bendle was inclined to be sorry for vane the fact that he and howitson had decided on some joint action after a long private discussion implied that there was trouble in store for the absent man unless he could be summoned to deal with the crisis in person jessy wondered whether nairn knew anything about the matter yet and decided that she would call and try to sound him this would be difficult because nairn was not the man to make any rash avowal and he had an annoying habit of parrying an injudicious question with an enigmatical smile in the meanwhile she led her companion away from the subject and they discussed millinery and such matters until she took her departure  it was early in the evening when she reached nairns house for she thought it better to arrive there a little before he came home she was told that mrs nairn and miss chisholm were out but were expected back shortly evelyn had been by no means cordial to her since their last interview and mrs nairns manner had been colder but jessy decided to wait and for the second time that day fortune seemed to play into her hands  it was dark outside but the entrance hall was brightly lighted and jessy could see into it from where she sat highly trained domestics are generally scarce in the west and the maid had left the door of the room open presently there was a knock at the outer door and a young lad came in with some letters in his hand he explained to the maid that he had been to the postoffice and had brought his employers private mail the maid pointed out that the top letter looked dirty and the lad owned that he had dropped the bundle in the street then he withdrew and the maid laid the letters carelessly on a little table and also retired banging a door behind her the concussion shook down the letters and one fluttering forward with the sudden draught fell almost upon the threshold of the room jessy who was methodical in most things rose to pick it up and replace it with the rest  when she reached the door however she stopped abruptly for she recognized the rather large writing on the envelope there was no doubt that it was from vane and she noticed that it was addressed to miss chisholm jessy picked it up and when she had laid the others on the table she stood with vanes letter in her hand  has the man no pride she said half aloud  then she looked about her listening greatly tempted and considering there was no sound in the house evelyn and mrs nairn were out and the other occupants were cut off from her by a closed door nobody would know that she had entered the hall and if the letter were subsequently missed it would be remembered that the lad had confessed to dropping the bundle it was most unlikely however that any question regarding its disappearance would ever be asked if there should be no response from evelyn vane she thought would not renew his appeal jessy had no doubt that the letter contained an appeal of some kind which might lead to a reconciliation and she knew that silence is often more potent than an outbreak of anger she had only to destroy the letter and the breach between the two people whom she desired to separate would widen automatically  there was little risk of detection but standing tensely still with set lips and heart beating faster than usual she shrank from the decisive action she could still replace the letter and look for other means of bringing about what she wished she was selfwilled and endowed with few troublesome principles but until she had poisoned evelyns mind against vane she had never done anything flagrantly dishonorable then while she waited irresolute a fresh temptation seized her in the shape of a burning desire to learn what the man had to say he would reveal his feelings in the message and she could judge the strength of her rivals influence over him jessy had her ideas on this point but she could now see them confirmed or refuted by the mans own words  yet she hesitated with a halfinstinctive recognition of the fact that the decision she must make was an eventful one she had transgressed grievously in one recent interview with evelyn but while she had no idea of making reparation she could at least stop short of a second offense she had perhaps not gone too far yet but if she ventured a little farther she might be driven on against her will and become inextricably involved in an entanglement of dishonorable treachery  the issue hung in the balancethe slightest thing would have turned the scalewhen she heard footsteps outside and the tinkle of a bell moving with a start she slipped back into the room just before the maid opened the adjacent door in another moment she thrust the envelope inside her dress and gathered her composure as mrs nairn and evelyn entered the hall the former approached the table and turned over the handful of letters  two for ye from england evelyn and one or two for me she said flashing a quick glance at the girl nothing else i had thought vane would maybe send a bit note from one of the island ports to say how he was getting on  then jessy rose smiling to greet her hostess the question was decidedit was too late to replace the letter now she could not remember what they talked about during the next halfhour but she took her part until nairn came in and she contrived to have a word with him before leaving mrs nairn had gone out to give some instructions about supper and when evelyn followed her jessy turned to nairn  mr vane should be at comox now she began have you any idea of recalling him of course i know a little about the clermont affairs  nairn glanced at her with thoughtful eyes  im no acquainted with any reason that would render such a course necessary  evelyn reappeared shortly after this and jessy excused herself from staying for the evening meal and walked home thinking hard it was needful that vane should be recalled he had written to evelyn but jessy still meant to send him word he would be grateful to her and indignant and wounded as she was she would not own herself beaten she would warn the man and afterward perhaps allow nairn to send him a second message  on reaching her brothers house she went straight to her own room and tore open the envelope the color receded from her face as she read and sinking into a chair she sat still with hands clenched the message was terse but it was stirringly candid and even where the man did not fully reveal his feelings in his words she could read between the lines there was no doubt that he had given his heart unreservedly into her rivals keeping he might be separated from her but jessy knew enough of him to realize at last that he would not turn to another the lurid truth was burned upon her brainshe might do what she would but this man was not for her  for a while she sat still and then stooping swiftly she seized the letter which she had dropped and rent it into fragments her eyes had grown hard and cruel love of the only kind that she was capable of had suddenly turned to hate what was more it was a hate that could be gratified  a little later horsfield came in jessy was very composed now but she noticed that her brother looked at her in a rather unusual manner once or twice during the meal that followed  you make me feel that you have something on your mind she observed at length  thats a fact  horsfield hesitated he was attached to and rather proud of his sister  well she prompted  he leaned forward confidentially  see here he said ive always imagined that you would go far and im anxious to see you do so i shouldnt like you to throw yourself away  his sister could take a hint but there was information that she desired and the man was speaking with unusual reserve  you must be plainer she retorted with a slight show of impatience  then you have seen a good deal of vane and in case you have any hankering after his scalp i think id better mention that theres reason to believe he wont be worth powder and shot before very long  ah exclaimed jessy with a calmness that was difficult to assume you may as well understand that there is nothing between vane and me i suppose you mean that howitson and bendle are turning against him  something like that horsfields tone implied that her answer had afforded him relief the man has trouble in front of him  jessy changed the subject what she had gathered from mrs bendle was fully confirmed but she had made up her mind evelyns lover might wait for the warning which could save him but he should wait in vain     chapter xxvi  on the trail   it was a long wet sail up the coast with the wind ahead and carroll was quite content when on reaching comox vane announced his intention of stopping there until the mail came in immediately after its arrival carroll went ashore and came back emptyhanded  nothing he reported personally im pleased nairn could have advised us here if there had been any striking developments since we left the last place  i wasnt expecting to hear from him vane replied tersely  carroll read keen disappointment in his face and was not surprised although the absence of any message meant that it was safe for them to go on with their project and that should have afforded his companion satisfaction the latter sat on deck gazing somewhat moodily across the ruffled water toward the snowclad heights of the mainland range they towered dimly white and majestic above a scarcelytrodden wilderness and carroll at least was not pleasantly impressed by the spectacle though not to be expected always the cold snaps are now and then severe in those wilds indeed at odd times a frost almost as rigorous as that of alaska lays its icy grip upon the mountains and the usually damp forests at their feet  i wish i could have got a man to go with us but between the coal development and the logging everybodys busy he remarked  it doesnt matter vane assured him if we took a man along and came back unsuccessful thered be a risk of his giving the thing away besides he might make trouble in other respects a hired packer would probably kick against what you and i may have to put up with  carroll was far from pleased with this hint but he let it pass  do you mean that if you dont find the spruce this time youll go back again  yes thats my intention and now we may as well get the mainsail on her  they got off shortly afterward and stood out to northward with the wind still ahead of them it was a lowering day and a short tumbling sea was running when late in the afternoon carroll fixed their position by the bearing of a peak on the island he pointed out the small progress they had made the sloop was then plunging closehauled through the vicious slategreen combers and thin showers of spray flew all over her  the lucks been dead against us ever since we began this search he commented  do you believe in that kind of foolishness vane inquired  carroll sitting on the coaming considered the question it was not one of much importance but the dingy sky and the dreary waste of sadcolored water had a depressing effect on him and as it was a solace to talk one topic would serve as well as another  i think i believe in a rhythmical recurrence of the contrary chance he answered i mean that the uncertain and adverse possibility often turns up in succession for a time  then you couldnt call it uncertain  you cant tell exactly when the break will come carroll explained but if i were a gambler or had other big risks i think id allow for dangers in triplets  yes vane responded you could cite the three extra big head seas and ive noticed that when one burned tree comes down in a brûlée its quite often followed by two more though there may be a number just ready to fall  he mused for a few moments with the spray whistling about him he had three things at stake evelyns favor his interest in the clermont mine and the timber he expected to find two of them were undoubtedly threatened and he wondered gloomily if he might be bereft of all then he drove the forebodings out of his mind  in the present case anyway our course is pretty simple he declared with a laugh we have only to hold out and go on until the luck changes  carroll knew that vane was capable of doing as he had suggested and he was not encouraged by the prospect but he went below to trim and bring up the lights and soon afterward retired to get what rest he could the locker cushions on which he lay felt unpleasantly damp his blankets which were not much drier smelt moldy and there was a dismal splash and gurgle of water among the timbers of the plunging craft now and then a jet of it shot up between the joints of the flooring or spouted through the opening made for the liftinggear in the centerboard trunk when he had several times failed to plug the opening with a rag carroll gave it up and shortly afterward fell into fitful slumber  he was awakened shivering by hearing vane calling him and scrambling out into the well he took the helm as his comrade left it  whats her course he inquired  if you can keep her hammering ahead closehauled on the port tack its all i ask vane laughed you neednt call me unless the sea gets steeper  he crawled below and it was a few minutes before carroll who was dazzled by the change from the dim lamplight felt himself fit for his task fine spray whirled about him it was pitch dark but by degrees he made out the shadowy seas which came charging up tipped with frothing white upon the weather bow by the way they broke on board it struck him that they were steep enough already but vane had seen them not long ago and there was nothing to be gained by expostulation if they caused him no anxiety several hours went by and then carroll noticed that the faint crimson blink which sometimes fell upon the seas to weather was no longer visible it was evident that the port light had either gone out or been washed out and it was his manifest duty to relight it on the other hand he could not do so unless vane took the helm he was wet and chilled through any fresh effort was distasteful he did not want to move and he decided that they were most unlikely to meet a steamer while it was certain that there would be no other yacht about he left the lamp alone and at length vane came up  whats become of the port light he demanded  thats more than i can tell you it was burning an hour ago  an hour ago vane broke out with disgusted indignation  it may have been a little longer theyve stopped the alaska steamboats now but of course theres no reason why you shouldnt light that lamp again if it would give you any satisfaction ill stay up until youre through with it  vane did as he suggested and immediately afterward carroll retired below he slept until a pale ray of sunshine crept in through the skylights and then crawling out found the sloop lurching very slowly over a dying swell with her deck and shaking mainsail white with frost the wind had fallen almost dead away and it was very cold  on the whole he complained this is worse than the other thing  vane merely told him to get breakfast and most of that day and the next one they drifted with the tides through narrowing waters though now and then for a few hours they were wafted on by light and fickle winds at length they crept into the inlet where they had landed on the previous voyage and on the morning after their arrival they set out on the march there was on this occasion reason to expect more rigorous weather and the load each carried was an almost crushing one where the trees were thinner the ground was frozen hard and even in the densest bush the undergrowth was white and stiff with frost while overhead a forbidding gray sky hung  on approaching the rift in the hillside at which he had glanced when they first passed that way vane stopped a moment  i looked into that place before but it didnt seem worth while to follow it up he said if youll wait ill go a little farther along it  though the air was nipping carroll was content to remain where he was and he spent some time sitting upon a log before a faint shout reached him then he rose and making his way up the hollow found his comrade standing upon a jutting ledge  i thought you were never coming climb up ive something to show you  carroll joined him with difficulty and vane stretched out his hand  look yonder  carroll looked and started they stood in a rocky gateway with a river brawling down the chasm beneath them but a valley opened up in front filled with somber forest it ran back almost straight between stupendous walls of hills  it answers hartleys description after all i dont think its extraordinary that we should have taken so much trouble to push on past the right place  why  carroll sat down and filled his pipe  its the natural result of possessing a temperament like yours somehow youve got it firmly fixed into your mind that everything worth doing must be hard  ive generally found it so  i think grinned carroll youve generally made it so theres a marked difference between the two if any means of doing a thing looks easy you at once conclude that it cant be the right one that mode of reasoning has never appealed to me in my opinion its more sensible to try the easiest method first  as a rule that leads to your having to fall back upon the other one and a frontal attack on a difficultys often quicker than considering how you can work round its flank in this case ill own we have wasted a lot of time and taken a good deal of trouble that might have been avoided but are you going to sit here and smoke  until ive finished my pipe carroll answered firmly i expect well find tobacco among other things getting pretty scarce before this expedition ends  he carried out his intention and they afterward pushed on up the valley during the remainder of the day it grew more level as they proceeded and in spite of the frost which bound the feeding snows there was a steady flow of water down the river which was free from rocky barriers vane now and then glanced at the river attentively and when dusk was drawing near he stopped and fixed his gaze on the long ranks of trees that stretched away in front of him fretted spires of somber greenery lifted high above a colonnade of mighty trunks  does anything in connection with this bush strike you he asked  its stiffness if thats what you mean carroll answered with a smile these big conifers look as if theyd been carved like the wooden trees in the swiss or german toys theyre impressive in a way but theyre too formally artificial  thats not what i mean vane said impatiently  to tell the truth i didnt suppose it was anyway these trees arent spruce theyre red cedar the stuff they make roofing shingles of  precisely just now shingles are in good demand in the province and with the wooden towns springing up on the prairie western millers can hardly send roofing material across the rockies fast enough besides this i havent struck a creek more adapted for running down logs and the last sharp drop to tidewater would give power for a mill im only puzzled that none of the timberlease prospectors have recorded the place  thats easy to understand laughed carroll like you theyd no doubt first search the most difficult spots to get at  they went on and when darkness fell they pitched their light tent beside the creek it was now freezing hard and after supper the men lay smoking wrapped in blankets with the tent between them and the stinging wind while a great fire of cedar branches snapped and roared in front of them sometimes the red blaze shot up flinging a lurid light on the stately trunks and tinging the mens faces with the hue of burnished copper sometimes it fanned out away from them while the sparks drove along the frozen ground and the great forest aisle growing dim was filled with drifting vapor the latter was aromatic pungently fragrant  it struck me that you were disappointed when you got no mail at comox carroll remarked at length feeling that he was making something of a venture  i was admitted vane  thats strange carroll persisted because your hearing nothing from nairn left you free to go ahead which one would suppose was what you wanted  vane happened to be in a confidential mood though usually averse to sharing his troubles he felt that he needed sympathy  id better confess that i wrote miss chisholm a few lines from nanaimo  and she didnt answer you now i couldnt well help noticing that you were rather in her bad graces that night at nairnsthe thing was pretty obvious no doubt youre acquainted with the reason  im not thats just the trouble  carroll reflected he had an idea that miss horsfield was somehow connected with the matter but this was a suspicion he could not mention  well he said as i pointed out youre addicted to taking the hardest way when we came up here before you marched past this valley chiefly because it was close at hand but i dont want to dwell on that has it occurred to you that you did something of the same kind when you were at the dene the way that was then offered you was easy  vane frowned  that is not the kind of subject one cares to talk about but you ought to know that i couldnt allow them to force miss chisholm upon me against her will it was unthinkable besides looking at it in the most coldblooded manner it would have been foolishness for which wed both have had to pay afterward  im not so sure of that carroll smiled there were the sabine women among other instances didnt they cut off their hair to make bowstring for their abductors  his companion made no comment and carroll deciding that he had ventured as far as was prudent talked of something else until they crept into the little tent and soon fell asleep  they started with the first of the daylight but the timber grew denser and more choked with underbrush as they proceeded and for a day or two they wearily struggled through it and the clogging masses of tangled withered fern besides this they were forced to clamber over mazes of fallen trunks when the ragged ends of the snappedoff branches caught their loads their shoulders ached their boots were ripped their feet were badly galled but they held on stubbornly plunging deeper into the mountains all the while it would probably overcome the average man if he were compelled to carry all the provisions he needed for a week along a wellkept road but the task of the prospector and the survey packer who must transport also an ax cooking utensils and whatever protection he requires from the weather through almost impenetrable thickets is infinitely more difficult  vane and carroll were more or less used to it but both of them were badly jaded when soon after setting out one morning they climbed a clearer hillside to look about them high up ahead the crest of the white range gleamed dazzlingly against leaden clouds in a burst of sunshine below dark forest still wrapped in gloom filled all the valley and in between a belt of timber touched by the light shone with a curious silvery luster though it was some distance off probably a days journey allowing for the difficulty of the march vane gazed at it earnestly the trees were barethere was no doubt of that for the dwindling ranks diminished by the distance stood out against the snowstreaked rock like rows of thick needles set upright their straightness and the way they glistened suggested the resemblance  ominous isnt it carroll suggested at length if this is the valley hartley came downand everything points to thatwe should be getting near the spruce  vanes face grew set  yes he agreed there has been a big fire up yonder but whether it has swept the lower ground or not is more than i can tell well find out tonight or early tomorrow  he swung round without another word and scrambling down the hillside they resumed the march they pushed on all that day rather faster than before with the same uncertainty troubling both of them forest fires are common in that region when there is a hot dry fall and where as often happens a deep valley forms a natural channel for the winds that fan them they travel far stripping and charring the surface of every tree in their way neither of the men thought of stopping for a noonday meal and during the gloomy afternoon when dingy clouds rolled down from the peaks they plodded forward with growing impatience they could see scarcely a hundred yards in front of them dense withering thickets choked up the spaces between the towering trunks and there was nothing to indicate that they were nearing the burned area when at last they pitched their camp as darkness fell     chapter xxvii  the end of the search   the two men made a hurried breakfast in the cold dawn and soon afterward they were struggling through thick timber when the light suddenly grew clearer carroll remarked upon the fact and vanes face hardened  were either coming to a swamp or the track the fire has swept is close in front he explained  a thicket lay before them but they smashed savagely through the midst of it the undergrowth snapping and crackling about their limbs then there was a network of tangled branches to be crossed and afterward reaching slightly clearer ground they broke into a run three or four minutes later they stopped breathless and ragged with their rent boots scarcely clinging to their feet and gazed eagerly about  the living forest rose behind them an almost unbroken wall but ahead the trees ran up in detached and blackened spires their branches had vanished every cluster of sombergreen needles and delicate spray had gone the great rampicks looked like shafts of charcoal about their feet lay crumbling masses of calcined wood which grew more numerous where there were open spaces farther on and then the bare black columns ran on again up the valley and the steep hill benches on either hand it was a weird scene of desolation impressive to the point of being appalling in its suggestiveness of widespread ruin  for the space of a minute the men gazed at it and then vane stretching out his hand pointed to a snowsheeted hill  thats the peak hartley mentioned he said in a voice which was strangely incisive give me the ax  he took it from his comrade and striding forward attacked the nearest rampick twice the keen blade sank noiselessly overhead scattering a black dust in the frosty air and then there was a clear ringing thud after that vane smote on with a determined methodical swiftness until carroll grabbed his shoulder  look out he cried its going  vane stepped back a few paces the trunk reeled and rushed downward there was a deafening crash and they were enveloped in a cloud of gritty dust through the midst of it they dimly saw two more great trunks collapse and then somewhere up the valley a series of thundering shocks which both knew were not echoes broke out the sound jarred on carrolls nerves as the thud of the felled rampick had not done vane picked up one of the chips  we have found hartleys spruce  carroll did not answer for a minute after all when defeat must be faced there was very little to be said though his companions expression troubled him its grim stolidity was portentous  i suppose he suggested hopefully nothing could be done with it  vane pointed to the butt of the tree which showed a space of clear wood surrounded by a blackened rim  you cant make marketable pulp of charcoal and the price would have to run pretty high before it would pay for ripping most of the log away to get at the residue  but there may be some unburned spruce farther on  its possible im going to find out  this was a logical determination but in spite of his recent suggestion carroll realized that he would have abandoned the search there and then had the choice been left to him in which he did not think he was singular after all they had undergone and the risk they had run in leaving vancouver the shock of the disappointment was severe he could have faced a failure to locate the spruce with some degree of philosophical calm but to find it at last useless was very much worse he did not however expect his companion to turn back yet before he desisted vane would search for and examine every unburned tree what was more carroll would have to accompany him he noticed that vane was waiting for him to speak and he decided that this was a situation which he would better endeavor to treat lightly  i think ill have a smoke he said im afraid any remarks i could make wouldnt do justice to the occasion language has its limits  he sat down on the charred log and took out his pipe  a brûlées not a nice place to wander about in when theres any wind he proceeded and ive an idea theres some coming though its still enough now  shut in as they were in the deep hollow with the towering snows above them it was impressively still and in conjunction with the sight of the black desolation the deep silence reacted on carrolls nerves he longed to escape from it to make a noise though this if done unguardedly might bring more of the rampicks thundering down he could hear tiny flakes of charcoal falling from them and though the fire had long gone out a faint and curious crackling as if the dead embers were stirring he wondered if it were some effect of the frost it struck him as disturbing and weird  well work right round the brûlée vane decided then i suppose wed better head back for vancouver though well look at that cedar as we go down something might be made of itim not sure weve thrown our time away  youd never be sure of that it isnt in you  vane disregarded this a new constructive policy was already springing up out of the wreck of his previous plans  theres a good mill site on the inlet but as its a long way from the railroad well have to determine whether it would be cheaper to tow the logs down or split them up on the spot ill talk it over with drayton hell no doubt be useful and theres no reason why he shouldnt earn his share  do you consider that the arrangement you made with hartley applies to the cedar carroll asked  of course i dont know that the other parties could insist on the original termswe can discuss that later but though it may be modified the arrangement stands  his companion considered the matter dispassionately as an abstract proposition here was a man who in return for certain information respecting the whereabouts of a marketable commodity had undertaken to find and share it with his informant the commodity had proved to be valueless but during the search for it he had incidentally discovered something else was he under any obligation to share the latter with his informants heirs  carroll decided that the question could be answered only in the negative but he had no intention of disputing his comrades point of view in the first place this would probably make vane only more determined or would ruffle his temper and in the second place carroll was neither a covetous man nor an ambitious one which perhaps was fortunate for him ambition the mother of steadfast industry and heroic effort has also a less reputable progeny  vane as his partner realized was ambitious but in place of aspiring after wealth or social prominence his was a different aim to rend the hidden minerals from the hills to turn forests into dressed lumber to make something grow money is often though not always made that way but while vane affected no contempt for it in his case its acquisition was undoubtedly not the end fortunately he was not altogether singular in this respect  when he next spoke however there was no hint of altruistic sentiment in his curt inquiry  are you going to sit there until you freeze  carroll got up and they spent the remainder of the day plodding through the brûlée with the result that when darkness fell vane had abandoned all idea of working the spruce the next morning they set out for the inlet and one afternoon during the journey they came upon several fallen logs lying athwart each other with their branches spread in an almost impenetrable tangle vane proceeded to walk along one log which was tilted up several yards above the ground balancing himself carefully upon the rounded surface and carroll followed cautiously suddenly there was a sharp snapping and vane plunged headlong into the tangle beneath while carroll stood still and laughed it was not an uncommon accident  vane however did not reappear nor was there any movement among the halfrotten boughs and withered sprays and carroll moving forward hastily looked down into the hole he was disagreeably surprised to see his comrade lying rather white in face upon his side  im afraid youll have to chop me out came up hoarsely get to work i cant move my leg  moving farther along the log carroll dropped to the ground which was less encumbered there and spent the next quarter of an hour hewing a passage to his comrade then as he stood beside him hot and panting vane looked up  its my lower leg the left he explained bones broken i felt it snap  carroll turned from him for a moment in consternation looking out between the branches he could see the lonely hills tower pitilessly white against the blue of the frosty sky and the rigid firs running back as far as his vision reached upon their lower slopes there was no touch of life in all the picture everything was silent and absolutely motionless and its desolation came near to appalling him when he looked around again vane smiled wryly  if this had happened farther north it would have been the end of me he said as it is its awkward  the word struck carroll as singularly inexpressive but he made an effort to gather his courage when his companion broke off with a groan of pain  its lucky we helped that doctor when he set petes leg at bryants mill he declared cheerily can you wait a few minutes  vanes face was beaded with damp now but he tried to smile  it strikes me he answered ill have to wait a mighty long time  carroll turned and left him he was afraid to stand still and think and action was a relief it was some time before he returned with several strips of fabric cut from the tent curtain and the neatest splints he could extemporize from slabs of strippedoff bark and the next halfhour was a trying one to both of them sometimes vane assisted him with suggestionsonce he reviled his clumsinessand sometimes he lay silent with his face awry and his lips tight silent but at length it was done and carroll stood up breathing hard  ill fasten you on to a couple of skids and pull you out then ill make camp here  he managed it with difficulty pitched the tent above vane whom he covered with their blankets and made a fire outside  are you comfortable now he inquired  vane looked up at him with a somewhat ghastly smile  i suppose im about as comfortable as could be expected anyhow ive got to get used to the thing six weeks is the shortest limit isnt it  carroll confessed that he did not know and presently vane spoke again  its lucky that the winters arent often very cold near the coast  the temperature struck carroll as low enough but he made no comment to his disgust he could think of no cheering observation for there was no doubt that the situation was serious they were cut off from the sloop by leagues of tangled forest which a vigorous man would find it difficult to traverse and it would be weeks before vane could use his leg no human assistance could be looked for and they had only a small quantity of provisions left besides this it would not be easy to keep the sufferer warm in rigorous weather  ill get supper youll feel better afterward he said at length  dont be too liberal vane warned him  after the meal vane fell into a restless doze and it was dark when he opened his eyes again  i cant sleep any more and we may as well talkthere are things to be arranged in the first place as soon as i feel a little easier youll have to sail across to comox and hire some men to pack me out when youve sent them off you can make for vancouver and get a timber license and find out how matters are going on  that is quite out of the question carroll replied firmly nairn can look after our mining interestshes a capable manand if the things too much for him they can go to smash besides they wont give you a timber license without full particulars of area and limits and weve blazed no boundaries anyhow im staying right here  vane began to protest but carroll raised his hand  arguments not conducive to recovery youre on your back unfortunately and ill give way to you as usual as soon as youre on your feet again but not before  id better point out that well both be hungry by that time the provisions wont last long  then ill look for a deer as soon as i think you can be left and now well try to talk of something more amusing  can you see anything humorous in the situation  i cant carroll confessed still there may be something of that description which i havent noticed yet by the way the last time we were at nairns i happened to cross the room near where you and miss horsfield were sitting and i heard her ask you to wait for something at nanaimo or comox it struck me as curious  she told me to wait so that she could send me word to come back if it should be needful  ah ejaculated carroll i wont ask why she was willing to do soit concerns you more than mebut i think that as regards your interests in the clermont a warning from her would be worth as much as one from nairn that is if she could be depended on  have you any doubt upon the subject  carroll made a soothing gesture  dont get angry perhaps ive talked too much we have to think of your leg  im not likely to forget it vane informed him but i dare say youre right in one respectas an amusing companion youre a dead failure and talking isnt as easy as i thought  he lay silent afterward and though he had disclaimed any desire for sleep worn by the march and pain as he was his eyes presently closed carroll however sat long awake that night and he afterward confessed that he felt badly afraid deer are by no means numerous in some parts of the bushthey had not seen one during the journey and it was a long way to the sloop  once or twice for no obvious reason he drew aside the tent flap and looked out the sky was cloudless and darkly blue and a sickle moon gleamed in it keen and clear with frost below the hills were washed in silver majestic but utterly cheerless and lower still the serrated tops of the rigid firs cut against the dreary whiteness after each glimpse of them carroll drew his blanket tighter round him with a shiver very shortly when the little flour and pork was gone and their few cartridges had been expended he would be reduced to the condition of primitive man cut off from all other resources he must then wrest what means of subsistence he could from the snowy wilderness by brute strength and cunning and such instruments as he could make with his unassisted hands except that an ax of pennsylvania steel was better than a stone one civilization has its compensations and carroll longed for a few more of them that night  on rising the next morning he found the frost keener and he spent that day and a number of those that followed in growing anxiety which was only temporarily lessened when he once succeeded in killing a deer there was almost a dearth of animal life in the lonely valley sometimes at first vane was feverish often he was irritable and the recollection of the three or four weeks he spent with him afterward haunted carroll like a nightmare at last when he had spent several days in vain search for a deer and the provisions were almost exhausted he and his companion held a council of emergency  theres no use in arguing vane declared youll rig me a shelter of green boughs outside the tent and close to the fire i can move from the waist upward and if its necessary drag myself with my hands then you can chop enough cordwood to last a while cook my share of the eatables and leave me while you go down to the sloop theres half a bag of flour on board her and a few other things id be uncommonly glad to have  carroll expostulated but it was evident that his companion was right and the next morning he started for the inlet taking with him the smallest possible portion of their provisions so long as he had enough to keep him from fainting on the way it was all he required because he could renew his stores on board the sloop the weather broke during the march driving snow followed him down the valley and by and by gave place to bitter rain the withered underbrush was saturated the soil was soddened with melting snow and after the first scanty meal or two the man dare risk no delay he felt himself flagging from insufficient food and it was obvious that he must reach the sloop before he broke down he had tobacco but that failed to stay the gnawing pangs and before the march was done he was on the verge of exhaustion forcing himself onward drenched and grim of face scarcely able to keep upon his bleeding feet  it was falling dusk and blowing fresh when he limped down the beach and with a last effort launched the light dingy and pulled off to the sloop she rode rather deep in the water but that did not trouble him most wooden craft leak more or less and it was a considerable time since he had pumped her out clambering wearily on board he made the dingy fast and then stood still a moment or two looking about him with his hand on the cabin slide thin flakes of snow drifted past him the firs were rustling eerily ashore and ragged wisps of cloud drove by low down above their tops little frothy ripples flecked the darkening water with streaks of white and splashed angrily against the bows of the craft the prospect was oppressively dreary and the wornout man was glad that he was at last in shelter and could snatch a few hours rest  thrusting back the slide he stepped below and lighted the lamp the brightening glow showed him that the boats starboard side was wet high up and though there was a good deal of water in her this puzzled him until an explanation suggested itself they had moored the craft carefully but he supposed she must have dragged her anchor or kedge and swung in near enough the shore to ground toward low tide then as the tide left her she would fall over on her starboard bilge because they had lashed the heavy boom down on that side and the water in her would cover the depressed portion of her interior this reasoning was probably correct but he did not foresee the result until after lighting the stove and putting on the kettle he opened the provision locker which was to starboard then he saw with a shock of dismay that the stock of food they had counted on was ruined the periodicallysubmerged flourbag had rotted and burst and most of its contents had run out into the water as the boat righted with the rising tide the prepared cereals purchased to save cooking had turned to moldy pulp and the few other stores were in much the same condition there were only two sound cans of beef and a few ounces of unspoiled tea in a canister  carrolls courage failed him as he realized it but he felt that he must eat and sleep before he could grapple with the situation he would allow himself a scanty meal and a few hours rest while the kettle boiled he crawled out and shortened in the cable and plied the pump then he went below and feasted on preserved beef and tea gaging the size of each slice with anxious care until he reluctantly laid the can aside after that he filled his pipe and stretching his aching limbs out on the port locker which was comparatively dry soon sank into heavy sleep     chapter xxviii  carroll seeks help   carroll slept for several hours before he awakened and sat up on the locker shivering he had left the hatch slightly open and a confused uproar reached him from outside the wail of windtossed trees the furious splash of ripples against the bows and the drumming of the halyards upon the mast there was no doubt that it was blowing hard but the wind was off the land and the sloop in shelter  filling his pipe he set himself to think and promptly decided that it would have been better had he gone down to the sloop in the beginning before the provisions had been spoiled a natural reluctance to leave his helpless companion had mainly prevented him from doing this but he had also been encouraged by the possibility of obtaining a deer now and then it was clear that he had made a mistake in remaining but it was not the first time he had done so and the point was unimportant the burning question waswhat should he do now  it would obviously be useless to go back with rations that would barely suffice for the march vane still had food enough to keep life in one man for a little while and it would not be a long run to comox with a strong northerly wind if the sloop would face the sea that was running he might return with assistance before his comrades scanty store was exhausted getting out the mildewed chart he laid off his course carefully trimmed and lighted the binnacle lamp and going up on deck hauled in the kedgeanchor he could not break the main one out though he worked savagely with a tackle and deciding to slip it he managed to lash three reefs in the mainsail and hoist it with the peak left down then he stopped to gather breathfor the work had been cruelly heavybefore he let the cable run and hoisted the jib  she paid off when he put up his helm and the black loom of trees ashore vanished he thought that he could find his way out of the inlet but he knew that he had done so only when the angry ripples that splashed about the boat suddenly changed to confused tumbling combers they foamed up in quick succession on her quarter but he fancied she would withstand their onslaught so long as he could prevent her from screwing up to windward when she lifted it would need constant care and if he failed the next comber would no doubt break on board his task was one that would have taxed the vigilance of a strong wellfed man and carroll had already nearly reached the limit of his powers  his case however was by no means an unusual one the cost of the subjugation of the wilderness is the endurance of hunger and thirst cold and crushing fatigue and somebody pays to the utmost farthing carroll sitting drenched strung up and hungry at the helm was merely playing his part in the struggle though he found it cruelly difficult  it was pitch dark but he must gaze ahead and guess the track of the pursuing seas by the angle of the spouting white ridge abreast of the weather shrouds he had a compass but when his course did not coincide with safety it must be disregarded the one essential thing was to keep the sloop on top and to do so he had frequently to let her fall off dead before the mad white combers that leaped out of the dark by and by his arms began to ache from the strain of the tiller and his wet fingers grew stiff and clawlike the nervous strain was also telling but that could not be helped he must keep the craft before the sea or go down with her there was one consolation she was traveling at a furious speed  at length morning broke gray and lowering over a leaden sea that was seamed with white carroll glanced longingly at the meat can on the locker near his feet he could reach it by stooping though he dare not leave the helm but he determined to wait until noon before he broke his fast again it could not be very far to comox but the wind might drop then he began to wonder how he had escaped the perils of the night he had come down what was really a wide and not quite straight sound passing several unlighted islands before starting he had decided that he would run so far and then change his course a point or two but he could not be sure that he had done so he had a hazy recollection of seeing surf and once a faint loom of land but he supposed that he had avoided it halfconsciously or that chance had favored him  in the afternoon the wind changed a little backing to the northwest the sky grew brighter and carroll made out shadowy land over his starboard quarter soon he recognized it with a start it was the high ridge north of comox he had run farther than he had expected and he must try to hoist the peak of the mainsail and haul her on the wind there was danger in rounding her up but it must be faced though a sea foamed across her as he put down his helm another followed but he scrambled forward and struggled desperately to hoist the downhanging gaff the halyards were swollen and he could scarcely keep his footing on the deluged deck that slanted steeply under him he thought he could have mastered the banging canvas had he been fresh but worn out as he was drenched with spray and buffeted by the shattered tops of the seas the task was beyond his power giving it up he staggered back breathless and almost nerveless to the helm  he could not reach comox which lay to windward with the sail half set but it was only seventy miles or so to nanaimo and not much farther to vancouver the breeze would be fair to either and he could charter a launch or tug for the return journey letting her go before the sea again he ate some canned meat ravenously tearing it with one hand  during the afternoon a gray mass rose out of the water to port and he supposed it was texada there were mines on the island and he might be able to engage a rescue party but he reflected that he could not beat the sloop back to windward unless the breeze fell which it showed no signs of doing it would be more prudent to go on to vancouver where he would be sure of getting a steamer but he closed with the long island a little and dusk was falling when he made out a boat in the partial shelter of a bight standing in closer he saw that there were two men on the craft and driving down upon her he backed and ran alongside there was a crash as he struck the boat and an astonished and angry man clutched the sloops rail  now what in the name of thunder he began and stopped struck by carrolls haggard and ragged appearance  can you take this sloop to vancouver carroll asked hoarsely  i could if it was worth while was the cautious answer it will be a mighty wet run  seven dollars a day until youre home again a bonus if you can sail her with the whole reefed mainsail upi wont stick at a few dollars can your partner pull that boat ashore alone if not cast her adrift ill buy her  hell make the beach returned the other jumping on board seven dollars sounds a square deal i wont put the screw on you  then help me hoist the peak after that you can take the helm im played out  the man shouted something to his companion and then seized the halyards and the sloop drove on again furiously with an increased spread of canvas while carroll stood holding on by the coaming until the boat dropped back  ill leave you to it he told the new helmsman its twentyfour hours since ive had more than a bite or two of food and some weeks since i had a decent meal  you look it been up against it somewhere  carroll without replying crawled below and managed to light the stove and make a kettleful of tea he drank a good deal of it and nearly emptied the remaining small meat can which he presently held out for the helmsmans inspection standing beneath the hatch  theres some tea left but this is all there is to eat on board the craft he said youre hired to take her to vancouveryoud better get there as quick as you can  the bronzed helmsman nodded  she wont be long on the way if the mast holds up  have you seen any papers lately carroll inquired ive been up in the bush and im interested in the clermont mine it looked as if there might be some changes in the companys prospects when i went away  i noticed a bit about it in the colonist a while back the company sold out to another concern or amalgamated with it i dont remember which  carroll was not astonished the news implied that he must be prepared to face a more or less serious financial reverse and it struck him as a fitting climax to his misadventures  its pretty much what i expected he said im going to sleep and i dont want to be wakened before its necessary  he crawled below and he had hardly stretched himself out upon the locker before his eyes closed when he opened them feeling more like his usual self he saw that the sun was above the horizon and he recognized by the boats motion that the wind had fallen going out he found her driving through the water under her whole mainsail and the helmsman sitting stolidly at the tiller the man stretched out a hand and pointed to the hazy hills to port  well fetch the narrows some time before noon if youll take the helm i guess well half that meat for breakfast  his prediction proved correct for carroll reached his hotel about midday and hastily changing his clothes set off to call on nairn he had not yet recovered his mental equipoise and in spite of his long sound sleep he was still badly jaded physically on arriving at the house he was shown into a room where mrs nairn and her husband were sitting with evelyn waiting for the midday meal the elder lady rose with a start of astonishment when he walked in  man she cried whats wrong yere looking like a ghost  it was not an inapt description carrolls face was worn and haggard and his clothes hung slack upon him  ive been feeling rather unsubstantial of late as the result of a restricted diet he answered with a smile sinking into the nearest chair  nairn regarded him with carefully suppressed curiosity  yere over lang in coming he remarked where left ye your partner  carroll sat silent a moment or two his eyes fixed on evelyn it was evident that his sudden appearance unaccompanied by vane which he felt had been undesirably dramatic had alarmed her at first he felt compassionate and then he was suddenly possessed by hot indignation this girl with her narrow prudish notions and dispassionate nature had presumed to condemn his comrade unheard for an imaginary offense the thing was at once ludicrous and intolerable if his news brought her dismay let her suffer his nerves it must be remembered were not in their normal condition  yes he said in answer to his hosts first remark ive gathered that we have failed to save the situation but i dont know exactly what has happened you had better tell me  mrs nairn made a sign of protest but her husband glanced at her restrainingly  ye will hear his news in good time he informed her and then turned to carroll in a few words the capital was no subscribedit leaked out that the ore was running poorand we held an emergency meeting with vane away i could put no confidence into the shareholdersthey were anxious to get from underand horsfield brought forward an amalgamation scheme a combine would take the property over on their valuation i and a few others were outvoted the scheme went through and when the announcement steadied the stock which had been tumbling down i exercised the authority given me and sold your shares and vanes at considerably less than their face value ye can have particulars later what i have to ask now iswhere is vane  the mans voice grew sharp the question was flung out like an accusation but carroll still looked at evelyn he felt very bitter against her he would not soften the blow  i left him in the bush with no more than a few days provisions and a broken leg he announced  then in spite of evelyns efforts to retain her composure her face blanched carrolls anger vanished because the truth was clear vane had triumphed through disaster his peril and ruin had swept his offenses away the girl who had condemned him in his prosperity would not turn from him in misfortune in the meanwhile the others sat silent gazing at the bearer of evil news until he spoke again  i want a tug to take me back at once if she can be got ill pick up a few men along the waterfront  nairn rose and went out of the room the tinkle of a telephone bell reached those who remained and a minute or two later he came back  ive sent whitney round he explained hell come across if theres a boat to be had and now ye look as if ye needed lunch  its several weeks since i had one carroll smiled  the meal was brought in but for a while he talked as well as ate relating his adventures in somewhat disjointed fragments while the others sat listening eagerly he was also pleased to notice something which suggested returning confidence in him in evelyns intent eyes as the tale proceeded when at last he had made the matter clear he added  if i keep you waiting youll excuse me  his hostess watched his subsequent efforts with candid approval and looking up once or twice he saw sympathy in the girls face instead of the astonishment or disgust he had half expected when he finished his hostess rose and carroll stood up but nairn motioned to him to resume his place  im thinking ye had better sit still a while and smoke he said  carroll was glad to do so and they conferred together until nairn was called to the telephone  ye can have the brodick boat at noon tomorrow he reported on his return  that wont do carroll objected heavily send whitney round again i must sail tonight  he had some difficulty in getting out the words and when he rose his eyes were half closed walking unsteadily he crossed the room and sank onto a big lounge  i think he added if you dont mind ill go to sleep  nairn merely nodded and when he went silently out of the room a minute or two afterward the wornout man was already wrapped in profound slumber nairn just then received another call by telephone and left in haste for his office without speaking to his wife with the result that mrs nairn and evelyn returning to the room in search of carroll found him lying still the elder lady raised her hand in warning as she bent over the sleeper and then taking up a light rug spread it gently over him evelyn too was stirred to sudden pity for the mans attitude was eloquent of exhaustion they withdrew softly and had reached the corridor outside when mrs nairn turned to the girl  when he first came in ye blamed that man for deserting his partner she said  evelyn confessed it and her hostess smiled meaningly  are ye no rather too ready to blame  im afraid i am evelyn admitted with the color creeping into her face as she remembered another instance in which she had condemned a man hastily  in this case ye were very foolish the man came down for help and if he could no get it he would go back his lone if all the way was barred with ice and he must walk on his naked feet love of womans strong and the fear of death is keen but ye will find now and then a faith between man and man that neither would sever she paused and looked at the girl fixedly as she asked what of him that could inspire it  evelyn did not answer she had never seen her hostess in this mood and she also was stirred but the elder lady went on again  the virtue of a gift lies in part but no altogether with the giver whiles it may be bestowed unworthily but im thinking its no often the bond that will drag carroll back to the north again to his death if need be has no been spun from nothing  evelyn had no doubt that mrs nairn was right loyalty most often demanded a worthy object to tender service to it sprang from implicit confidence mutual respect and strong appreciation it was not without a reason that vane had inspired it in his comrades breast and this was the man she had condemned that fact however was by comparison a very minor trouble vane was lying helpless and alone in the snowy wilderness in peril of his life and she knew that she loved him she realized now when it might be too late that had he in reality been stained with dishonor she could have forgiven him indeed it had only been by a painful effort that she had maintained some show of composure since carroll had brought the disastrous news and she felt that she could not keep it up much longer  what she said to mrs nairn she could not remember but escaping from her she retired to her own room to lie still and grapple with an agony of fear and contrition  it was two hours later when she went down and found carroll who still looked drowsy about to go out his hostess had left him for a moment in the hall and meeting the girls eyes he smiled at her reassuringly  dont be anxious ill bring him back he said  then mrs nairn appeared and in a few moments carroll left without another word to evelyn she did not ask herself why he had taken it for granted that she would be anxious she was beyond any petty regard for appearances then it was consoling to remember that he was vanes tried comrade a man who kept his word     chapter xxix  jessys contrition   after leaving mrs nairn carroll walked toward horsfields residence in a thoughtful mood because he felt it incumbent upon him to play a part he was not particularly fitted for in a somewhat delicate matter uncongenial as his task was it was one that could not be left to vane who was even less to be trusted with the handling of such affairs and carroll had resolved as he would have described it to straighten out things  his partner had somehow offended evelyn and though she was now obviously disposed to forgive him the recollection of his supposititious iniquity might afterward rankle in her mind though vane was innocent of any conduct to which she could with reason take exception it was first of all needful to ascertain the exact nature of the charge against him carroll who for several reasons had preferred not to press this question upon evelyn had a strong suspicion that jessy horsfield was at the bottom of the trouble there was also one clue to followvane had paid the rent of celia hartleys shack and he wondered whether jessy could by any means have heard of it if she had done so the matter would be simplified for he had a profound distrust of her a recent action of hers was he thought sufficient to justify this attitude  he found her at home reclining gracefully in an easychair in her drawingroom and though she did not seem astonished to see him he fancied that her expression hinted at suppressed concern  i heard that you had arrived alone and i intended to make inquiries from mrs nairn as soon as i thought she would be at liberty she informed him  carroll had found the direct attack effective in evelyns case and he determined to try it again  then he declared it says a good deal for your courage  he never doubted that she possessed courage and she displayed it now  so she said calmly you have come as an enemy  not exactly it didnt seem worth while though theres no doubt you betrayed usvane waited for the warning you could have sentso far as it concerns our ruined interests in the clermont the things done and cant be mended well let that question go the most important point is that if you had recalled us as you promised vane would now be safe and sound  this shot told the girls face became less imperturbable there was eagerness and he thought a hint of fear in it  then has any accident happened to him  hes lying in the bush helpless in imminent peril of starvation  go on  there were signs of strain clearly perceptible in the girls voice carroll was brief but he made her understand the position then she turned upon him imperiously  then why are you wasting your time here  its a reasonable question i cant get a tug to take me back until noon tomorrow  ah murmured jessy excuse me for a minute  she left him astonished he had not expected her to take him at a disadvantage as she had done with her previous thrust and now he did not think that she had slipped away to hide her feelings that did not seem necessary in jessys case though he believed she was more or less disturbed she came back presently looking calm and sat down again  my brother will be here in a quarter of an hour she informed him things are rather slack and he had half promised to take me for a drive i have just called him up  carroll did not see how this bore upon the subject of their conversation but he left her to take the lead  did mr vane tell you that i had promised to warn him she asked  to do him justice he let it out before he quite realized what he was saying id better own that i partly surprised him into giving me the information  the expedient seems a favorite one with you i suppose no news of what has happened here can have reached him  none if its any consolation he has still an unshaken confidence in you carroll assured her with blunt bitterness  the girl showed faint signs of confusion but she sat silent for the next few moments during that time it flashed upon carroll with illuminating light that he had heard celia hartley say that miss horsfield had found her orders for millinery this confirmed his previous suspicion that jessy had discovered who had paid the rent of celias shack and that she had with deliberate malice informed evelyn distorting her account so that it would tell against vane there were breaks in the chain of reasoning which led him to this conclusion but he did not think that jessy would shrink from such a course and he determined to try a chance shot  vanes inclined to be trustful and his rash generosity has once or twice got him into trouble he remarked and went on as if an explanation were needed its miss hartleys case im thinking about just now ive an idea he asked you to look after her am i right  as soon as he had spoken he knew that he had hit the mark jessy did not openly betray herself but there are not many people who can remain absolutely unmoved when unexpectedly asked a startling question besides the man was observant and had all his faculties strung up for the encounter he saw one of her hands tighten on the arm of her chair and a hint of uneasiness in her eyes and that sufficed him  yes she replied i recommended her to some of my friends i understand that she is getting along satisfactorily  carroll felt compelled to admire her manner he believed that she loved his comrade but had nevertheless tried to ruin him in a fit of jealous rage she was no doubt now keenly regretting her success but though he thought she deserved to suffer she was bravely facing the trying situation it was one that was rife with dramatic possibilities and he was grateful to her for avoiding them  you are going back tomorrow she said after a brief silence i suppose you will have to tell your partnerwhat you have discovered hereas soon as you reach him  carroll had not intended to spare her but now he felt almost compassionate and he had one grain of comfort to offer  i must tell him that his shares in the clermont have been sacrificed i wonder if that is all you meant  jessy met his inquiring gaze with something very much like an appeal and then she spread out her hands in a manner that seemed to indicate that she threw herself upon his mercy  it is not all i meant she confessed  then if its any relief to you ill confine myself to telling him that he has been deprived of his most valuable property i dare say the news will hit him hard enough he may afterward discover other facts for himself but on the whole i shouldnt consider it likely as i said hes confiding and slow to suspect  he read genuine gratitude which he had hardly expected in the girls face but he raised his hand and went on in the rather formal manner which he felt was the only safe one to assume  i had perhaps better mention that i am going to call on miss hartley after that i shall be uncommonly thankful to start back for the bush he paused and concluded with a sudden trace of humor ill own that i feel more at home with the work that awaits me there  jessy made a little gesture which while it might have meant anything was somehow very expressive just then there were footsteps outside and the next moment horsfield walked into the room  so youre back  yes carroll replied shortly beaten at both endstheres no use in hiding it  horsfield showed no sign of satisfaction and carroll afterward admitted that the man behaved very considerately  well he declared though you may be astonished to hear it im sorry unfortunately our interests clashed and i naturally looked after mine once upon a time i thought i could have worked hand in hand with vane but our ideas did not coincide and your partner is not the man to yield a point or listen to advice  carroll was aware that horsfield had by means which were far from honorable deprived him of a considerable portion of his possessions he had also betrayed his fellow shareholders in the clermont mine selling their interests doubtless for a tempting consideration to the directors of another company for all that carroll recognized that since he and vane were beaten as he had confessed recriminations and reproaches would be useless as well as undignified he preferred to face defeat calmly  its the fortunes of war he returned what you say about vane is more or less correct but although it is not a matter of much importance now it was impossible from the beginning that your views and his ever should agree  horsfield smiled  too great a difference of temperament i dare say youre right vane measures things by a different standardmines perhaps more adapted to the marketplace but where have you left him  in the bush miss horsfield will no doubt give you particulars ive just told her the tale  she called me up at the office and asked me to come across at once will you excuse us for a few minutes  they went out together and jessy presently came back alone and looked at carroll in a diffident manner  i suppose she began one could hardly expect you to think of either of us very leniently but i must ask you to believe that i am sincerely distressed to hear of your partners accident it was a thing i could never have anticipated but there are amends i can make every minute you can save is precious isnt it  it is  then i can get you a tug my brother tells me the atlin is coming across from victoria and should be here early this evening he has gone back to the office to secure her for you though she was fixed to go off for a lumber boom  thank you responded carroll its a very great service shes a powerful boat  jessy hesitated  i think my brother would like to say a few words when he comes back can i offer you some tea  i think not answered carroll smiling for one thing if i sit still much longer i shall no doubt go to sleep again as i did at nairns and that would be neither seemly nor convenient if im to sail this evening besides now that weve arranged an armistice it might be wiser not to put too much strain on it  an armistice  i think that describes it carrolls manner grew significant the word implies a cessation of hostilitieson certain terms  jessy could take a hint and his meaning was clear unless she forced him to do so he would not betray her to his comrade who might never discover the part she had played but he had given her a warning which might be bluntly rendered as hands off there was only one course open to herto respect it she had brought down the man she loved but it was clear that he was not for her and now that the unreasoning fury which had driven her to strike had passed she was troubled with contrition there was nothing left except to retire from the field and it was better to do so gracefully for all that there were signs of strain in her expression as she capitulated  well she said i have given you proof that you have nothing to fear from me my brother is the only man in vancouver who could have got you that tug for this evening i understand that the sawmill people are very much in need of the lumber she was engaged to tow  she held out her hand and carroll took it though he had not expected to part from her on friendly terms  i owe you a good deal for that he smiled  his task however was only half completed when he left the house and the remaining portion was the more difficult but he meant to finish it he preferred to take life lightly he had trifled with it before disaster had driven him out into the wilds but there was resolution in the man and he could force himself to play an unpleasant part when it was needful fortune also favored him as she often does those who follow the boldest course  he had entered a busy street when he met kitty and celia the latter looked thin and somewhat pale but she was moving briskly and her face was eager when she shook hands with him  we have been anxious about you she declared there was no news is mr vane with you how have you got on  we found the spruce answered carroll its not worth millinga forest fire has wiped out most of itbut we struck some shingling cedar we may make something of  wheres mr vane  in the bush ive a good deal to tell you about him but we cant talk here i wonder if we could find a quiet place in a restaurant or if the park would be better  the park said kitty decidedly  they reached it in due time and carroll who had refused to say anything about vane on the way found the girls a seat in a grove of giant firs and sat down opposite to them though it was winter the day as is often the case near vancouver was pleasantly mild  now he began my partner is a singularly unfortunate person in the first place the transfer of the clermont property which you have no doubt heard of means a serious loss to him though he is not ruined yet he talks of putting up a shingling mill in which drayton will be of service and if things turn out satisfactorily you will be given an interest in it  he added the last sentence as an experiment and was satisfied with the result  never mind our interests cried kitty what about mr vane  for the third time since his arrival carroll made the strongest appeal he could to womanly pity drawing with a purpose a vivid picture of his comrades peril and suffering nor was he disappointed for he saw consternation compassion and sympathy in the girls faces so far the thing had been easy but now he hesitated and it was with difficulty that he nerved himself for what must follow  he has been beaten out of his stock in the mine hes broken down in health and in danger but by comparison that doesnt count for very much with him he has another trouble and though im afraid im going out of the way in mentioning it if it could be got over it would help him to face the future and set him on his feet again  then he briefly recounted the story of vanes regard for evelyn making the most of his sacrifice in withdrawing from the field and again he realized that he had acted wisely a love affair appealed to his listeners and there was a romance in this one that heightened the effect of it  but miss chisholm cant mean to turn from him now interrupted celia  carroll looked at her meaningly  no she turned from him before he sailed she heard something about him  his companions appeared astonished  she couldnt have heard anything that anybody could mind kitty exclaimed indignantly hes not that kind of man  its a compliment returned carroll i think he deserves it at the same time hes a little rash and now and then a mans generosity is open to misconception in this case i dont think one could altogether blame miss chisholm  kitty glanced at him sharply and then at celia who looked at first puzzled and then startled then the blood surged into kittys cheeks  oh she gasped as if she were breathless i was once afraid of something like this you mean were the cause of it  the course he followed was hateful to carroll but the tangle could not be straightened without having somebodys feelings hurt and it was his comrade about whom he was most concerned  i believe that you understand the situation he said quietly  he saw the fire in kittys eyes and noticed that celias face also was flushed but he did not think their anger was directed against him they knew the world they lived in and for that matter he could share their indignation he resented the fact that a little thing should bring swift suspicion upon them he was however not required to face any disconcerting climax indeed it struck him as curious that a difficult situation in which strong emotion was stirred up could become so tamely prosaic merely because it was resolutely handled in a matteroffact manner  well inquired celia why did you tell us this  i think you both owe vane something and you can do him a great favor just now  kitty looked up at him  dont ask me too much mr carroll im irish and i feel like killing somebody  its natural responded carroll with a sympathetic smile ive now and then felt much the same way its probably unavoidable in a world like this however i think you ought to call on miss chisholm after ive gone though youd better not mention that i sent you you can say you came for news of vaneand add anything that you consider necessary  the girls looked at each other and at length though it obviously cost her a struggle kitty said decidedly  we will have to go  then she faced round toward carroll  if miss chisholm wont believe us shell be sorry we came  carroll made her a slight inclination  shell deserve it if shes not convinced but it might be better if you didnt approach her in the mood youre in just now  kitty rose motioning to celia and carroll turned back with them toward the city feeling a certain constraint in their company and yet conscious of a strong relief it had grown dark when he returned to nairns house  where have ye been his host inquired i had a clerk seeking ye all round the city i canna get ye a boat before the morn  carroll saw that mrs nairn shared her husbands desire to learn how he had been occupied evelyn also was in the room and she waited expectantly for his answer  there were one or two little matters that required attention and i managed to arrange them satisfactorily he explained among other things ive got a tug and i expect to sail in an hour or two miss horsfield found me the vessel  he noticed evelyns interest and was rather pleased to see it if she were disposed to be jealous of jessy it could do no harm nairn however frowned  im thinking it might have been better if ye had no troubled jessy he commented  im sorry i cant agree with you carroll retorted the difference between this evening and noon tomorrow is a big consideration  weel replied nairn resignedly i can no deny the thing if ye look at it like that  carroll changed the subject but some time later mrs nairn sat down near him in the temporary absence of her husband and evelyn  we will no be disturbed for two or three minutes she said ye answered alic like a scotsman before supper and put him off the track though thats no so easy done  carroll grinned he enjoyed an encounter with mrs nairn though she was as a rule more than a match for him  youre too complimentary he declared the genuine caledonian caution cant be acquired by outsiders its a gift  ill no practise it now returned the lady yere no so proud of yourself for nothing what have ye been after  carroll crossed his fingertips and looked at her over them  since you ask the question i may say thisif miss chisholm has two lady visitors during the next few days you might make sure that she sees them  what are their names  miss celia hartley the daughter of the prospector who sent vane off to look for the timber and miss kitty blake who as you have probably heard once came down the west coast with him in company with an elder lady and myself  mrs nairn started then she looked thoughtful and finally she broke into a smile of open appreciation  now she ejaculated i understand i did no think it of ye yere no far from a genius  thanks i believe i succeeded better than i could have expected and perhaps than i deserved  they were interrupted then by nairn who came hastily into the room  theres one of the atlin deckhands below he announced hes come on here from horsfields to say that the boats ready with a full head of steam up and the packers ye hired are waiting on the wharf  carroll rose and became in a moment intent and eager  tell him ill be down almost as soon as he is youll have to excuse me two minutes later he left the house and fervent good wishes followed him from the party on the stoop he did not stop to acknowledge them but shortly afterward the blast of a whistle came ringing across the roofs from beside the waterfront     chapter xxx  convincing testimony   one afternoon three or four days after carroll had sailed evelyn sat alone in mrs nairns drawingroom a prey to confused regrets and keen anxiety she had recovered from the first shock caused her by carrolls news but though she could face the situation more calmly she could find no comfort anywherevane was lying helpless and famishing in the frostbound wilderness she knew that she loved the man indeed she had really known it for some time and it was that which had made jessys revelation so bitter now fastidious in thought and feeling as she was she wondered whether she had been too hard upon him it was becoming more and more difficult to believe that he could have justified her disgust and anger but this was not what troubled her most she had sent him away with cold disfavor now he was threatened by dangers it was horrible to think of what might befall him before assistance arrived and yet she could not drive the haunting dread out of her mind  she was in this mood when a maid announced that two visitors wished to see her and when they were shown in she found it difficult to hide her astonishment as she recognized in kitty the very attractive girl she had once seen in vanes company it was this which prompted her to assume a chilling manner though she asked her guests to be seated neither of them appeared altogether at her ease and there was indeed a rather ominous sparkle in kittys blue eyes  mr carroll was in town not long ago kitty began bluntly have you had any news of him since he sailed  evelyn did not know what to make of the question and she answered coldly  no we do not expect any word for some time  im sorry were anxious about mr vane  on the surface the announcement appeared significant but the girls boldness in coming to her for news was inexplainable to evelyn puzzled as she was her attitude became more discouraging  you know him then  something in her tone made celias cheeks burn and she drew herself up  yes she said we know him both of us i guess its astonishing to you but i met him first when he was poor and getting rich hasnt spoiled mr vane  evelyn was once more puzzled the girls manner savored less of assurance than of wholesome pride which had been injured kitty then broke in  we had no cards to send in but im kathleen blake and this is celia hartleyit was her father sent mr vane off to look for the spruce  ah exclaimed evelyn a little more gently addressing celia i understand that your father died  kitty flashed a commanding glance at celia  yes the girl replied that is correct he left me ill and worn out without a dollar and i dont know what i should have done if mr vane hadnt insisted on giving drayton a little money for me on account he said because i was a partner in the venture then miss horsfield got some work among her friends for me to do at home mr vane must have asked her to it would be like him  evelyn sat silent a few moments celia had given her a good deal of information in answer to a very simple remark but she was most impressed by the statement that jessy who had prejudiced her against vane had helped the girl at his request it was difficult to believe that she would have done so had there been any foundation for her insinuations if celia spoke the truth and evelyn somehow felt this was the case the whole thing was extraordinary  now continued celia its no way astonishing that im grateful to mr vane and anxious to hear whether mr carroll has reached him this was spoken with a hint of defiance but the girls voice changed  i am anxious its horrible to think of a man like him freezing in the bush  her concern was so genuine and yet somehow so innocent that evelyns heart softened  yes she asserted its dreadful then she asked a question whos the mr drayton you mentioned  kitty blushed becomingly this was her lead  hes a kind of partner in the lumber scheme im going to marry him hes as firm a friend of mr vanes as any one theres a reason for thati was in a very tight place once left without money in a desolate settlement where there was nothing i could do when mr vane helped me but perhaps that wouldnt interest you  for a moment her doubts still clung to their hold in evelyns mind and then she suddenly drove the last of them out with a stinging sense of humiliation she could not distrust this girl it was jessys suggestion that was incredible  it would interest me very much she declared  kitty told her story effectively but with caution laying most stress upon vanes compassion for the child and her invalid mother she was rather impressed by miss chisholm but she supposed that she was endowed with some of the failing common to human nature  evelyn listened with confused emotions and a softened face she was convinced of the truth of the simple tale and the thought of vanes keeping his moneyed friends and directors waiting in vancouver in order that a tired child might rest and gather shells upon a sunny beach stirred her deeply it was so characteristic exactly what she would have expected him to do  thank you she said quietly when kitty had finished and then flinging off the last of her reserve she asked a number of questions about drayton and about celias affairs  before her visitors left all three were on friendly terms but evelyn was glad when they took their departure she wanted to be alone to think in spite of the relief of which she was conscious her thoughts were far from pleasant foremost among them figured a crushing sense of shame she had wickedly misjudged a man who had given her many proofs of the fineness of his character the evil she had imputed to him was born of her own perverted imagination she was no better than the narrowminded conventional pharisees she detested who were swift to condemn out of the uncleanness of their selfrighteous hearts then as she began to reason it flashed upon her that she was perhaps wronging herself her mind had been cunningly poisoned by an utterly unscrupulous and wholly detestable woman and she flamed out into a fit of imperious anger against jessy she had a hazy idea that this was not altogether reasonable for she was to some extent fastening the blame she deserved upon another persons shoulders but it did not detract from the comfort the indulgence in her indignation brought her  when she had grown a little calmer mrs nairn came in and mrs nairn was a discerning lady it was not difficult to lead evelyn on to speak of her visitors for the girls pride was broken and she felt in urgent need of sympathy but when she had described the interview she felt impelled to avoid any discussion of the more important issues even with the kindly scotch lady  i was surprised at the girls manner she concluded it must have been embarrassing to them but they were really so delicate over it and they had so much courage  mrs nairn smiled  although one of them has traveled with thirdrate strolling companies and the other has waited in a hotel weel maybe your surprise was natural ye canna all at once get rid of the ideas and prejudices ye were brought up with  i suppose that was it replied evelyn thoughtfully  her companions eyes twinkled  then if yere to live among us happily yell have to try in the way ye use the words some of the leading men in this country were no brought up at all  do you imagine that im going to live here  mrs nairn gathered up one or two articles she had brought into the room with her and moved toward the door but before she reached it she looked back with a laugh  it occurred to me that the thing was no altogether impossible  an hour afterward evelyn and mrs nairn went down into the town and in one of the streets they came upon jessy leaving a store the latter was not lacking in assurance and she moved toward them with a smile but evelyn gazed at her with a total disregard of her presence and walked quietly on there was neither anger nor disdain in her attitude to have shown either would have been a concession she could not make the instincts of generations of gentlyreared englishwomen were aroused as well as the revulsion of an untainted nature from something unclean  jessys cheeks turned crimson and a malevolent light flashed into her eyes as she crossed the street mrs nairn noticed her expression and smiled at her companion  im thinking its as weel ye met jessy after she had got the boat for carroll she commented  the remark was no doubt justified but the fact that jessy had been able to offer valuable assistance failed to soften evelyn toward her it was merely another offense  in the meanwhile the powerful tug steamed northward towing the sloop which would be required and after landing the rescue party at the inlet steamed away again before she had disappeared carroll began his march and his companions long remembered it two of them were accustomed to packing surveyors stores through the seldomtrodden bush and the others had worked in logging camps and chopped new roads but though they did not spare themselves they lacked their leaders animus carroll with all his love of ease could rise to meet an emergency and he wore out his companions before the journey was half done he scarcely let them sleep he fed them on canned stuff to save delay in lighting fires and he grew more feverishly impatient with every mile they made he showed it chiefly by the tight set of his lips and the tension of his face though now and then when fallen branches or thickets barred the way he fell upon the obstacles with the ax in silent fury for the rest he took the lead and kept it and the others following with shoulders aching from the packstraps and labored breath suppressed their protests  like many another made in that country it was a heroic journey one in which every power of mind and body was taxed to the limit delay might prove fatal the loads were heavy fatigue seized the shrinking flesh but the unrelenting will trained in such adventures mercilessly spurred it on toughened muscle is useful and in the trackless north can seldom be dispensed with but mans strength does not consist of that alone there are occasions when the stalwart fall behind and die  in front of them as they progressed lay the unchanging forest tangled choked with fallen wreckage laced here and there with stabbing thorns appalling and almost impenetrable to the stranger they must cleave their passage except where they could take to the creek for an easier way and wade through stingingly cold water or flounder over slippery fangs of rock and iceencrusted stones there was sharp frost among the ranges and the brush through which they tore their way was generally burdened with clogging snow they went on however and on the last day carroll drew some distance ahead of those who followed him it was dark when he discovered that he had lost them but that did not matter for now and then faint moonlight came filtering down and he was leaving a plain trail behind his shoulders were bleeding beneath the biting straps he was on the verge of exhaustion but he struggled forward panting heavily and rending his garments to rags as he smashed through the brakes in the darkness  the nightit seemed a very long onewas nearly over when he recognized the roar of a rapid that rang in louder and louder pulsations across the snowsprinkled bush he was not far from the end now and he became conscious of an unnerving fear the ground was ascending sharply and when he reached the top of the slope the question from which he shrank would be answered for himif there should be no blink of light among the serried trunks he would have come too late  he reached the summit and his heart leaped then he clutched at a drooping branch to support himself shaken by a reaction that sprang from relief a flicker of uncertain radiance fell upon the trees ahead and down the bitter wind there came the reek of pungent smoke the bush was slightly more open and carroll broke into a run presently he came crashing and stumbling into the light of the fire and then stopped too stirred and out of breath to speak vane lay where the red glow fell upon his face smiling up at him  well he said youve come ive been expecting you but on the whole i got along not so badly  carroll flung off his pack and sat down beside the fire then he fumbled for his pipe and began to fill it hurriedly with trembling fingers he lighted it and flung away the match before he spoke  sorry i couldnt get through sooner he mumbled the stores on board the sloop were spoiled i had to go on to vancouver but there are things to eat in my pack  hand it across i havent been faring sumptuously the last few days no sit still im supple enough from the waist up  he proved it by the way he leaned to and fro as he opened the pack and distributed part of its contents among the cooking utensils carroll assisted him now and then but he did not care to speak the sight of the mans gaunt face and the eagerness in his eyes prompted him to an outbreak of feeling rather foreign to his nature and he did not think his companion would appreciate it when the meal was ready vane looked up at him  ive no doubt this journey cost you somethingpartner he said  then they ate cheerfully and carroll watching his friends efforts with appreciation told his story in broken sentences afterward they lighted their pipes but by and by carrolls fell from his relaxing grasp  i cant get over this sleepiness he explained i believe i disgraced myself in vancouver by going off in the most unsuitable places  i dare say it was quite natural anyway hadnt you better hitch yourself a little farther from the fire  carroll did so and lay still afterward but vane kept watch during the rest of the night until in the dawn the packers appeared     chapter xxxi  vane is reinstated   breakfast was over and the two men wrapped in blankets lay on opposite sides of the fire while the packers reclined in various ungainly attitudes about another now that they had a supply of provisions haste was not a matter of importance and there was no doubt that the rescue party needed a rest carroll was aching all over and was somewhat disturbed in mind he had not said anything about their financial affairs to his comrade yet and the subject must be mentioned it was from every point of view an unpleasant one  what about the clermont vane asked at length you neednt trouble about breaking the newscome right to the point  then to all intents and purposes the company has gone under its been taken over by horsfields friends nairn has sold our stockat considerably less than face value carroll explained adding a brief account of the absorption of the concern  vanes face set hard  i anticipated something of the kind last night i saw how you kept clear of the matter  but you said nothing  no id had time to consider the thing while i lay here and it didnt look as if i could have got an intelligible account out of you but you may as well mention how much nairn got  he lay smoking silently for a few minutes after he learned the amount and carroll was strongly moved to sympathy he felt that it was not the financial reverse but one indirect result of it which would hit his comrade hardest  well vane said grimly i suppose ive done what my friends would consider a mad thing in coming up hereand i must face the reckoning  carroll wondered whether their conversation could be confined to the surface of the subject because there were depths beneath it that it would be better to leave undisturbed  after all youre far from broke he encouraged him you have what the clermont stock brought in and you may make something out of this shingle scheme  there was bitterness in vanes laugh  when i left vancouver for england i was generally supposed to be well on the way to affluence and there was some foundation for the idea i had floated the clermont in the face of opposition people believed in me i could have raised what money i required for any new undertaking now a good deal of my money and all of my prestige is gone people have very little confidence in a man who has shown himself a failure whats more i may be a cripple my leg will probably have to be broken again  carroll could guess his companions thoughts there was a vein of stubborn pride in him and he had no doubt decided it was unfitting that evelyns future should be linked to that of a ruined man this was an exaggerated view because vane was in reality far from ruined and even if he had been so he had in him the ability to recover from his misfortunes still the man was obstinate and generally ready to make a sacrifice for an idea carroll however consoled himself with the reflection that evelyn would probably have something to say upon the subject if she were given an opportunity and he felt certain that mrs nairn would contrive that she had one  i cant see any benefit in making things out considerably worse than they are he objected  nor can i vane agreed after all i was getting pretty tired of the city and i suppose i can raise enough to put up a smallpower mill it will be a pleasant change to take charge for a year or two in the bush ill make a start at the thing as soon as im able to walk  this was significant as it implied that he did not intend to remain in vancouver where he would be able to enjoy evelyns company but carroll made no comment and vane soon spoke again  didnt you mention last night that it was through miss horsfield that you got the tug i was thinking about something else at the time  yes she made horsfield put some pressure on the people who had previously hired the boat  thats rather strange  for a moment he looked puzzled but almost immediately his face grew impassive and carroll knew that he had some idea of jessys treachery he was however sure that any suspicions his comrade entertained would remain locked up in his breast  im grateful to her anyway vane added i dare say i could have held out another day or two but it wouldnt have been pleasant  carroll began to talk about the preparations for their return which he soon afterward set about making and early the next morning they started for the sloop carrying vane upon a stretcher they had brought with them though they had to cut a passage for it every here and there they reached the sloop in safety and after some trouble in getting vane below and onto a locker carroll decided to sail straight for vancouver they were favored with moderate fair winds and though the little vessel was uncomfortably crowded she made a quick passage and stole in through the narrows as dusk was closing down one tranquil evening  evelyn had spent the greater part of the afternoon on the forestcrested rise above the city where she could look down upon the inlet she had visited the spot frequently during the last few days watching eagerly for a sail that did not appear there had been no news of carroll since the skipper of the tug reported having landed him and the girl was tormented by doubts and anxieties she had just come back and was standing in mrs nairns sittingroom when she heard the tinkle of the telephone bell a moment or two later her hostess entered hastily  its a message from alic she cried hes heard from the wharfvanes sloops crossing the harbor ill away down to see carroll brings him here  evelyn turned to follow her but mrs nairn waved her back  no she said firmly yell bide where ye are see they get plenty lights onat the stairhead and in the passageand the room on the left of it ready  she was gone in another moment and evelyn hastily carried out her instructions and then waited with what patience she could assume at last there was a rattle of wheels outside followed by a voice giving orders and then a tramp of feet the sounds brought her a strange inward shrinking but she ran to the door and saw two tattered men awkwardly carrying a stretcher up the steps while carroll and another assisted them then the light fell upon its burden and half prepared as she was she started in dismay vane whom she had last seen in vigorous health lay partly covered with an old blanket which had slipped off him to the waist his jacket looked a mass of rags his hat had fallen aside and his face showed hollow and worn and pinched then he saw her and a light leaped into his eyes but the next moment carrolls shoulder hid him and the men plodded on toward the stairs they ascended them with difficulty and the girl waited until carroll came down  i noticed you at the door i dare say you were a little shocked at the change in vane he said what he has undergone has pulled him down but if you had seen him when i first found him youd have been worse startled hes getting on quite satisfactorily  evelyn was relieved to hear it and carroll continued  as soon as the doctor comes well make him more presentable he cant be moved till then as im not sure about the last bandages i put on afterward hell no doubt hold an audience  there was nothing to do but wait and evelyn again summoned her patience before long a doctor arrived and carroll followed him to vanes room the invalids face was very impassive though carroll waited in tense suspense while the doctor stripped off the bandages and bark supports from the injured leg he examined it attentively and then looked around at carroll  you fixed that limb when it was broken in the bush he asked  yes carroll answered with a desperate attempt to treat the matter humorously but i really think we both had a hand in the thing my partner favored me with his views i disclaim some of the responsibility  then i guess youve been remarkably fortunate perhaps thats the best way of expressing it  vane raised his head and fixed his eyes upon the speaker  it wont have to be rebroken ill be able to walk without a limp  its most probable  vanes eyes glistened and he let his head fall back  its good news better than i expected now if you could fix me up again id like to get dressed ive felt like a hobo long enough  the doctor smiled indulgently  we can venture to change that state of affairs but ill superintend the operation  it was some time before vanes toilet was completed and then carroll surveyed him with humorous admiration  it strikes me you do us credit and now i suppose i can announce that youll receive  nairn and his wife and evelyn came in nairn shaking hands with vane very heartily looked down at him with twinkling eyes  id have been glad to see ye however ye had come he asserted and vane fully believed him for a that this is no the way i would have wished to welcome ye  when a man wont take his friends advice what can he expect retorted vane  nairn nodded smiling  let it be a warning if the making of your mark and money is your object ye must stick to it and think of nothing else ye canna accumulate riches by spreading yourself and philanthropys no lucrative except maybe to a few  its good counsel but im thinking that its a pity mrs nairn remarked what would ye say evelyn  the girl was aware that the tone of light banter had been adopted to cover deeper feelings which those present shrank from expressing but she ventured to give her thoughts free rein  i agree with you in one respect she said but i cant believe the object mentioned is mr vanes only one he would never be willing to pay the necessary price  it was a delicate compliment uttered in all sincerity and vanes worn face grew warm he was however conscious that it would be safer to avoid being serious and he smiled  well he drawled looking for timber rights is apt to prove expensive too i had a haunting fear that i might be lame until the doctor banished it id better own that id no great confidence in carrolls surgery  carroll keeping strictly to the line the others had chosen made him an ironical bow but evelyn was not to be deterred  it was foolish of you to be troubled she declared it isnt a fault to be wounded in an honorable fight and even if the mark remains there is no reason why one should be ashamed of it  mrs nairn glanced at the girl rather sharply but carroll came to his comrades relief  strictly speaking there wasnt a wound he pointed out fortunately it was what is known as a simple fracture if it had been anything else im inclined to think i couldnt have treated it  nairn chuckled as if this met with his approval and his wife turned around as they heard a patter of footsteps on the stairs  yon bell has kept on ringing ever since we came up she complained i left word i was no to be disturbed weelas the door openedwhat is it minnie  the reception rooms plumb full announced the maid who was lately from the bush if any more folks come along i sure wont know where to put em  now that the door was open evelyn could hear a murmur of voices on the floor below and the next moment the bell rang violently again it struck her as a testimonial to the injured man vane had not spent a long time in vancouver but he had the gift of making friends having heard of the sloops arrival they had come to inquire for him and there was obviously a number of them  mrs nairn glanced interrogatively at carroll  it does no look as if they could be got rid of by a message  i guess hes fit to see them carroll answered well hold a levee if hed only let me id like to pose him a bit  mrs nairn with evelyns assistance did so instead rearranging the cushions about the man in spite of his confused and halfindignant protests and during the next halfhour the room was generally full people walked in made sympathetic inquiries or exchanged cheerful banter until mrs nairn forcibly dismissed the last of them after this she declared that vane must go to sleep and paying no heed to his assertion that he had not the least wish to do so she led her remaining companions away  a couple of hours had passed when she handed evelyn a large tumbler containing a preparation of beaten eggs and milk  ye might take him this and ask if he would like anything else she said im weary of the stairs and i would no trust minnie shes handiest at spilling things  carroll grinned  its the third and id better say firmly the limit  then he assumed an aggrieved expression as evelyn moved off with the tray  i cant see why i couldnt have gone i think ive discharged my duties as nurse satisfactorily  i canna help ye thinking mrs nairn informed him but i would point out that ye have now and then been wrong  thats a fact carroll confessed  evelyn fully shared his suspicions her hostesss artifice was a transparent one but she nevertheless fell in with it she had seen vane only in the company of others this might be the same again tomorrow and there was something to be said by intuition as much as reason she recognized that there was something working in his mind something that troubled him and might trouble her it excited her apprehension and animated her with a desire to combat it that she might be compelled to follow an unconventional course did not matter she knew this man was hersand she could not let him go  she entered his room collectedly he was lying neatly dressed upon a couch with his shoulders raised against the end of it for he had thrown the cushions which supported him upon the floor as she came in he leaned down in an attempt to recover them and finding himself too late looked up guiltily the fact that he could move with so much freedom was a comfort to the girl she set the tray down on a table near him  mrs nairn has sent you this she said and the laugh they both indulged in drew them together  then her mood changed and her heart yearned over him he had gone away a strong selfconfident prosperous man and he had come back defeated broken in fortune and terribly worn her pity shone in her softening eyes  do you wish to sleep she asked  no vane assured her id a good deal rather talk to you  i want to say something evelyn confessed im afraid i was rather unpleasant to you the evening before you sailed i was sorry for it afterward it was flagrant injustice  then i wonder why you didnt answer the letter i wrote at nanaimo  the letter i never received one  vane considered this for a few moments  after all he declared it doesnt matter now im acquitted  absolutely  the mans satisfaction was obvious but he smiled  do you know he said ive still no idea of my offense  evelyn was exceedingly glad to hear it but a warmth crept into her face and as the blood showed through the delicate skin he fixed his eyes upon her intently  it was all a mistake im sorry still she murmured penitently  oh he exclaimed in a different tone dont trouble about it the satisfaction of being acquitted outweighs everything else besides ive made a number of rather serious mistakes myself the search for that spruce for instance is supposed to be one  no returned evelyn decidedly whoever thinks that is wrong it is a very fine thing you have done it doesnt matter in the least that you were unsuccessful  do you really believe that  of course how could i believe anything else  the mans face changed again and once more she read the signs whatever doubts and halfformed resolutionsand she had some idea of themhad been working in his mind were dissipating  well he continued ive sacrificed the best half of my possessions and have destroyed the confidence of the people who to serve their ends would have helped me on isnt that a serious thing  no its really a most unimportant one ithe slight pause gave the assertion forcereally mean it  vane partly raised himself with one arm and there was no doubting the significance of his intent gaze  i believe i made another blunderin england i should have had more courage and have faced the risk but you might have turned against me then  i dont think thats likely evelyn murmured lowering her eyes  the man leaned forward eagerly but the hand he stretched out fell short and the trivial fact once more roused her compassion for his helplessness  you can mean only one thing he cried you wouldnt be afraid to face the future with me now  i wouldnt be afraid at all  a halfhour later mrs nairn tapped at the door and smiled rather broadly when she came in then she shook her head reproachfully  ye should have been asleep a while since she scolded vane and then turned to evelyn is this the way ye intend to look after him  she waved the girl toward the door and when she joined her in the passage she kissed her effusively  ye have got the man i would have chosen ye she declared it will no be any fault of his if ye are sorry  i have very little fear of that laughed evelyn   the end
