57699574	night watches  by ww jacobs     the understudy  the understudy  dogs on board ship is a nuisance said the nightwatchman gazing fiercely at the vociferous mongrel that had chased him from the deck of the henry william the skipper asks me to keep an eye on the ship and then leaves a thing like that down in the cabin  he leaned against a pile of empty casks to recover his breath shook his fist at the dog and said slowly  some people cant make too much of em  they talk about a dogs honest eyes and his faithful art  i ad a dog once and i never saw his eyes look so honest as they did one day when e was sitting on a pound o beefsteak we was unting high and low for  ive known dogs to cause a lot of trouble in my time  a man as used to live in my street told me he ad been in jail three times because dogs follered him ome and wouldnt go away when he told em to  he said that some men would ha kicked em out into the street but he thought their little lives was far too valuable to risk in that way  some people used to wink when e talked like that but i didnt i remembered a dog that took a fancy to old sam small and ginger dick and peter russet once in just the same way  it was one night in a little publicouse down commercial road way they ad ony been ashore a week and aving been turned out of a musicall the night afore because a man ginger dick had punched in the jaw wouldnt behave imself they said theyd spend the rest o their money on beer instead  there was just the three of em sitting by themselves in a cosy little bar when the door was pushed open and a big black dog came in  he came straight up to sam and licked his and  sam was eating a arrowroot biscuit with a bit o cheese on it at the time  he wasnt wot youd call a partickler sort o man but seeing as ow the dog was so careless that e licked the biscuit amost as much as he did his and he gave it to im  the dog took it in one gulp and then he jumped up on sams lap and wagged his tail in is face for joy and thankfulness  hes took a fancy to you sam ses ginger  sam pushed the dog off on to the floor and wiped his face  hes a good dog by the look of im ses peter russet who was country bred  he bought a sausageroll and him and the dog ate it between em  then ginger dick bought one and gave it to im and by the time it was finished the dog didnt seem to know which one of em he loved the most  wonder who he belongs to  ses ginger  is there any name on the collar peter  peter shook his ead  its a good collar though he ses  i wonder whether hes been and lost imself  old sam wot was always on the lookout for money put his beer down and wiped is mouth  there might be a reward out for im he ses i think ill take care of im for a day or two in case  well all take care of im ses ginger and if theres a reward well go shares  mind that  i found im ses sam very disagreeable  he came up to me as if hed known me all is life  no ses ginger  dont you flatter yourself  he came up to you because he didnt know you sam  if he ad hed ha bit your and ses peter russet  instead o washing it ses ginger  go on  ses sam olding his breath with passion  go on  peter opened is mouth but just then another man came into the bar and arter ordering is drink turned round and patted the dogs ead  thats a good dog ow old is he  he ses to ginger  two years last april ses ginger without moving a eyelid  fifth of april ses old sam very quick and fierce  at two oclock in the morning ses peter  the man took up is beer and looked at em then e took a drink and looked at em again  arter which he ad another look at the dog  i could see e was very valuable he ses  i see that the moment i set eyes on im  mind you dont get im stole  he finished up is beer and went out and he ad ardly gone afore ginger took a piece o thick string out of is pocket and fastened it to the dogs collar  make yourself at ome ginger ses sam very nasty  im going to ses ginger  that chap knows something about dogs and if we cant get a reward for im praps we can sell im  they ad another arfpint each and then ginger taking old of the string they went out into the street  nine oclock ses peter  its no good going ome yet ginger  we can ave a glass or two on the way ses ginger but i shant feel comfortable in my mind till weve got the dog safe ome  praps the people wot ave lost it are looking for it now  they ad another drink farther on and a man in the bar took such a fancy to the dog that e offered ginger five shillings for it and drinks round  that shows ow valuable it is ses peter russet when they got outside hold that string tight ginger  wots the matter  he wont come ses ginger tugging at the string  come on old chap good dog  come on  he stood there pulling at the dog wot was sitting down and being dragged along on its stummick  he didnt know its name but e called it a few things that seemed to ease is mind and then he anded over the string to sam wot ad been asking for it and told im to see wot he could do  we shall ave a crowd round us in a minute ses peter  mind you dont bust a bloodvessel sam  and be locked up for stealing it praps ses ginger  better let it go sam  wot arter refusing five bob for it  ses sam  talk sense ginger and give it a shove beind  ginger gave it a shove but it was no good  there was three or four people coming along the road and sam made up is mind in an instant and eld up his and to a cab that was passing  it took the three of em to get the dog into the cab and as soon as it was in the cabman told em to take it out agin  they argufied with im till their tongues ached and at last arter paying im four shillings and sixpence afore they started he climbed up on the box and drove off  the door was open when they got to their lodgings but they ad to be careful because o the landlady  it took the three of em to pull and push that dog upstairs and ginger took a dislike to dogs that e never really got over  they got im in the bedroom at last and arter they ad given im a drink o water out o the washhand basin ginger and peter started to find fault with sam small  i know wot im about ses sam but o course if you dont want your share say so  wot  talk sense  ses ginger  we paid our share o the cab didnt we and more fools us  there wont be no share ses peter russet but if there is were going toave it  they undressed themselves and got into bed and ginger adnt been in his five minutes afore the dog started to get in with im  when ginger pushed im off e seemed to think he was having a game with im and arter pretending to bite im in play he took the end of the counterpane in is mouth and tried to drag it off  why dont you get to sleep ginger  ses sam who was just dropping off  ave a game with im in the morning  ginger gave the dog a punch in the chest and arter saying a few o the things hed like to do to sam small he cuddled down in is bed and they all went off to sleep  all but the dog that is  he seemed uneasy in is mind and if e woke em up once by standing on his indlegs and putting his forepaws on their chest to see if they was still alive he did arfadozen times  he dropped off to sleep at last scratching imself but about three oclock in the morning ginger woke up with a orrible start and sat up in bed shivering  sam and peter woke up too and raising themselves in bed looked at the dog wot was sitting on its tail with its ead back moaning fit to break its art  wots the matter  ses old sam in a shaky voice  stop it  stop it dye hear  praps its dying ses ginger as the dog let off a owl like a steamer coming up the river  stop it you brute  hell wake the ouse up in a minute ses peter  take im downstairs and kick im into the street sam  take im yourself ses sam  hsh  somebodys coming upstairs  poor old doggie  come along then  come along  the dog left off his owling and went over and licked im just as the landlady and one or two more came to the door and called out to know wot they meant by it  its all right missis ses sam  its ony pore ginger  you keep quiet he ses in a whisper turning to ginger  wots he making that row about  ses the landlady  he made my blood run cold  hes got a touch o toothache ses sam  never mind ginger e ses in a hurry as the dog let off another owl try and bear it  hes a coward thats wot e is ses the landlady very fierce  why a child o five wouldnt make such a fuss  sounds more like a dog than a uman being ses another voice  you come outside ginger and ill give you something to cry for  they waited a minute or two and then everything being quiet they went back to bed while old sam talked to ginger about wot e called is presence o mind and ginger talked to im about wot hed do to im if e wasnt a fat old man with one foot in the grave  they was all in a better temper when they woke up in the morning and while sam was washing they talked about wot they was to do with the dog  we cant lead im about all day ses ginger and if we let im off the string hell go off ome  he dont know where his ome is ses sam very severe but he might run away and then the pore thing might be starved or else illtreated i ave eard o boys tying tin cans to their tails  ive done it myself ses ginger nodding  consequently its our dooty to look arter im ses sam  ill go down to the front door ses peter and when i whistle bring him down  ginger stuck his ead out o the window and by and by when peter whistled him and sam took the dog downstairs and out into the street  so far so good ses sam now wot about brekfuss  they ad their brekfuss in their usual coffeeshop and the dog took bits from all of them  unfortunately e wasnt used to haddick bones and arter two of the customers ad gorn out and two more ad complained to the landlord they ad to leave their brekfusses and take im outside for a breath o fresh air  now wot are we going to do  ses ginger  im beginning to be sick of the sight of im  ave we got to lead im about all day on a bit o string  lets take im round the corner and lose im ses peter russet  you give me old o that string ses sam  if you dont want shares thats all right  if im going to look arter im ill ave it all  that made ginger and peter look at each other  direckly sam began to talk about money they began to think they might be losing something  and wot about aving im in our bedroom and keeping us awake all night ses peter  and putting it on to me with the toothache ses ginger  no you can look arter im sam while me and peter goes off and enjoys ourselves and if you get anything we go shares mind  all right ses sam turning away with the dog  and suppose sam gets a reward or sells it and then tells us that it ran away and e lost it  ses peter  o course i never thought o that ses ginger  youve got your ead on straight peter  i see im smile thats why ses peter russet  youre a liar ses sam  well stick together ses ginger  leastways one of usll keep with you sam  they settled it that way at last and while ginger went for a walk down round about where they ad found the dog sam small and peter waited for him in a little publicouse down limehouse way  their idea was that there would be bills up and when ginger came back and said there wasnt they ad a lot to say about people wot wasnt fit to ave dogs because they didnt love em  they ad a miserable day  when the dog got sick o sitting in a pub e made such a noise they ad to take im out and when e got tired o walking about he sat down on the pavement and they ad to drag im along to the nearest pub agin  at five oclock in the arternoon ginger dick was talking about twopennorth o ratpoison  wot are we to do with im till twelve oclock tonight  ses peter  and spose we cant smuggle im into the ouse agin  ses ginger  or suppose he makes that noise agin in the night  they ad a pint each to elp them to think wot was to be done  and arter a lot o talking and quarrelling they did wot a lot of other people ave done when they got into trouble they came to me  i ad ony been on dooty about arf an hour when the three of em turned up at the wharf with the dog and arter saying ow well i looked and that i seemed to get younger every time they saw me they asked me to take charge of the dog for em  itll be company for you ses old sam  it must be very lonely ere of a night  ive often thought of it  and of a daytime you could take it ome and tie it up in your back yard ses ginger  i wouldnt ave anything to do with it at fust but at last i gave way they offered me fourpence a day for its keep and as i didnt want to run any risk i made em give me a couple o bob to go on with  they went off as though theyd left a load o care beind em and arter tying the dog up to a crane i went on with my work  they adnt told me wot the game was but from one or two things theyd let drop id got a pretty good idea  the dog owled a bit at fust but he quieted down arter a bit  he was a nicelooking animal but one dog is much the same as another to me and if i ad one ten years i dont suppose i could pick it out from two or three others  i took it off ome with me when i left at six oclock next morning and tied it up in my yard  my missis ad words about it o coursethats wot people get married forbut when she found it woke me up three times she quieted down and said wot a nice coat it ad got  the three of em came round next evening to see it and they was so afraid of its being lost that when they stood me a pint at the bulls head we ad to take it with us  ginger was going to buy a sausageroll for it but arter sam ad pointed out that they was paying me fourpence a day for its keep he didnt  and sam ad the cheek to tell me that it liked a nice bit o fried steak as well as anything  a lot o people admired that dog  i remember on the fourth night i think it was the barge dauntless came alongside and arter she was made fast the skipper came ashore and took a little notice of it  where did you get im he ses  i told im ow it was and he stood there for some time patting the dog on the ead and whistling under is breath  its much the same size as my dog he ses thats a black retriever too  i ses oh  im afraid i shall ave to get rid of it he ses  its on the barge now  my missis wont ave it in the ouse any more cos it bit the baby and o course it was no good pinting out to er that it was its first bite  even the law allows one bite but its no good talking about the law to wimmen  except when its on their side i ses  he patted the dogs ead agin and whistled and a big black dog came up out of the cabin and sprang ashore  it went up and put its nose to sams dog and they both growled like thunderstorms  might be brothers ses the skipper ony your dogs got a better eead and a better coat  its a good dog  theyre all alike to me i ses  i couldnt tell em apart not if you paid me  the skipper stood there a moment and then he ses i wish youd let me see ow my dog looks in your dogs collar he ses  whaffor  i ses  ony fancy he ses  oh bill  yes i ses  it aint christmas he ses taking my arm and walking up and down a bit but it will be soon and then i mightnt see you  youve done me one or two good turns and i should like to make you a christmasbox of three arfdollars  i let im give em to me and then just to please im i let im try the collar on is dog while i swept up a bit  it looked beautiful on im he ses when id finished but ive put it back agin  come on bruno  goodnight bill  he got is dog on the barge agin arter a bit o trouble and arter making sure that my dog ad got its own collar on i went on with my work  the dog didnt seem to be quite imself next day and he was so fierce in the yard that my missis was afraid to go near im  i was going to ask the skipper about it as e seemed to know more about dogs than i did but when i got to the wharf the barge had sailed  it was just getting dark when there came a ring at the gatebell and afore i could answer it arfadozen more as fast as the bell could go and when i opened the wicket sam small and ginger and peter russet all tried to get in at once  wheres the dog  ses sam  tied up i ses  wots the matter  ave you all gorn mad  they didnt answer me  they ran on to the jetty and afore i could turn round amost they ad got the dog loose and was dragging it towards me smiling all over their faces  reward ses ginger as i caught old of im by the coat  five pounds landlord of a pubat bowcome on sam  why dont you keep your mouth shut ginger  ses sam  five pounds  i ses  five pounds  hurrah  wot are you hurraying about  ses sam very short  why i ses i sposehere arf a moment  cant stop ses sam going arter the others  i watched em up the road and then i locked the gate and walked up and down the wharf thinking wot a funny thing money is and ow it alters peoples natures  and arter all i thought that three arfdollars earned honest was better than a reward for hiding another mans dog  i finished tidying up and at nine oclock i went into the office for a quiet smoke  i couldnt elp wondering ow them three ad got on and just as i was thinking about it there came the worst ringing at the gatebell i ave ever eard in my life and the noise of heavy boots kicking the gate  it was so violent i ardly liked to go at fust thinking it might be bad news but i opened it at last and in bust sam small with ginger and peter  for five minutes they all talked at once with their nasty fists eld under my nose  i couldnt make lead or tail of it at fust and then i found as ow they ad got the dog back with them and that the landlord ad said e wasnt the one  but e said as he thought the collar was his ses sam  ow do you account for that  praps he made a mistake i ses or praps he thought youd turn the dog adrift and hed get it back for nothing  you know wot landlords are try im agin  id pretty well swear he aint the same dog ses peter russet looking in a puzzled way at sam and ginger  you take im back tomorrow night i ses  its a nice walk to bow and then come back and beg my pardon  i want to ave a word with this policeman here  goodnight
