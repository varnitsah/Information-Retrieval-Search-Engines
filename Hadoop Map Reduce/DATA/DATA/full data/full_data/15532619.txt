15532619	illustration     the little lady of the big house  by  jack london    author of the valley of the moon the star rover the sea wolf etc      chapter i    he awoke in the dark his awakening was simple easy without movement save for the eyes that opened and made him aware of darkness unlike most who must feel and grope and listen to and contact with the world about them he knew himself on the moment of awakening instantly identifying himself in time and place and personality after the lapsed hours of sleep he took up without effort the interrupted tale of his days he knew himself to be dick forrest the master of broad acres who had fallen asleep hours before after drowsily putting a match between the pages of road town and pressing off the electric reading lamp  near at hand there was the ripple and gurgle of some sleepy fountain from far off so faint and far that only a keen ear could catch he heard a sound that made him smile with pleasure he knew it for the distant throaty bawl of king poloking polo his champion short horn bull thrice grand champion also of all bulls at sacramento at the california state fairs the smile was slow in easing from dick forrests face for he dwelt a moment on the new triumphs he had destined that year for king polo on the eastern livestock circuits he would show them that a bull california born and finished could compete with the cream of bulls cornfed in iowa or imported overseas from the immemorial home of short horns  not until the smile faded which was a matter of seconds did he reach out in the dark and press the first of a row of buttons there were three rows of such buttons the concealed lighting that spilled from the huge bowl under the ceiling revealed a sleepingporch three sides of which were finemeshed copper screen the fourth side was the house wall solid concrete through which french windows gave access  he pressed the second button in the row and the bright light concentered at a particular place on the concrete wall illuminating in a row a clock a barometer and centigrade and fahrenheit thermometers almost in a sweep of glance he read the messages of the dials time 430 air pressure 2980 which was normal at that altitude and season and temperature fahrenheit 36Â° with another press the gauges of time and heat and air were sent back into the darkness  a third button turned on his reading lamp so arranged that the light fell from above and behind without shining into his eyes the first button turned off the concealed lighting overhead he reached a mass of proofsheets from the reading stand and pencil in hand lighting a cigarette he began to correct  the place was clearly the sleeping quarters of a man who worked efficiency was its key note though comfort not altogether spartan was also manifest the bed was of gray enameled iron to tone with the concrete wall across the foot of the bed an extra coverlet hung a gray robe of wolfskins with every tail adangle on the floor where rested a pair of slippers was spread a thickcoated skin of mountain goat  heaped orderly with books magazines and scribblepads there was room on the big reading stand for matches cigarettes an ashtray and a thermos bottle a phonograph for purposes of dictation stood on a hinged and swinging bracket on the wall under the barometer and thermometers from a round wooden frame laughed the face of a girl on the wall between the rows of buttons and a switchboard from an open holster loosely projected the butt of a 44 colts automatic  at six oclock sharp after gray light had begun to filter through the wire netting dick forrest without raising his eyes from the proofsheets reached out his right hand and pressed a button in the second row five minutes later a softslippered chinese emerged on the sleepingporch in his hands he bore a small tray of burnished copper on which rested a cup and saucer a tiny coffee pot of silver and a correspondingly tiny silver cream pitcher  good morning oh my was dick forrests greeting and his eyes smiled and his lips smiled as he uttered it  good morning master oh my returned as he busied himself with making room on the reading stand for the tray and with pouring the coffee and cream  this done without waiting further orders noting that his master was already sipping coffee with one hand while he made a correction on the proof with the other oh my picked up a rosy filmy lacy boudoir cap from the floor and departed his exit was noiseless he ebbed away like a shadow through the open french windows  at sixthirty sharp to the minute he was back with a larger tray dick forrest put away the proofs reached for a book entitled commercial breeding of frogs and prepared to eat the breakfast was simple yet fairly substantialmore coffee a half grapefruit two softboiled eggs made ready in a glass with a dab of butter and piping hot and a sliver of bacon not overcooked that he knew was of his own raising and curing  by this time the sunshine was pouring in through the screening and across the bed on the outside of the wire screen clung a number of houseflies earlyhatched for the season and numb with the nights cold as forrest ate he watched the hunting of the meateating yellow jackets sturdy more frostresistant than bees they were already on the wing and preying on the benumbed flies despite the rowdy noise of their flight these yellow hunters of the air with rarely ever a miss pounced on their helpless victims and sailed away with them the last fly was gone ere forrest had sipped his last sip of coffee marked commercial breeding of frogs with a match and taken up his proofsheets  after a time the liquidmellow cry of the meadowlark first vocal for the day caused him to desist he looked at the clock it marked seven he set aside the proofs and began a series of conversations by means of the switchboard which he manipulated with a practiced hand  hello oh joy was his first talk is mr thayer up very well dont disturb him i dont think hell breakfast in bed but find out thats right and show him how to work the hot water maybe he doesnt know yes thats right plan for one more boy as soon as you can get him theres always a crowd when the good weather comes on sure use your judgment goodby  mr hanley yes was his second conversation over another switch ive been thinking about the dam on the buckeye i want the figures on the gravelhaul and on the rockcrushing yes thats it i imagine that the gravelhaul will cost anywhere between six and ten cents a yard more than the crushed rock that last pitch of hill is what eats up the gravelteams work out the figures  no we wont be able to start for a fortnight  yes yes the new tractors if they ever deliver will release the horses from the plowing but theyll have to go back for the checking no youll have to see mr everan about that goodby   and his third call  mr dawson ha ha thirtysix on my porch right now it must be white with frost down on the levels but its most likely the last this year yes they swore the tractors would be delivered two days ago call up the station agent  by the way you catch hanley for me i forgot to tell him to start the ratcatchers out with the second instalment of flytraps yes pronto there were a couple of dozen roosting on my screen this morning yes good by  at this stage forrest slid out of bed in his pajamas slipped his feet into the slippers and strode through the french windows to the bath already drawn by oh my a dozen minutes afterward shaved as well he was back in bed reading his frog book while oh my punctual to the minute massaged his legs  they were the wellformed legs of a wellbuilt fivefootten man who weighed a hundred and eighty pounds further they told a tale of the man the left thigh was marred by a scar ten inches in length across the left ankle from instep to heel were scattered half a dozen scars the size of halfdollars when oh my prodded and pulled the left knee a shade too severely forrest was guilty of a wince the right shin was colored with several dark scars while a big scar just under the knee was a positive dent in the bone midway between knee and groin was the mark of an ancient threeinch gash curiously dotted with the minute scars of stitches  a sudden joyous nicker from without put the match between the pages of the frog book and while oh my proceeded partly to dress his master in bed including socks and shoes the master twisting partly on his side stared out in the direction of the nicker down the road through the swaying purple of the early lilacs ridden by a picturesque cowboy paced a great horse glinting ruddy in the morning sungold flinging free the snowy foam of his mighty fetlocks his noble crest tossing his eyes roving afield the trumpet of his love call echoing through the springing land  dick forrest was smitten at the same instant with joy and anxietyjoy in the glorious beast pacing down between the lilac hedges anxiety in that the stallion might have awakened the girl who laughed from the round wooden frame on his wall he glanced quickly across the two hundredfoot court to the long shadowy jut of her wing of the house the shades of her sleepingporch were down they did not stir again the stallion nickered and all that moved was a flock of wild canaries upspringing from the flowers and shrubs of the court rising like a greengold spray of light flung from the sunrise  he watched the stallion out of sight through the lilacs seeing visions of fair shire colts mighty of bone and frame and free from blemish then turned as ever he turned to the immediate thing and spoke to his body servant  hows that last boy oh my showing up  him pretty good boy i think was the answer him young boy everything new pretty slow all the same bime by him show up good  why what makes you think so  i call him three four morning now him sleep like baby him wake up smiling just like you that very good  do i wake up smiling forrest queried  oh my nodded his head violently  many times many years i call you always your eyes open your eyes smile your mouth smile your face smile you smile all over just like that right away quick that very good a man wake up that way got plenty good sense i know this new boy like that bime by pretty soon he make fine boy you see his name chow gam what name you call him this place  dick forrest meditated  what names have we already he asked  oh joy ah well ah me and me i am oh my the chinese rattled off oh joy him say call new boy  he hesitated and stared at his master with a challenging glint of eye forrest nodded  oh joy him say call new boy oh hell  oh ho forrest laughed in appreciation oh joy is a josher a good name but it wont do there is the missus weve got to think another name  oh ho that very good name  forrests exclamation was still ringing in his consciousness so that he recognized the source of oh mys inspiration  very well the boys name is oh ho  oh my lowered his head ebbed swiftly through the french windows and as swiftly returned with the rest of forrests clothesgear helping him into undershirt and shirt tossing a tie around his neck for him to knot and kneeling putting on his leggings and spurs a baden powell hat and a quirt completed his apparelingthe quirt indian braided of rawhide with ten ounces of lead braided into the butt that hung from his wrist on a loop of leather  but forrest was not yet free oh my handed him several letters with the explanation that they had come up from the station the previous night after forrest had gone to bed he tore the righthand ends across and glanced at the contents of all but one with speed the latter he dwelt upon for a moment with an irritated indrawing of brows then swung out the phonograph from the wall pressed the button that made the cylinder revolve and swiftly dictated without ever a pause for word or idea  in reply to yours of march 14 1914 i am indeed sorry to learn that you were hit with hog cholera i am equally sorry that you have seen fit to charge me with the responsibility and just as equally am i sorry that the boar we sent you is dead  i can only assure you that we are quite clear of cholera here and that we have been clear of cholera for eight years with the exception of two eastern importations the last two years ago both of which according to our custom were segregated on arrival and were destroyed before the contagion could be communicated to our herds  i feel that i must inform you that in neither case did i charge the sellers with having sent me diseased stock on the contrary as you should know the incubation of hog cholera being nine days i consulted the shipping dates of the animals and knew that they had been healthy when shipped  has it ever entered your mind that the railroads are largely responsible for the spread of cholera did you ever hear of a railroad fumigating or disinfecting a car which had carried cholera consult the dates first of shipment by me second of receipt of the boar by you and third of appearance of symptoms in the boar as you say because of washouts the boar was five days on the way not until the seventh day after you receipted for same did the first symptoms appear that makes twelve days after it left my hands  no i must disagree with you i am not responsible for the disaster that overtook your herd furthermore doubly to assure you write to the state veterinary as to whether or not my place is free of cholera  very truly yours     chapter ii    when forrest went through the french windows from his sleepingporch he crossed first a comfortable dressing room windowdivaned many lockered with a generous fireplace out of which opened a bathroom and second a long office room wherein was all the paraphernalia of businessdesks dictaphones filing cabinets book cases magazine files and drawerpigeonholes that tiered to the low beamed ceiling  midway in the office room he pressed a button and a series of book freightened shelves swung on a pivot revealing a tiny spiral stairway of steel which he descended with care that his spurs might not catch the bookshelves swinging into place behind him  at the foot of the stairway a press on another button pivoted more shelves of books and gave him entrance into a long low room shelved with books from floor to ceiling he went directly to a case directly to a shelf and unerringly laid his hand on the book he sought a minute he ran the pages found the passage he was after nodded his head to himself in vindication and replaced the book  a door gave way to a pergola of square concrete columns spanned with redwood logs and interlaced with smaller trunks of redwood all rough and crinkled velvet with the ruddy purple of the bark  it was evident since he had to skirt several hundred feet of concrete walls of wandering house that he had not taken the short way out under widespreading ancient oaks where the long hitchingrails barkchewed and the hoofbeaten gravel showed the stamping place of many horses he found a palegolden almost tangolden sorrel mare her wellgroomed spring coat was alive and flaming in the morning sun that slanted straight under the edge of the roof of trees she was herself alive and flaming she was built like a stallion and down her backbone ran a narrow dark strip of hair that advertised an ancestry of many range mustangs  hows the maneater this morning he queried as he unsnapped the tierope from her throat  she laid back the tiniest ears that ever a horse possessedears that told of some thoroughbreds wild loves with wild mares among the hillsand snapped at forrest with wicked teeth and wickedgleaming eyes  she sidled and attempted to rear as he swung into the saddle and sidling and attempting to rear she went off down the graveled road and rear she would have had it not been for the martingale that held her head down and that as well saved the riders nose from her angrytossing head  so used was he to the mare that he was scarcely aware of her antics automatically with slightest touch of rein against arched neck or with tickle of spur or press of knee he kept the mare to the way he willed once as she whirled and danced he caught a glimpse of the big house big it was in all seeming and yet such was the vagrant nature of it it was not so big as it seemed eight hundred feet across the front face it stretched but much of this eight hundred feet was composed of mere corridors concretewalled tileroofed that connected and assembled the various parts of the building there were patios and pergolas in proportion and all the walls with their many rightangled juts and recessions arose out of a bed of greenery and bloom  spanish in character the architecture of the big house was not of the californiaspanish type which had been introduced by way of mexico a hundred years before and which had been modified by modern architects to the californiaspanish architecture of the day hispanomoresque more technically classified the big house in all its hybridness although there were experts who heatedly quarreled with the term  spaciousness without austerity and beauty without ostentation were the fundamental impressions the big house gave its lines long and horizontal broken only by lines that were vertical and by the lines of juts and recesses that were always rightangled were as chaste as those of a monastery the irregular roofline however relieved the hint of monotony  low and rambling without being squat the square upthrusts of towers and of towers overtopping towers gave just proportion of height without being skyaspiring the sense of the big house was solidarity it defied earthquakes it was planted for a thousand years the honest concrete was overlaid by a creamstucco of honest cement again this very sameness of color might have proved monotonous to the eye had it not been saved by the many flat roofs of warmred spanish tile  in that one sweeping glance while the mare whirled unduly dick forrests eyes embracing all of the big house centered for a quick solicitous instant on the great wing across the twohundredfoot court where under climbing groups of towers redsnooded in the morning sun the drawn shades of the sleepingporch tokened that his lady still slept  about him for three quadrants of the circle of the world arose low rolling hills smooth fenced cropped and pastured that melted into higher hills and steeper wooded slopes that merged upward steeper into mighty mountains the fourth quadrant was unbounded by mountain walls and hills it faded away descending easily to vast far flatlands which despite the clear brittle air of frost were too vast and far to scan across  the mare under him snorted his knees tightened as he straightened her into the road and forced her to one side down upon him with a pattering of feet on the gravel flowed a river of white shimmering silk he knew it at sight for his prize herd of angora goats each with a pedigree each with a history there had to be a near two hundred of them and he knew according to the rigorous selection he commanded not having been clipped in the fall that the shining mohair draping the sides of the least of them as fine as any human newborn babys hair and finer as white as any human albinos thatch and whiter was longer than the twelveinch staple and that the mohair of the best of them would dye any color into twentyinch switches for womens heads and sell at prices unreasonable and profound  the beauty of the sight held him as well the roadway had become a flowing ribbon of silk gemmed with yellow catlike eyes that floated past wary and curious in their regard for him and his nervous horse two basque herders brought up the rear they were short broad swarthy men blackeyed vividfaced contemplative and philosophic of expression they pulled off their hats and ducked their heads to him forrest lifted his right hand the quirt dangling from wrist the straight forefinger touching the rim of his baden powell in semi military salute  the mare prancing and whirling again he held her with a touch of rein and threat of spur and gazed after the fourfooted silk that filled the road with shimmering white he knew the significance of their presence the time for kidding was approaching and they were being brought down from their brushpastures to the broodpens and shelters for jealous care and generous feed through the period of increase and as he gazed in his mind comparing was a vision of all the best of turkish and south african mohair he had ever seen and his flock bore the comparison well it looked good it looked very good  he rode on from all about arose the clacking whir of manure spreaders in the distance on the low easysloping hills he saw team after team and many teams three to a team abreast what he knew were his shire mares drawing the plows back and forth across contourplowing turning the green sod of the hillsides to the rich dark brown of humusfilled earth so organic and friable that it would almost melt by gravity into fineparticled seedbed that was for the cornand sorghumplanting for his silos other hillslopes in the due course of his rotation were kneehigh in barley and still other slopes were showing the good green of burr clover and canada pea  everywhere about him large fields and small were arranged in a system of accessibility and workability that would have warmed the heart of the most meticulous efficiencyexpert every fence was hogtight and bullproof and no weeds grew in the shelters of the fences many of the level fields were in alfalfa others following the rotations bore crops planted the previous fall or were in preparation for the springplanting still others close to the brood barns and pens were being grazed by rotund shropshire and frenchmerino ewes or were being hogged off by white gargantuan broodsows that brought a flash of pleasure in his eyes as he rode past and gazed  he rode through what was almost a village save that there were neither shops nor hotels the houses were bungalows substantial pleasing to the eye each set in the midst of gardens where stouter blooms including roses were out and smiling at the threat of late frost children were already astir laughing and playing among the flowers or being called in to breakfast by their mothers  beyond beginning at a halfmile distant to circle the big house he passed a row of shops he paused at the first and glanced in one smith was working at a forge a second smith a shoe freshnailed on the forefoot of an elderly shire mare that would disturb the scales at eighteen hundred weight was rasping down the outer wall of the hoof to smooth with the toe of the shoe forrest saw saluted rode on and a hundred feet away paused and scribbled a memorandum in the notebook he drew from his hippocket  he passed other shopsa paintshop a wagonshop a plumbing shop a carpentershop while he glanced at the last a hybrid machine half auto halftruck passed him at speed and took the main road for the railroad station eight miles away he knew it for the morning butter truck freighting from the separator house the daily output of the dairy  the big house was the hub of the ranch organization half a mile from it it was encircled by the various ranch centers dick forrest saluting continually his people passed at a gallop the dairy center which was almost a sea of buildings with batteries of silos and with litter carriers emerging on overhead tracks and automatically dumping into waiting manurespreaders several times businesslooking men collegemarked astride horses or driving carts stopped him and conferred with him they were foremen heads of departments and they were as brief and to the point as was he the last of them astride a palomina threeyearold that was as graceful and wild as a halfbroken arab was for riding by with a bare salute but was stopped by his employer  good morning mr hennessy and how soon will she be ready for mrs forrest dick forrest asked  id like another week was hennessys answer shes well broke now just the way mrs forrest wanted but shes overstrung and sensitive and id like the week more to set her in her ways  forrest nodded concurrence and hennessy who was the veterinary went on  there are two drivers in the alfalfa gang id like to send down the hill  whats the matter with them  one a new man hopkins is an exsoldier he may know government mules but he doesnt know shires  forrest nodded  the other has worked for us two years but hes drinking now and he takes his hangovers out on his horses  thats smith oldtype american smoothshaven with a cast in his left eye forrest interrupted  the veterinary nodded  ive been watching him forrest concluded he was a good man at first but hes slipped a cog recently sure send him down the hill and send that other fellowhopkins you saidalong with him by the way mr hennessy as he spoke forrest drew forth his pad book tore off the last note scribbled and crumpled it in his hand youve a new horseshoer in the shop how does he strike you  hes too new to make up my mind yet  well send him down the hill along with the other two he cant take your orders i observed him just now fitting a shoe to old alden bessie by rasping off half an inch of the toe of her hoof  he knew better  send him down the hill forrest repeated as he tickled his champing mount with the slightest of spurtickles and shot her out along the road sidling headtossing and attempting to rear  much he saw that pleased him once he murmured aloud a fat land a fat land divers things he saw that did not please him and that won a note in his scribble pad completing the circle about the big house and riding beyond the circle half a mile to an isolated group of sheds and corrals he reached the objective of the ride the hospital here he found but two young heifers being tested for tuberculosis and a magnificent duroc jersey boar in magnificent condition weighing fully six hundred pounds its bright eyes brisk movements and sheen of hair shouted out that there was nothing the matter with it nevertheless according to the ranch practice being a fresh importation from iowa it was undergoing the regular period of quarantine burgess premier was its name in the herd books of the association age two years and it had cost forrest five hundred dollars laid down on the ranch  proceeding at a hand gallop along a road that was one of the spokes radiating from the big house hub forrest overtook crellin his hog manager and in a fiveminute conference outlined the next few months of destiny of burgess premier and learned that the brood sow lady isleton the matron of all matrons of the o i cs and blue ribboner in all shows from seattle to san diego was safely farrowed of eleven crellin explained that he had sat up half the night with her and was then bound home for bath and breakfast  i hear your oldest daughter has finished high school and wants to enter stanford forrest said curbing the mare just as he had half signaled departure at a gallop  crellin a young man of thirtyfive with the maturity of a longtime father stamped upon him along with the marks of college and the youthfulness of a man used to the open air and straightliving showed his appreciation of his employers interest as he halfflushed under his tan and nodded  think it over forrest advised make a statistic of all the college girlsyes and state normal girlsyou know how many of them follow career and how many of them marry within two years after their degrees and take to baby farming  helen is very seriously bent on the matter crellin urged  do you remember when i had my appendix out forrest queried well i had as fine a nurse as i ever saw and as nice a girl as ever walked on two nice legs she was just six months a fullfledged nurse then and four months after that i had to send her a wedding present she married an automobile agent shes lived in hotels ever since shes never had a chance to nursenever a child of her own to bring through a bout with colic but she has hopes and whether or not her hopes materialize shes confoundedly happy but what good was her nursing apprenticeship  just then an empty manurespreader passed forcing crellin on foot and forrest on his mare to edge over to the side of the road forrest glanced with kindling eye at the off mare of the machine a huge symmetrical shire whose own blue ribbons and the blue ribbons of her progeny would have required an expert accountant to enumerate and classify  look at the fotherington princess forrest said nodding at the mare that warmed his eye she is a normal female only incidentally through thousands of years of domestic selection has man evolved her into a draught beast breeding true to kind but being a draughtbeast is secondary primarily she is a female take them by and large our own human females above all else love us men and are intrinsically maternal there is no biological sanction for all the hurly burly of woman today for suffrage and career  but there is an economic sanction crellin objected  true his employer agreed then proceeded to discount our present industrial system prevents marriage and compels woman to career but remember industrial systems come and industrial systems go while biology runs on forever  its rather hard to satisfy young women with marriage these days the hogmanager demurred  dick forrest laughed incredulously  i dont know about that he said theres your wife for an instance she with her sheepskinclassical scholar at thatwell what has she done with it two boys and three girls i believe as i remember your telling me she was engaged to you the whole last half of her senior year  true but crellin insisted with an eyetwinkle of appreciation of the point that was fifteen years ago as well as a lovematch we just couldnt help it that far i agree she had planned unheardof achievements while i saw nothing else than the deanship of the college of agriculture we just couldnt help it but that was fifteen years ago and fifteen years have made all the difference in the world in the ambitions and ideals of our young women  dont you believe it for a moment i tell you mr crellin its a statistic all contrary things are transient ever woman remains avoman everlasting eternal not until our girlchildren cease from playing with dolls and from looking at their own enticingness in mirrors will woman ever be otherwise than what she has always been first the mother second the mate of man it is a statistic ive been looking up the girls who graduate from the state normal you will notice that those who marry by the way before graduation are excluded nevertheless the average length of time the graduates actually teach school is little more than two years and when you consider that a lot of them through ill looks and ill luck are foredoomed old maids and are foredoomed to teach all their lives you can see how they cut down the period of teaching of the marriageable ones  a woman even a girlwoman will have her way where mere men are concerned crellin muttered unable to dispute his employers figures but resolved to look them up  and your girlwoman will go to stanford forrest laughed as he prepared to lift his mare into a gallop and you and i and all men to the end of time will see to it that they do have their way  crellin smiled to himself as his employer diminished down the road for crellin knew his kipling and the thought that caused the smile was but wheres the kid of your own mr forrest he decided to repeat it to mrs crellin over the breakfast coffee  once again dick forrest delayed ere he gained the big house the man he stopped he addressed as mendenhall who was his horsemanager as well as pasture expert and who was reputed to know not only every blade of grass on the ranch but the length of every blade of grass and its age from seedgermination as well  at signal from forrest mendenhall drew up the two colts he was driving in a double breakingcart what had caused forrest to signal was a glance he had caught across the northern edge of the valley of great smoothhill ranges miles beyond touched by the sun and deeply green where they projected into the vast flat of the sacramento valley  the talk that followed was quick and abbreviated to terms of understanding between two men who knew grass was the subject mention was made of the winter rainfall and of the chance for late spring rains to come names occurred such as the little coyote and los cuatos creeks the yolo and the miramar hills the big basin round valley and the san anselmo and los banos ranges movements of herds and droves past present and to come were discussed as well as the outlook for cultivated hay in far upland pastures and the estimates of such hay that still remained over the winter in remote barns in the sheltered mountain valleys where herds had wintered and been fed  under the oaks at the stamping posts forrest was saved the trouble of tying the maneater a stableman came on the run to take the mare and forrest scarce pausing for a word about a horse by the name of duddy was clanking his spurs into the big house     chapter iii    forrest entered a section of the big house by way of a massive hewn timber ironstudded door that let in at the foot of what seemed a donjon keep the floor was cement and doors let off in various directions one opening to a chinese in the white apron and starched cap of a chef emitted at the same time the low hum of a dynamo it was this that deflected forrest from his straight path he paused holding the door ajar and peered into a cool electriclighted cement room where stood a long glassfronted glassshelved refrigerator flanked by an icemachine and a dynamo on the floor in greasy overalls squatted a greasy little man to whom his employer nodded  anything wrong thompson he asked  there was was the answer positive and complete  forrest closed the door and went on along a passage that was like a tunnel narrow ironbarred openings like the slits for archers in medieval castles dimly lighted the way another door gave access to a long low room beamceilinged with a fireplace in which an ox could have been roasted a huge stump resting on a bed of coals blazed brightly two billiard tables several card tables lounging corners and a miniature bar constituted the major furnishing two young men chalked their cues and returned forrests greeting  good morning mr naismith he bantered more material for the breeders gazette  naismith a youngish man of thirty with glasses smiled sheepishly and cocked his head at his companion  wainwright challenged me he explained  which means that lute and ernestine must still be beautysleeping forrest laughed  young wainwright bristled to acceptance of the challenge but before he could utter the retort on his lips his host was moving on and addressing naismith over his shoulder  do you want to come along at eleventhirty thayer and i are running out in the machine to look over the shropshires he wants about ten carloads of rams you ought to find good stuff in this matter of idaho shipments bring your camera alongseen thayer this morning  just came in to breakfast as we were leaving bert wainwright volunteered  tell him to be ready at eleventhirty if you see him youre not invited bert out of kindness the girls are sure to be up then  take rita along with you anyway bert pleaded  no fear was forrests reply from the door were on business besides you cant pry rita from ernestine with blockandtackle  thats why i wanted to see if you could bert grinned  funny how fellows never appreciate their own sisters forrest paused for a perceptible moment i always thought rita was a real nice sister whats the matter with her  before a reply could reach him he had closed the door and was jingling his spurs along the passage to a spiral stairway of broad concrete steps as he left the head of the stairway a dancetime piano measure and burst of laughter made him peep into a white morning room flooded with sunshine a young girl in rosecolored kimono and boudoir cap was at the instrument while two others similarly accoutered in each others arms were parodying a dance never learned at dancing school nor intended by the participants for male eyes to see  the girl at the piano discovered him winked and played on not for another minute did the dancers spy him they gave startled cries collapsed laughing in each others arms and the music stopped they were gorgeous healthy young creatures the three of them and forrests eye kindled as he looked at them in quite the same way that it had kindled when he regarded the fotherington princess  persiflage of the sort that obtains among young things of the human kind flew back and forth  ive been here five minutes dick forrest asserted  the two dancers to cover their confusion doubted his veracity and instanced his many wellknown and notorious guilts of mendacity the girl at the piano ernestine his sisterinlaw insisted that pearls of truth fell from his lips that she had seen him from the moment he began to look and that as she estimated the passage of time he had been looking much longer than five minutes  well anyway forrest broke in on their babel bert the sweet innocent doesnt think you are up yet  were not to him one of the dancers a vivacious young venus retorted nor are we to you either so run along little boy run along  look here lute forrest began sternly just because i am a decrepit old man and just because you are eighteen just eighteen and happen to be my wifes sister you neednt presume to put the high and mighty over on me dont forgetand i state the fact disagreeable as it may be for ritas sakedont forget that in the past ten years ive paddled you more disgraceful times than you care to dare me to enumerate  it is true i am not so young as i used to was but he felt the biceps of his right arm and made as if to roll up the sleeve but im not all in yet and for two cents  what the young woman challenged belligerently  for two cents he muttered darkly for two cents besides and it grieves me to inform you your cap is not on straight also it is not a very tasteful creation at best i could make a far more becoming cap with my toes asleep and yes seasick as well  lute tossed her blond head defiantly glanced at her comrades in solicitation of support and said  oh i dont know it seems humanly reasonable that the three of us can womanhandle a mere man of your elderly and insulting avoirdupois what do you say girls lets rush him hes not a minute under forty and he has an aneurism yes and though loath to divulge family secrets hes got menieres disease  ernestine a small but robust blonde of eighteen sprang from the piano and joined her two comrades in a raid on the cushions of the deep window seats side by side a cushion in each hand and with proper distance between them cannily established for the swinging of the cushions they advanced upon the foe  forrest prepared for battle then held up his hand for parley  fraid cat they taunted in several at first and then in chorus  he shook his head emphatically  just for that and for all the rest of your insolences the three of you are going to get yours all the wrongs of a lifetime are rising now in my brain in a dazzling brightness i shall go berserk in a moment but first and i speak as an agriculturist and i address myself to you lute in all humility in heavens name what is menieres disease do sheep catch it  menieres disease is lute began is what youve got sheep are the only known living creatures that get it  ensued red war and chaos forrest made a football rush of the sort that obtained in california before the adoption of rugby and the girls broke the line to let him through turned upon him flanked him on either side and pounded him with cushions  he turned with widespread arms extended fingers each finger a hook and grappled the three the battle became a whirlwind a bespurred man the center from which radiated flying draperies of flimsy silk disconnected slippers boudoir caps and hairpins there were thuds from the cushions grunts from the man squeals yelps and giggles from the girls and from the totality of the combat inextinguishable laughter and a ripping and tearing of fragile textures  dick forrest found himself sprawled on the floor the wind half knocked out of him by shrewdly delivered cushions his head buzzing from the buffeting and in one hand a trailing torn and generally disrupted girdle of pale blue silk and pink roses  in one doorway cheeks flaming from the struggle stood rita alert as a fawn and ready to flee in the other doorway likewise flame checked stood ernestine in the commanding attitude of the mother of the gracchi the wreckage of her kimono wrapped severely about her and held severely about her by her own waistpressing arm lute cornered behind the piano attempted to run but was driven back by the menace of forrest who on hands and knees stamped loudly with the palms of his hands on the hardwood floor rolled his head savagely and emitted bulllike roars  and they still believe that old prehistoric myth ernestine proclaimed from safety that once he that wretched semblance of a manthing prone in the dirt captained berkeley to victory over stanford  her breasts heaved from the exertion and he marked the pulsating of the shimmering cherrycolored silk with delight as he flung his glance around to the other two girls similarly breathing  the piano was a miniature granda dainty thing of rich white and gold to match the morning room it stood out from the wall so that there was possibility for lute to escape around either way of it forrest gained his feet and faced her across the broad flat top of the instrument as he threatened to vault it lute cried out in horror  but your spurs dick your spurs  give me time to take them off he offered  as he stooped to unbuckle them lute darted to escape but was herded back to the shelter of the piano  all right he growled on your head be it if the pianos scratched ill tell paula  ive got witnesses she panted indicating with her blue joyous eyes the young things in the doorways  very well my dear forrest drew back his body and spread his resting palms im coming over to you  action and speech were simultaneous his body posited sidewise from his hands was vaulted across the perilous spurs a full foot above the glossy white surface and simultaneously lute ducked and went under the piano on hands and knees her mischance lay in that she bumped her head and before she could recover way forrest had circled the piano and cornered her under it  come out he commanded come out and take your medicine  a truce she pleaded a truce sir knight for dear loves sake and all damsels in distress  i aint no knight forrest announced in his deepest bass im an ogre a filthy debased and altogether unregenerate ogre i was born in the tuleswamps my father was an ogre and my mother was more so i was lulled to slumber on the squalls of infants dead foreordained and predamned i was nourished solely on the blood of maidens educated in mills seminary my favorite chophouse has ever been a hardwood floor a loaf of mills seminary maiden and a roof of flat piano my father as well as an ogre was a california horsethief i am more reprehensible than my father i have more teeth my mother as well as an ogress was a nevada bookcanvasser let all her shame be told she even solicited subscriptions for ladies magazines i am more terrible than my mother i have peddled safety razors  can naught soothe and charm your savage breast lute pleaded in soulful tones while she studied her chances for escape  one thing only miserable female one thing only on the earth over the earth and under its ruining waters  a squawk of recognized plagiarism interrupted him from ernestine  see ernest dowson page seventynine a thin book of thin verse ladled out with porridge to young women detentioned at mills seminary forrest went on as i had already enunciated before i was so rudely interrupted the one thing only that can balm and embalm this savage breast is the maidens prayer listen with all your ears ere i chew them off in multitude and gross listen silly unbeautiful squat shortlegged and ugly female under the piano can you recite the maidens prayer  screams of delight from the young things in the doorways prevented the proper answer and lute from under the piano cried out to young wainwright who had appeared  a rescue sir knight a rescue  unhand the maiden was berts challenge  who art thou forrest demanded  king george sirrahi mean er saint george  then am i thy dragon forrest announced with due humility spare this ancient honorable and only neck i have  off with his head the young things encouraged  stay thee maidens i pray thee bert begged i am only a small potato yet am i unafraid i shall beard the dragon i shall beard him in his gullet and while he lingeringly chokes to death over my unpalatableness and general spinefulness do you fair damsels flee to the mountains lest the valleys fall upon you yolo petaluma and west sacramento are about to be overwhelmed by a tidal wave and many big fishes  off with his head the young things chanted slay him in his blood and barbecue him  thumbs down forrest groaned i am undone trust to the unstrained quality of mercy possessed by christian young women in the year 1914 who will vote some day if ever they grow up and do not marry foreigners consider my head off saint george i am expired further deponent sayeth not  and forrest with sobs and slubberings with realistic shudders and kicks and a great jingling of spurs lay down on the floor and expired  lute crawled out from under the piano and was joined by rita and ernestine in an extemporized dance of the harpies about the slain  in the midst of it forrest sat up protesting also he was guilty of a significant and privy wink to lute  the hero he cried forget him not crown him with flowers  and bert was crowned with flowers from the vases unchanged from the day before when a bunch of waterlogged stems of early tulips propelled by lutes vigorous arm impacted soggily on his neck under the ear he fled the riot of pursuit echoed along the hall and died out down the stairway toward the stag room forrest gathered himself together and grinning went jingling on through the big house  he crossed two patios on brick walks roofed with spanish tile and swamped with early foliage and blooms and gained his wing of the house still breathing from the fun to find in the office his secretary awaiting him  good morning mr blake he greeted sorry i was delayed he glanced at his wristwatch only four minutes however i just couldnt get away sooner     chapter iv    from nine till ten forrest gave himself up to his secretary achieving a correspondence that included learned societies and every sort of breeding and agricultural organization and that would have compelled the average petty business man unaided to sit up till midnight to accomplish  for dick forrest was the center of a system which he himself had built and of which he was secretly very proud important letters and documents he signed with his ragged fist all other letters were rubberstamped by mr blake who also in shorthand in the course of the hour put down the indicated answers to many letters and received the formula designations of reply to many other letters mr blakes private opinion was that he worked longer hours than his employer although it was equally his private opinion that his employer was a wonder for discovering work for others to perform  at ten to the stroke of the clock as pittman forrests show manager entered the office blake burdened with trays of correspondence sheafs of documents and phonograph cylinders faded away to his own office  from ten to eleven a stream of managers and foremen flowed in and out all were well disciplined in terseness and timesaving as dick forrest had taught them the minutes spent with him were not minutes of cogitation they must be prepared before they reported or suggested bonbright the assistant secretary always arrived at ten to replace blake and bonbright close to shoulder with flying pencil took down the rapidfire interchange of question and answer statement and proposal and plan these shorthand notes transcribed and typed in duplicate were the nightmare and on occasion the nemesis of the managers and foremen for first forrest had a remarkable memory and second he was prone to prove its worth by reference to those same notes of bonbright  a manager at the end of a five or ten minute session often emerged sweating limp and frazzled yet for a swift hour at high tension forrest met all comers with a masters grip handling them and all the multifarious details of their various departments he told thompson the machinist in four flashing minutes where the fault lay in the dynamo to the big house refrigerator laid the fault home to thompson dictated a note to bonbright with citation by page and chapter to a volume from the library to be drawn by thompson told thompson that parkman the dairy manager was not satisfied with the latest wiring up of milking machines and that the refrigerating plant at the slaughter house was balking at its accustomed load  each man was a specialist yet forrest was the proved master of their specialties as paulson the head plowman complained privily to dawson the crop manager ive worked here twelve years and never have i seen him put his hands to a plow and yet damn him he somehow seems to know hes a genius thats what he is why dye know ive seen him tear by a piece of work his hands full with that maneater of his athreatenin sudden funeral an next morning had m mention casually to a halfinch how deep it was plowed an what plowsd done the plowintake that plowin of the poppy meadow up above little meadow on los cuatos i just couldnt see my way to it an had to cut out the crosssubsoiling an thought i could slip it over on him after it was all finished he kind of happened up that wayi was lookin an he didnt seem to lookan well next am i got mine in the office no i didnt slip it over i aint tried to slip nothing over since  at eleven sharp wardman his sheep manager departed with an engagement scheduled at eleven thirty to ride in the machine along with thayer the idaho buyer to look over the shropshire rams at eleven bonbright having departed with wardman to work up his notes forrest was left alone in the office from a wire tray of unfinished businessone of many wire trays superimposed in groups of fivehe drew a pamphlet issued by the state of iowa on hog cholera and proceeded to scan it  five feet ten inches in height weighing a cleanmuscled one hundred and eighty pounds dick forrest was anything but insignificant for a forty years old man the eyes were gray large overarched by bone of brow and lashes and brows were dark the hair above an ordinary forehead was light brown to chestnut under the forehead the cheeks showed highboned with underneath the slight hollows that necessarily accompany such formation the jaws were strong without massiveness the nose largenostriled was straight enough and prominent enough without being too straight or prominent the chin square without harshness and uncleft and the mouth girlish and sweet to a degree that did not hide the firmness to which the lips could set on due provocation the skin was smooth and welltanned although midway between eyebrows and hair the tan of forehead faded in advertisement of the rim of the baden powell interposed between him and the sun  laughter lurked in the mouth corners and eyecorners and there were cheek lines about the mouth that would seem to have been formed by laughter equally strong however every line of the face that meant blended things carried a notice of surety dick forrest was sure sure when his hand reached out for any object on his desk that the hand would straightly attain the object without a fumble or a miss of a fraction of an inch sure when his brain leaped the high places of the hog cholera text that it was not missing a point sure from his balanced body in the revolving deskchair to the balanced backhead of him sure in heart and brain of life and work of all he possessed and of himself  he had reason to be sure body brain and career were longproven sure a rich mans son he had not played ducks and drakes with his fathers money city born and reared he had gone back to the land and made such a success as to put his name on the lips of breeders wherever breeders met and talked he was the owner without encumbrance of two hundred and fifty thousand acres of landland that varied in value from a thousand dollars an acre to a hundred dollars that varied from a hundred dollars to ten cents an acre and that in stretches was not worth a penny an acre the improvements on that quarter of a million acres from draintiled meadows to dredge drained tule swamps from good roads to developed waterrights from farm buildings to the big house itself constituted a sum gaspingly ungraspable to the countryside  everything was largescale but modern to the last tick of the clock his managers lived rentfree with salaries commensurate to ability in fiveand tenthousanddollar housesbut they were the cream of specialists skimmed from the continent from the atlantic to the pacific when he ordered gasolinetractors for the cultivation of the flat lands he ordered a round score when he dammed water in his mountains he dammed it by the hundreds of millions of gallons when he ditched his tuleswamps instead of contracting the excavation he bought the huge dredgers outright and when there was slack work on his own marshes he contracted for the draining of the marshes of neighboring big farmers land companies and corporations for a hundred miles up and down the sacramento river  he had brain sufficient to know the need of buying brains and to pay a tidy bit over the current market price for the most capable brains and he had brain sufficient to direct the brains he bought to a profitable conclusion  and yet he was just turned forty was cleareyed calmhearted heartypulsed manstrong and yet his history until he was thirty had been harumscarum and erratic to the superlative he had run away from a millionaire home when he was thirteen he had won enviable college honors ere he was twentyone and after that he had known all the purple ports of the purple seas and with cool head hot heart and laughter played every risk that promised and provided in the wild world of adventure that he had lived to see pass under the sobriety of law  in the old days of san francisco forrest had been a name to conjure with the forrest mansion had been one of the pioneer palaces on nob hill where dwelt the floods the mackays the crockers and the obriens lucky richard forrest the father had arrived via the isthmus straight from old new england keenly commercial interested before his departure in clipper ships and the building of clipper ships and interested immediately after his arrival in waterfront real estate river steamboats mines of course and later in the draining of the nevada comstock and the construction of the southern pacific  he played big he won big he lost big but he won always more than he lost and what he paid out at one game with one hand he drew back with his other hand at another game his winnings from the comstock he sank into the various holes of the bottomless daffodil group in eldorado county the wreckage from the benicia line he turned into the napa consolidated which was a quicksilver venture and it earned him five thousand per cent what he lost in the collapse of the stockton boom was more than balanced by the realty appreciation of his key holdings at sacramento and oakland  and to cap it all when lucky richard forrest had lost everything in a series of calamities so that san francisco debated what price his nob hill palace would fetch at auction he grubstaked one del nelson to a prospecting in mexico as soberly set down in history the result of the said del nelsons search for quartz was the harvest group including the fabulous and inexhaustible tattlesnake voice city desdemona bullfrog and yellow boy claims del nelson astounded by his achievement within the year drowned himself in an enormous quantity of cheap whisky and the will being incontestible through lack of kith and kin left his half to lucky richard forrest  dick forrest was the son of his father lucky richard a man of boundless energy and enterprise though twice married and twice widowed had not been blessed with children his third marriage occurred in 1872 when he was fiftyeight and in 1874 although he lost the mother a twelvepound boy stoutbarreled and huskylunged remained to be brought up by a regiment of nurses in the palace on nob hill  young dick was precocious lucky richard was a democrat result young dick learned in a year from a private teacher what would have required three years in the grammar school and used all of the saved years in playing in the open air also result of precocity of son and democracy of father young dick was sent to grammar school for the last year in order to learn shoulderrubbing democracy with the sons and daughters of workmen tradesmen saloonkeepers and politicians  in class recitation or spelling match his fathers millions did not aid him in competing with patsy halloran the mathematical prodigy whose father was a hodcarrier nor with mona sanguinetti who was a wizard at spelling and whose widowed mother ran a vegetable store nor were his fathers millions and the nob hill palace of the slightest assistance to young dick when he peeled his jacket and bareknuckled without rounds licking or being licked milled it to a finish with jimmy botts jean choyinsky and the rest of the lads that went out over the world to glory and cash a few years later a generation of prizefighters that only san francisco raw and virile and yeasty and young could have produced  the wisest thing lucky richard did for his boy was to give him this democratic tutelage in his secret heart young dick never forgot that he lived in a palace of many servants and that his father was a man of power and honor on the other hand young dick learned twolegged twofisted democracy he learned it when mona sanguinetti spelled him down in class he learned it when berney miller outdodged and outran him when running across in black man  and when tim hagan with straight left for the hundredth time to bleeding nose and mangled mouth and with ever reiterant right hook to stomach had him dazed and reeling the breath whistling and sobbing through his lacerated lipswas no time for succor from palaces and bank accounts on his two legs with his two fists it was either he or tim and it was right there in sweat and blood and iron of soul that young dick learned how not to lose a losing fight it had been uphill from the first blow but he stuck it out until in the end it was agreed that neither could best the other although this agreement was not reached until they had first lain on the ground in nausea and exhaustion and with streaming eyes wept their rage and defiance at each other after that they became chums and between them ruled the schoolyard  lucky richard died the same month young dick emerged from grammar school young dick was thirteen years old with twenty million dollars and without a relative in the world to trouble him he was the master of a palace of servants a steam yacht stables and as well of a summer palace down the peninsula in the nabob colony at menlo one thing only was he burdened with guardians  on a summer afternoon in the big library he attended the first session of his board of guardians there were three of them all elderly and successful all legal all business comrades of his father dicks impression as they explained things to him was that although they meant well he had no contacts with them in his judgment their boyhood was too far behind them besides that it was patent that him the particular boy they were so much concerned with they did not understand at all furthermore in his own sure way he decided that he was the one person in the world fitted to know what was best for himself  mr crockett made a long speech to which dick listened with alert and becoming attention nodding his head whenever he was directly addressed or appealed to messrs davidson and slocum also had their say and were treated with equal consideration among other things dick learned what a sterling upright man his father had been and the program already decided upon by the three gentlemen which would make him into a sterling and upright man  when they were quite done dick took it upon himself to say a few things  i have thought it over he announced and first of all i shall go traveling  that will come afterward my boy mr slocum explained soothingly whensaywhen you are ready to enter the university at that time a year abroad would be a very good thing a very good thing indeed  of course mr davidson volunteered quickly having noted the annoyed light in the lads eyes and the unconscious firmdrawing and setting of the lips of course in the meantime you could do some traveling a limited amount of traveling during your school vacations i am sure my fellow guardians will agreeunder the proper management and safeguarding of coursethat such bits of travel sandwiched between your schoolterms would be advisable and beneficial  how much did you say i am worth dick asked with apparent irrelevance  twenty millionsat a most conservative estimatethat is about the sum mr crockett answered promptly  suppose i said right now that i wanted a hundred dollars dick went on  whyerahem mr slocum looked about him for guidance  we would be compelled to ask what you wanted it for answered mr crockett  and suppose dick said very slowly looking mr crockett squarely in the eyes suppose i said that i was very sorry but that i did not care to say what i wanted it for  then you wouldnt get it mr crockett said so immediately that there was a hint of testiness and snap in his manner  dick nodded slowly as if letting the information sink in  but of course my boy mr slocum took up hastily you understand you are too young to handle money yet we must decide that for you  you mean i cant touch a penny without your permission  not a penny mr crockett snapped  dick nodded his head thoughtfully and murmured oh i see  of course and quite naturally it would only be fair you know you will have a small allowance for your personal spending mr davidson said say a dollar or perhaps two dollars a week as you grow older this allowance will be increased and by the time you are twentyone doubtlessly you will be fully qualifiedwith advice of courseto handle your own affairs  and until i am twentyone my twenty million wouldnt buy me a hundred dollars to do as i please with dick queried very subduedly  mr davidson started to corroborate in soothing phrases but was waved to silence by dick who continued  as i understand it whatever money i handle will be by agreement between the four of us  the board of guardians nodded  that is whatever we agree goes  again the board of guardians nodded  well id like to have a hundred right now dick announced  what for mr crockett demanded  i dont mind telling you was the lads steady answer to go traveling  youll go to bed at eightthirty this evening mr crockett retorted and you dont get any hundred the lady we spoke to you about will be here before six she is to have as we explained daily and hourly charge of you at sixthirty as usual you will dine and she will dine with you and see you to bed as we told you she will have to serve the place of a mother to yousee that your ears are clean your neck washed  and that i get my saturday night bath dick amplified meekly for him  precisely  how much are youam ipaying the lady for her services dick questioned in the disconcerting tangential way that was already habitual to him as his school companions and teachers had learned to their cost  mr crockett for the first time cleared his throat for pause  im paying her aint i dick prodded out of the twenty million you know  the spit of his father said mr slocum in an aside  mrs summerstone the lady as you elect to call her receives one hundred and fifty a month eighteen hundred a year in round sum said mr crockett  its a waste of perfectly good money dick sighed and board and lodging thrown in  he stood upnot the born aristocrat of the generations but the reared aristocrat of thirteen years in the nob hill palace he stood up with such a manner that his board of guardians left their leather chairs to stand up with him but he stood up as no lord fauntleroy ever stood up for he was a mixer he had knowledge that human life was manyfaced and manyplaced not for nothing had he been spelled down by mona sanguinetti not for nothing had he fought tim hagan to a standstill and coequal ruled the schoolyard roost with him  he was birthed of the wild goldadventure of fortynine he was a reared aristocrat and a grammarschooltrained democrat he knew in his precocious immature way the differentiations between caste and mass and behind it all he was possessed of a will of his own and of a quiet surety of self that was incomprehensible to the three elderly gentlemen who had been given charge of his and his destiny and who had pledged themselves to increase his twenty millions and make a man of him in their own composite image  thank you for your kindness young dick said generally to the three i guess well get along all right of course that twenty millions is mine and of course youve got to take care of it for me seeing i know nothing of business  and well increase it for you my boy well increase it for you in safe conservative ways mr slocum assured him  no speculation young dick warned dads just been luckyive heard him say that times have changed and a fellow cant take the chances everybody used to take  from which and from much which has already passed it might erroneously be inferred that young dick was a mean and moneygrubbing soul on the contrary he was at that instant entertaining secret thoughts and plans so utterly regardless and disdainful of his twenty millions as to place him on a par with a drunken sailor sowing the beach with a three years payday  i am only a boy young dick went on but you dont know me very well yet well get better acquainted by and by and again thanking you  he paused bowed briefly and grandly as lords in nob hill palaces early learn to bow and by the quality of the pause signified that the audience was over nor did the impact of dismissal miss his guardians they who had been colords with his father withdrew confused and perplexed messrs davidson and slocum were on the point of resolving their perplexity into wrath as they went down the great stone stairway to the waiting carriage but mr crockett the testy and snappish muttered ecstatically the son of a gun the little son of a gun  the carriage carried them down to the old pacific union club where for another hour they gravely discussed the future of young dick forrest and pledged themselves anew to the faith reposed in them by lucky richard forrest and down the hill on foot where grass grew on the paved streets too steep for horsetraffic young dick hurried as the height of land was left behind almost immediately the palaces and spacious grounds of the nabobs gave way to the mean streets and wooden warrens of the working people the san francisco of 1887 as incontinently intermingled its slums and mansions as did the old cities of europe nob hill arose like any medieval castle from the mess and ruck of common life that denned and laired at its base  young dick came to pause alongside a corner grocery the second story of which was rented to timothy hagan senior who by virtue of being a policeman with a wage of a hundred dollars a month rented this high place to dwell above his fellows who supported families on no more than forty and fifty dollars a month  in vain young dick whistled up through the unscreened open windows tim hagan junior was not at home but young dick wasted little wind in the whistling he was debating on possible adjacent places where tim hagan might be when tim himself appeared around the corner bearing a lidless lardcan that foamed with steam beer he grunted greeting and young dick grunted with equal roughness just as if a brief space before he had not in most lordly fashion terminated an audience with three of the richest merchantkings of an imperial city nor did his possession of twenty increasing millions hint the slightest betrayal in his voice or mitigate in the slightest the gruffness of his grunt  aint seen yeh since yer old man died tim hagan commented  well youre seein me now aint you was young dicks retort say tim i come to see you on business  wait till i rush the beer to the old man said tim inspecting the state of the foam in the lardcan with an experienced eye hell roar his head off if it comes in flat  oh you can shake it up young dick assured him only want to see you a minute im hitting the road tonight want to come along  tims small blue irish eyes flashed with interest  where to he queried  dont know want to come if you do we can talk it over after we start you know the ropes what dye say  the old manll beat the stuffin outa me tim demurred  hes done that before an you dont seem to be much missing young dick callously rejoined say the word an well meet at the ferry building at nine tonight what dye say ill be there  supposin i dont show up tim asked  ill be on my way just the same young dick turned as if to depart paused casually and said over his shoulder better come along  tim shook up the beer as he answered with equal casualness aw right ill be there  after parting from tim hagan young dick spent a busy hour or so looking up one marcovich a slavonian schoolmate whose father ran a chophouse in which was reputed to be served the finest twentycent meal in the city young marcovich owed young dick two dollars and young dick accepted the payment of a dollar and forty cents as full quittance of the debt  also with shyness and perturbation young dick wandered down montgomery street and vacillated among the many pawnshops that graced that thoroughfare at last diving desperately into one he managed to exchange for eight dollars and a ticket his gold watch that he knew was worth fifty at the very least  dinner in the nob hill palace was served at sixthirty he arrived at sixfortyfive and encountered mrs summerstone she was a stout elderly decayed gentlewoman a daughter of the great porter rickington family that had shaken the entire pacific coast with its financial crash in the middle seventies despite her stoutness she suffered from what she called shattered nerves  this will never never do richard she censured here is dinner waiting fifteen minutes already and you have not yet washed your face and hands  i am sorry mrs summerstone young dick apologized i wont keep you waiting ever again and i wont bother you much ever  at dinner in state the two of them alone in the great dining room young dick strove to make things easy for the lady whom despite his knowledge that she was on his payroll he felt toward as a host must feel toward a guest  youll be very comfortable here he promised once you are settled down its a good old house and most of the servants have been here for years  but richard she smiled seriously to him it is not the servants who will determine my happiness here it is you  ill do my best he said graciously better than that im sorry i came in late for dinner in years and years youll never see me late again i wont bother you at all youll see it will be just as though i wasnt in the house  when he bade her good night on his way to bed he added as a last thought  ill warn you of one thing ah sing hes the cook hes been in our house for years and yearsoh i dont know maybe twentyfive or thirty years hes cooked for father from long before this house was built or i was born hes privileged hes so used to having his own way that youll have to handle him with gloves but once he likes you hell work his fool head off to please you he likes me that way you get him to like you and youll have the time of your life here and honest i wont give you any trouble at all itll be a regular snap just as if i wasnt here at all     chapter v   at nine in the evening sharp to the second clad in his oldest clothes young dick met tim hagan at the ferry building  no use headin north said tim winterll come on up that way and make the sleepin crimpy dye want to go eastthat means nevada and the deserts  any other way queried young dick whats the matter with south we can head for los angeles an arizona an new mexicooh an texas  how much money you got tim demanded  what for young dick countered  we gotta get out quick an payin our way at the start is quickest meim all hunkydory but you aint the folks thats lookin after youll raise a roar theyll have more detectives out than you can shake at stick at we gotta dodge em thats what  then we will dodge said young dick well make short jumps this way and that for a couple of days layin low most of the time paying our way until we can get to tracy then well quit payin an beat her south  all of which program was carefully carried out they eventually went through tracy as pay passengers six hours after the local deputy sheriff had given up his task of searching the trains with an excess of precaution young dick paid beyond tracy and as far as modesto after that under the teaching of tim he traveled without paying riding blind baggage box cars and cowcatchers young dick bought the newspapers and frightened tim by reading to him the lurid accounts of the kidnapping of the young heir to the forrest millions  back in san francisco the board of guardians offered rewards that totaled thirty thousand dollars for the recovery of their ward and tim hagan reading the same while they lay in the grass by some water tank branded forever the mind of young dick with the fact that honor beyond price was a matter of neither place nor caste and might outcrop in the palace on the height of land or in the dwelling over a grocery down on the flat  gee tim said to the general landscape the old man wouldnt raise a roar if i snitched on you for that thirty thousand it makes me scared to think of it  and from the fact that tim thus openly mentioned the matter young dick concluded that there was no possibility of the policemans son betraying him  not until six weeks afterward in arizona did young dick bring up the subject  you see tim he said ive got slathers of money its growing all the time and i aint spending a cent of it not so as you can notice though that mrs summerstone is getting a cold eighteen hundred a year out of me with board and carriages thrown in while you an i are glad to get the leavings of firemens pails in the roundhouses just the same my moneys growing whats ten per cent on twenty dollars  tim hagan stared at the shimmering heatwaves of the desert and tried to solve the problem  whats onetenth of twenty million young dick demanded irritably  huhtwo million of course  well five per cents half of ten per cent what does twenty million earn at five per cent for one year  tim hesitated  half of it half of two million young dick cried at that rate im a million richer every year get that and hang on to it and listen to me when im good and willing to go backbut not for years an yearswell fix it up you and i when i say the word youll write to your father hell jump out to where we are waiting pick me up and cart me back then hell collect the thirty thousand reward from my guardians quit the police force and most likely start a saloon  thirty thousands a hell of a lot of money was tims nonchalant way of expressing his gratitude  not to me young dick minimized his generosity thirty thousand goes into a million thirtythree times and a millions only a years turnover of my money  but tim hagan never lived to see his father a saloon keeper two days later on a trestle the lads were fired out of an empty boxcar by a brakeman who should have known better the trestle spanned a dry ravine young dick looked down at the rocks seventy feet below and demurred  theres room on the trestle he said but what if the train starts up  it aint goin to startbeat it while you got time the brakeman insisted the engines takin water at the other side she always takes it here  but for once the engine did not take water the evidence at the inquest developed that the engineer had found no water in the tank and started on scarcely had the two boys dropped from the sidedoor of the boxcar and before they had made a score of steps along the narrow way between the train and the abyss than the train began to move young dick quick and sure in all his perceptions and adjustments dropped on the instant to hands and knees on the trestle this gave him better holding and more space because he crouched beneath the overhang of the boxcars tim not so quick in perceiving and adjusting also overcome with celtic rage at the brakeman instead of dropping to hands and knees remained upright to flare his opinion of the brakeman to the brakeman in lurid and ancestral terms  get downdrop young dick shouted  but the opportunity had passed on a down grade the engine picked up the train rapidly facing the moving cars with empty air at his back and the depth beneath tim tried to drop on hands and knees but the first twist of his shoulders brought him in contact with the car and nearly outbalanced him by a miracle he recovered equilibrium but he stood upright the train was moving faster and faster it was impossible to get down  young dick kneeling and holding watched the train gathered way the cars moved more swiftly tim with a cool head his back to the fall his face to the passing cars his arms by his sides with nowhere save under his feet a holding point balanced and swayed the faster the train moved the wider he swayed until exerting his will he controlled himself and ceased from swaying  and all would have been well with him had it not been for one car young dick knew it and saw it coming it was a palace horsecar projecting six inches wider than any car on the train he saw tim see it coming he saw tim steel himself to meet the abrupt subtraction of half a foot from the narrow space wherein he balanced he saw tim slowly and deliberately sway out sway out to the extremest limit and yet not sway out far enough the thing was physically inevitable an inch more and tim would have escaped the car an inch more and he would have fallen without impact from the car it caught him in that margin of an inch and hurled him backward and sidetwisting twice he whirled sidewise and two and a half times he turned over ere he struck on his head and neck on the rocks  he never moved after he struck the seventyfoot fall broke his neck and crushed his skull and right there young dick learned deathnot the ordered decent death of civilization wherein doctors and nurses and hypodermics ease the stricken one into the darkness and ceremony and function and flowers and undertaking institutions conspire to give a happy leavetaking and sendoff to the departing shade but sudden death primitive death ugly and ungarnished like the death of a steer in the shambles or a fat swine stuck in the jugular  and right there young dick learned morethe mischance of life and fate the universe hostile to man the need to perceive and to act to see and know to be sure and quick to adjust instantly to all instant shiftage of the balance of forces that bear upon the living and right there beside the strangely crumpled and shrunken remnant of what had been his comrade the moment before young dick learned that illusion must be discounted and that reality never lied  in new mexico young dick drifted into the jinglebob ranch north of roswell in the pecos valley he was not yet fourteen and he was accepted as the mascot of the ranch and made into a sureenough cowboy by cowboys who on legal papers legally signed names such as wild horse willie buck boomer deacon and high pockets  here during a stay of six months young dick soft of frame and unbreakable achieved a knowledge of horses and horsemanship and of men in the rough and raw that became a life asset more he learned there was john chisum owner of the jinglebob the bosque grande and of other cattle ranches as far away as the black river and beyond john chisum was a cattle king who had foreseen the coming of the farmer and adjusted from the open range to barbed wire and who in order to do so had purchased every forty acres carrying water and got for nothing the use of the millions of acres of adjacent range that was worthless without the water he controlled and in the talk by the campfire and chuck wagon among fortydollaramonth cowboys who had not foreseen what john chisum foresaw young dick learned precisely why and how john chisum had become a cattle king while a thousand of his contemporaries worked for him on wages  but young dick was no coolhead his blood was hot he had passion and fire and male pride ready to cry from twenty hours in the saddle he learned to ignore the thousand aching creaks in his body and with the stoic brag of silence to withstain from his blankets until the hardbitten punchers led the way by the same token he straddled the horse that was apportioned him insisted on riding nightherd and knew no hint of uncertainty when it came to him to turn the flank of a stampede with a flying slicker he could take a chance it was his joy to take a chance but at such times he never failed of due respect for reality he was well aware that men were softshelled and cracked easily on hard rocks or under pounding hoofs and when he rejected a mount that tangled its legs in quick action and stumbled it was not because he feared to be cracked but because when he took a chance on being cracked he wanted as he told john chisum himself an even break for his money  it was while at the jinglebob but mailed by a cattleman from chicago that young dick wrote a letter to his guardians even then so careful was he that the envelope was addressed to ah sing though unburdened by his twenty millions young dick never forgot them and fearing his estate might be distributed among remote relatives who might possibly inhabit new england he warned his guardians that he was still alive and that he would return home in several years also he ordered them to keep mrs summerstone on at her regular salary  but young dicks feet itched half a year he felt was really more than he should have spent at the jinglebob as a boy hobo or road kid he drifted on across the united states getting acquainted with its peace officers police judges vagrancy laws and jails and he learned vagrants themselves at first hand and floating laborers and petty criminals among other things he got acquainted with farms and farmers and in new york state once picked berries for a week with a dutch farmer who was experimenting with one of the first silos erected in the united states nothing of what he learned came to him in the spirit of research he had merely the human boys curiosity about all things and he gained merely a huge mass of data concerning human nature and social conditions that was to stand him in good stead in later years when with the aid of the books he digested and classified it  his adventures did not harm him even when he consorted with jail birds in jungle camps and listened to their codes of conduct and measurements of life he was not affected he was a traveler and they were alien breeds secure in the knowledge of his twenty millions there was neither need nor temptation for him to steal or rob all things and all places interested him but he never found a place nor a situation that could hold him he wanted to see to see more and more and to go on seeing  at the end of three years nearly sixteen hard of body weighing a hundred and thirty pounds he judged it time to go home and open the books so he took his first long voyage signing on as boy on a windjammer bound around the horn from the delaware breakwater to san francisco it was a hard voyage of one hundred and eighty days but at the end he weighed ten pounds the more for having made it  mrs summerstone screamed when he walked in on her and ah sing had to be called from the kitchen to identify him mrs summerstone screamed a second time it was when she shook hands with him and lacerated her tender skin in the fisty grip of his ropecalloused palms  he was shy almost embarrassed as he greeted his guardians at the hastily summoned meeting but this did not prevent him from talking straight to the point  its this way he said i am not a fool i know what i want and i want what i want i am alone in the world outside of good friends like you of course and i have my own ideas of the world and what i want to do in it i didnt come home because of a sense of duty to anybody here i came home because it was time because of my sense of duty to myself im all the better from my three years of wandering about and now its up to me to go on with my educationmy book education i mean  the belmont academy mr slocum suggested that will fit you for the university  dick shook his head decidedly  and take three years to do it so would a high school i intend to be in the university of california inside one year that means work but my minds like acid itll bite into the books i shall hire a coach or half a dozen of them and go to it and ill hire my coaches myselfhire and fire them and that means money to handle  a hundred a month mr crockett suggested  dick shook his head  ive taken care of myself for three years without any of my money i guess i can take care of myself along with some of my money here in san francisco i dont care to handle my business affairs yet but i do want a bank account a respectablesized one i want to spend it as i see fit for what i see fit  the guardians looked their dismay at one another  its ridiculous impossible mr crockett began you are as unreasonable as you were before you went away  its my way i guess dick sighed the other disagreement was over my money it was a hundred dollars i wanted then  think of our position dick mr davidson urged as your guardians how would it be looked upon if we gave you a lad of sixteen a free hand with money  whats the freda worth right now dick demanded irrelevantly  can sell for twenty thousand any time mr crockett answered  then sell her shes too large for me and shes worth less every year i want a thirtyfooter that i can handle myself for knocking around the bay and that wont cost a thousand sell the freda and put the money to my account now what you three are afraid of is that ill misspend my moneytaking to drinking horseracing and running around with chorus girls heres my proposition to make you easy on that let it be a drawing account for the four of us the moment any of you decide i am misspending that moment you can draw out the total balance i may as well tell you that just as a side line im going to get a business college expert to come here and cram me with the mechanical side of the business game  dick did not wait for their acquiescence but went on as from a matter definitely settled  how about the horses down at menlonever mind ill look them over and decide what to keep mrs summerstone will stay on here in charge of the house because ive got too much work mapped out for myself already i promise you you wont regret giving me a free hand with my directly personal affairs and now if you want to hear about the last three years ill spin the yarn for you   dick forrest had been right when he told his guardians that his mind was acid and would bite into the books never was there such an education and he directed it himselfbut not without advice he had learned the trick of hiring brains from his father and from john chisum of the jinglebob he had learned to sit silent and to think while cow men talked long about the campfire and the chuck wagon and by virtue of name and place he sought and obtained interviews with professors and college presidents and practical men of affairs and he listened to their talk through many hours scarcely speaking rarely asking a question merely listening to the best they had to offer content to receive from several such hours one idea one fact that would help him to decide what sort of an education he would go in for and how  then came the engaging of coaches never was there such an engaging and discharging such a hiring and firing he was not frugal in the matter for one that he retained a month or three months he discharged a dozen on the first day or the first week and invariably he paid such dischargees a full month although their attempts to teach him might not have consumed an hour he did such things fairly and grandly because he could afford to be fair and grand  he who had eaten the leavings from firemens pails in roundhouses and scoffed mulliganstews at watertanks had learned thoroughly the worth of money he bought the best with the sure knowledge that it was the cheapest a year of high school physics and a year of high school chemistry were necessary to enter the university when he had crammed his algebra and geometry he sought out the heads of the physics and chemistry departments in the university of california professor carey laughed at him at the first  my dear boy professor carey began  dick waited patiently till he was through then dick began and concluded  im not a fool professor carey high school and academy students are children they dont know the world they dont know what they want or why they want what is ladled out to them i know the world i know what i want and why i want it they do physics for an hour twice a week for two terms which with two vacations occupy one year you are the top teacher on the pacific coast in physics the college year is just ending in the first week of your vacation giving every minute of your time to me i can get the years physics what is that week worth to you  you couldnt buy it for a thousand dollars professor carey rejoined thinking he had settled the matter  i know what your salary is dick began  what is it professor carey demanded sharply  its not a thousand a week dick retorted as sharply its not five hundred a week nor twofifty a week he held up his hand to stall off interruption youve just told me i couldnt buy a week of your time for a thousand dollars im not going to but i am going to buy that week for two thousand heavensive only got so many years to live  and you can buy years professor carey queried slyly  sure thats why im here i buy three years in one and the week from you is part of the deal  but i have not accepted professor carey laughed  if the sum is not sufficient dick said stiffly why name the sum you consider fair  and professor carey surrendered so did professor barsdale head of the department of chemistry  already had dick taken his coaches in mathematics duck hunting for weeks in the sloughs of the sacramento and the san joaquin after his bout with physics and chemistry he took his two coaches in literature and history into the curry county hunting region of southwestern oregon he had learned the trick from his father and he worked and played lived in the open air and did three conventional years of adolescent education in one year without straining himself he fished hunted swam exercised and equipped himself for the university at the same time and he made no mistake he knew that he did it because his fathers twenty millions had invested him with mastery money was a tool he did not overrate it nor underrate it he used it to buy what he wanted  the weirdest form of dissipation i ever heard said mr crockett holding up dicks account for the year sixteen thousand for education all itemized including railroad fares porters tips and shotgun cartridges for his teachers  he passed the examinations just the same quoth mr slocum  and in a year growled mr davidson my daughters boy entered belmont at the same time and if hes lucky it will be two years yet before he enters the university  well all ive got to say proclaimed mr crockett is that from now on what that boy says in the matter of spending his money goes  and now ill have a snap dick told his guardians here i am neck and neck again and years ahead of them in knowledge of the world why i know things good and bad big and little about men and women and life that sometimes i almost doubt myself that theyre true but i know them  from now on im not going to rush ive caught up and im going through regular all i have to do is to keep the speed of the classes and ill be graduated when im twentyone from now on ill need less money for educationno more coaches you knowand more money for a good time  mr davidson was suspicious  what do you mean by a good time  oh im going in for the frats for football hold my own you know and im interested in gasoline engines im going to build the first oceangoing gasoline yacht in the world  youll blow yourself up mr crockett demurred its a fool notion all these cranks are rushing into over gasoline  ill make myself safe dick answered and that means experimenting and it means money so keep me a good drawing accountsame old way all four of us can draw     chapter vi    dick forrest proved himself no prodigy at the university save that he cut more lectures the first year than any other student the reason for this was that he did not need the lectures he cut and he knew it his coaches while preparing him for the entrance examinations had carried him nearly through the first college year incidentally he made the freshman team a very scrub team that was beaten by every high school and academy it played against  but dick did put in work that nobody saw his collateral reading was wide and deep and when he went on his first summer cruise in the oceangoing gasoline yacht he had built no gay young crowd accompanied him instead his guests with their families were professors of literature history jurisprudence and philosophy it was long remembered in the university as the highbrow cruise the professors on their return reported a most enjoyable time dick returned with a greater comprehension of the general fields of the particular professors than he could have gained in years at their classlectures and time thus gained enabled him to continue to cut lectures and to devote more time to laboratory work  nor did he miss having his good college time college widows made love to him and college girls loved him and he was indefatigable in his dancing he never cut a smoker a beer bust or a rush and he toured the pacific coast with the banjo and mandolin club  and yet he was no prodigy he was brilliant at nothing half a dozen of his fellows could outbanjo and outmandolin him a dozen fellows were adjudged better dancers than he in football and he gained the varsity in his sophomore year he was considered a solid and dependable player and that was all it seemed never his luck to take the ball and go down the length of the field while the blue and gold host tore itself and the grandstand to pieces but it was at the end of heartbreaking grueling slog in mud and rain the score tied the second half imminent to its close stanford on the fiveyard line berkeleys ball with two downs and three yards to gainit was then that the blue and gold arose and chanted its demand for forrest to hit the center and hit it hard  he never achieved superexcellence at anything big charley everson drank him down at the beer busts harrison jackson at hammer throwing always exceeded his best by twenty feet carruthers out pointed him at boxing anson burge could always put his shoulders to the mat two out of three but always only by the hardest work in english composition a fifth of his class excelled him edlin the russian jew outdebated him on the contention that property was robbery schultz and debret left him with the class behind in higher mathematics and otsuki the japanese was beyond all comparison with him in chemistry  but if dick forrest did not excel at anything he failed in nothing he displayed no superlative strength he betrayed no weakness nor deficiency as he told his guardians who by his unrelenting good conduct had been led into dreaming some great career for him as he told them when they asked what he wanted to become  nothing just all around you see i dont have to be a specialist my father arranged that for me when he left me his money besides i couldnt be a specialist if i wanted to it isnt me  and thus so wellkeyed was he that he expressed clearly his key he had no flare for anything he was that rare individual normal average balanced allaround  when mr davidson in the presence of his fellow guardians stated his pleasure in that dick had shown no wildness since he had settled down dick replied  oh i can hold myself when i want to  yes said mr slocum gravely its the finest thing in the world that you sowed your wild oats early and learned control  dick looked at him curiously  why that boyish adventure doesnt count he said that wasnt wildness i havent gone wild yet but watch me when i start do you know kiplings song of diego valdez let me quote you a bit of it you see diego valdez like me had good fortune he rose so fast to be high admiral of spain that he found no time to take the pleasure he had merely tasted he was lusty and husky but he had no time being too busy rising but always he thought he fooled himself with the thought that his lustiness and huskiness would last and after he became high admiral he could then have his pleasure always he remembered    comrades        old playmates on new seas      when as we traded orpiment        among the savages      a thousand leagues to southard        and thirty years removed      they knew not noble valdez        but me they knew and loved    then they that found good liquor        they drank it not alone     and they that found fair plunder        they told us every one     behind our chosen islands        or secret shoals between      when walty from far voyage        we gathered to careen    there burned our breamingfagots        all pale along the shore     there rose our worn pavilions        a sail above an oar     as flashed each yearning anchor        through mellow seas afire      so swift our careless captains        rowed each to his desire    where lay our loosened harness        where turned our naked feet     whose tavern mid the palmtrees        what quenchings of what heat     oh fountain in the desert        oh cistern in the waste      oh bread we ate in secret        oh cup we spilled in haste    the youth newtaught of longing        the widow curbed and wan     the good wife proud at season        and the maid aware of man      all souls unslaked consuming        defrauded in delays      desire not more than quittance        than i those forfeit days  oh get him get him you three oldsters as ive got him get what he saws next    i dreamed to wait my pleasure        unchanged my spring would bide      wherefore to wait my pleasure        i put my spring aside     till first in face of fortune        and last in mazed disdain      i made diego valdez        high admiral of spain  listen to me guardians dick cried on his face a flame of passion dont forget for one moment that i am anything but unslaked consuming i am i burn but i hold myself dont think i am a dead one because i am a darn nice meritorious boy at college i am young i am alive i am all lusty and husky but i make no mistake i hold myself i dont start out now to blow up on the first lap i am just getting ready i am going to have my time i am not going to spill my cup in haste and in the end i am not going to lament as diego valdez did    there walks no wind neath heaven        nor wave that shall restore      the old careening riot        and the clamorous crowded shore      the fountain in the desert        the cistern in the waste      the bread we ate in secret        the cup we spilled in haste  listen guardians do you know what it is to hit your man to hit him in hot bloodsquare to the jawand drop him cold i want that and i want to love and kiss and risk and play the lusty husky fool i want to take my chance i want my careening riot and i want it while i am young but not while i am too young and im going to have it and in the meantime i play the game at college i hold myself i equip myself so that when i turn loose i am going to have the best chance of my best oh believe me i do not always sleep well of nights  you mean queried mr crockett  sure thats just what i mean i havent gone wild yet but just watch me when i start  and you will start when you graduate  the remarkable youngster shook his head  after i graduate im going to take at least a year of postgraduate courses in the college of agriculture you see im developing a hobbyfarming i want to do something  something constructive my father wasnt constructive to amount to anything neither were you fellows you struck a new land in pioneer days and you picked up money like a lot of sailors shaking out nuggets from the grass roots in a virgin placer  my lad ive some little experience in californian farming mr crockett interrupted in a hurt way  sure you have but you werent constructive you werewell facts are factsyou were destructive you were a bonanza farmer what did you do you took forty thousand acres of the finest sacramento valley soil and you grew wheat on it year after year you never dreamed of rotation you burned your straw you exhausted your humus you plowed four inches and put a plowsole like a cement sidewalk just four inches under the surface you exhausted that film of four inches and now you cant get your seed back  youve destroyed thats what my father did they all did it well im going to take my fathers money and construct im going to take workedout wheatland that i can buy as at a firesale rip out the plowsole and make it produce more in the end than it did when you fellows first farmed it  it was at the end of his junior year that mr crockett again mentioned dicks threatened period of wildness  soon as im done with cow college was his answer then im going to buy and stock and start a ranch thatll be a ranch and then ill set out after my careening riot  about how large a ranch will you start with mr davidson asked  maybe fifty thousand acres maybe five hundred thousand it all depends im going to play unearned increment to the limit people havent begun to come to california yet without a tap of my hand or a turn over fifteen years from now land that i can buy for ten dollars an acre will be worth fifty and what i can buy for fifty will be worth five hundred  a half million acres at ten dollars an acre means five million dollars mr crockett warned gravely  and at fifty it means twentyfive million dick laughed  but his guardians never believed in the wild oats pilgrimage he threatened he might waste his fortune on newfangled farming but to go literally wild after such years of selfrestraint was an unthinkable thing  dick took his sheepskin with small honor he was twentyeighth in his class and he had not set the college world afire his most notable achievement had been his resistance and bafflement of many nice girls and of the mothers of many nice girls next after that he had signalized his senior year by captaining the varsity to its first victory over stanford in five years it was in the day prior to large salaried football coaches when individual play meant much but he hammered teamwork and the sacrifice of the individual into his team so that on thanksgiving day over a vastly more brilliant eleven the blue and gold was able to serpentine its triumph down market street in san francisco  in his postgraduate year in cow college dick devoted himself to laboratory work and cut all lectures in fact he hired his own lecturers and spent a sizable fortune on them in mere traveling expenses over california jacques ribot esteemed one of the greatest world authorities on agricultural chemistry who had been seduced from his two thousand a year in france by the six thousand offered by the university of california who had been seduced to hawaii by the ten thousand of the sugar planters dick forrest seduced with fifteen thousand and the more delectable temperate climate of california on a five years contract  messrs crockett slocum and davidson threw up their hands in horror and knew that this was the wild career dick forrest had forecast  but this was only one of dick forrests similar dissipations he stole from the federal government at a prodigal increase of salary its star specialist in livestock breeding and by similar misconduct he robbed the university of nebraska of its greatest milch cow professor and broke the heart of the dean of the college of agriculture of the university of california by appropriating professor nirdenhammer the wizard of farm management  cheap at the price cheap at the price dick explained to his guardians wouldnt you rather see me spend my money in buying professors than in buying race horses and actresses besides the trouble with you fellows is that you dont know the game of buying brains i do thats my specialty im going to make money out of them and better than that im going to make a dozen blades of grass grow where you fellows didnt leave room for half a blade in the soil you gutted  so it can be understood how his guardians could not believe in his promise of wild career of kissing and risking and hitting men hot on the jaw one year more he warned while he delved in agricultural chemistry soil analysis farm management and traveled california with his corps of highsalaried experts and his guardians could only apprehend a swift and wide dispersal of the forrest millions when dick attained his majority took charge of the totality of his fortune and actually embarked on his agricultural folly  the day he was twentyone the purchase of his principality that extended west from the sacramento river to the mountain tops was consummated  an incredible price said mr crockett  incredibly cheap said dick you ought to see my soil reports you ought to see my waterreports and you ought to hear me sing listen guardians to a song that is a true song i am the singer and the song  whereupon in the queer quavering falsetto that is the sense of song to the north american indian the eskimo and the mongol dick sang    hutim yokim koiodi     wihi yanning koiodi     lowhi yanning koiodi     yoho naini haludom yo nai yoho nainim  the music is my own he murmured apologetically the way i think it ought to have sounded you see no man lives who ever heard it sung the nishinam got it from the maidu who got it from the konkau who made it but the nishinam and the maidu and the konkau are gone their last rancheria is not you plowed it under mr crockett with you bonanza gangplowing plowsoling farming and i got the song from a certain ethnological report volume three of the united states pacific coast geographical and geological survey red cloud who was formed out of the sky first sang this song to the stars and the mountain flowers in the morning of the world i shall now sing it for you in english  and again in indian falsetto ringing with triumph vernal and bursting slapping his thighs and stamping his feet to the accent dick sang    the acorns come down from heaven     i plant the short acorns in the valley     i plant the long acorns in the valley     i sprout i the blackoak acorn sprout i sprout  dick forrests name began to appear in the newspapers with appalling frequency he leaped to instant fame by being the first man in california who paid ten thousand dollars for a single bull his livestock specialist whom he had filched from the federal government in england outbid the rothschilds shire farm for hillcrest chieftain quickly to be known as forrests folly paying for that kingly animal no less than five thousand guineas  let them laugh dick told his exguardians i am importing forty shire mares ill write off half his price the first twelvemonth he will be the sire and grandsire of many sons and grandsons for which the californians will fall over themselves to buy of me at from three to five thousand dollars a clatter  dick forrest was guilty of many similar follies in those first months of his majority but the most unthinkable folly of all was after he had sunk millions into his original folly that he turned it over to his experts personally to develop along the general broad lines laid down by him placed checks upon them that they might not go catastrophically wrong bought a ticket in a passenger brig to tahiti and went away to run wild  occasionally his guardians heard from him at one time he was owner and master of a fourmasted steel sailing ship that carried the english flag and coals from newcastle they knew that much because they had been called upon for the purchase price because they read dicks name in the papers as master when his ship rescued the passengers of the illfated orion and because they collected the insurance when dicks ship was lost with most of all hands in the great fiji hurricane in 1896 he was in the klondike in 1897 he was in kamchatka and scurvystricken and next he erupted with the american flag into the philippines once although they could never learn how nor why he was owner and master of a crazy tramp steamer long since rejected by lloyds which sailed under the aegis of siam  from time to time business correspondence compelled them to hear from him from various purple ports of the purple seas once they had to bring the entire political pressure of the pacific coast to bear upon washington in order to get him out of a scrape in russia of which affair not one line appeared in the daily press but which affair was secretly provocative of ticklish joy and delight in all the chancellories of europe  incidentally they knew that he lay wounded in mafeking that he pulled through a bout with yellow fever in guayaquil and that he stood trial for brutality on the high seas in new york city thrice they read in the press dispatches that he was dead once in battle in mexico and twice executed in venezuela after such false flutterings his guardians refused longer to be thrilled when he crossed the yellow sea in a sampan was rumored to have died of beriberi was captured from the russians by the japanese at mukden and endured military imprisonment in japan  the one thrill of which they were still capable was when true to promise thirty years of age his wild oats sown he returned to california with a wife to whom as he announced he had been married several years and whom all his three guardians found they knew mr slocum had dropped eight hundred thousand along with the totality of her fathers fortune in the final catastrophe at the los cocos mine in chihuahua when the united states demonetized silver mr davidson had pulled a million out of the last stake along with her father when he pulled eight millions from that sunken manresurrected river bed in amador county mr crockett a youth at the time had spooned the merced bottom with her father in the late fifties had stood up best man with him at stockton when he married her mother and at grants pass had played poker with him and with the then lieutenant us grant when all the little the western world knew of that young lieutenant was that he was a good indian fighter but a poor poker player  and dick forrest had married the daughter of philip desten it was not a case of wishing dick luck it was a case of garrulous insistence on the fact that he did not know how lucky he was his guardians forgave him all his wildness he had made good at last he had performed a purely rational act better it was a stroke of genius paula desten philip destens daughter the desten blood the destens and the forrests it was enough the three aged comrades of forrest and desten of the old gold days of the two who had played and passed on were even severe with dick they warned him of the extreme value of his treasure of the sacred duty such wedlock imposed on him of all the traditions and virtues of the desten and forrest blood until dick laughed and broke in with the disconcerting statement that they were talking like a bunch of fanciers or eugenics crankswhich was precisely what they were talking like although they did not care to be told so crassly  at any rate the simple fact that he had married a desten made them nod unqualified approbation when he showed them the plans and building estimates of the big house thanks to paula desten for once they were agreed that he was spending wisely and well as for his farming it was incontestible that the harvest group was unfalteringly producing and he might be allowed his hobbies nevertheless as mr slocum put it twentyfive thousand dollars for a mere workhorse stallion is a madness workhorses are workhorses now had it been running stock     chapter vii    while dick forrest scanned the pamphlet on hog cholera issued by the state of iowa through his open windows across the wide court began to come sounds of the awakening of the girl who laughed from the wooden frame by his bed and who had left on the floor of his sleeping porch not so many hours before the rosy filmy lacy boudoir cap so circumspectly rescued by oh my  dick heard her voice for she awoke like a bird with song he heard her trilling in and out through open windows all down the long wing that was hers and he heard her singing in the patio garden where also she desisted long enough to quarrel with her airedale and scold the collie pup unholily attracted by the redorange diversfinned and manytailed japanese goldfish in the fountain basin  he was aware of pleasure that she was awake it was a pleasure that never staled always up himself for hours he had a sense that the big house was not really awake until he heard paulas morning song across the patio  but having tasted the pleasure of knowing her to be awake dick as usual forgot her in his own affairs she went out of his consciousness as he became absorbed again in the iowa statistics on hog cholera  good morning merry gentleman was the next he heard always adorable music in his ears and paula flowed in upon him all softness of morning kimono and stayless body as her arm passed around his neck and she perched half in his arms on one accommodating knee of his and he pressed her and advertised his awareness of her existence and nearness although his eyes lingered a full half minute longer on the totals of results of professor kenealys hog inoculations on simon jones farm at washington iowa  my she protested you are too fortunate you are sated with riches here is your lady boy your little haughty moon and you havent even said good morning little lady boy was your sleep sweet and gentle  and dick forrest forsook the statistical columns of professor kenealys inoculations pressed his wife closer kissed her but with insistent right forefinger maintained his place in the pages of the pamphlet  nevertheless the very terms of her reproof prevented him from asking what he should have askedthe prosperity of her night since the boudoir cap had been left upon his sleeping porch he shut the pamphlet on his right forefinger at the place he intended to resume and added his right arm to his left about her  oh she cried oh oh listen  from without came the flutecalls of quail she quivered against him with the joy she took in the mellowsweet notes  the coveys are breaking up he said  it means spring paula cried  and the sign that good weather has come  and love  and nestbuilding and egglaying dick laughed never has the world seemed more fecund than this morning lady isleton is farrowed of eleven the angoras were brought down this morning for the kidding you should have seen them and the wild canaries have been discussing matrimony in the patio for hours i think some free lover is trying to break up their monogamic heaven with modern lovetheories its a wonder you slept through the discussion listen there they go now is that applause or is it a riot  arose a thin twittering like elfin pipings with sharp pitches and excited shrillnesses to which dick and paula lent delighted ears till suddenly with the abruptness of the trump of doom all the microphonic chorus of the tiny golden lovers was swept away obliterated in a gargantuan blast of soundno less wild no less musical no less passionate with love but immense dominant compelling by very vastitude of volume  the eager eyes of the man and woman sought instantly the channel past open french windows and the screen of the sleeping porch to the road through the lilacs while they waited breathlessly for the great stallion to appear who trumpeted his lovecall before him again unseen he trumpeted and dick said  i will sing you a song my haughty moon it is not my song it is the mountain lads it is what he nickers listen he sings it again this is what he says hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills i fill the wide valleys the mares hear me and startle in quiet pastures for they know me the grass grows rich and richer the land is filled with fatness and the sap is in the trees it is the spring the spring is mine i am monarch of my kingdom of the spring the mares remember my voice they know me aforetime through their mothers before them hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills and the wide valleys are my heralds echoing the sound of my approach  and paula pressed closer to her husband and was pressed as her lips touched his forehead and as the pair of them gazing at the empty road among the lilacs saw it filled with the eruptive vision of mountain lad majestic and mighty the gnatcreature of a man upon his back absurdly small his eyes wild and desirous with the blue sheen that surfaces the eyes of stallions his mouth flecked with the froth and fret of high spirit now brushed to burnished knees of impatience now tossed skyward to utterance of that vast compelling call that shook the air  almost as an echo from afar off came a thinsweet answering whinney  it is the fotherington princess paula breathed softly  again mountain lad trumpeted his call and dick chanted  hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills  and almost for a flash of an instant circled soft and close in his arms paula knew resentment of her husbands admiration for the splendid beast and the next instant resentment vanished and in acknowledgment of due debt she cried gaily  and now red cloud the song of the acorn dick glanced half absently to her from the pamphlet folded on his finger and then with equal pitch of gaiety sang     the acorns come down from heaven     i plant the short acorns in the valley     i plant the long acorns in the valley     i sprout i the blackoak acorn sprout i sprout  she had impressed herself very close against him during his moment of chanting but in the first moments that succeeded she felt the restless movement of the hand that held the fingermarked hogpamphlet and caught the swift though involuntary flash of his eye to the clock on his desk that marked 1125 again she tried to hold him although with equal involuntariness her attempt was made in mild terms of resentment  you are a strange and wonderful red cloud she said slowly sometimes almost am i convinced that you are utterly red cloud planting your acorns and singing your savage joy of the planting and sometimes almost you are to me the ultramodern man the last word of the twolegged male human that finds trojan adventures in sieges of statistics and armed with test tubes and hypodermics engages in gladiatorial contests with weird microorganisms almost at times it seems you should wear glasses and be baldheaded almost it seems  that i have no right of vigor to possess an armful of girl he completed for her drawing her still closer that i am a silly scientific brute who doesnt merit his vain little breath of sweet rosecolored dust well listen i have a plan in a few days  but his plan died in birth for at their backs came a discreet cough of warning and both heads turning as one they saw bonbright the assistant secretary with a sheaf of notes on yellow sheets in his hand  four telegrams he murmured apologetically mr blake is confident that two of them are very important one of them concerns that chile shipment of bulls  and paula slowly drawing away from her husband and rising to her feet could feel him slipping from her toward his tables of statistics bills of lading and secretaries foremen and managers  oh paula dick called as she was fading through the doorway ive christened the last boyhes to be known as oh ho how do you like it  her reply began with a hint of forlornness that vanished with her smile as she warned  you will play ducks and drakes with the houseboys names  i never do it with pedigreed stock he assured her with a solemnity belied by the challenging twinkle in his eyes  i didnt mean that was her retort i meant that you were exhausting the possibilities of the language before long youll have to be calling them oh bel oh hell and oh go to hell your oh was a mistake you should have started with red then you could have had red bull red horse red dog red frog red fernand and all the rest of the reds  she mingled her laughter with his as she vanished and the next moment the telegram before him he was immersed in the details of the shipment at two hundred and fifty dollars each f o b of three hundred registered yearling bulls to the beef ranges of chile even so vaguely with vague pleasure he heard paula sing her way back across the patio to her long wing of house though he was unaware that her voice was a trifle just the merest trifle subdued     chapter viii    five minutes after paula had left him punctual to the second the four telegrams disposed of dick was getting into a ranch motor car along with thayer the idaho buyer and naismith the special correspondent for the breeders gazette wardman the sheep manager joined them at the corrals where several thousand young shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection  there was little need for conversation thayer was distinctly disappointed in this for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation  they speak for themselves dick had assured him and turned aside to give data to naismith for his impending article on shropshires in california and the northwest  i wouldnt advise you to bother to select them dick told thayer ten minutes later the average is all top you could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand  this cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed thayer that along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads  as he told naismith after they had regained the big house and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game  its my first visit to forrests hes a wizard ive been buying in the east and importing but those shropshires won my judgment you noticed i doubled my order those idaho buyers will be wild for them i only had buying orders straight for six carloads and contingent on my judgment for two carloads more but if every buyer doesnt double his order straight and contingent when he sees them rams and if there isnt a stampede for whats left i dont know sheep theyre the goods if they dont jump up the sheep game of idaho  well then forrests no breeder and im no buyer thats all  as the warning gong for lunch rang outa huge bronze gong from korea that was never struck until it was first indubitably ascertained that paula was awakedick joined the young people at the goldfish fountain in the big patio bert wainwright variously advised and commanded by his sister rita and by paula and her sisters lute and ernestine was striving with a dipnet to catch a particularly gorgeous flower of a fish whose size and color and multiplicity of fins and tails had led paula to decide to segregate him for the special breeding tank in the fountain of her own secret patio amid high excitement and much squealing and laughter the deed was accomplished the big fish deposited in a can and carried away by the waiting italian gardener  and what have you to say for yourself ernestine challenged as dick joined them  nothing he answered sadly the ranch is depleted three hundred beautiful young bulls depart tomorrow for south america and thayer you met him last nightis taking twenty carloads of rams all i can say is that my congratulations are extended to idaho and chile  plant more acorns paula laughed her arms about her sisters the three of them smilingly expectant of an inevitable antic  oh dick sing your acorn song lute begged  he shook his head solemnly  ive got a better one its purest orthodoxy its got red cloud and his acorn song skinned to death listen this is the song of the little eastsider on her first trip to the country under the auspices of her sunday school shes quite young pay particular attention to her lisp  and then dick chanted lisping    the goldfish thwimmeth in the bowl     the robin thiths upon the tree     what maketh them thit so eathily     who stuckth the fur upon their breasths       god god he done it  cribbed was ernestines judgment as the laughter died away  sure dick agreed i got it from the rancher and stockman that got it from the swine breeders journal that got it from the western advocate that got it from public opinion that got it undoubtedly from the little girl herself or rather from her sunday school teacher for that matter i am convinced it was first printed in our dumb animals  the bronze gong rang out its second call and paula one arm around dick the other around rita led the way into the house while bringing up the rear bert wainwright showed lute ernestine a new tango step  one thing thayer dick said in an aside after releasing himself from the girls as they jostled in confusion where they met thayer and naismith at the head of the stairway leading down to the dining room before you leave us cast your eyes over those merinos i really have to brag about them and american sheepmen will have to come to them of course started with imported stock but ive made a california strain that will make the french breeders sit up see wardman and take your pick get naismith to look them over with you stick half a dozen of them in your trainload with my compliments and let your idaho sheepmen get a line on them  they seated at a table capable of indefinite extension in a long low dining room that was a replica of the hacienda dining rooms of the mexican landkings of old california the floor was of large brown tiles the beamed ceiling and the walls were whitewashed and the huge undecorated cement fireplace was an achievement in massiveness and simplicity greenery and blooms nodded from without the deep embrasured windows and the room expressed the sense of cleanness chastity and coolness  on the walls but not crowded were a number of canvasesmost ambitious of all in the setting of honor all in sad grays a twilight mexican scene by xavier martinez of a peon with a crooked stick plow and two bullocks turning a melancholy furrow across the foreground of a sad illimitable mexican plain there were brighter pictures of early mexicancalifornian life a pastel of twilight eucalyptus with a sunsettipped mountain beyond by reimers a moonlight by peters and a griffin stubblefield across which gleamed and smoldered california summer hills of tawny brown and purple misted wooded canyons  say thayer muttered in an undertone across to naismith while dick and the girls were in the thick of exclamatory and giggling banter heres some stuff for that article of yours if you touch upon the big house ive seen the servants dining room forty head sit down to it every meal including gardeners chauffeurs and outside help its a boarding house in itself some head some system take it from me that chiney boy oh joy is a wooz hes housekeeper or manager of the whole shebang or whatever you want to call his joband say it runs that smooth you cant hear it  forrests the real wooz naismith nodded hes the brains that picks brains he could run an army a campaign a government or even a threering circus  which last is some compliment thayer concurred heartily  oh paula dick said across to his wife i just got word that graham arrives tomorrow morning better tell oh joy to put him in the watchtower its mansize quarters and its possible he may carry out his threat and work on his book  grahamgraham paula queried aloud of her memory do i know him  you met him once two years ago in santiago at the cafÃ© venus he had dinner with us  oh one of those naval officers  dick shook his head  the civilian dont you remember that big blond fellowyou talked music with him for half an hour while captain joyce talked our heads off to prove that the united states should clean mexico up and out with the mailed fist  oh to be sure paula vaguely recollected hed met you somewhere before south africa wasnt it or the philippines  thats the chap south africa it was evan graham next time we met was on the times dispatch boat on the yellow sea and we crossed trails a dozen times after that without meeting until that night in the cafÃ© venus  heavenshe left borabora going east two days before i dropped anchor bound west on my way to samoa i came out of apia with letters for him from the american consul the day before he came in we missed each other by three days at levukai was sailing the wild duck then he pulled out of suva as guest on a british cruiser sir everard im thurm british high commissioner of the south seas gave me more letters for graham i missed him at port resolution and at vila in the new hebrides the cruiser was junketing you see i beat her in and out of the santa cruz group it was the same thing in the solomons the cruiser after shelling the cannibal villages at langalanga steamed out in the morning i sailed in that afternoon i never did deliver those letters in person and the next time i laid eyes on him was at the cafÃ© venus two years ago  but who about him and what about him paula queried and whats the book  well first of all beginning at the end hes brokethat is for him hes broke hes got an income of several thousand a year left but all that his father left him is gone no he didnt blow it he got in deep and the silent panic several years ago just about cleaned him but he doesnt whimper  hes good stuff old american stock a yale man the bookhe expects to make a bit on itcovers last years trip across south america west coast to east coast it was largely new ground the brazilian government voluntarily voted him a honorarium of ten thousand dollars for the information he brought out concerning unexplored portions of brazil oh hes a man all man he delivers the goods you know the typeclean big strong simple been everywhere seen everything knows most of a lot of things straight square looks you in the eyeswell in short a mans man  ernestine clapped her hands flung a tantalizing manchallenging manconquering glance at bert wainwright and exclaimed and he comes tomorrow  dick shook his head reprovingly  oh nothing in that direction ernestine just as nice girls as you have tried to hook evan graham before now and between ourselves i couldnt blame them but hes had good wind and fast legs and theyve always failed to run him down or get him into a corner where dazed and breathless hes mechanically muttered yes to certain interrogatories and come out of the trance to find himself roped thrown branded and married forget him ernestine stick by golden youth and let it drop its golden apples pick them up and golden youth with them making a noise like stupid failure all the time you are snaring swiftlegged youth but grahams out of the running hes old like mejust about the same ageand like me hes run a lot of those queer races he knows how to make a getaway hes been cut by barbed wire nosetwitched neckburnt cinched to a fareyouwell and he remains subdued but uncatchable he doesnt care for young things in fact you may charge him with being wobbly but i plead guilty by proxy that he is merely old hard bitten and very wise     chapter ix    wheres my boy in breeches dick shouted stamping with jingling spurs through the big house in quest of its little lady  he came to the door that gave entrance to her long wing it was a door without a knob a huge panel of wood in a woodpaneled wall but dick shared the secret of the hidden spring with his wife pressed the spring and the door swung wide  wheres my boy in breeches he called and stamped down the length of her quarters  a glance into the bathroom with its sunken roman bath and descending marble steps was fruitless as were the glances he sent into paulas wardrobe room and dressing room he passed the short broad stairway that led to her empty windowseat divan in what she called her juliet tower and thrilled at sight of an orderly disarray of filmy pretty lacy womans things that he knew she had spread out for her own sensuous delight of contemplation he fetched up for a moment at a drawing easel his reiterant cry checked on his lips and threw a laugh of recognition and appreciation at the sketch just outlined of an awkward bigboned knobby weanling colt caught in the act of madly whinneying for its mother  wheres my boy in breeches he shouted before him out to the sleeping porch and found only a demure browtroubled chinese woman of thirty who smiled selfeffacing embarrassment into his eyes  this was paulas maid oh dear so named by dick many years before because of a certain solicitous contraction of her delicate brows that made her appear as if ever on the verge of saying oh dear in fact dick had taken her as a child almost for paulas service from a fishing village on the yellow sea where her widowmother earned as much as four dollars in a prosperous year at making nets for the fishermen oh dears first service for paula had been aboard the threetopmast schooner all away at the same time that oh joy cabinboy had begun to demonstrate the efficiency that enabled him through the years to rise to the majordomoship of the big house  where is your mistress oh dear dick asked  oh dear shrank away in an agony of bashfulness  dick waited  she maybe with m young ladiesi dont know oh dear stammered and dick in very mercy swung away on his heel  wheres my boy in breeches he shouted as he stamped out under the porte cochÃ¨re just as a ranch limousine swung around the curve among the lilacs  ill be hanged if i know a tall blond man in a light summer suit responded from the car and the next moment dick forrest and evan graham were shaking hands  oh my and oh ho carried in the hand baggage and dick accompanied his guest to the watch tower quarters  youll have to get used to us old man dick was explaining we run the ranch like clockwork and the servants are wonders but we allow ourselves all sorts of loosenesses if youd arrived two minutes later thered have been no one to welcome you but the chinese boys i was just going for a ride and paulamrs forresthas disappeared  the two men were almost of a size graham topping his host by perhaps an inch but losing that inch in the comparative breadth of shoulders and depth of chest graham was if anything a clearer blond than forrest although both were equally gray of eye equally clear in the whites of the eyes and equally and precisely similarly bronzed by sun and weatherbeat grahams features were in a slightly larger mold his eyes were a trifle longer although this was lost again by a heavier droop of lids his nose hinted that it was a shade straighter as well as larger than dicks and his lips were a shade thicker a shade redder a shade more bowed with fulsomeness  forrests hair was light brown to chestnut while grahams carried a whispering advertisement that it would have been almost golden in its silk had it not been burned almost to sandiness by the sun the cheeks of both were highboned although the hollows under forrests cheek bones were more pronounced both noses were largenostriled and sensitive and both mouths while generously proportioned carried the impression of girlish sweetness and chastity along with the muscles that could draw the lips to the firmness and harshness that would not give the lie to the square uncleft chins beneath  but the inch more in height and the inch less in chestgirth gave evan graham a grace of body and carriage that dick forrest did not possess in this particular of build each served well as a foil to the other graham was all light and delight with a hintbut the slightest of hintsof prince charming forrests seemed a more efficient and formidable organism more dangerous to other life stoutergripped on its own life  forrest threw a glance at his wrist watch as he talked but in that glance without pause or fumble of focus with swift certainty of correlation he read the dial  eleventhirty he said come along at once graham we dont eat till twelvethirty i am sending out a shipment of bulls three hundred of them and im downright proud of them you simply must see them never mind your riding togs oh hofetch a pair of my leggings you oh joy order altadena saddledwhat saddle do you prefer graham  oh anything old man  englishaustralianmcclellanmexican dick insisted  mcclellan if its no trouble graham surrendered   they sat their horses by the side of the road and watched the last of the herd beginning its long journey to chili disappear around the bend  i see what youre doingits great graham said with sparkling eyes ive fooled some myself with the critters when i was a youngster down in the argentine if id had beefblood like that to build on i mightnt have taken the cropper i did  but that was before alfalfa and artesian wells dick smoothed for him the time wasnt ripe for the shorthorn only scrubs could survive the droughts they were strong in staying powers but light on the scales and refrigerator steamships hadnt been invented thats what revolutionized the game down there  besides i was a mere youngster graham added though that meant nothing much there was a young german tackled it at the same time i did with a tenth of my capital he hung it out lean years dry years and all hes rated in seven figures now  they turned their horses back for the big house dick flirted his wrist to see his watch  lots of time he assured his guest im glad you saw those yearlings there was one reason why that young german stuck it out he had to you had your fathers money to fall back on and i imagine not only that your feet itched but that your chief weakness lay in that you could afford to solace the itching   over there are the fish ponds dick said indicating with a nod of his head to the right an invisible area beyond the lilacs youll have plenty of opportunity to catch a mess of trout or bass or even catfish you see im a miser i love to make things work there may be a justification for the eighthour labor day but i make the work day of water just twentyfour hours long the ponds are in series according to the nature of the fish but the water starts working up in the mountains it irrigates a score of mountain meadows before it makes the plunge and is clarified to crystal clearness in the next few rugged miles and at the plunge from the highlands it generates half the power and all the lighting used on the ranch then it sub irrigates lower levels flows in here to the fish ponds and runs out and irrigates miles of alfalfa farther on and believe me if by that time it hadnt reached the flat of the sacramento id be pumping out the drainage for more irrigation  man man graham laughed you could make a poem on the wonder of water ive met fireworshipers but youre the first real water worshiper ive ever encountered and youre no desertdweller either you live in a land of waterpardon the bullbut as i was saying  graham never completed his thought from the right not far away came the unmistakable ring of shod hoofs on concrete followed by a mighty splash and an outburst of womens cries and laughter quickly the cries turned to alarm accompanied by the sounds of a prodigious splashing and floundering as of some huge drowning beast dick bent his head and leaped his horse through the lilacs graham on altadena followed at his heels they emerged in a blaze of sunshine on an open space among the trees and graham came upon as unexpected a picture as he had ever chanced upon in his life  treesurrounded the heart of the open space was a tank foursided of concrete the upper end of the tank full width was a broad spillway sheened with an inch of smoothslipping water the sides were perpendicular the lower end roughly corrugated sloped out gently to solid footing here in distress that was consternation and in fear that was panic excitedly bobbed up and down a cowboy in bearskin chaps vacuously repeating the exclamation oh god oh godthe first division of it rising in inflection the second division inflected fallingly with despair on the edge of the farther side facing him in bathing suits legs dangling toward the water sat three terrified nymphs  and in the tank the center of the picture a great horse bright bay and wet and ruddy satin vertical in the water struck upward and outward into the free air with huge forehoofs steelgleaming in the wet and sun while on its back slipping and clinging was the white form of what graham took at first to be some glorious youth not until the stallion sinking emerged again by means of the powerful beat of his legs and hoofs did graham realize that it was a woman who rode hima woman as white as the white silken slip of a bathing suit that molded to her form like a marblecarven veiling of drapery as marble was her back save that the fine delicate muscles moved and crept under the silken suit as she strove to keep her head above water her slim round arms were twined in yards of halfdrowned stallionmane while her white round knees slipped on the sleek wet satin pads of the great horses straining shoulder muscles the white toes of her dug for a grip into the smooth sides of the animal vainly seeking a hold on the ribs beneath  in a breath or the half of a breath graham saw the whole breathless situation realized that the white wonderful creature was a woman and sensed the smallness and daintiness of her despite her gladiatorial struggles she reminded him of some dresden china figure set absurdly small and light and strangely on the drowning back of a titanic beast so dwarfed was she by the bulk of the stallion that she was a midget or a tiny fairy from fairyland come true  as she pressed her cheek against the great arching neck her golden brown hair wet from being under flowing and tangled seemed tangled in the black mane of the stallion but it was her face that smote graham most of all it was a boys face it was a womans face it was serious and at the same time amused expressing the pleasure it found woven with the peril it was a white womans faceand modern and yet to graham it was allpagan this was not a creature and a situation one happened upon in the twentieth century it was straight out of old greece it was a maxfield parrish reminiscence from the arabian nights genii might be expected to rise from those troubled depths or golden princes astride winged dragons to swoop down out of the blue to the rescue  the stallion forcing itself higher out of water missed by a shade from turning over backward as it sank glorious animal and glorious rider disappeared together beneath the surface to rise together a second later the stallion still pawing the air with forehoofs the size of dinner plates the rider still clinging to the sleek satin coated muscles graham thought with a gasp what might have happened had the stallion turned over a chance blow from any one of those four enormous floundering hoofs could have put out and quenched forever the light and sparkle of that superb whitebodied fireanimated woman  ride his neck dick shouted catch his foretop and get on his neck till he balances out  the woman obeyed digging her toes into the evasive musclepads for the quick effort and leaping upward one hand twined in the wet mane the other hand free and upstretched darting between the ears and clutching the foretop the next moment as the stallion balanced out horizontally in obedience to her shiftage of weight she had slipped back to the shoulders holding with one hand to the mane she waved a white arm in the air and flashed a smile of acknowledgment to forrest and as graham noted she was cool enough to note him on his horse beside forrest also graham realized that the turning of her head and the waving of her arm was only partly in bravado was more in aesthetic wisdom of the picture she composed and was most of all sheer joy of daring and emprise of the blood and the flesh and the life that was she  not many womend tackle that dick said quietly as mountain lad easily retaining his horizontal position once it had been attained swam to the lower end of the tank and floundered up the rough slope to the anxious cowboy  the latter swiftly adjusted the halter with a turn of chain between the jaws but paula still astride leaned forward imperiously took the leadpart from the cowboy whirled mountain lad around to face forrest and saluted  now you will have to go away she called this is our hen party and the stag public is not admitted  dick laughed saluted acknowledgment and led the way back through the lilacs to the road  who  who was it graham queried  paulamrs forrestthe boy girl the child that never grew up the grittiest puff of rosedust that was ever woman  my breath is quite taken away graham said do your people do such stunts frequently  first time she ever did that forrest replied that was mountain lad she rode him straight down the spillwaytobogganed with him twentytwo hundred and forty pounds of him  risked his neck and legs as well as her own was grahams comment  thirtyfive thousand dollars worth of neck and legs dick smiled thats what a pool of breeders offered me for him last year after hed cleaned up the coast with his get as well as himself and as for paula she could break necks and legs at that price every day in the year until i went brokeonly she doesnt she never has accidents  i wouldnt have given tuppence for her chance if hed turned over  but he didnt dick answered placidly thats paulas luck shes tough to kill why ive had her under shellfire where she was actually disappointed because she didnt get hit or killed or near killed four batteries opened on us shrapnel at milerange and we had to cover half a mile of smooth hillbrow for shelter i really felt i was justified in charging her with holding back she did admit a trifle weve been married ten or a dozen years now and dye know sometimes it seems to me i dont know her at all and that nobody knows her and that she doesnt know herselfjust the same way as you and i can look at ourselves in a mirror and wonder who the devil we are anyway paula and i have one magic formula damn the expense when fun is selling and it doesnt matter whether the price is in dollars hide or life its our way and our luck it works and dye know weve never been gouged on the price yet     chapter x    it was a stag lunch as forrest explained the girls were hen partying  i doubt youll see a soul of them till four oclock when ernestine thats one of paulas sisters is going to wallop me at tennisat least so shes threatened and pledged  and graham sat through the lunch where only men sat took his part in the conversation on breeds and breeding learned much contributed a mite from his own worldexperiences and was unable to shake from his eyes the persistent image of his hostess the vision of the rounded and delicate white of her against the dark wet background of the swimming stallion and all the afternoon looking over prize merinos and berkshire gilts continually that vision burned up under his eyelids even at four in the tennis court himself playing against ernestine he missed more than one stroke because the image of the flying ball would suddenly be eclipsed by the image of a white marble figure of a woman that strove and clung on the back of a great horse  graham although an outlander knew his california and while every girl of the swimming suits was gowned for dinner was not surprised to find no man similarly accoutered nor had he made the mistake of so being himself despite the big house and the magnificent scale on which it operated  between the first and second gongs all the guests drifted into the long dining room sharp after the second gong dick forrest arrived and precipitated cocktails and graham impatiently waited the appearance of the woman who had worried his eyes since noon he was prepared for all manner of disappointment too many gorgeous stripped athletes had he seen slouched into conventional garmenting to expect too much of the marvelous creature in the white silken swimming suit when it should appear garbed as civilized women garb  he caught his breath with an imperceptible gasp when she entered she paused naturally for just the right flash of an instant in the arched doorway limned against the darkness behind her the soft glow of the indirect lighting full upon her grahams lips gasped apart and remained apart his eyes ravished with the beauty and surprise of her he had deemed so small so fairylike here was no delicate midget of a childwoman or boygirl on a stallion but a grand lady as only a small woman can be grand on occasion  taller in truth was she as well as in seeming than he had judged her and as finely proportioned in her gown as in her swimming suit he noted her shining goldbrown hair piled high the healthy tinge of her skin that was clean and clear and white the singing throat full and round incomparably set on a healthy chest and the gown dull blue a sort of medieval thing with halffitting halfclinging body with flowing sleeves and trimmings of goldjeweled bands  she smiled an embracing salutation and greeting graham recognized it as kin to the one he had seen when she smiled from the back of the stallion when she started forward he could not fail to see the inimitable way she carried the cling and weight of her draperies with her kneesround knees he knew that he had seen press desperately into the round musclepads of mountain lad graham observed also that she neither wore nor needed corseting nor could he fail as she crossed the floor to see two women one the grand lady the mistress of the big house one the lovely equestrienne statue beneath the dullblue goldentrimmed gown that no gowning could ever make his memory forget  she was upon them among them and grahams hand held hers in the formal introduction as he was made welcome to the big house and all the hacienda in a voice that he knew was a singing voice and that could proceed only from a throat that pillared such as hers from a chest deep as hers despite her smallness  at table across the corner from her he could not help a surreptitious studying of her while he held his own in the general fun and foolishness it was his hostess that mostly filled the circle of his eye and the content of his mind  it was as bizarre a company as graham had ever sat down to dinner with the sheepbuyer and the correspondent for the breeders gazette were still guests three machineloads of men women and girls totaling fourteen had arrived shortly before the first gong and had remained to ride home in the moonlight graham could not remember their names but he made out that they came from some valley town thirty miles away called wickenberg and that they were of the smalltown banking professional and wealthyfarmer class they were full of spirits laughter and the latest jokes and catches sprung in the latest slang  i see right now graham told paula if your place continues to be the caravanserai which it has been since my arrival that i might as well give up trying to remember names and people  i dont blame you she laughed concurrence but these are neighbors they drop in any time mrs watson there next to dick is of the old landaristocracy her grandfather wicken came across the sierras in 1846 wickenberg is named after him and that pretty dark eyed girl is her daughter  and while paula gave him a running sketch of the chance guests graham heard scarce half she said so occupied was he in trying to sense his way to an understanding of her naturalness was her keynote was his first judgment in not many moments he had decided that her keynote was joy but he was dissatisfied with both conclusions and knew he had not put his finger on her and then it came to himpride that was it it was in her eye in the poise of her head in the curling tendrils of her hair in her sensitive nostrils in the mobile lips in the very pitch and angle of the rounded chin in her hands small muscular and veined that he knew at sight to be the hardworked hands of one who had spent long hours at the piano pride it was in every muscle nerve and quiver of herconscious sentient stinging pride  she might be joyous and natural boy and woman fun and frolic but always the pride was there vibrant tense intrinsic the basic stuff of which she was builded she was a woman frank outspoken straight looking plastic democratic but toy she was not at times to him she seemed to glint an impression of steelthin jewellike steel she seemed strength in its most delicate terms and fabrics he fondled the impression of her as of silverspun wire of fine leather of twisted hairsennit from the heads of maidens such as the marquesans make of carven pearlshell for the lure of the bonita and of barbed ivory at the heads of seaspears such as the eskimos throw  all right aaron they heard dick forrests voice rising in a lull from the other end of the table heres something from phillips brooks for you to chew on brooks said that no man has come to true greatness who has not felt in some degree that his life belongs to his race and that what god gives him he gives him for mankind  so at last you believe in god the man addressed aaron genially sneered back he was a slender longfaced olivebrunette with brilliant black eyes and the blackest of long black beards  im hanged if i know dick answered anyway i quoted only figuratively call it morality call it good call it evolution  a man doesnt have to be intellectually correct in order to be great intruded a quiet longfaced irishman whose sleeves were threadbare and frayed and by the same token many men who are most correct in sizing up the universe have been least great  true for you terrence dick applauded  its a matter of definition languidly spoke up an unmistakable hindoo crumbling his bread with exquisitely slender and smallboned fingers what shall we mean as great  shall we say beauty softly queried a tragicfaced youth sensitive and shrinking crowned with an abominably trimmed head of long hair  ernestine rose suddenly at her place hands on table leaning forward with a fine simulation of intensity   theyre off she cried theyre off now well have the universe settled all over again for the thousandth time theodoreto the youthful poetits a poor start get into the running ride your father ion and your mother ion and youll finish three lengths ahead  a roar of laughter was her reward and the poet blushed and receded into his sensitive shell  ernestine turned on the blackbearded one  now aaron hes not in form you start it you know how begin as bergson so well has said with the utmost refinement of philosophic speech allied with the most comprehensive intellectual outlook that  more laughter roared down the table drowning ernestines conclusion as well as the laughing retort of the blackbearded one  our philosophers wont have a chance tonight paula stole in an aside to graham  philosophers he questioned back they didnt come with the wickenberg crowd who and what are they im all at sea  they paula hesitated they live here they call themselves the junglebirds they have a camp in the woods a couple of miles away where they never do anything except read and talk ill wager right now youll find fifty of dicks latest uncatalogued books in their cabins they have the run of the library as well and youll see them drifting in and out any time of the day or night with their arms full of booksalso the latest magazines dick says they are responsible for his possessing the most exhaustive and uptodate library on philosophy on the pacific coast in a way they sort of digest such things for him its great fun for dick and besides it saves him time hes a dreadfully hard worker you know  i understand that they that dick takes care of them graham asked the while he pleasured in looking straight into the blue eyes that looked so straight into his  as she answered he was occupied with noting the faintest hint of bronzeperhaps a trick of the lightin her long brown lashes perforce he lifted his gaze to her eyebrows brown delicately stenciled and made sure that the hint of bronze was there still lifting his gaze to her highpiled hair he again saw but more pronounced the bronze note glinting from the browngolden hair nor did he fail to startle and thrill to a dazzlement of smile and teeth and eye that frequently lived its life in her face hers was no thin smile of restraint he judged when she smiled she smiled all of herself generously joyously throwing the largess of all her being into the natural expression of what was herself and which domiciled somewhere within that pretty head of hers  yes she was saying they have never to worry as long as they live over mere bread and butter dick is most generous and rather immoral in his encouragement of idleness on the part of men like them its a funny place as youll find out until you come to understand us they they are appurtenances andand hereditaments and such things they will be with us always until we bury them or they bury us once in a while one or another of them drifts awayfor a time like the cat you know then it costs dick real money to get them back terrence thereterrence mcfanehes an epicurean anarchist if you know what that means he wouldnt kill a flea he has a pet cat i gave him a persian of the bluest blue and he carefully picks her fleas not injuring them stores them in a vial and turns them loose in the forest on his long walks when he tires of human companionship and communes with nature  well only last year he got a bee in his bonnetthe alphabet he started for egyptwithout a cent of courseto run the alphabet down in the home of its origin and thereby to win the formula that would explain the cosmos he got as far as denver traveling as tramps travel when he mixed up in some i w w riot for free speech or something dick had to hire lawyers pay fines and do just about everything to get him safe home again  and the one with a beardaaron hancock like terrence he wont work aarons a southerner says none of his people ever did work and that there have always been peasants and fools who just couldnt be restrained from working thats why he wears a beard to shave he holds is unnecessary work and therefore immoral i remember at melbourne when he broke in upon dick and me a sunburnt wild man from out the australian bush it seems hed been making original researches in anthropology or folkloreology or something like that dick had known him years before in paris and dick assured him if he ever drifted back to america of food and shelter so here he is  and the poet graham asked glad that she must still talk for a while enabling him to study the quick dazzlement of smile that played upon her face  oh theotheodore malken though we call him leo he wont work either his people are old californian stock and dreadfully wealthy but they disowned him and he disowned them when he was fifteen they say he is lunatic and he says they are merely maddening he really writes some remarkable verse when he does write but he prefers to dream and live in the jungle with terrence and aaron he was tutoring immigrant jews in san francisco when terrence and aaron rescued him or captured him i dont know which hes been with us two years now and hes actually filling out despite the facts that dick is absurdly generous in furnishing supplies and that theyd rather talk and read and dream than cook the only good meals they get is when they descend upon us like tonight  and the hindoo therewhos he  thats dar hyal hes their guest the three of them invited him up just as aaron first invited terrence and as aaron and terrence invited leo dick says in time three more are bound to appear and then hell have his seven sages of the madroÃ±o grove their jungle camp is in a madroÃ±o grove you know its a most beautiful spot with living springs a canyonbut i was telling you about dar hyal  hes a revolutionist of sorts hes dabbled in our universities studied in france italy switzerland is a political refugee from india and hes hitched his wagon to two stars one a new synthetic system of philosophy the other rebellion against the tyranny of british rule in india he advocates individual terrorism and direct mass action thats why his paper kadar or badar or something like that was suppressed here in california and why he narrowly escaped being deported and thats why hes up here just now devoting himself to formulating his philosophy  he and aaron quarrel tremendouslythat is on philosophical matters and now paula sighed and erased the sigh with her smileand now im done consider yourself acquainted and oh if you encounter our sages more intimately a word of warning especially if the encounter be in the stag room dar hyal is a total abstainer theodore malken can get poetically drunk and usually does on one cocktail aaron hancock is an expert winebibber and terrence mcfane knowing little of one drink from another and caring less can put ninetynine men out of a hundred under the table and go right on lucidly expounding epicurean anarchy  one thing graham noted as the dinner proceeded the sages called dick forrest by his first name but they always addressed paula as mrs forrest although she called them by their first names there was nothing affected about it quite unconsciously did they who respected few things under the sun and among such few things not even work quite unconsciously and invariably did they recognize the certain definite aloofness in dick forrests wife so that her given name was alien to their lips by such tokens evan graham was not slow in learning that dick forrests wife had a way with her compounded of sheerest democracy and equally sheer royalty  it was the same thing after dinner in the big living room she dared as she pleased but nobody assumed before the company settled down paula seemed everywhere bubbling over with more outrageous spirits than any of them from this group or that from one corner or another her laugh rang out and her laugh fascinated graham there was a fibrous thrill in it most sweet to the ear that differentiated it from any laugh he had ever heard it caused graham to lose the thread of young mr wombolds contention that what california needed was not a japanese exclusion law but at least two hundred thousand japanese coolies to do the farm labor of california and knock in the head the threatened eighthour day for agricultural laborers young mr wombold graham gleaned was an hereditary large landowner in the vicinity of wickenberg who prided himself on not yielding to the trend of the times by becoming an absentee landlord  from the piano where eddie mason was the center of a group of girls came much noise of ragtime music and slangtime song terrence mcfane and aaron hancock fell into a heated argument over the music of futurism and graham was saved from the japanese situation with mr wombold by dar hyal who proceeded to proclaim asia for the asiatics and california for the californians  paula catching up her skirts for speed fled down the room in some romp pursued by dick who captured her as she strove to dodge around the wombold group  wicked woman dick reproved her in mock wrath and the next moment joined her in persuading dar hyal to dance  and dar hyal succumbed flinging asia and the asiatics to the winds along with his arms and legs as he weirdly parodied the tango in what he declared to be the blastic culmination of modern dancing  and now red cloud sing mr graham your acorn song paula commanded dick  forrest his arm still about her detaining her for the threatened punishment not yet inflicted shook his head somberly  the acorn song ernestine called from the piano and the cry was taken up by eddie mason and the girls  oh do dick paula pleaded mr graham is the only one who hasnt heard it  dick shook his head  then sing him your goldfish song  ill sing him mountain lads song dick bullied a whimsical sparkle in his eyes he stamped his feet pranced nickered a not bad imitation of mountain lad tossed an imaginary mane and cried  hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills  the acorn song paula interrupted quickly and quietly with just the hint of steel in her voice  dick obediently ceased his chant of mountain lad but shook his head like a stubborn colt  i have a new song he said solemnly it is about you and me paula i got it from the nishinam  the nishinam are the extinct aborigines of this part of california paula shot in a swift aside of explanation to graham  dick danced half a dozen steps stifflegged as indians dance slapped his thighs with his palms and began a new chant still retaining his hold on his wife  me i am aikut the first man of the nishinam aikut is the short for adam and my father and my mother were the coyote and the moon and this is yototowi my wife she is the first woman of the nishinam her father and her mother were the grasshopper and the ring tailed cat they were the best father and mother left after my father and mother the coyote is very wise the moon is very old but who ever heard much of anything of credit to the grasshopper and the ring tailed cat the nishinam are always right the mother of all women had to be a cat a little wizened sadfaced shrewd ringtailed cat  whereupon the song of the first man and woman was interrupted by protests from the women and acclamations from the men  this is yototowi which is the short for eve dick chanted on drawing paula bruskly closer to his side with a semblance of savage roughness yototowi is not much to look at but be not hard upon her the fault is with the grasshopper and the ringtailed cat me i am aikut the first man but question not my taste i was the first man and this i saw was the first woman where there is but one choice there is not much to choose adam was so circumstanced he chose eve yototowi was the one woman in all the world for me so i chose yototowi  and evan graham listening his eyes on that possessive encircling arm of all his hostesss fairness felt an awareness of hurt and arose unsummoned the thought to be dismissed angrily dick forrest is luckytoo lucky  me i am aikut dick chanted on this is my dew of woman she is my honeydew of woman i have lied to you her father and her mother were neither hopper nor cat they were the sierra dawn and the summer east wind of the mountains together they conspired and from the air and earth they sweated all sweetness till in a mist of their own love the leaves of the chaparral and the manzanita were dewed with the honeydew  yototowi is my honeydew woman hear me i am aikut yototowi is my quail woman my deerwoman my lushwoman of all soft rain and fat soil she was born of the thin starlight and the brittle dawn light before the sun     and forrest concluded relapsing into his natural voice and enunciation having reached the limit of extemporizationand if you think old sweet blueeyed solomon has anything on me in singing the song of songs just put your names down for the subscription edition of my song of songs     chapter xi    it was mrs mason who first asked that paula play but it was terrence mcfane and aaron hancock who evicted the ragtime group from the piano and sent theodore malken a blushing ambassador to escort paula  tis for the confounding of this pagan that im askin you to play reflections on the water graham heard terrence say to her  and the girl with flaxen hair after please begged hancock the indicted pagan it will aptly prove my disputation this wild celt has a bogtheory of music that predates the cavemanand he has the unadulterated stupidity to call himself ultramodern  oh debussy paula laughed still wrangling over him eh ill try and get around to him but i dont know with what ill begin  dar hyal joined the three sages in seating paula at the concert grand which graham decided was none too great for the great room but no sooner was she seated than the three sages slipped away to what were evidently their chosen listening places the young poet stretched himself prone on a deep bearskin forty feet from the piano his hands buried in his hair terrence and aaron lolled into a cushioned embrasure of a window seat sufficiently near to each other to nudge the points of their respective contentions as paula might expound them the girls were huddled in colored groups on wide couches or garlanded in twos and threes on and in the big koawood chairs  evan graham halfstarted forward to take the honor of turning paulas music but saw in time that dar hyal had already elected to himself that office graham glimpsed the scene with quiet curious glances the grand piano under a low arch at the farend of the room was cunningly raised and placed as on and in a sounding board all jollity and banter had ceased evidently he thought the little lady had a way with her and was accepted as a player of parts and from this he was perversely prepared for disappointment  ernestine leaned across from a chair to whisper to him  she can do anything she wants to do and she doesnt work    much she studied under leschetizky and madame carreno you know and she abides by their methods she doesnt play like a woman either listen to that  graham knew that he expected disappointment from her confident hands even as she rippled them over the keys in little chords and runs with which he could not quarrel but which he had heard too often before from technically brilliant but musically mediocre performers but whatever he might have fancied she would play he was all unprepared for rachmaninoffs sheerly masculine prelude which he had heard only men play when decently played  she took hold of the piano with the first two ringing bars masterfully like a man she seemed to lift it and its sounding wires with her two hands with the strength and certitude of maleness and then as only he had heard men do it she sank or leapedhe could scarcely say whichto the sureness and pureness and ineffable softness of the andante following  she played on with the calm and power of anything but the little almost girlish woman he glimpsed through halfclosed lids across the ebony board of the enormous piano which she commanded as she commanded herself as she commanded the composer her touch was definite authoritative was his judgment as the prelude faded away in dying chords hauntingly reminiscent of its full vigor that seemed still to linger in the air  while aaron and terrence debated in excited whispers in the window seat and while dar hyal sought other music at paulas direction she glanced at dick who turned off bowl after bowl of mellow light till paula sat in an oasis of soft glow that brought out the dull gold lights in her dress and hair  graham watched the lofty room grow loftier in the increasing shadows eighty feet in length rising two stories and a half from masonry walls to treetrunked roof flung across with a flying gallery from the rail of which hung skins of wild animals handwoven blankets of oaxaca and ecuador and tapas womanpounded and vegetabledyed from the islands of the south pacific graham knew it for what it wasa feasthall of some medieval castle and almost he felt a poignant sense of lack of the long spread table with pewter below the salt and silver above the salt and with huge hounddogs scuffling beneath for bones  later when paula had played sufficient debussy to equip terrence and aaron for fresh war graham talked with her about music for a few vivid moments so well did she prove herself aware of the philosophy of music that ere he knew it he was seduced into voicing his own pet theory  and so he concluded the true psychic factor of music took nearly three thousand years to impress itself on the western mind debussy more nearly attains the ideaengendering and suggestive serenitysay of the time of pythagorasthan any of his forerunners  here paula put a pause in his summary by beckoning over terrence and aaron from their battlefield in the windowseat  yes and what of it terrence was demanding as they came up side by side i defy you aaron i defy you to get one thought out of bergson on music that is more lucid than any thought he ever uttered in his philosophy of laughter which is not lucid at all  ohlisten paula cried with sparkling eyes we have a new prophet hear mr graham hes worthy of your steel of both your steel he agrees with you that music is the refuge from blood and iron and the pounding of the table that weak souls and sensitive souls and highpitched souls flee from the crassness and the rawness of the world to the drugdreams of the overworld of rhythm and vibration  atavistic aaron hancock snorted the cavemen the monkeyfolk and the ancestral bogmen of terrence did that sort of thing  but wait paula urged its his conclusions and methods and processes also there he disagrees with you aaron fundamentally he quoted paters that all art aspires toward music  pure prehuman and microorganic chemistry aaron broke in the reactions of cellelements to the doggerel punch of the wavelengths of sunlight the foundation of all folksongs and ragtimes terrence completes his circle right there and stultifies all his windiness now listen to me and i will present  but wait paula pleaded mr graham argues that english puritanism barred music real music for centuries  true said terrence  and that england had to win to its sensuous delight in rhythm through milton and shelley  who was a metaphysician aaron broke in  a lyrical metaphysician terrence defined instantly that you must acknowledge aaron  and swinburne aaron demanded with a significance that tokened former arguments  he says offenbach was the forerunner of arthur sullivan paula cried challengingly and that auber was before offenbach and as for wagner ask him just ask him  and she slipped away leaving graham to his fate he watched her watched the perfect kneelift of her draperies as she crossed to mrs mason and set about arranging bridge quartets while dimly he could hear terrence beginning  it is agreed that music was the basis of inspiration of all the arts of the greeks  later when the two sages were obliviously engrossed in a heated battle as to whether berlioz or beethoven had exposited in their compositions the deeper intellect graham managed his escape clearly his goal was to find his hostess again but she had joined two of the girls in the whispering giggling seclusiveness of one of the big chairs and most of the company being deep in bridge graham found himself drifted into a group composed of dick forrest mr wombold dar hyal and the correspondent of the breeders gazette  im sorry you wont be able to run over with me dick was saying to the correspondent it would mean only one more day ill take you tomorrow  sorry was the reply but i must make santa rosa burbank has promised me practically a whole morning and you know what that means yet i know the gazette would be glad for an account of the experiment cant you outline itbriefly just briefly heres mr graham it will interest him i am sure  more waterworks graham queried  no an asinine attempt to make good farmers out of hopelessly poor ones mr wombold answered i contend that any farmer today who has no land of his own proves by his lack of it that he is an inefficient farmer  on the contrary spoke up dar hyal weaving his slender asiatic fingers in the air to emphasize his remarks quite on the contrary times have changed efficiency no longer implies the possession of capital it is a splendid experiment an heroic experiment and it will succeed  what is it dick graham urged tell us  oh nothing just a white chip on the table forrest answered lightly most likely it will never come to anything although just the same i have my hopes  a white chip wombold broke in five thousand acres of prime valley land all for a lot of failures to batten on to farm if you please on salary with food thrown in  the food that is grown on the land only dick corrected now i will have to put it straight ive set aside five thousand acres midway between here and the sacramento river  think of the alfalfa it grew and that you need wombold again interrupted  my dredgers redeemed twice that acreage from the marshes in the past year dick replied the thing is i believe the west and the world must come to intensive farming i want to do my share toward blazing the way ive divided the five thousand acres into twentyacre holdings i believe each twenty acres should support comfortably not only a family but pay at least six per cent  when it is all allotted it will mean two hundred and fifty families the gazette man calculated and say five to the family it will mean twelve hundred and fifty souls  not quite dick corrected the last holding is occupied and we have only a little over eleven hundred on the land he smiled whimsically but they promise they promise several fat years and theyll average six to the family  who is we graham inquired  oh i have a committee of farm experts on itmy own men with the exception of professor lieb whom the federal government has loaned me the thing is they must farm with individual responsibility according to the scientific methods embodied in our instructions the land is uniform every holding is like a pea in the pod to every other holding the results of each holding will speak in no uncertain terms the failure of any farmer through laziness or stupidity measured by the average result of the entire two hundred and fifty farmers will not be tolerated out the failures must go convicted by the average of their fellows  its a fair deal no farmer risks anything with the food he may grow and he and his family may consume plus a cash salary of a thousand a year he is certain good seasons and bad stupid or intelligent of at least a hundred dollars a month the stupid and the inefficient will be bound to be eliminated by the intelligent and the efficient thats all it will demonstrate intensive farming with a vengeance and there is more than the certain salary guaranty after the salary is paid the adventure must yield six per cent to me if more than this is achieved then the entire hundred per cent of the additional achievement goes to the farmer  which means that each farmer with go in him will work nights to make goodi see said the gazette man and why not hundred dollar jobs arent picked up for the asking the average farmer in the united states doesnt net fifty a month on his own land especially when his wages of superintendence and of direct personal labor are subtracted of course able men will work their heads off to hold to such a proposition and theyll see to it that every member of the family does the same  tis the one objection i have to this place terrence mcfane who had just joined the group announced ever one hears but the one thingwork tis repulsive the thought of the work each on his twenty acres toilin and moilin daylight till dark and after dark an for what a bit of meat a bit of bread and maybe a bit of jam on the bread an to what end is meat an bread an jam the end of it all the meaning of life the goal of existence surely the man will die like a work horse dies after a life of toil and what end has been accomplished bread an meat an jam is that it a full belly and shelter from the cold till ones body drops apart in the dark moldiness of the grave  but terrence you too will die dick forrest retorted  but oh my glorious life of loafing came the instant answer the hours with the stars and the flowers under the green trees with the whisperings of breezes in the grass my books my thinkers and their thoughts beauty music all the solaces of all the arts what when i fade into the dark i shall have well lived and received my wage for living but these twentyacre workanimals of twolegged men of yours daylight till dark toil and moil sweat on the shirts on the backs of them that dries only to crust meat and bread in their bellies roofs that dont leak a brood of youngsters to live after them to live the same beastlives of toil to fill their bellies with the same meat and bread to scratch their backs with the same sweaty shirts and to go into the dark knowing only meat and bread and mayhap a bit of jam  but somebody must do the work that enables you to loaf mr wombold spoke up indignantly  tis true tis sad tis true terrence replied lugubriously then his face beamed and i thank the good lord for it for the work beasties that drag and drive the plows up and down the fields for the bateyed minerbeasties that dig the coal and gold for all the stupid peasantbeasties that keep my hands soft and give power to fine fellows like dick there who smiles on me and shares the loot with me and buys the latest books for me and gives me a place at his board that is plenished by the twolegged workbeasties and a place at his fire that is builded by the same beasties and a shack and a bed in the jungle under the madroÃ±o trees where never work intrudes its monstrous head  evan graham was slow in getting ready for bed that night he was unwontedly stirred both by the big house and by the little lady who was its mistress as he sat on the edge of the bed halfundressed and smoked out a pipe he kept seeing her in memory as he had seen her in the flesh the past twelve hours in her varied moods and guisesthe woman who had talked music with him and who had expounded music to him to his delight who had enticed the sages into the discussion and abandoned him to arrange the bridge tables for her guests who had nestled in the big chair as girlish as the two girls with her who had with a hint of steel quelled her husbands obstreperousness when he had threatened to sing mountain lads song who unafraid had bestridden the halfdrowning stallion in the swimming tank and who a few hours later had dreamed into the dining room distinctive in dress and person to meet her many guests  the big house with all its worthy marvels and bizarre novelties competed with the figure of paula forrest in filling the content of his imagination once again and yet again many times he saw the slender fingers of dar hyal weaving argument in the air the black whiskers of aaron hancock enunciating bergsonian dogmas the frayed coatcuffs of terrence mcfane articulating thanks to god for the two legged workbeasties that enabled him to loaf at dick forrests board and under dick forrests madroÃ±o trees  graham knocked out his pipe took a final sweeping survey of the strange room which was the last word in comfort pressed off the lights and found himself between cool sheets in the wakeful dark again he heard paula forrest laugh again he sensed her in terms of silver and steel and strength again against the dark he saw that inimitable kneelift of her gown the bright vision of it was almost an irk to him so impossible was it for him to shake it from his eyes ever it returned and burned before him a moving image of light and color that he knew to be subjective but that continually asserted the illusion of reality  he saw stallion and rider sink beneath the water and rise again a flurry of foam and floundering of hoofs and a womans face that laughed while she drowned her hair in the drowning mane of the beast and the first ringing bars of the prelude sounded in his ears as again he saw the same hands that had guided the stallion lift the piano to all rachmaninoffs pure splendor of sound  and when graham finally fell asleep it was in the thick of marveling over the processes of evolution that could produce from primeval mire and dust the glowing glorious flesh and spirit of woman     chapter xii    the next morning graham learned further the ways of the big house oh my had partly initiated him in particular things the preceding day and had learned that after the waking cup of coffee he preferred to breakfast at table rather than in bed also oh my had warned him that breakfast at table was an irregular affair anywhere between seven and nine and that the breakfasters merely drifted in at their convenience if he wanted a horse or if he wanted a swim or a motor car or any ranch medium or utility he desired oh my informed him all he had to do was to call for it  arriving in the breakfast room at half past seven graham found himself just in time to say goodby to the gazette man and the idaho buyer who finishing were just ready to catch the ranch machine that connected at eldorado with the morning train for san francisco he sat alone being perfectly invited by a perfect chinese servant to order as he pleased and found himself served with his first desirean icecold sherried grapefruit which the tableboy proudly informed him was grown on the ranch declining variously suggested breakfast foods mushes and porridges graham had just ordered his softboiled eggs and bacon when bert wainwright drifted in with a casualness that graham recognized as histrionic when five minutes later in boudoir cap and delectable negligee ernestine desten drifted in and expressed surprise at finding such a multitude of early risers  later as the three of them were rising from table they greeted lute desten and rita wainwright arriving over the billiard table with bert graham learned that dick forrest never appeared for breakfast that he worked in bed from terribly wee small hours had coffee at six and only on unusual occasions appeared to his guests before the twelvethirty lunch as for paula forrest bert explained she was a poor sleeper a late riser lived behind a door without a knob in a spacious wing with a rare and secret patio that even he had seen but once and only on infrequent occasion was she known to appear before twelvethirty and often not then  you see shes healthy and strong and all that he explained but she was born with insomnia she never could sleep she couldnt sleep as a little baby even but its never hurt her any because shes got a will and wont let it get on her nerves shes just about as tense as they make them yet instead of going wild when she cant sleep she just wills to relax and she does relax she calls them her white nights when she gets them maybe shell fall asleep at daybreak or at nine or ten in the morning and then shell sleep the rest of the clock around and get down to dinner as chipper as you please  its constitutional i fancy graham suggested  bert nodded  it would be a handicap to nine hundred and ninetynine women out of a thousand but not to her she puts up with it and if she cant sleep one timeshe should worryshe just sleeps some other time and makes it up  more and other things bert wainwright told of his hostess and graham was not slow in gathering that the young man despite the privileges of long acquaintance stood a good deal in awe of her  i never saw anybody whose goat she couldnt get if she went after it he confided man or woman or servant age sex and previous condition of servitudeits all one when she gets on the high and mighty and i dont see how she does it maybe its just a kind of light that comes into her eyes or some kind of an expression on her lips or i dont know whatanyway she puts it across and nobody makes any mistake about it  she has a  a way with her graham volunteered   thats it berts face beamed its a way she has she just puts it over kind of gives you a chilly feeling you dont know why maybe shes learned to be so quiet about it because of the control shes learned by passing sleepless nights without squealing out or getting sour the chances are she didnt bat an eye all last night excitement you know the crowd swimming mountain lad and such things now ordinary things thatd keep most women awake like danger or storm at sea and such things dick says dont faze her she can sleep like a baby he says when the town shes in is being bombarded or when the ship shes in is trying to claw off a lee shore shes a wonder and no mistake you ought to play billiards with herthe english game shell go some  a little later graham along with bert encountered the girls in the morning room where despite an hour of ragtime song and dancing and chatter he was scarcely for a moment unaware of a loneliness a lack and a desire to see his hostess in some fresh and unguessed mood and way come in upon them through the open door  still later mounted on altadena and accompanied by bert on a thoroughbred mare called mollie graham made a two hours exploration of the dairy center of the ranch and arrived back barely in time to keep an engagement with ernestine in the tennis court  he came to lunch with an eagerness for which his keen appetite could not entirely account and he knew definite disappointment when his hostess did not appear  a white night dick forrest surmised for his guests benefit and went into details additional to berts of her constitutional inaptitude for normal sleep do you know we were married years before i ever saw her sleep i knew she did sleep but i never saw her ive seen her go three days and nights without closing an eye and keep sweet and cheerful all the time and when she did sleep it was out of exhaustion that was when the all away went ashore in the carolines and the whole population worked to get us off it wasnt the danger for there wasnt any it was the noise also it was the excitement she was too busy living and when it was almost all over i actually saw her asleep for the first time in my life  a new guest had arrived that morning a donald ware whom graham met at lunch he seemed well acquainted with all as if he had visited much in the big house and graham gathered that despite his youth he was a violinist of note on the pacific coast  he has conceived a grand passion for paula ernestine told graham as they passed out from the dining room  graham raised his eyebrows  oh but she doesnt mind ernestine laughed every man that comes along does the same thing shes used to it she has just a charming way of disregarding all their symptoms and enjoys them and gets the best out of them in consequence its lots of fun to dick youll be doing the same before youre here a week if you dont well all be surprised mightily and if you dont most likely youll hurt dicks feelings hes come to expect it as a matter of course and when a fond proud husband gets a habit like that it must hurt terribly to see his wife not appreciated  oh well if i am expected to i suppose i must graham sighed but just the same i hate to do whatever everybody does just because everybody does it but if its the customwell its the custom thats all but its mighty hard on one with so many other nice girls around  there was a quizzical light in his long gray eyes that affected ernestine so profoundly that she gazed into his eyes over long became conscious of what she was doing dropped her own eyes away and flushed  little leothe boy poet you remember last night she rattled on in a patent attempt to escape from her confusion hes madly in love with paula too ive heard aaron hancock chaffing him about some sonnet cycle and it isnt difficult to guess the inspiration and terrencethe irishman you knowhes mildly in love with her they cant help it you see and can you blame them  she surely deserves it all graham murmured although vaguely hurt in that the addlepated alphabetobsessed epicurean anarchist of an irishman who gloried in being a loafer and a pensioner should even mildly be in love with the little lady she is most deserving of all mens admiration he continued smoothly from the little ive seen of her shes quite remarkable and most charming  shes my halfsister ernestine vouchsafed although you wouldnt dream a drop of the same blood ran in our veins shes so different shes different from all the destens from any girl i ever knew though she isnt exactly a girl shes thirtyeight you know  pussy pussy graham whispered  the pretty young blonde looked at him in surprise and bewilderment taken aback by the apparent irrelevance of his interruption  cat he censured in mock reproof  oh she cried i never meant it that way you will find we are very frank here everybody knows paulas age she tells it herself im eighteenso there and now just for your meanness how old are you  as old as dick he replied promptly  and hes forty she laughed triumphantly are you coming swimming the water will be dreadfully cold  graham shook his head im going riding with dick  her face fell with all the ingenuousness of eighteen  oh she protested some of his eternal green manures or hillside terracing or waterpocketing  but he said something about swimming at five  her face brightened joyously  then well meet at the tank it must be the same party paula said swimming at five  as they parted under a long arcade where his way led to the tower room for a change into riding clothes she stopped suddenly and called  oh mr graham  he turned obediently  you really are not compelled to fall in love with paula you know it was just my way of putting it  i shall be very very careful he said solemnly although there was a twinkle in his eye as he concluded  nevertheless as he went on to his room he could not but admit to himself that the paula forrest charm or the far fairy tentacles of it had already reached him and were wrapping around him he knew right there that he would prefer the engagement to ride to have been with her than with his oldtime friend dick  as he emerged from the house to the long hitchingrails under the ancient oaks he looked eagerly for his hostess only dick was there and the stableman although the many saddled horses that stamped in the shade promised possibilities but dick and he rode away alone dick pointed out her horse an alert bay thoroughbred stallion at that under a small australian saddle with steel stirrups and double reined and singlebitted  i dont know her plans he said she hasnt shown up yet but at any rate shell be swimming later well meet her then  graham appreciated and enjoyed the ride although more than once he found himself glancing at his wristwatch to ascertain how far away five oclock might yet be lambing time was at hand and through home field after home field he rode with his host now one and now the other dismounting to turn over onto its feet rotund and glorious shropshire and ramboulletmerino ewes so hopelessly the product of mans selection as to be unable to get off of themselves from their own broad backs once they were down with their four legs helplessly skyaspiring  ive really worked to make the american merino dick was saying to give it the developed leg the strong back the wellsprung rib and the stamina the oldcountry breed lacked the stamina it was too much handreared and manicured  youre doing things big things graham assured him think of shipping rams to idaho that speaks for itself  dick forrests eyes were sparkling as he replied  better than idaho incredible as it may sound and asking forgiveness for bragging the great flocks today of michigan and ohio can trace back to my californiabred ramboullet rams take australia twelve years ago i sold three rams for three hundred each to a visiting squatter after he took them back and demonstrated them he sold them for as many thousand each and ordered a shipload more from me australia will never be the worse for my having been down there they say that lucerne artesian wells refrigerator ships and forrests rams have tripled the wool and mutton production  quite by chance on the way back meeting mendenhall the horse manager they were deflected by him to a wide pasture broken by wooded canyons and studded with oaks to look over a herd of yearling shires that was to be dispatched next morning to the upland pastures and feeding sheds of the miramar hills there were nearly two hundred of them roughcoated beginning to shed largeboned and large for their age  we dont exactly crowd them dick forrest explained but mr mendenhall sees to it that they never lack full nutrition from the time they are foaled up there in the hills where they are going theyll balance their grass with grain this makes them assemble every night at the feeding places and enables the feeders to keep track of them with a minimum of effort ive shipped fifty stallions twoyear olds every year for the past five years to oregon alone theyre sort of standardized you know the people up there know what theyre getting they know my standard so well that theyll buy unsight and unseen  you must cull a lot then graham ventured  and youll see the culls draying on the streets of san francisco dick answered  yes and on the streets of denver mr mendenhall amplified and of los angeles andwhy two years ago in the horsefamine we shipped twenty carloads of fouryear geldings to chicago that averaged seventeen hundred each the lightest were sixteen and there were matched pairs up to nineteen hundred lord lord that was a year for horsepricesblue sky and then some  as mr mendenhall rode away a man on a slenderlegged headtossing palomina rode up to them and was introduced to graham as mr hennessy the ranch veterinary  i heard mrs forrest was looking over the colts he explained to his employer and i rode across to give her a glance at the fawn here shell be riding her in less than a week what horse is she on today  the fop dick replied as if expecting the comment that was prompt as the disapproving shake of mr hennessys head  i can never become converted to women riding stallions muttered the veterinary the fop is dangerous worsethough i take my hat off to his recordhes malicious and vicious shemrs forrest ought to ride him with a muzzlebut hes a striker as well and i dont see how she can put cushions on his hoofs  oh well dick placated she has a bit that is a bit in his mouth and shes not afraid to use it  if he doesnt fall over on her some day mr hennessy grumbled anyway ill breathe easier when she takes to the fawn here now shes a ladys mountall the spirit in the world but nothing vicious shes a sweet mare a sweet mare and shell steady down from her friskiness but shell always be a gay handfulno riding academy proposition  lets ride over dick suggested mrs forrestll have a gay handful in the fop if shes ridden him into that bunch of younglingsits her territory you know he elucidated to graham all the house horses and lighter stock is her affair and she gets grand results i cant understand it myself its like a little girl straying into an experimental laboratory of high explosives and mixing the stuff around any old way and getting more powerful combinations than the graybeard chemists  the three men took a crossranch road for half a mile turned up a wooded canyon where ran a springtrickle of stream and emerged on a wide rolling terrace rich in pasture grahams first glimpse was of a background of many curious yearling and twoyearold colts against which in the middleground he saw his hostess on the back of the bright bay thoroughbred the fop who on hind legs was striking his forefeet in the air and squealing shrilly they reined in their mounts and watched  hell get her yet the veterinary muttered morosely that fop isnt safe  but at that moment paula forrest unaware of her audience with a sharp cry of command and a cavalier thrust of sharp spurs into the fops silken sides checked him down to fourfootedness on the ground and a restless champing quietness  taking chances dick mildly reproached her as the three rode up  oh i can manage him she breathed between tight teeth as with ears back and viciousgleaming eyes the fop bared his teeth in a bite that would have been perilously near to grahams leg had she not reined the brute abruptly away across the neck and driven both spurs solidly into his sides  the fop quivered squealed and for the moment stood still  its the old game the white mans game dick laughed shes not afraid of him and he knows it she outgames him outsavages him teaches him what savagery is in its intimate mood and tense  three times while they looked on ready to whirl their own steeds away if he got out of hand the fop attempted to burst into rampage and three times solidly with careful delicate hand on the bitter bit paula forrest dealt him double spurs in the ribs till he stood sweating frothing fretting beaten and in hand  its the way the white man has always done dick moralized while graham suffered a fluttery shivery sensation of admiration of the beastconquering little lady hes outsavaged the savage the world around dick went on hes outendured him outfilthed him out scalped him outtortured him outeaten himyes outeaten him its a fair wager that the white man in extremis has eaten more of the genus homo than the savage in extremis has eaten  good afternoon paula greeted her guest the ranch veterinary and her husband i think ive got him now lets look over the colts just keep an eye mr graham on his mouth hes a dreadful snapper ride free from him and youll save your leg for old age  now that the fops demonstration was over the colts startled into flight by some impish spirit amongst them galloped and frisked away over the green turf until curious again they circled back halted at gaze and then led by one particularly saucy chestnut filly drew up in half a circle before the riders with alert pricking ears  graham scarcely saw the colts at first he was seeing his protean hostess in a new role would her proteanness never end he wondered as he glanced over the magnificent sweating mastered creature she bestrode mountain lad despite his hugeness was a mildmannered pet beside this squealing biting striking fop who advertised all the spirited viciousness of the most spirited vicious thoroughbred  look at her paula whispered to dick in order not to alarm the saucy chestnut filly isnt she wonderful thats what ive been working for paula turned to evan always they have some fault some miss at the best an approximation rather than an achievement but shes an achievement look at her shes as near right as i shall probably ever get her sire is big chief if you know our racing register he sold for sixty thousand when he was a cripple we borrowed the use of him she was his only get of the season but look at her shes got his chest and lungs i had my choicesmares eligible for the register her dam wasnt eligible but i chose her she was an obstinate old maid but she was the one mare for big chief this is her first foal and she was eighteen years old when she bred but i knew it was there all i had to do was to look at big chief and her and it just had to be there  the dam was only half thoroughbred dick explained  but with a lot of morgan on the other side paula added instantly and a streak along the back of mustang this shall be called nymph even if she has no place in the books shell be my first unimpeachable perfect saddle horsei know itthe kind i likemy dream come true at last  a hoss has four legs one on each corner mr hennessy uttered profoundly  and from five to seven gaits graham took up lightly  and yet i dont care for those manygaited kentuckians paula said quickly except for park work but for california rough roads mountain trails and all the rest give me the fast walk the fox trot the long trot that covers the ground and the not toolong groundcovering gallop of course the closecoupled easy canter but i scarcely call that a gaitits no more than the long lope reduced to the adjustment of wind or rough ground  shes a beauty dick admired his eyes warm in contemplation of the saucy chestnut filly who was daringly close and alertly sniffing of the subdued fops tremulous and nostrildilated muzzle  i prefer my own horses to be near thoroughbred rather than all thoroughbred paula proclaimed the running horse has its place on the track but its too specialized for mere human use  nicely coupled mr hennessy said indicating the nymph short enough for good running and long enough for the long trot ill admit i didnt have any faith in the combination but youve got a grand animal out of it just the same  i didnt have horses when i was a young girl paula said to graham and the fact that i can now not only have them but breed them and mold them to my hearts desire is always too good to be true sometimes i cant believe it myself and have to ride out and look them over to make sure  she turned her head and raised her eyes gratefully to forrest and graham watched them look into each others eyes for a long half minute forrests pleasure in his wifes pleasure in her young enthusiasm and joy of life was clear to grahams observation lucky devil was grahams thought not because of his hosts vast ranch and the success and achievement of it but because of the possession of a wonderwoman who could look unabashed and appreciative into his eyes as the little lady had looked  graham was meditating with skepticism ernestines information that paula forrest was thirtyeight when she turned to the colts and pointed her riding whip at a black yearling nibbling at the spring green  look at that level rump dick she said and those trotting feet and pasterns and to graham rather different from nymphs long wrists arent they but theyre just what i was after she laughed a little with just a shade of annoyance the dam was a bright sorrel almost like a freshminted twentydollar pieceand i did so want a pair out of her of the same color for my own trap well i cant say that i exactly got them although i bred her to a splendid sorrel trotting horse and this is my reward this blackand wait till we get to the brood mares and youll see the other a full brother and mahogany brown im so disappointed  she singled out a pair of dark bays feeding together those are two of guy dillons getbrother you know to lou dillon theyre out of different mares not quite the same bay but arent they splendidly matched and they both have guy dillons coat  she moved her subdued steed on skirting the flank of the herd quietly in order not to alarm it but a number of colts took flight  look at them she cried five there are hackneys look at the lift of their forelegs as they run  ill be terribly disappointed if you dont get a prizewinning four inhand out of them dick praised and brought again the flash of grateful eyes that hurt graham as he noted it  two are out of heavier maressee that one in the middle and the one on the far leftand theres the other three to pick from for the leaders same sire five different dams and a matched and balanced four out of five choices all in the same season is a stroke of luck isnt it  she turned quickly to mr hennessy i can begin to see the ones that will have to sell for polo poniesamong the twoyearolds you can pick them  if mr mendenhall doesnt sell that strawberry roan for a clean fifteen hundred itll be because polo has gone out of fashion the veterinary approved with waxing enthusiasm ive had my eye on them that pale sorrel there you remember his setback give him an extra year and helllook at his couplingwatch him turna cowskin hell turn on a silver dollar give him a year to make up and hell stand a show for the international listen to me ive had my faith in him from the beginning cut out that burlingame crowd when hes ripe ship him straight east  paula nodded and listened to mr hennessys judgment her eyes kindling with his in the warmth of the sight of the abounding young life for which she was responsible  it always hurts though she confessed to graham selling such beauties to have them knocked out on the field so quickly  her sheer absorption in the animals robbed her speech of any hint of affectation or showso much so that dick was impelled to praise her judgment to evan  i can dig through a whole library of horse practice and muddle and mull over the mendelian law until im dizzy like the clod that i am but she is the genius she doesnt have to study law she just knows it in some witchlike intuitional way all she has to do is size up a bunch of mares with her eyes and feel them over a little with her hands and hunt around till she finds the right sires and get pretty nearly what she wants in the resultexcept color eh paul he teased  she showed her laughing teeth in the laugh at her expense in which mr hennessy joined and dick continued look at that filly there we all knew paula was wrong but look at it she bred a rickety old thoroughbred that we wanted to put out of her old age to a standard stallion got a filly bred it back with a thoroughbred bred its filly foal with the same standard again knocked all our prognostications into a cocked hat andwell look at it a world beater polo pony there is one thing we have to take off our hats to her for she doesnt let any woman sentimentality interfere with her culling oh shes coldblooded enough shes as remorseless as any man when it comes to throwing out the undesirables and selecting for what she wants but she hasnt mastered color yet theres where her genius falls down eh paul youll have to put up with duddy and fuddy for a while longer for your trap by the way how is duddy  hes come around she answered thanks to mr hennessy  nothing serious the veterinarian added he was just off his feed a trifle it was more a scare of the stableman than anything else     chapter xiii    from the colt pasture to the swimming tank graham talked with his hostess and rode as nearly beside her as the fops wickedness permitted while dick and hennessy on ahead were deep in ranch business  insomnia has been a handicap all my life she said while she tickled the fop with a spur in order to check a threatened belligerence but i early learned to keep the irritation of it off my nerves and the weight of it off my mind in fact i early came to make a function of it and actually to derive enjoyment from it it was the only way to master a thing i knew would persist as long as i persisted have youof course you havelearned to win through an undertow  yes by never fighting it graham answered his eyes on the spray of color in her cheeks and the tiny beads of sweat that arose from her continuous struggle with the highstrung creature she rode thirty eight he wondered if ernestine had lied paula forrest did not look twentyeight her skin was the skin of a girl with all the delicate finepored and thin transparency of the skin of a girl  exactly she went on by not fighting the undertow by yielding to its downdrag and outdrag and working with it to reach air again dick taught me that trick so with my insomnia if it is excitement from immediate events that holds me back from the city of sleep i yield to it and come quicker to unconsciousness from out the entangling currents i invite my soul to live over again from the same and different angles the things that keep me from unconsciousness  take the swimming of mountain lad yesterday i lived it over last night as i had lived it in reality then i lived it as a spectatoras the girls saw it as you saw it as the cowboy saw it and most of all as my husband saw it then i made up a picture of it many pictures of it from all angles and painted them and framed them and hung them and then a spectator looked at them as if for the first time and i made myself many kinds of spectators from crabbed old maids and lean pantaloons to girls in boarding school and greek boys of thousands of years ago  after that i put it to music i played it on the piano and guessed the playing of it on full orchestras and blaring bands i chanted it i sang itepic lyric comic and after a weary long while of course i slept in the midst of it and knew not that i slept until i awoke at twelve today the last time i had heard the clock strike was six six unbroken hours is a capital prize for me in the sleep lottery  as she finished mr hennessy rode away on a cross path and dick forrest dropped back to squire his wife on the other side  will you sport a bet evan he queried  id like to hear the terms of it first was the answer  cigars against cigars that you cant catch paula in the tank inside ten minutesno inside five for i remember youre some swimmer  oh give him a chance dick paula cried generously ten minutes will worry him  but you dont know him dicked argued and you dont value my cigars i tell you he is a swimmer hes drowned kanakas and you know what that means  perhaps i should reconsider maybe hell slash a killing crawlstroke at me before ive really started tell me his history and prizes  ill just tell you one thing they still talk of it in the marquesas it was the big hurricane of 1892 he did forty miles in fortyfive hours and only he and one other landed on the land and they were all kanakas he was the only white man yet he outendured and drowned the last kanaka of them  i thought you said there was one other paula interrupted  she was a woman dick answered he drowned the last kanaka  and the woman was then a white woman paula insisted  graham looked quickly at her and although she had asked the question of her husband her head turned to the turn of his head so that he found her eyes meeting his straightly and squarely in interrogation graham held her gaze with equal straightness as he answered she was a kanaka  a queen if you please dick took up a queen out of the ancient chief stock she was queen of huahoa  was it the chief stock that enabled her to outendure the native men paula asked or did you help her  i rather think we helped each other toward the end graham replied we were both out of our heads for short spells and long spells sometimes it was one sometimes the other that was all in we made the land at sunsetthat is a wall of iron coast with the surf bursting skyhigh she took hold of me and clawed me in the water to get some sense in me you see i wanted to go in which would have meant finish  she got me to understand that she knew where she was that the current set westerly along shore and in two hours would drift us abreast of a spot where we could land i swear i either slept or was unconscious most of those two hours and i swear she was in one state or the other when i chanced to come to and noted the absence of the roar of the surf then it was my turn to claw and maul her back to consciousness it was three hours more before we made the sand we slept where we crawled out of the water next mornings sun burnt us awake and we crept into the shade of some wild bananas found fresh water and went to sleep again next i awoke it was night i took another drink and slept through till morning she was still asleep when the bunch of kanakas hunting wild goats from the next valley found us  ill wager for a man who drowned a whole kanaka crew it was you who did the helping dick commented  she must have been forever grateful paula challenged her eyes directly on grahams dont tell me she wasnt young wasnt beautiful wasnt a golden brown young goddess  her mother was the queen of huahoa graham answered her father was a greek scholar and an english gentleman they were dead at the time of the swim and nomare was queen herself she was young she was beautiful as any woman anywhere in the world may be beautiful thanks to her fathers skin she as not golden brown she was tawny golden but youve heard the story undoubtedly  he broke off with a look of question to dick who shook his head  calls and cries and splashings of water from beyond a screen of trees warned them that they were near the tank  youll have to tell me the rest of the story some time paula said  dick knows it i cant see why he hasnt told you  she shrugged her shoulders  perhaps because hes never had the time or the provocation  god wot its had wide circulation graham laughed for know that i was once morganaticor whatever you call itking of the cannibal isles or of a paradise of a polynesian isle at any rateby a purple wave on an opal beach in the hush of the mahim woods he hummed carelessly in conclusion and swung off from his horse  the white moth to the closing vine the bee to the opening clover she hummed another line of the song while the fop nearly got his teeth into her leg and she straightened him out with the spur and waited for dick to help her off and tie him  cigarsim in on thatyou cant catch her bert wainwright called from the top of the high dive forty feet above wait a minute im coming  and come he did in a swan dive that was almost professional and that brought handclapping approval from the girls  a sweet dive balanced beautifully graham told him as he emerged from the tank  bert tried to appear unconscious of the praise failed and to pass it off plunged into the wager  i dont know what kind of a swimmer you are graham he said but i just want in with dick on the cigars  me too me too chorused ernestine and lute and rita  boxes of candy gloves or any truck you care to risk ernestine added  but i dont know mrs forrests records either graham protested after having taken on the bets however if in five minutes  ten minutes paula said and to start from opposite ends of the tank is that fair any touch is a catch graham looked his hostess over with secret approval she was clad not in the single white silk slip she evidently wore only for girl parties but in a coquettish imitation of the prevailing fashion mode a suit of changeable light blue and green silkalmost the color of the pool the skirt slightly above the knees whose roundedness he recognized with long stockings to match and tiny bathing shoes bound on with crossed ribbons on her head was a jaunty swimming cap no jauntier than herself when she urged the ten minutes in place of five  rita wainwright held the watch while graham walked down to the other end of the hundredandfiftyfoot tank  paula youll be caught if you take any chances dick warned evan graham is a real fish man  i guess paulall show him a few even without the pipe bert bragged loyally and ill bet she can outdive him  there you lose dick answered i saw the rock he dived from at huahoa that was after his time and after the death of queen nomare he was only a youngstertwentytwo he had to be to do it it was off the peak of the pauwi rockone hundred and twentyeight feet by triangulation and he couldnt do it legitimately or technically with a swandive because he had to clear two lower ledges while he was in the air the upper ledge of the two by their own traditions was the highest the best of the kanakas had ever dared since their traditions began well he did it he became tradition as long as the kanakas of huahoa survive he will remain traditionget ready rita start on the full minute  its almost a shame to play tricks on so reputable a swimmer paula confided to them as she faced her guest down the length of the tank and while both waited the signal  he may get you before you can turn the trick dick warned again and then to bert with just a shade of anxiety is it working all right because if it isnt paula will have a bad five seconds getting out of it  all ok bert assured i went in myself the pipe is working theres plenty of air  ready rita called go  graham ran toward their end like a footracer while paula darted up the high dive by the time she had gained the top platform his hands and feet were on the lower rungs when he was halfway up she threatened a dive compelling him to cease from climbing and to get out on the twentyfoot platform ready to follow her to the water whereupon she laughed down at him and did not dive time is passing the precious seconds are ticking off ernestine chanted  when he started to climb paula again chased him to the halfway platform with a threat to dive but not many seconds did graham waste his next start was determined and paula poised for her dive could not send him scuttling back he raced upward to gain the thirtyfoot platform before she should dive and she was too wise to linger out into space she launched head back arms bent hands close to chest legs straight and close together her body balanced horizontally on the air as it fell outward and downward  oh you annette kellerman bert wamwrights admiring cry floated up  graham ceased pursuit to watch the completion of the dive and saw his hostess a few feet above the water bend her head forward straighten out her arms and lock the hands to form the arch before her head and so shifting the balance of her body change it from the horizontal to the perfect watercleaving angle  the moment she entered the water he swung out on the thirtyfoot platform and waited from this height he could make out her body beneath the surface swimming a full stroke straight for the far end of the tank not till then did he dive he was confident that he could outspeed her and his dive far and flat entered him in the water twenty feet beyond her entrance  but at the instant he was in dick dipped two flat rocks into the water and struck them together this was the signal for paula to change her course graham heard the concussion and wondered he broke surface in the full swing of the crawl and went down the tank to the far end at a killing pace he pulled himself out and watched the surface of the tank a burst of handclapping from the girls drew his eyes to the little lady drawing herself out of the tank at the other end  again he ran down the side of the tank and again she climbed the scaffold but this time his wind and endurance enabled him to cut down her lead so that she was driven to the twentyfoot platform she took no time for posturing or swanning but tilted immediately off in a stiff dive angling toward the west side of the tank almost they were in the air at the same time in the water and under it he could feel against his face and arms the agitation left by her progress but she led into the deep shadow thrown by the low afternoon sun where the water was so dark he could see nothing  when he touched the side of the tank he came up she was not in sight he drew himself out panting and stood ready to dive in at the first sign of her but there were no signs  seven minutes rita called and a half  eight and a half  and no paula forrest broke surface graham refused to be alarmed because he could see no alarm on the faces of the others  i lose he announced at ritas nine minutes  shes been under over two minutes and youre all too blessed calm about it to get me excited he said ive still a minutemaybe i dont lose he added quickly as he stepped off feet first into the tank  as he went down he turned over and explored the cement wall of tank with his hands midway possibly ten feet under the surface he estimated his hands encountered an opening in the wall he felt about learned it was unscreened and boldly entered almost before he was in he found he could come up but he came up slowly breaking surface in pitchy blackness and feeling about him without splashing  his fingers touched a cool smooth arm that shrank convulsively at contact while the possessor of it cried sharply with the startle of fright he held on tightly and began to laugh and paula laughed with him a line from the first chanty flashed into his consciousness hearing her laugh in the gloom greatly i loved her  you did frighten me when you touched me she said you came without a sound and i was a thousand miles away dreaming  what graham asked  well honestly i had just got an idea for a gowna dusty musty mulberrywine velvet with long close lines and heavy tarnished gold borders and cords and things and the only jewelery a ringone enormous pigeonblood ruby that dick gave me years ago when we sailed the all away  is there anything you dont do he laughed  she joined with him and their mirth sounded strangely hollow in the pent and echoing dark  who told you she next asked  no one after you had been under two minutes i knew it had to be something like this and i came exploring  it was dicks idea he had it built into the tank afterward you will find him full of whimsies he delighted in scaring old ladies into fits by stepping off into the tank with their sons or grandsons and hiding away in here but after one or two nearly died of shockold ladies i meanhe put me up as today to fooling hardier persons like yourselfoh he had another accident there was a miss coghlan friend of ernestine a little seminary girl they artfully stood her right beside the pipe that leads out and dick went off the high dive and swam in here to the inside end of the pipe after several minutes by the time she was in collapse over his drowning he spoke up the pipe to her in most horrible sepulchral tones and right there miss coghlan fainted dead away  she must have been a weak sister graham commented while he struggled with a wanton desire for a match so that he could strike it and see how paula forrest looked paddling there beside him to keep afloat  she had a fair measure of excuse paula answered she was a young thingeighteen and she had a sort of schoolgirl infatuation for dick they all get it you see hes such a boy when hes playing that they cant realize that hes a hardbitten hardworking deep thinking mature elderly benedict the embarrassing thing was that the little girl when she was first revived and before she could gather her wits exposed all her secret heart dicks face was a study while she babbled her  wellgoing to stay there all night bert wainwrights voice came down the pipe sounding megaphonically close  heavens graham sighed with relief for he had startled and clutched paulas arm thats the time i got my fright the little maiden is avenged also at last i know what a leadpipe cinch is  and its time we started for the outer world she suggested its not the coziest gossiping place in the world shall i go first  by all meansand ill be right behind although its a pity the water isnt phosphorescent then i could follow your incandescent heel like that chap byron wrote aboutdont you remember  he heard her appreciative gurgle in the dark and then her well im going now  unable to see the slightest glimmer nevertheless from the few sounds she made he knew she had turned over and gone down head first and he was not beyond visioning with inner sight the graceful way in which she had done itan anything but graceful feat as the average swimming woman accomplishes it  somebody gave it away to you was berts prompt accusal when graham rose to the surface of the tank and climbed out  and you were the scoundrel who rapped stone under water graham challenged if id lost id have protested the bet it was a crooked game a conspiracy and competent counsel i am confident would declare it a felony its a case for the district attorney  but you won ernestine cried  i certainly did and therefore i shall not prosecute you nor any one of your crooked gangif the bets are paid promptly let me see you owe me a box of cigars  one cigar sir  a box a box cross tag paula cried lets play crosstag youre it  suiting action to word she tagged graham on the shoulder and plunged into the tank before he could follow bert seized him whirled him in a circle was himself tagged and tagged dick before he could escape and while dick pursued his wife through the tank and bert and graham sought a chance to cross the girls fled up the scaffold and stood in an enticing row on the fifteenfoot diving platform     chapter xiv    an indifferent swimmer donald ware had avoided the afternoon sport in the tank but after dinner somewhat to the irritation of graham the violinist monopolized paula at the piano new guests with the casual expectedness of the big house had drifted ina lawyer by name adolph well who had come to confer with dick over some big water right suit jeremy braxton straight from mexico dicks general superintendent of the harvest group which bonanza according to jeremy braxton was as unpetering as ever edwin ohay a redheaded irish musical and dramatic critic and chauncey bishop editor and owner of the san francisco dispatch and a member of dicks class and frat as graham gleaned  dick had started a boisterous gambling game which he called horrible fives wherein although excitement ran high and players plunged the limit was ten cents and on a lucky coup the transient banker might win or lose as high as ninety cents such coup requiring at least ten minutes to play out this game went on at a big table at the far end of the room accompanied by much owing and borrowing of small sums and an incessant clamor for change  with nine players the game was crowded and graham rather than draw cards casually and occasionally backed ernestines cards the while he glanced down the long room at the violinist and paula forrest absorbed in beethoven symphonies and delibes ballets jeremy braxton was demanding raising the limit to twenty cents and dick the heaviest loser as he averred to the tune of four dollars and sixty cents was plaintively suggesting the starting of a kitty in order that some one should pay for the lights and the sweeping out of the place in the morning when graham with a profound sigh at the loss of his last beta nickel which he had had to pay doubleannounced to ernestine that he was going to take a turn around the room to change his luck  i prophesied you would she told him under her breath  what he asked  she glanced significantly in paulas direction  just for that i simply must go down there now he retorted  cant dast decline a dare she taunted  if it were a dare i wouldnt dare do it  in which case i dare you she took up  he shook his head i had already made up my mind to go right down there to that one spot and cut that fiddler out of the running you cant dare me out of it at this late stage besides theres mr ohay waiting for you to make your bet  ernestine rashly laid ten cents and scarcely knew whether she won or lost so intent was she on watching graham go down the room although she did know that bert wainwright had not been unobservant of her gaze and its direction on the other hand neither she nor bert nor any other at the table knew that dicks quickglancing eyes sparkling with merriment while his lips chaffed absurdities that made them all laugh had missed no portion of the side play  ernestine but little taller than paula although hinting of a plus roundness to come was a sunhealthy clear blonde her skin sprayed with the almost transparent flush of maidenhood at eighteen to the eye it seemed almost that one could see through the pink daintiness of fingers hand wrist and forearm neck and cheek and to this delicious transparency of rose and pink was added a warmth of tone that did not escape dicks eyes as he glimpsed her watch evan graham move down the length of room dick knew and classified her wild imagined dream or guess though the terms of it were beyond his divination  what she saw was what she imagined was the princely walk of graham the high light blooded carriage of his head the delightful carelessness of the goldburnt sunsanded hair that made her fingers ache to be into with caresses she for the first time knew were possible of her fingers  nor did paula during an interval of discussion with the violinist in which she did not desist from stating her criticism of ohays latest criticism of harold bauer fail to see and keep her eyes on grahams progress she too noted with pleasure his grace of movement the high light poise of head the careless hair the clear bronze of the smooth cheeks the splendid forehead the long gray eyes with the hint of drooping lids and boyish sullenness that fled before the smile with which he greeted her  she had observed that smile often since her first meeting with him it was an irresistible smile a smile that lighted the eyes with the radiance of good fellowship and that crinkled the corners into tiny genial lines it was provocative of smiles for she found herself smiling a silent greeting in return as she continued stating to ware her grievance against ohays toocomplacent praise of bauer  but her engagement was tacitly with donald ware at the piano and with no more than passing speech she was off and away in a series of hungarian dances that made graham marvel anew as he loafed and smoked in a windowseat  he marveled at the proteanness of her at visions of those nimble fingers guiding and checking the fop swimming and paddling in submarine crypts and falling in swanlike flight through forty feet of air locking just above the water to make the divers head protecting arch of arm  in decency he lingered but few minutes returned to the gamblers and put the entire table in a roar with a wellacted yiddishers chagrin and passion at losing entire nickels every few minutes to the fortunate and chesty mine superintendent from mexico  later when the game of horrible fives broke up bert and lute desten spoiled the adagio from beethovens sonata pathetique by exaggeratedly ragging to it in what dick immediately named the loving slowdrag till paula broke down in a gale of laughter and ceased from playing  new groupings occurred a bridge table formed with weil rita bishop and dick donald ware was driven from his monopoly of paula by the young people under the leadership of jeremy braxton while graham and ohay paired off in a windowseat and ohay talked shop  after a time in which all at the piano had sung hawaiian hulas paula sang alone to her own accompaniment she sang several german lovesongs in succession although it was merely for the group about her and not for the room and evan graham almost to his delight decided that at last he had found a weakness in her she might be a magnificent pianist horsewoman diver and swimmer but it was patent despite her singing throat that she was not a magnificent singer this conclusion he was quickly compelled to modify a singer she was a consummate singer weakness was only comparative after all she lacked the magnificent voice it was a sweet voice a rich voice with the same warmfibered thrill of her laugh but the volume so essential to the great voice was not there ear and voice seemed effortlessly true and in her singing were feeling artistry training intelligence but volumeit was scarcely a fair average was his judgment  but qualitythere he halted it was a womans voice it was haunted with richness of sex in it resided all the temperament in the world with all the restraint of discipline was the next step of his analysis he had to admire the way she refused to exceed the limitations of her voice in this she achieved triumphs  and while he nodded absently to ohays lecturette on the state of theopera graham fell to wondering if paula forrest thus so completely the mistress of her temperament might not be equally mistress of her temperament in the deeper passional ways there was a challenge therebased on curiosity he conceded but only partly so based and over and beyond and deeper and far beneath a challenge to a man made in the immemorial image of man  it was a challenge that bade him pause and even look up and down the great room and to the treetrunked roof far above and to the flying gallery hung with the spoils of the world and to dick forrest master of all this material achievement and husband of the woman playing bridge just as he worked with all his heart his laughter ringing loud as he caught rita in renig for graham had the courage not to shun the ultimate connotations behind the challenge in his speculations lurked the woman paula forrest was splendidly deliciously woman all woman unusually woman from the blow between the eyes of his first striking sight of her swimming the great stallion in the pool she had continued to witchride his mans imagination he was anything but unused to women and his general attitude was that of being tired of the mediocre sameness of them to chance upon the unusual woman was like finding the great pearl in a lagoon fished out by a generation of divers  glad to see youre still alive paula laughed to him a little later  she was prepared to depart with lute for bed a second bridge quartet had been arrangedernestine bert jeremy braxton and graham while ohay and bishop were already deep in a bout of twohanded pinochle  hes really a charming irishman when he keeps off his one string paula went on  which i think i am fair is music graham said  and on music he is insufferable lute observed its the only thing he doesnt know the least thing about he drives one frantic  never mind paula soothed in gurgling tones you will all be avenged dick just whispered to me to get the philosophers up to morrow night you know how they talk music a musical critic is their awful prey  terrence said the other night that there was no closed season on musical critics lute contributed  terrence and aaron will drive him to drink paula laughed her joy of anticipation and dar hyal alone with his blastic theory of art can specially apply it to music to the confutation of all the first words and the last he doesnt believe a thing he says about blastism any more than was he serious when he danced the other evening its his bit of fun hes such a deep philosopher that he has to get his fun somehow  and if ohay ever locks horns with terrence lute prophesied i can see terrence tucking arm in arm with him leading him down to the stag room and heating the argument with the absentestminded variety of drinks that ever ohay accomplished  which means a very sick ohay next day paula continued her gurgles of anticipation  ill tell him to do it exclaimed lute  you mustnt think were all bad paula protested to graham its just the spirit of the house dick likes it hes always playing jokes himself he relaxes that way ill wager right now it was dicks suggestion to lute and for lute to carry out for terrence to get ohay into the stag room now fess up lute  well i will say lute answered with meticulous circumspection that the idea was not entirely original with me  at this point ernestine joined them and appropriated graham with  were all waiting for you weve cut and you and i are partners besides paulas making her sleep noise so say good night and let her go  paula had left for bed at ten oclock not till one did the bridge break up dick his arm about ernestine in brotherly fashion said good night to graham where one of the divided ways led to the watch tower and continued on with his pretty sisterinlaw toward her quarters  just a tip ernestine he said at parting his gray eyes frankly and genially on hers but his voice sufficiently serious to warn her  what have i been doing now she pouted laughingly  nothing as yet but dont get started or youll be laying up a sore heart for yourself youre only a kid yeteighteen and a darned nice likable kid at that enough to make most any man sit up and take notice but evan graham is not most any man  oh i can take care of myself she blurted out in a fling of quick resentment  but listen to me just the same there comes a time in the affairs of a girl when the lovebee gets a buzzing with a very loud hum in her pretty noddle then is the time she mustnt make a mistake and start in loving the wrong man you havent fallen in love with evan graham yet and all you have to do is just not to fall in love with him hes not for you nor for any young thing hes an oldster an ancient and possibly has forgotten more about love romantic love and young things than youll ever learn in a dozen lives if he ever marries again  again ernestine broke in  why hes been a widower my dear for over fifteen years  then what of it she demanded defiantly  just this dick continued quietly hes lived the youngthing romance and lived it wonderfully and from the fact that in fifteen years he has not married again means  that hes never recovered from his loss ernestine interpolated but thats no proof  means that hes got over his apprenticeship to wild young romance dick held on steadily all you have to do is look at him and realize that he has not lacked opportunities and that on occasion some very fine women real wise women mature women have given him footraces that tested his wind and endurance but so far theyve not succeeded in catching him and as for young things you know how filled the world is with them for a man like him think it over and just keep your heartthoughts away from him if you dont let your heart start to warm toward him it will save your heart from a grievous chill later on  he took one of her hands in his and drew her against him an arm soothingly about her shoulder for several minutes of silence dick idly speculated on what her thoughts might be  you know we hardbitten old fellows he began halfapologetically halfhumorously  but she made a restless movement of distaste and cried out  are the only ones worth while the young men are all youngsters and thats whats the matter with them theyre full of life and coltish spirits and dance and song but theyre not serious theyre not big theyre notoh they dont give a girl that sense of all wiseness of proven strength of of well of manhood  i understand dick murmured but please do not forget to glance at the other side of the shield you glowing young creatures of women must affect the old fellows in precisely similar ways they may look on you as toys playthings delightful things to whom to teach a few fine foolishnesses but not as comrades not as equals not as sharersfull sharers life is something to be learned they have learned it some of it but young things like you ernestine have you learned any of it yet  tell me she asked abruptly almost tragically about this wild young romance about this young thing when he was young fifteen years ago  fifteen dick replied promptly eighteen they were married three years before she died in factfigure it out for yourselfthey were actually married by a church of england dominie and living in wedlock about the same moment that you were squalling your first postbirth squalls in this world  yes yesgo on she urged nervously what was she like  she was a resplendent goldenbrown or tangolden halfcaste a polynesian queen whose mother had been a queen before her whose father was an oxford man an english gentleman and a real scholar her name was nomare she was queen of huahoa she was barbaric he was young enough to outbarbaric her there was nothing sordid in their marriage he was no penniless adventurer she brought him her island kingdom and forty thousand subjects he brought to that island his fortuneand it was no inconsiderable fortune he built a palace that no south sea island ever possessed before or will ever possess again it was the real thing grassthatched handhewn beams that were lashed with cocoanut sennit and all the rest it was rooted in the island it sprouted out of the island it belonged although he fetched hopkins out from new york to plan it  heavens they had their own royal yacht their mountain house their canoe housethe last a veritable palace in itself i know i have been at great feasts in itthough it was after their time nomare was dead and no one knew where graham was and a king of collateral line was the ruler  i told you he outbarbaricked her their dinner service was gold oh whats the use in telling any more he was only a boy she was halfenglish halfpolynesian and a really and truly queen they were flowers of their races they were a pair of wonderful children they lived a fairy tale and well ernestine the years have passed and evan graham has passed from the realm of the young thing it will be a remarkable woman that will ever infatuate him now besides hes practically broke though he didnt wastrel his money as much misfortune and more than anything else  paula would be more his kind ernestine said meditatively  yes indeed dick agreed paula or any woman as remarkable as paula would attract him a thousand times more than all the sweet young lovely things like you in the world we oldsters have our standards you know  and ill have to put up with the youngsters ernestine sighed  in the meantime yes he chuckled remembering always that you too in time may grow into the remarkable mature woman who can outfoot a man like evan in a footrace of love for possession  but i shall be married long before that she pouted  which will be your good fortune my dear and now good night and you are not angry with me  she smiled pathetically and shook her head put up her lips to be kissed then said as they parted  i promise not to be angry if you will only show me the way that in the end will lead me to ancient graybeards like you and graham  dick forrest turning off lights as he went penetrated the library and while selecting half a dozen reference volumes on mechanics and physics smiled as if pleased with himself at recollection of the interview with his sisterinlaw he was confident that he had spoken in time and not a moment too soon but half way up the bookconcealed spiral staircase that led to his work room a remark of ernestine echoing in his consciousness made him stop from very suddenness to lean his shoulder against the wallpaula would be more his kind  silly ass he laughed aloud continuing on his way and married a dozen years  nor did he think again about it until in bed on his sleeping porch he took a glance at his barometers and thermometers and prepared to settle down to the solution of the electrical speculation that had been puzzling him then it was as he peered across the great court to his wifes dark wing and dark sleeping porch to see if she were still waking that ernestines remark again echoed he dismissed it with a silly ass of scorn lighted a cigarette and began running with trained eye the indexes of the books and marking the pages sought with matches     chapter xv    it was long after ten in the morning when graham straying about restlessly and wondering if paula forrest ever appeared before the middle of the day wandered into the music room despite the fact that he was a several days guest in the big house so big was it that the music room was new territory it was an exquisite room possibly thirtyfive by sixty and rising to a lofty trussed ceiling where a warm golden light was diffused from a skylight of yellow glass red tones entered largely into the walls and furnishing and the place to him seemed to hold the hush of music  graham was lazily contemplating a keith with its inevitable triumph of sungloried atmosphere and twilightshadowed sheep when from the tail of his eye he saw his hostess come in from the far entrance again the sight of her that was a picture gave him the little catchbreath of gasp she was clad entirely in white and looked very young and quite tall in the sweeping folds of a holoku of elaborate simplicity and apparent shapelessness he knew the holoku in the home of its origin where on the lanais of hawaii it gave charm to a plain woman and doublefolded the charm of a charming woman  while they smiled greeting across the room he was noting the set of her body the poise of head and frankness of eyesall of which seemed articulate with a friendly comradely hello friends at least such was the form grahams fancy took as she came toward him  you made a mistake with this room he said gravely  no dont say that but how  it should have been longer much longer twice as long at least  why she demanded with a disapproving shake of head while he delighted in the girlish color in her cheeks that gave the lie to her thirtyeight years  because then he answered you should have had to walk twice as far this morning and my pleasure of watching you would have been correspondingly increased ive always insisted that the holoku is the most charming garment ever invented for women  then it was my holoku and not i she retorted i see you are like dickalways with a string on your compliments and lo when we poor sillies start to nibble back goes the compliment dragging at the end of the string  now i want to show you the room she hurried on closing his disclaimer dick gave me a free hand with it its all mine you see even to its proportions  and the pictures  i selected them she nodded every one of them and loved them onto the walls myself although dick did quarrel with me over that vereschagin he agreed on the two millets and the corot over there and on that isabey and even conceded that some vereschagins might do in a music room but not that particular vereschagin hes jealous for our local artists you see he wanted more of them wanted to show his appreciation of home talent  i dont know your pacific coast mens work very well graham said tell me about them show me thatof course thats a keith there but whose is that next one its beautiful  a mccomas she was answering and graham with a pleasant satisfaction was settling himself to a halfhours talk on pictures when donald ware entered with questing eyes that lighted up at sight of the little lady  his violin was under his arm and he crossed to the piano in a brisk businesslike way and proceeded to lay out music  were going to work till lunch paula explained to graham he swears im getting abominably rusty and i think hes half right well see you at lunch you can stay if you care of course but i warn you its really going to be work and were going swimming this afternoon four oclock at the tank dick says also he says hes got a new song hes going to sing thenwhat time is it mr ware  ten minutes to eleven the musician answered briefly with a touch of sharpness  youre ahead of timethe engagement was for eleven and till eleven youll have to wait sir i must run and see dick first i havent said good morning to him yet  well paula knew her husbands hours scribbled secretly in the back of the notebook that lay always on the reading stand by her couch were hieroglyphic notes that reminded her that he had coffee at sixthirty might possibly be caught in bed with proofsheets or books till eight fortyfive if not out riding was inaccessible between nine and ten dictating correspondence to blake was inaccessible between ten and eleven conferring with managers and foremen while bonbright the assistant secretary took down like any court reporter every word uttered by all parties in the rapidfire interviews  at eleven unless there were unexpected telegrams or business she could usually count on finding dick alone for a space although invariably busy passing the secretaries room the click of a typewriter informed her that one obstacle was removed in the library the sight of mr bonbright hunting a book for mr manson the shorthorn manager told her that dicks hour with his head men was over  she pressed the button that swung aside a section of filled book shelves and revealed the tiny spiral of steel steps that led up to dicks work room at the top a similar pivoting section of shelves swung obediently to her press of button and let her noiselessly into his room a shade of vexation passed across her face as she recognized jeremy braxtons voice she paused in indecision neither seeing nor being seen  if we flood we flood the mine superintendent was saying it will cost a mintyes half a dozen mintsto pump out again and its a damned shame to drown the old harvest that way  but for this last year the books show that weve worked at a positive loss paula heard dick take up every petty bandit from huerta down to the last peon whos stolen a horse has gouged us its getting too stifftaxes extraordinarybandits revolutionists and federals we could survive it if only the end were in sight but we have no guarantee that this disorder may not last a dozen or twenty years  just the same the old harvestthink of flooding her the superintendent protested  and think of villa dick replied with a sharp laugh the bitterness of which did not escape paula if he wins he says hes going to divide all the land among the peons the next logical step will be the mines how much do you think weve coughed up to the constitutionalists in the past twelvemonth  over a hundred and twenty thousand braxton answered promptly not counting that fifty thousand cold bullion to torenas before he retreated he jumped his army at guaymas and headed for europe with iti wrote you all that  if we keep the workings afloat jeremy theyll go on gouging gouge without end amen i think wed better flood if we can make wealth more efficiently than those rapscallions let us show them that we can destroy wealth with the same facility  thats what i tell them and they smile and repeat that such and such a free will offering under exigent circumstances would be very acceptable to the revolutionary chiefsmeaning themselves the big chiefs never finger one peso in ten of it good lord i show them what weve done steady work for five thousand peons wages raised from ten centavos a day to a hundred and ten i show them peonstencentavo men when we took them and fivepeso men when i showed them and the same old smile and the same old itching palm and the same old acceptability of a free will offering from us to the sacred cause of the revolution by god old diaz was a robber but he was a decent robber i said to arranzo if we shut down heres five thousand mexicans out of a jobwhatll you do with them and arranzo smiled and answered me pat do with them he said why put guns in their hands and march em down to take mexico city  in imagination paula could see dicks disgusted shrug of shoulders as she heard him say  the curse of it isthat the stuff is there and that were the only fellows that can get it out the mexicans cant do it they havent the brains all theyve got is the guns and theyre making us shell out more than we make theres only one thing for us jeremy well forget profits for a year or so lay off the men and just keep the engineer force on and the pumping going  i threw that into arranzo jeremy braxtons voice boomed and what was his comeback that if we laid off the peons hed see to it that the engineers laid off too and the mine could flood and be damned to usno he didnt say that last he just smiled but the smile meant the same thing for two cents id awrung his yellow neck except that thered have been another patriot in his boots and in my office next day proposing a stiffer gouge  so arranzo got his bit and on top of it before he went across to join the main bunch around juarez he let his men run off three hundred of our mulesthirty thousand dollars worth of muleflesh right there after id sweetened him too the yellow skunk  who is revolutionary chief in our diggings right now paula heard her husband ask with one of his abrupt shifts that she knew of old time tokened his drawing together the many threads of a situation and proceeding to action  raoul bena  whats his rank  colonelhes got about seventy ragamuffins  what did he do before he quit work  sheepherder  very well dicks utterance was quick and sharp youve got to playact become a patriot hike back as fast as god will let you sweeten this raoul bena hell see through your play or hes no mexican sweeten him and tell him youll make him a generala second villa  lord lord yes but how jeremy braxton demanded  by putting him at the head of an army of five thousand lay off the men make him make them volunteer were safe because huerta is doomed tell him youre a real patriot give each man a rifle well stand that for a last gouge and it will prove you a patriot promise every man his job back when the war is over let them and raoul bena depart with your blessing keep on the pumping force only and if we cut out profits for a year or so at the same time we are cutting down losses and perhaps we wont have to flood old harvest after all  paula smiled to herself at dicks solution as she stole back down the spiral on her way to the music room she was depressed but not by the harvest group situation ever since her marriage there had always been trouble in the working of the mexican mines dick had inherited her depression was due to her having missed her morning greeting to him but this depression vanished at meeting graham who had lingered with ware at the piano and who at her coming was evidencing signs of departure  dont run away she urged stay and witness a spectacle of industry that should nerve you up to starting on that book dick has been telling me about     chapter xvi    on dicks face at lunch there was no sign of trouble over the harvest group nor could anybody have guessed that jeremy braxtons visit had boded anything less gratifying than a report of unfailing earnings although adolph weil had gone on the early morning train which advertised that the business which had brought him had been transacted with dick at some unheard of hour graham discovered a greater company than ever at the table besides a mrs tully who seemed a stout and elderly society matron and whom graham could not make out there were three new men of whose identity he gleaned a little a mr gulhuss state veterinary a mr deacon a portrait painter of evident note on the coast and a captain lester then captain of a pacific mail liner who had sailed skipper for dick nearly twenty years before and who had helped dick to his navigation  the meal was at its close and the superintendent was glancing at his watch when dick said  jeremy i want to show you what ive been up to well go right now youll have time on your way to the train  let us all go paula suggested and make a party of it im dying to see it myself dicks been so obscure about it  sanctioned by dicks nod she was ordering machines and saddle horses the next moment  what is it graham queried when she had finished  oh one of dicks stunts hes always after something new this is an invention he swears it will revolutionize farmingthat is small farming i have the general idea of it but i havent seen it set up yet it was ready a week ago but there was some delay about a cable or something concerning an adjustment  theres billions in it if it works dick smiled over the table billions for the farmers of the world and perhaps a trifle of royalty for me if it works  but what is it ohay asked music in the dairy barns to make the cows give down their milk more placidly  every farmer his own plowman while sitting on his front porch dick baffled back in fact the laboreliminating intermediate stage between soil production and sheer laboratory production of food but wait till you see it gulhuss this is where i kill my own business if it works for it will do away with the one horse of every tenacre farmer between here and jericho  in ranch machines and on saddle animals the company was taken a mile beyond the dairy center where a level field was fenced squarely off and contained as dick announced just precisely ten acres  behold he said the oneman and nohorse farm where the farmer sits on the porch please imagine the porch  in the center of the field was a stout steel pole at least twenty feet in height and guyed very low  from a drum on top of the pole a thin wire cable ran to the extreme edge of the field and was attached to the steering lever of a small gasoline tractor about the tractor two mechanics fluttered at command from dick they cranked the motor and started it on its way  this is the porch dick said just imagine were all that future farmer sitting in the shade and reading the morning paper while the manless horseless plowing goes on  alone unguided the drum on the head of the pole in the center winding up the cable the tractor at the circumference permitted by the cable turned a single furrow as it described a circle or rather an inward trending spiral about the field  no horse no driver no plowman nothing but the farmer to crank the tractor and start it on its way dick exulted as the uncanny mechanism turned up the brown soil and continued unguided ever spiraling toward the fields center plow harrow roll seed fertilize cultivate harvestall from the front porch and where the farmer can buy juice from a power company all he or his wife will have to do is press the button and he to his newspaper and she to her piecrust  all you need now to make it absolutely perfect graham praised is to square the circle  yes mr gulhuss agreed as it is a circle in a square field loses some acreage  grahams face advertised a mental arithmetic trance for a minute when he announced loses roughly three acres out of every ten  sure dick concurred but the farmer has to have his front porch somewhere on his ten acres and the front porch represents the house the barn the chicken yard and the various outbuildings very well let him get tradition out of his mind and instead of building these things in the center of his ten acres let him build them on the three acres of fringe and let him plant his fruit and shade trees and berry bushes on the fringe when you come to consider it the traditionary method of erecting the buildings in the center of a rectangular ten acres compels him to plow around the center in broken rectangles  gulhuss nodded enthusiastically sure and theres always the roadway from the center out to the county road or right of way that breaks the efficiency of his plowing break ten acres into the consequent smaller rectangles and its expensive cultivation  wish navigation was as automatic was captain lesters contribution  or portrait painting laughed rita wainwright with a significant glance at mr deacon  or musical criticism lute remarked with no glance at all but with a pointedness of present company that brought from ohay  or just being a charming young woman  what price for the outfit jeremy braxton asked  right now we could manufacture and lay down at a proper profit for five hundred if the thing came into general use with up to date largescale factory methods three hundred but say five hundred and write off fifteen per cent for interest and constant it would cost the farmer seventy dollars a year what tenacre farmer on two hundreddollar land who keeps books can keep a horse for seventy dollars a year and on top of that it would save him in labor personal or hired at the abjectest minimum two hundred dollars a year  but what guides it rita asked  the drum on the post the drum is graduated for the complete radius which took some tall figuring i assure youand the cable winding around the drum and shortening draws the tractor in toward the center  there are lots of objections to its general introduction even among small farmers gulhuss said  dick nodded affirmation  sure he replied i have over forty noted down and classified and ive as many more for the machine itself if the thing is a success it will take a long time to perfect it and introduce it  graham found himself divided between watching the circling tractor and casting glances at the picture paula forrest was on her mount it was her first day on the fawn which was the palomina mare hennessy had trained for her graham smiled with secret approval of her femininity for paula whether she had designed her habit for the mare or had selected one most peculiarly appropriate had achieved a triumph  in place of a riding coat for the afternoon was warm she wore a tan linen blouse with white turnback collar a short skirt made like the lower part of a riding coat reached the knees and from knees to entrancing little bespurred champagne boots tight riding trousers showed skirt and trousers were of fawncolored silk corduroy soft white gauntlets on her hands matched with the collar in the one emphasis of color her head was bare the hair done tight and low around her ears and nape of neck  i dont see how you can keep such a skin and expose yourself to the sun this way graham ventured in mild criticism  i dont she smiled with a dazzle of white teeth that is i dont expose my face this way more than a few times a year id like to because i love the sungold burn in my hair but i dont dare a thorough tanning  the mare frisked and a breeze of air blew back a flap of skirt showing an articulate knee where the trouser leg narrowed tightly over it again graham visioned the white round of knee pressed into the round muscles of the swimming mountain lad as he noted the firm knee grip on her pigskin english saddle quite new and fawncolored to match costume and horse  when the magneto on the tractor went wrong and the mechanics busied themselves with it in the midst of the partly plowed field the company under paulas guidance leaving dick behind with his invention resolved itself into a pilgrimage among the broodcenters on the way to the swimming tank mr crellin the hogmanager showed them lady isleton who with her prodigious fat recent progeny of eleven won various naÃ¯ve encomiums while mr crellin warmly proclaimed at least four times and not a runt not a runt in the bunch  other glorious broodsows of berkshire durocjersey and o i c blood they saw till they were wearied and newborn kids and lambs and rotund does and ewes from center to center paula kept the telephones warning ahead of the partys coming so that mr manson waited to exhibit the great king polo and his broadbacked shorthorn harem and the shorthorn harems of bulls that were only little less than king polo in magnificence and record and parkman the jersey manager was on hand with staffed assistants to parade sensational drake golden jolly fontaine royal oxford master and karnaks fairy boyblue ribbon bulls all and founders and scions of noble houses of butterfat renown and rosaire queen standbys dam golden jollys lass olgas pride and gertie of maitlandsequally blueribboned and blueblooded jersey matrons in the royal realm of butterfat and mr mendenhall who had charge of the shires proudly exhibited a string of mighty stallions led by the mighty mountain lad and a longer string of matrons headed by the fotherington princess of the silver whinny even old alden bessie the princesss dam retired to but partdays work he sent for that they might render due honor to so notable a dam  as four oclock approached donald ware not keen on swimming returned in one of the machines to the big house and mr gulhuss remained to discuss shires with mr mendenhall dick was at the tank when the party arrived and the girls were immediately insistent for the new song  it isnt exactly a new song dick explained his gray eyes twinkling roguery and its not my song it was sung in japan before i was born and i doubt not before columbus discovered america also it is a dueta competitive duet with forfeit penalties attached paula will have to sing it with meill teach you sit down there thats rightnow all the rest of you gather around and sit down  still in her riding habit paula sat down on the concrete facing her husband in the center of the sitting audience under his direction timing her movements to his she slapped her hands on her knees slapped her palms together and slapped her palms against his palms much in the fashion of the nursery game of bean porridge hot then he sang the song which was short and which she quickly picked up singing it with him and clapping the accent while the air of it was orientally catchy it was chanted slowly almost monotonously but it was quickly provocative of excitement to the spectators    jongkeena jongkeena     jongjong keenakeena     yokohama nagasaki     kobemarohoy  the last syllable hoy was uttered suddenly explosively and an octave and more higher than the pitch of the melody at the same moment that it was uttered paulas and dicks hands were abruptly shot toward each others either clenched or open the point of the game was that paulas hands open or closed at the instant of uttering hoy should match dicks thus the first time she did match him both his and her hands being closed whereupon he took off his hat and tossed it into lutes lap  my forfeit he explained come on paul again and again they sang and clapped    jongkeena jongkeena     jongjong keenakeena     yokohama nagasaki     kobemarohoy  this time with the hoy her hands were closed and his were open  forfeitforfeit the girls cried  she looked her costume over with alarm asking what can i give  a hair pin dick advised and one of her turtleshell hair pins joined his hat in lutes lap  bother it she exclaimed when the last of her hair pins had gone the same way she having failed seven times to dicks once i cant see why i should be so slow and stupid besides dick youre too clever i never could outguess you or outanticipate you  again they sang the song she lost and to mrs tullys shocked paula she forfeited a spur and threatened a boot when the remaining spur should be gone a winning streak of three compelled dick to give up his wrist watch and both spurs then she lost her wrist watch and the remaining spur  jongkeena jongkeena they began again while mrs tully remonstrated now paula you simply must stop thisdick you ought to be ashamed of yourself  but dick emitting a triumphant hoy won and joined in the laughter as paula took off one of her little champagne boots and added it to the heap in lutes lap  its all right aunt martha paula assured mrs tully mr wares not here and hes the only one who would be shockedcome on dick you cant win every time  jongkeena jongkeena she chanted on with her husband the repetition at first slow had accelerated steadily so that now they fairly rippled through with it while their slapping striking palms made a continuous patter the exercise and excitement had added to the suns action on her skin so that her laughing face was all a rosy glow  evan graham a silent spectator was aware of hurt and indignity he knew the jongkeena of old time from the geishas of the tea houses of nippon and despite the unconventionality that ruled the forrests and the big house he experienced shock in that paula should take part in such a game it did not enter his head at the moment that he would have been merely curious to see how far the madness would go had the player been lute or ernestine or rita not till afterward did he realize that his concern and sense of outrage were due to the fact that the player was paula and that therefore she was bulking bigger in his imagination than he was conscious of what he was conscious of at the moment was that he was growing angry and that he had deliberately to check himself from protesting  by this time dicks cigarette case and matches and paulas second boot belt skirtpin and wedding ring had joined the mound of forfeits mrs tully her face set in stoic resignation was silent  jongkeena jongkeena paula laughed and sang on and graham heard ernestine laugh to bert i dont see what she can spare next  well you know her he heard bert answer shes game once she gets started and it certainly looks like shes started  hoy paula and dick cried simultaneously as they thrust out their hands  but dicks were closed and hers were open graham watched her vainly quest her person for the consequent forfeit  come on lady godiva dick commanded you hae sung you hae danced now pay the piper  was the man a fool was grahams thought and a man with a wife like that  well paula sighed her fingers playing with the fastenings of her blouse if i must i must  raging inwardly graham averted his gaze and kept it averted there was a pause in which he knew everybody must be hanging on what she would do next then came a giggle from ernestine a burst of laughter from all and a frameup from bert that overcame grahams resoluteness he looked quickly the little ladys blouse was off and from the waist up she appeared in her swimming suit it was evident that she had dressed over it for the ride  come on luteyou next dick was challenging   but lute not similarly prepared for jongkeena blushingly led the retreat of the girls to the dressing rooms  graham watched paula poise at the fortyfoot top of the diving scaffold and swandive beautifully into the tank heard berts admiring oh you annette kellerman and still chagrined by the trick that had threatened to outrage him fell to wondering about the wonder woman the little lady of the big house and how she had happened so wonderfully to be as he fetched down the length of tank under water moving with leisurely strokes and with open eyes watching the shoaling bottom it came to him that he did not know anything about her she was dick forrests wife that was all he knew how she had been born how she had lived how and where her past had beenof all this he knew nothing  ernestine had told him that lute and she were half sisters of paula that was one bit of data at any rate warned by the increasing brightness of the bottom that he had nearly reached the end of the tank and recognizing dicks and berts legs intertwined in what must be a wrestling bout graham turned about still under water and swam back a score or so of feet there was that mrs tully whom paula had addressed as aunt martha was she truly an aunt or was she a courtesy aunt through sisterhood with the mother of lute and ernestine  he broke surface was hailed by the others to join in bullinthe ring in which strenuous sport for the next half hour he was compelled more than once to marvel at the litheness and agility as well as strategy of paula in her successful efforts at escaping through the ring concluding the game through weariness breathing hard the entire party raced the length of the tank and crawled out to rest in the sunshine in a circle about mrs tully  soon there was more fun afoot and paula was contending impossible things with mrs tully  now aunt martha just because you never learned to swim is no reason for you to take such a position i am a real swimmer and i tell you i can dive right into the tank here and stay under for ten minutes  nonsense child mrs tully beamed your father when he was young a great deal younger than you my dear could stay under water longer than any other man and his record as i know was three minutes and forty seconds as i very well know for i held the watch myself and kept the time when he won against harry selby on a wager  oh i know my father was some man in his time paula swaggered but times have changed if i had the old dear here right now in all his youthful excellence id drown him if he tried to stay under water with me ten minutes of course i can do ten minutes and i will you hold the watch aunt martha and time me why its as easy as  shooting fish in a bucket dick completed for her  paula climbed to the platform above the springboard  time me when im in the air she said  make your turn and a half dick called  she nodded smiled and simulated a prodigious effort at filling her lungs to their utmost capacity graham watched enchanted a diver himself he had rarely seen the turn and a half attempted by women other than professionals her wet suit of light blue and green silk clung closely to her showing the lines of her justly proportioned body with what appeared to be an agonized gulp for the last cubic inch of air her lungs could contain she sprang up out and down her body vertical and stiff her legs straight her feet close together as they impacted on the springboard end flung into the air by the board she doubled her body into a ball made a complete revolution then straightened out in perfect divers form and in a perfect dive with scarcely a ripple entered the water  a toledo blade would have made more splash was grahams verdict  if only i could dive like that ernestine breathed her admiration but i never shall dick says diving is a matter of timing and thats why paula does it so terribly well shes got the sense of time  and of abandon graham added  of willed abandon dick qualified  of relaxation by effort graham agreed ive never seen a professional do so perfect a turn and a half  and im prouder of it than she is dick proclaimed you see i taught her though i confess it was an easy task she coordinates almost effortlessly and that along with her will and sense of time why her first attempt was better than fair  paula is a remarkable woman mrs tully said proudly her eyes fluttering between the second hand of the watch and the unbroken surface of the pool women never swim so well as men but she does three minutes and forty seconds shes beaten her father  but she wont stay under any five minutes much less ten dick solemnly stated shell burst her lungs first  at four minutes mrs tully began to show excitement and to look anxiously from face to face captain lester not in the secret scrambled to his feet with an oath and dived into the tank  something has happened mrs tully said with controlled quietness she hurt herself on that dive go in after her you men  but graham and bert and dick meeting under water gleefully grinned and squeezed hands dick made signs for them to follow and led the way through the darkshadowed water into the crypt where treading water they joined paula in subdued whisperings and gigglings  just came to make sure you were all right dick explained and now weve got to beat ityou first bert ill follow evan  and one by one they went down through the dark water and came up on the surface of the pool by this time mrs tully was on her feet and standing by the edge of the tank  if i thought this was one of your tricks dick forrest she began  but dick paying no attention acting preternaturally calmly was directing the men loudly enough for her to hear  weve got to make this systematic fellows you bert and you evan join with me we start at this end five feet apart and search the bottom across then move along and repeat it back  dont exert yourselves gentlemen mrs tully called beginning to laugh as for you dick you come right out i want to box your ears  take care of her you girls dick shouted shes got hysterics  i havent but i will have she laughed  but damn it all madam this is no laughing matter captain lester spluttered breathlessly as he prepared for another trip to explore the bottom  are you on aunt martha really and truly on dick asked after the valiant mariner had gone down  mrs tully nodded but keep it up dick youve got one dupe elsie coghlans mother told me about it in honolulu last year  not until eleven minutes had elapsed did the smiling face of paula break the surface simulating exhaustion she slowly crawled out and sank down panting near her aunt captain lester really exhausted by his strenuous exertions at rescue studied paula keenly then marched to the nearest pillar and meekly bumped his head three times against the concrete  im afraid i didnt stay down ten minutes paula said but i wasnt much under that was i aunt martha  you werent much under at all mrs tully replied if its my opinion you were asking im surprised that you are even wetthere there breathe naturally child the playacting is unnecessary i remember when i was a young girl traveling in india there was a school of fakirs who leaped into deep wells and stayed down much longer than you child much longer indeed  you knew paula charged  but you didnt know i did her aunt retorted and therefore your conduct was criminal when you consider a woman of my age with my heart  and with your blessed brasstack head paula cried  for two apples id box your ears  and for one apple id hug you wet as i am paula laughed back anyway we did fool captain lesterdidnt we captain  dont speak to me that doughty mariner muttered darkly im busy with myself meditating what form my vengeance shall takeas for you mr dick forrest im divided between blowing up your dairy or hamstringing mountain lad maybe ill do both in the meantime i am going out to kick that mare you ride  dick on the outlaw and paula on the fawn rode back side by side to the big house  how do you like graham he asked  splendid was her reply hes your type dick hes universal like you and hes got the same worldmarks branded on himthe seven seas the books and all the rest hes an artist too and pretty well allaround and hes good fun have you noticed his smile its irresistible it makes one want to smile with him  and hes got his serious scars as well dick nodded concurrence  yesright in the corners of the eyes just after he has smiled youll see them come theyre not tired marks exactly but rather the old eternal questions why what for whats it worth whats it all about                                         and bringing up the rear of the cavalcade ernestine and graham talked  dicks deep she was saying you dont know him any too well hes dreadfully deep i know him a little paula knows him a lot but very few others ever get under the surface of him hes a real philosopher and he has the control of a stoic or an englishman and he can play act to fool the world                                         at the long hitching rails under the oaks where the dismounting party gathered paula was in gales of laughter  go on go on she urged dick more more  shes been accusing me of exhausting my vocabulary in naming the houseboys by my system he explained  and hes given me at least forty more names in a minute and a half go on dick more  then he said striking a chant we can have oh sin and oh pshaw oh sing and oh song oh sung and oh sang oh last and oh least oh ping and oh pong oh some oh more and oh most oh naught and oh nit  and dick jingled away into the house still chanting his extemporized directory     chapter xvii    a week of dissatisfaction and restlessness ensued for graham tom between belief that his business was to leave the big house on the first train and desire to see and see more of paula to be with her and to be more with herhe succeeded in neither leaving nor in seeing as much of her as during the first days of his visit  at first and for the five days that he lingered the young violinist monopolized nearly her entire time of visibility often graham strayed into the music room and quite neglected by the pair sat for moody halfhours listening to their work they were oblivious of his presence either flushed and absorbed with the passion of their music or wiping their foreheads and chatting and laughing companionably in pauses to rest that the young musician loved her with an ardency that was almost painful was patent to graham but what hurt him was the abandon of devotion with which she sometimes looked at ware after he had done something exceptionally fine in vain graham tried to tell himself that all this was mental on her partpurely delighted appreciation of the others artistry nevertheless being man it hurt and continued to hurt until he could no longer suffer himself to remain  once chancing into the room at the end of a schumann song and just after ware had departed graham found paula still seated at the piano an expression of rapt dreaming on her face she regarded him almost unrecognizingly gathered herself mechanically together uttered an absentminded commonplace or so and left the room despite his vexation and hurt graham tried to think it mere artistdreaming on her part a listening to the echo of the justplayed music in her soul but women were curious creatures he could not help moralizing and were prone to lose their hearts most strangely and inconsequentially might it not be that by his very music this youngster of a man was charming the woman of her  with the departure of ware paula forrest retired almost completely into her private wing behind the door without a knob nor did this seem unusual graham gleaned from the household  paula is a woman who finds herself very good company ernestine explained and she often goes in for periods of aloneness when dick is the only person who sees her  which is not flattering to the rest of the company graham smiled  which makes her such good company whenever she is in company ernestine retorted  the driftage through the big house was decreasing a few guests on business or friendship continued to come but more departed under oh joy and his chinese staff the big house ran so frictionlessly and so perfectly that entertainment of guests seemed little part of the hosts duties the guests largely entertained themselves and one another  dick rarely appeared even for a moment until lunch and paula now carrying out her seclusion program never appeared before dinner  rest cure dick laughed one noon and challenged graham to a tournament with boxing gloves singlesticks and foils  and nows the time he told graham as they breathed between bouts for you to tackle your book im only one of the many who are looking forward to reading it and im looking forward hard got a letter from havely yesterdayhe mentioned it and wondered how far along you were  so graham in his tower room arranged his notes and photographs schemed out the work and plunged into the opening chapters so immersed did he become that his nascent interest in paula might have languished had it not been for meeting her each evening at dinner then too until ernestine and lute left for santa barbara there were afternoon swims and rides and motor trips to the pastures of the miramar hills and the upland ranges of the anselmo mountains other trips they made sometimes accompanied by dick to his great dredgers working in the sacramento basin or his dambuilding on the little coyote and los cuatos creeks or to his fivethousandacre colony of twentyacre farmers where he was trying to enable two hundred and fifty heads of families along with their families to make good on the soil  that paula sometimes went for long solitary rides graham knew and once he caught her dismounting from the fawn at the hitching rails  dont you think you are spoiling that mare for riding in company he twitted  paula laughed and shook her head  well then he asserted stoutly im spoiling for a ride with you  theres lute and ernestine and bert and all the rest  this is new country he contended and one learns country through the people who know it ive seen it through the eyes of lute and ernestine and all the rest but there is a lot i havent seen and which i can see only through your eyes  a pleasant theory she evaded aa sort of landscape vampirism  but without the ill effects of vampirism he urged quickly  her answer was slow in coming her look into his eyes was frank and straight and he could guess her words were weighed and gauged  i dont know about that was all she said finally but his fancy leaped at the several words ranging and conjecturing their possible connotations  but we have so much we might be saying to each other he tried again so much we ought to be saying to each other  so i apprehend she answered quietly and again that frank straight look accompanied her speech  so she did apprehendthe thought of it was flame to him but his tongue was not quick enough to serve him to escape the cool provoking laugh as she turned into the house  still the company of the big house thinned paulas aunt mrs tully much to grahams disappointment for he had expected to learn from her much that he wanted to know of paula had gone after only a several days stay there was vague talk of her return for a longer stay but just back from europe she declared herself burdened with a round of duty visits which must be performed before her pleasure visiting began  ohay the critic had been compelled to linger several days in order to live down the disastrous culmination of the musical raid made upon him by the philosophers the idea and the trick had been dicks combat had joined early in the evening when a seeming chance remark of ernestine had enabled aaron hancock to fling the first bomb into the thick of ohays deepest convictions dar hyal a willing and eager ally had charged around the flank with his blastic theory of music and taken ohay in reverse and the battle had raged until the hotheaded irishman beside himself with the grueling the pair of skilled logomachists were giving him accepted with huge relief the kindly invitation of terrence mcfane to retire with him to the tranquillity and repose of the stag room where over a soothing highball and far from the barbarians the two of them could have a heart to heart talk on real music at two in the morning wildeyed and befuddled ohay had been led to bed by the uprightwalking and unshakably steady terrence  never mind ernestine had told ohay later with a twinkle in her eye that made him guess the plot it was only to be expected those rattlebrained philosophers would drive even a saint to drink  i thought you were safe in terrences hands had been dicks mock apology a pair of irishmen you know id forgot terrence was case hardened do you know after he said good night to you he came up to me for a yarn and he was steady as a rock he mentioned casually of having had several sips so i i never dreamed  er that he had indisposed you  when lute and ernestine departed for santa barbara bert wainwright and his sister remembered their longneglected home in sacramento a pair of painters proteges of paula arrived the same day but they were little in evidence spending long days in the hills with a trap and driver and smoking long pipes in the stag room  the free and easy life of the big house went on in its frictionless way dick worked graham worked paula maintained her seclusion the sages from the madrono grove strayed in for wordy dinnersand wordy evenings except when paula played for them automobile parties from sacramento wickenberg and other valley towns continued to drop in unexpectedly but never to the confusion of oh joy and the house boys whom graham saw on occasion with twenty minutes warning seat a score of unexpected guests to a perfect dinner and there were even nightsrare oneswhen only dick and graham and paula sat at dinner and when afterward the two men yarned for an hour before an early bed while she played soft things to herself or disappeared earlier than they  but one moonlight evening when the watsons and masons and wombolds arrived in force graham found himself out when every bridge table was made up paula was at the piano as he approached he caught the quick expression of pleasure in her eyes at sight of him which as quickly vanished she made a slight movement as if to rise which did not escape his notice any more than did her quiet mastery of the impulse that left her seated  she was immediately herself as he had always seen heralthough it was little enough he had seen of her he thought as he talked whatever came into his head and rummaged among her songs with her now one and now another song he tried with her subduing his high baritone to her light soprano with such success as to win cries of more from the bridge players  yes i am positively aching to be out again over the world with dick she told him in a pause if we could only start tomorrow but dick cant start yet hes in too deep with too many experiments and adventures on the ranch here why what do you think hes up to now as if he did not have enough on his hands hes going to revolutionize the sales end or at least the california and pacific coast portion of it by making the buyers come to the ranch  but they do do that graham said the first man i met here was a buyer from idaho  oh but dick means as an institution you knowto make them come en masse at a stated time not simple auction sales either though he says he will bait them with a bit of that to excite interest it will be an annual fair to last three days in which he will be the only exhibitor hes spending half his mornings now in conference with mr agar and mr pitts mr agar is his sales manager and mr pitts his showman  she sighed and rippled her fingers along the keyboard  but oh if only we could get awaytimbuctoo mokpo or jericho  dont tell me youve ever been to mokpo graham laughed  she nodded cross my heart solemnly hope to die it was with dick in the all away and in the long ago it might almost be said we honeymooned in mokpo  and while graham exchanged reminiscences of mokpo with her he cudgeled his brain to try and decide whether her continual reference to her husband was deliberate  i should imagine you found it such a paradise here he was saying  i do i do she assured him with what seemed unnecessary vehemence but i dont know whats come over me lately i feel it imperative to be up and away the spring fret i suppose the red gods and their medicine and if only dick didnt insist on working his head off and getting tied down with projects do you know in all the years of our marriage the only really serious rival i have ever had has been this ranch hes pretty faithful and the ranch is his first love he had it all planned and started before he ever met me or knew i existed  here let us try this together graham said abruptly placing the song on the rack before her  oh but its the gypsy trail she protested it will only make my mood worse and she hummed    follow the romany patteran      west to the sinking sun      till the junk sails lift through the homeless drift      and the east and the west are one  what is the romany patteran she broke off to ask ive always thought of it as patter or patois the gypsy patois and somehow it strikes me as absurd to follow a language over the worlda sort of philological excursion  in a way the patteran is speech he answered but it always says one thing this way i have passed two sprigs crossed in certain ways and left upon the trail compose the patteran but they must always be of different trees or shrubs thus on the ranch here a patteran could be made of manzanita and madrono of oak and spruce of buckeye and alder of redwood and laurel of huckleberry and lilac it is a sign of gypsy comrade to gypsy comrade of gypsy lover to gypsy lover and he hummed    back to the road again again       out of a clear sea track     follow the cross of the gypsy trail       over the world and back  she nodded comprehension looked for a moment with troubled eyes down the long room to the cardplayers caught herself in her momentary absentness and said quickly  heaven knows theres a lot of gypsy in some of us i have more than full share in spite of his bucolic proclivities dick is a born gypsy and from what he has told of you you are hopelessly one  after all the white man is the real gypsy the king gypsy graham propounded he has wandered wider wilder and with less equipment than any gypsy the gypsy has followed in his trails but never made trail for himcome let us try it  and as they sang the reckless words to their merry careless lilt he looked down at her and wonderedwondered at herat himself this was no place for him by this womans side under her husbands roof tree yet here he was and he should have gone days before after the years he was just getting acquainted with himself this was enchantment madness he should tear himself away at once he had known enchantments and madnesses before and had torn himself away had he softened with the years he questioned himself or was this a profounder madness than he had experienced this meant the violation of dear thingsthings so dear so jealously cherished and guarded in his secret life that never yet had they suffered violation  and still he did not tear himself away he stood there beside her looking down on her brown crown of hair glinting gold and bronze and bewitchingly curling into tendrils above her ears singing a song that was fire to himthat must be fire to her she being what she was and feeling what she had already in flashes halfunwittingly hinted to him  she is a witch and her voice is not the least of her witchery he thought as her voice so richly a womans voice so essentially her voice in contradistinction to all womens voices in the world sang and throbbed in his ear and he knew beyond shade of doubt that she felt some touch of this madness that afflicted him that she sensed as he sensed that the man and the woman were met  they thrilled together as they sang and the thought and the sure knowledge of it added fuel to his own madness till his voice warmed unconsciously to the daring of the last lines as voices and thrills blending they sang    the wild hawk to the windswept sky       the deer to the wholesome wold       and the heart of a man to the heart of a maid       as it was in the days of old       the heart of a man to the heart of a maid     light of my tents be fleet       morning waits at the end of the world     and the world is all at our feet  he looked for her to look up as the last notes died away but she remained quiet a moment her eyes bent on the keys and then the face that was turned to his was the face of the little lady of the big house the mouth smiling mischievously the eyes filled with roguery as she said  let us go and devil dickhes losing ive never seen him lose his temper at cards but he gets ridiculously blue after a long siege of losing  and he does love gambling she continued as she led the way to the tables its one of his modes of relaxing it does him good about once or twice a year if its a good poker game hell sit in all night to it and play to the blue sky if they take off the limit     chapter xviii    almost immediately after the singing of the gypsy trail paula emerged from her seclusion and graham found himself hard put in the tower room to keep resolutely to his work when all the morning he could hear snatches of song and opera from her wing or laughter and scolding of dogs from the great patio or the continuous pulse for hours of the piano from the distant music room but graham patterning after dick devoted his mornings to work so that he rarely encountered paula before lunch  she made announcement that her spell of insomnia was over and that she was ripe for all gaieties and excursions dick had to offer her further she threatened in case dick grudged these personal diversions to fill the house with guests and teach him what liveliness was it was at this time that her aunt marthamrs tully returned for a several days visit and that paula resumed the driving of duddy and fuddy in the high oneseated studebaker trap duddy and fuddy were spirited trotters but mrs tully despite her elderliness and avoirdupois was without timidity when paula held the reins  as mrs tully told graham and that is a concession i make to no woman save paula she is the only woman i can trust myself to with horses she has the horseway about her when she was a child she was wild over horses its a wonder she didnt become a circus rider  more much more graham learned about paula in various chats with her aunt of philip desten paulas father mrs tully could never say enough her eldest brother and older by many years he had been her childhood prince his ways had been big ways princely waysways that to commoner folk had betokened a streak of madness he was continually guilty of the wildest things and the most chivalrous things it was this streak that had enabled him to win various fortunes and with equal facility to lose them in the great gold adventure of fortynine himself of old new england stock he had had for great grandfather a frenchmana trifle of flotsam from a mid ocean wreck and landed to grow up among the farmersailormen of the coast of maine  and once and once only in each generation that french desten crops out mrs tully assured graham philip was that frenchman in his generation and who but paula and in full measure received that same inheritance in her generation though lute and ernestine are her half sisters no one would imagine one drop of the common blood was shared thats why paula instead of going circusriding drifted inevitably to france it was that old original desten that drew her over  and of the adventure in france graham learned much philip destens luck had been to die when the wheel of his fortune had turned over and down ernestine and lute little tots had been easy enough for destens sisters to manage but paula who had fallen to mrs tully had been the problembecause of that frenchman  oh she is rigid new england mrs tully insisted the solidest of creatures as to honor and rectitude dependableness and faithfulness as a girl she really couldnt bring herself to lie except to save others in which case all her new england ancestry took flight and she would lie as magnificently as her father before her and he had the same charm of manner the same daring the same ready laughter the same vivacity but what is lightsome and blithe in her was debonaire in him he won mens hearts always or failing that their bitterest enmity no one was left cold by him in passing contact with him quickened them to love or hate therein paula differs being a woman i suppose and not enjoying mans prerogative of tilting at windmills i dont know that she has an enemy in the world all love her unless it may well be there are catwomen who envy her her nice husband  and as graham listened paulas singing came through the open window from somewhere down the long arcades and there was that everhaunting thrill in her voice that he could not escape remembering afterward she burst into laughter and mrs tully beamed to him and nodded at the sound  there laughs philip desten she murmured and all the frenchwomen behind the original frenchman who was brought into penobscot dressed in homespun and sent to meeting have you noticed how paulas laugh invariably makes everybody look up and smile philips laugh did the same thing  paula had always been passionately fond of music painting drawing as a little girl she could be traced around the house and grounds by the trail she left behind her of images and shapes made in whatever medium she chanced upondrawn on scraps of paper scratched on bits of wood modeled in mud and sand  she loved everything and everything loved her said mrs tully she was never timid of animals and yet she always stood in awe of them but she was born sensestruck and her awe was beautyawe yes she was an incorrigible heroworshiper whether the person was merely beautiful or did things and she never will outgrow that beautyawe of anything she loves whether it is a grand piano a great painting a beautiful mare or a bit of landscape  and paula had wanted to do to make beauty herself but she was sorely puzzled whether she should devote herself to music or painting in the full swing of work under the best masters in boston she could not refrain from straying back to her drawing from her easel she was lured to modeling   and so with her love of the best her soul and heart full of beauty she grew quite puzzled and worried over herself as to which talent was the greater and if she had genius at all i suggested a complete rest from work and took her abroad for a year and of all things she developed a talent for dancing but always she harked back to her music and painting no she was not flighty her trouble was that she was too talented  too diversely talented graham amplified  yes that is better mrs tully nodded but from talent to genius is a far cry and to save my life at this late day i dont know whether the child ever had a trace of genius in her she has certainly not done anything big in any of her chosen things  except to be herself graham added  which is the big thing mrs tully accepted with a smile of enthusiasm she is a splendid unusual woman very unspoiled very natural and after all what does doing things amount to id give more for one of paulas madcap escapadesoh i heard all about swimming the big stallionthan for all her pictures if every one was a masterpiece but she was hard for me to understand at first dick often calls her the girl that never grew up but gracious she can put on the grand air when she needs to i call her the most mature child i have ever seen dick was the finest thing that ever happened to her it was then that she really seemed for the first time to find herself it was this way  and mrs tully went on to sketch the year of travel in europe the resumption of paulas painting in paris and the conviction she finally reached that success could be achieved only by struggle and that her aunts money was a handicap  and she had her way mrs tully sighed shewhy she dismissed me sent me home she would accept no more than the meagerest allowance and went down into the latin quarter on her own batching with two other american girls and she met dick dick was a rare one you couldnt guess what he was doing then running a cabaretoh not these modern cabarets but a real students cabaret of sorts it was very select they were a lot of madmen you see he was just back from some of his wild adventuring at the ends of the earth and as he stated it he wanted to stop living life for a while and to talk about life instead  paula took me there once oh they were engagedthe day before and he had called on me and all that i had known lucky richard forrest and i knew all about his son from a worldly standpoint paula couldnt have made a finer marriage it was quite a romance paula had seen him captain the university of california eleven to victory over stanford and the next time she saw him was in the studio she shared with the two girls she didnt know whether dick was worth millions or whether he was running a cabaret because he was hard up and she cared less she always followed her heart fancy the situation dick the uncatchable and paula who never flirted they must have sprung forthright into each others arms for inside the week it was all arranged and dick made his call on me as if my decision meant anything one way or the other  but dicks cabaret it was the cabaret of the philosophersa small pokey place down in a cellar in the heart of the quarter and it had only one table fancy that for a cabaret but such a table a big round one of plain boards without even an oilcloth the wood stained with the countless drinks spilled by the tablepounding of the philosophers and it could seat thirty women were not permitted an exception was made for paula and me  youve met aaron hancock here he was one of the philosophers and to this day he swaggers that he owed dick a bigger bill that never was paid than any of his customers and there they used to meet all those wild young thinkers and pound the table and talk philosophy in all the tongues of europe dick always had a penchant for philosophers  but paula spoiled that little adventure no sooner were they married than dick fitted out his schooner the all away and away the blessed pair of them went honeymooning from bordeaux to hongkong  and the cabaret was closed and the philosophers left homeless and discussionless graham remarked  mrs tully laughed heartily and shook her head  he endowed it for them she gasped her hand to her side or partially endowed it or something i dont know what the arrangement was and within the month it was raided by the police for an anarchist club  after having learned the wide scope of her interests and talents graham was nevertheless surprised one day at finding paula all by herself in a corner of a windowseat completely absorbed in her work on a piece of fine embroidery  i love it she explained all the costly needlework of the shops means nothing to me alongside of my own work on my own designs dick used to fret at my sewing hes all for efficiency you know elimination of waste energy and such things he thought sewing was a wasting of time peasants could be hired for a song to do what i was doing but i succeeded in making my viewpoint clear to him  its like the music one makes oneself of course i can buy better music than i make but to sit down at an instrument and evoke the music oneself with ones own fingers and brain is an entirely different and dearer satisfaction whether one tries to emulate anothers performance or infuses the performance with ones own personality and interpretation its all the same it is souljoy and fulfilment  take this little embroidered crust of lilies on the edge of this flouncethere is nothing like it in the world mine the idea all mine and mine the delight of giving form and being to the idea there are better ideas and better workmanship in the shops but this is different it is mine i visioned it and i made it and who is to say that embroidery is not art  she ceased speaking and with her eyes laughed the insistence of her question  and who is to say graham agreed that the adorning of beautiful womankind is not the worthiest of all the arts as well as the sweetest  i rather stand in awe of a good milliner or modiste she nodded gravely they really are artists and important ones as dick would phrase it in the worlds economy                                         another time seeking the library for andean reference graham came upon paula sprawled gracefully over a sheet of paper on a big table and flanked by ponderous architectural portfolios engaged in drawing plans of a log bungalow or camp for the sages of the madroÃ±o grove  its a problem she sighed dick says that if i build it i must build it for seven weve got four sages now and his heart is set on seven he says never mind showers and such things because what philosopher ever bathes and he has suggested seriously seven stoves and seven kitchens because it is just over such mundane things that philosophers always quarrel  wasnt it voltaire who quarreled with a king over candleends graham queried pleasuring in the sight of her graceful abandon thirtyeight it was impossible she seemed almost a girl petulant and flushed over some school task then he remembered mrs tullys remark that paula was the most mature child she had ever known  it made him wonder was she the one who under the oaks at the hitching rails with two brief sentences had cut to the heart of an impending situation so i apprehend she had said what had she apprehended had she used the phrase glibly without meaning yet she it was who had thrilled and fluttered to him and with him when they had sung the gypsy trail that he knew but again had he not seen her warm and glow to the playing of donald ware but here grahams ego had its will of him for he told himself that with donald ware it was different and he smiled to himself and at himself at the thought  what amuses you paula was asking  heaven knows i am no architect and i challenge you to house seven philosophers according to all the absurd stipulations laid down by dick  back in his tower room with his andean books unopened before him graham gnawed his lip and meditated the woman was no woman she was the veriest child orand he hesitated at the thoughtwas this naturalness that was overdone did she in truth apprehend it must be it had to be she was of the world she knew the world she was very wise no remembered look of her gray eyes but gave the impression of poise and power that was itstrength he recalled her that first night when she had seemed at times to glint an impression of steel of thin and jewellike steel in his fancy at the time he remembered likening her strength to ivory to carven pearl shell to sennit twisted of maidens hair  and he knew now ever since the brief words at the hitching rails and the singing of the gypsy trail that whenever their eyes looked into each others it was with a mutual knowledge of unsaid things  in vain he turned the pages of the books for the information he sought he tried to continue his chapter without the information but no words flowed from his pen a maddening restlessness was upon him he seized a time table and pondered the departure of trains changed his mind switched the room telephone to the house barn and asked to have altadena saddled  it was a perfect morning of california early summer no breath of wind stirred over the drowsing fields from which arose the calls of quail and the notes of meadowlarks the air was heavy with lilac fragrance and from the distance as he rode between the lilac hedges graham heard the throaty nicker of mountain lad and the silvery answering whinney of the fotherington princess  why was he here astride dick forrests horse graham asked himself why was he not even then on the way to the station to catch that first train he had noted on the time table this unaccustomed weakness of decision and action was a new rÃ´le for him he considered bitterly butand he was on fire with the thought of itthis was his one life and this was the one woman in the world  he reined aside to let a herd of angora goats go by each was a doe and there were several hundred of them and they were moved slowly by the basque herdsmen with frequent pauses for each doe was accompanied by a young kid in the paddock were many mares with new born colts and once receiving warning in time graham raced into a crossroad to escape a drove of thirty yearling stallions being moved somewhere across the ranch their excitement was communicated to that entire portion of the ranch so that the air was filled with shrill nickerings and squealings and answering whinneys while mountain lad beside himself at sight and sound of so many rivals raged up and down his paddock and again and again trumpeted his challenging conviction that he was the most amazing and mightiest thing that had ever occurred on earth in the way of horse flesh  dick forrest pranced and sidled into the cross road on the outlaw his face beaming with delight at the little tempest among his many creatures  fecundity fecundityhe chanted in greeting as he reined in to a halt if halt it might be called with his tangolden sorrel mare afret and afroth wickedly reaching with her teeth now for his leg and next for grahams one moment pawing the roadway the next moment in sheer impotence of resentfulness kicking the empty air with one hind leg and kicking the air repeatedly a dozen times  those youngsters certainly put mountain lad on his mettle dick laughed listen to his song  hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills i fill the wide valleys the mares hear me and startle in quiet pastures for they know me the land is filled with fatness and the sap is in the trees it is the spring the spring is mine i am monarch of my kingdom of the spring the mares remember my voice they knew me aforetime through their mothers before them hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills and the wide valleys are my heralds echoing the sound of my approach     chapter xix    after mrs tullys departure paula true to her threat filled the house with guests she seemed to have remembered all who had been waiting an invitation and the limousine that met the trains eight miles away was rarely empty coming or going there were more singers and musicians and artist folk and bevies of young girls with their inevitable followings of young men while mammas and aunts and chaperons seemed to clutter all the ways of the big house and to fill a couple of motor cars when picnics took place  and graham wondered if this surrounding of herself by many people was not deliberate on paulas part as for himself he definitely abandoned work on his book and joined in the beforebreakfast swims of the hardier younger folk in the morning rides over the ranch and in whatever fun was afoot indoors and out  late hours and early were kept and one night dick who adhered to his routine and never appeared to his guests before midday made a night of it at poker in the stagroom graham had sat in and felt well repaid when at dawn the players received an unexpected visit from paulaherself past one of her white nights she said although no sign of it showed on her fresh skin and color graham had to struggle to keep his eyes from straying too frequently to her as she mixed golden fizzes to rejuvenate the waneyed jaded players then she made them start the round of jacks that closed the game and sent them off for a cold swim before breakfast and the days work or frolic  never was paula alone graham could only join in the groups that were always about her although the young people ragged and tangoed incessantly she rarely danced and then it was with the young men once however she favored him with an oldfashioned waltz your ancestors in an antediluvian dance she mocked the young people as she stepped out for she and graham had the floor to themselves  once down the length of the room the two were in full accord paula with the sympathy graham recognized that made her the exceptional accompanist or rider subdued herself to the masterful art of the man until the two were as parts of a sentient machine that operated without jar or friction after several minutes finding their perfect mutual step and pace and graham feeling the absolute giving of paula to the dance they essayed rhythmical pauses and dips their feet never leaving the floor yet affecting the onlookers in the way dick voiced it when he cried out they float they float the music was the waltz of salomÃ© and with its slowfading end they postured slower and slower to a perfect close  there was no need to speak in silence without a glance at each other they returned to the company where dick was proclaiming  well younglings codlings and other fry thats the way we old folks used to dance im not saying anything against the new dances mind you theyre all right and dandy fine but just the same it wouldnt injure you much to learn to waltz properly the way you waltz when you do attempt it is a scream we old folks do know a thing or two that is worth while  for instance queried one of the girls  ill tell you i dont mind the young generation smelling of gasoline the way it does  cries and protests drowned dick out for a moment  i know i smell of it myself he went on but youve all failed to learn the good old modes of locomotion there isnt a girl of you that paula cant walk into the ground there isnt a fellow of you that graham and i cant walk into a receiving hospitaloh i know you can all crank engines and shift gears to the queens taste but there isnt one of you that can properly ride a horsea real horse in the only way i mean as for driving a smart pair of roadsters its a screech and how many of you husky lads hellscooting on the bay in your speedboats can take the wheel of an oldtime sloop or schooner without an auxiliary and get out of your own way in her  but we get there just the same the same girl retorted  and i dont deny it dick answered but you are not always pretty ill tell you a pretty sight that no one of you can ever present paula there with the reins of four slashing horses in her hands her foot on the brake swinging tallyho along a mountain road   on a warm morning in the cool arcade of the great patio a chance group of four or five among whom was paula formed about graham who had been reading alone after a time he returned to his magazine with such absorption that he forgot those about him until an awareness of silence penetrated to his consciousness he looked up all the others save paula had strayed off he could hear their distant laughter from across the patio but paula he surprised the look on her face in her eyes it was a look bent on him concerning him doubt speculation almost fear were in her eyes and yet in that swift instant he had time to note that it was a look deep and searchingalmost his quick fancy prompted the look of one peering into the justopened book of fate her eyes fluttered and fell and the color increased in her cheeks in an unmistakable blush twice her lips moved to the verge of speech yet caught so arrantly in the act she was unable to phrase any passing thought graham saved the painful situation by saying casually  do you know ive just been reading de vries eulogy of luther burbanks work and it seems to me that dick is to the domestic animal world what burbank is to the domestic vegetable world you are life makers herethumbing the stuff into new forms of utility and beauty  paula by this time herself again laughed and accepted the compliment  i fear me graham continued with easy seriousness as i watch your achievements that i can only look back on a misspent life why didnt i get in and make things im horribly envious of both of you  we are responsible for a dreadful lot of creatures being born she said it makes one breathless to think of the responsibility  the ranch certainly spells fecundity graham smiled i never before was so impressed with the flowering and fruiting of life everything here prospers and multiplies  oh paula cried breaking in with a sudden thought some day ill show you my goldfish i breed them tooyea and commercially i supply the san francisco dealers with their rarest strains and i even ship to new york and best of all i actually make moneyprofits i mean dicks books show it and he is the most rigid of bookkeepers there isnt a tackhammer on the place that isnt inventoried nor a horseshoe nail unaccounted for thats why he has such a staff of bookkeepers why do you know calculating every last least item of expense including average loss of time for colic and lameness out of fearfully endless columns of figures he has worked the cost of an hours labor for a draught horse to the third decimal place  but your goldfish graham suggested irritated by her constant dwelling on her husband  well dick makes his bookkeepers keep track of my goldfish in the same way im charged every hour of any of the ranch or house labor i use on the fishpostage stamps and stationery too if you please i have to pay interest on the plant he even charges me for the water just as if he were a city water company and i a householder and still i net ten per cent and have netted as high as thirty but dick laughs and says when ive deducted the wages of superintendencemy superintendence he meansthat ill find i am poorly paid or else am operating at a loss that with my net i couldnt hire so capable a superintendent  just the same thats why dick succeeds in his undertakings unless its sheer experiment he never does anything without knowing precisely to the last microscopic detail what it is he is doing  he is very sure graham observed  i never knew a man to be so sure of himself paula replied warmly and i never knew a man with half the warrant i know him he is a geniusbut only in the most paradoxical sense he is a genius because he is so balanced and normal that he hasnt the slightest particle of genius in him such men are rarer and greater than geniuses i like to think of abraham lincoln as such a type  i must admit i dont quite get you graham said  oh i dont dare to say that dick is as good as cosmically good as lincoln she hurried on dick is good but it is not that it is in their excessive balance normality lack of flare that they are of the same type now i am a genius for see i do things without knowing how i do them i just do them i get effects in my music that way take my diving to save my life i couldnt tell how i swandive or jump or do the turn and a half  dick on the other hand cant do anything unless he clearly knows in advance how he is going to do it he does everything with balance and foresight hes a general allaround wonder without ever having been a particular wonder at any one thingoh i know him hes never been a champion or a recordbreaker in any line of athletics nor has he been mediocre in any line and so with everything else mentally intellectually he is an evenly forged chain he has no massive links no weak links  im afraid im like you graham said that commoner and lesser creature a genius for i too on occasion flare and do the most unintentional things and i am not above falling on my knees before mystery  and dick hates mysteryor it would seem he does not content with knowing howhe is eternally seeking the why of the how mystery is a challenge to him it excites him like a red rag does a bull at once he is for ripping the husks and the heart from mystery so that he will know the how and the why when it will be no longer mystery but a generalization and a scientifically demonstrable fact   much of the growing situation was veiled to the three figures of it graham did not know of paulas desperate efforts to cling close to her husband who himself desperately busy with his thousand plans and projects was seeing less and less of his company he always appeared at lunch but it was a rare afternoon when he could go out with his guests paula did know from the multiplicity of long code telegrams from mexico that things were in a parlous state with the harvest group also she saw the agents and emissaries of foreign investors in mexico always in haste and often inopportune arriving at the ranch to confer with dick beyond his complaint that they ate the heart out of his time he gave her no clew to the matters discussed  my i wish you werent so busy she sighed in his arms on his knees one fortunate morning when at eleven oclock she had caught him alone  it was true she had interrupted the dictation of a letter into the phonograph and the sigh had been evoked by the warning cough of bonbright whom she saw entering with more telegrams in his hand  wont you let me drive you this afternoon behind duddy and fuddy just you and me and cut the crowd she begged  he shook his head and smiled  youll meet at lunch a weird combination he explained nobody else needs to know but ill tell you he lowered his voice while bonbright discreetly occupied himself at the filing cabinets theyre tampico oil folk samuels himself president of the nacisco and wishaar the big inside man of the pearsonbrooks crowdthe chap that engineered the purchase of the east coast railroad and the tiuana central when they tried to put the nacisco out of business and matthewsonhes the hiyuskookum big chief this side the atlantic of the palmerston interestsyou know the english crowd that fought the nacisco and the pearsonbrooks bunch so hard and oh therell be several others it shows you that things are rickety down mexico way when such a bunch stops scrapping and gets together  you see they are oil and im important in my way down there and they want me to swing the mining interests in with the oil truly big things are in the air and weve got to hang together and do something or get out of mexico and ill admit after they gave me the turndown in the trouble three years ago that ive sulked in my tent and made them come to see me  he caressed her and called her his armful of dearest woman although she detected his eye roving impatiently to the phonograph with its unfinished letter  and so he concluded with a pressure of his arms about her that seemed to hint that her moment with him was over and she must go that means the afternoon none will stop over and theyll be off and away before dinner  she slipped off his knees and out of his arms with unusual abruptness and stood straight up before him her eyes flashing her cheeks white her face set with determination as if about to say something of grave importance but a bell tinkled softly and he reached for the desk telephone  paula drooped and sighed inaudibly and as she went down the room and out the door and as bonbright stepped eagerly forward with the telegrams she could hear the beginning of her husbands conversation  no it is impossible hes got to come through or ill put him out of business that gentlemans agreement is all poppycock if it were only that of course he could break it but ive got some mighty interesting correspondence that hes forgotten about yes yes it will clinch it in any court of law ill have the file in your office by five this afternoon and tell him for me that if he tries to put through this trick ill break him ill put a competing line on and his steamboats will be in the receivers hands inside a year and hello are you there and just look up that point i suggested i am rather convinced youll find the interstate commerce has got him on two counts  nor did graham nor even paula imagine that dickthe keen one the deep one who could see and sense things yet to occur and out of intangible nuances and glimmerings build shrewd speculations and hypotheses that subsequent events often proved correctwas already sensing what had not happened but what might happen he had not heard paulas brief significant words at the hitching post nor had he seen graham catch her in that deep scrutiny of him under the arcade dick had heard nothing seen little but sensed much and even in advance of paula had he apprehended in vague ways what she afterward had come to apprehend  the most tangible thing he had to build on was the night immersed in bridge when he had not been unaware of the abrupt leaving of the piano after the singing of the gypsy trail nor when in careless smiling greeting of them when they came down the room to devil him over his losing had he failed to receive a hint or feeling of something unusual in paulas roguish teasing face on the moment laughing retorts giving as good as she sent dicks own laughing eyes had swept over graham beside her and likewise detected the unusual the man was overstrung had been dicks mental note at the time but why should he be overstrung was there any connection between his overstrungness and the sudden desertion by paula of the piano and all the while these questions were slipping through his thoughts he had laughed at their sallies dealt sorted his hand and won the bid on no trumps  yet to himself he had continued to discount as absurd and preposterous the possibility of his vague apprehension ever being realized it was a chance guess a silly speculation based upon the most trivial data he sagely concluded it merely connoted the attractiveness of his wife and of his friend butand on occasional moments he could not will the thought from coming uppermost in his mindwhy had they broken off from singing that evening why had he received the feeling that there was something unusual about it why had graham been overstrung                                         nor did bonbright one morning taking dictation of a telegram in the last hour before noon know that dicks casual sauntering to the window still dictating had been caused by the faint sound of hoofs on the driveway it was not the first of recent mornings that dick had so sauntered to the window to glance out with apparent absentness at the rush of the morning riding party in the last dash home to the hitching rails but he knew on this morning before the first figures came in sight whose those figures would be  braxton is safe he went on with the dictation without change of tone his eyes on the road where the riders must first come into view if things break he can get out across the mountains into arizona see connors immediately braxton left connors complete instructions connors tomorrow in washington give me fullest details any move signed  up the driveway the fawn and altadena clattered neck and neck dick had not been disappointed in the figures he expected to see from the rear cries and laughter and the sound of many hoofs tokened that the rest of the party was close behind  and the next one mr bonbright please put in the harvest code dick went on steadily while to himself he was commenting that graham was a passable rider but not an excellent one and that it would have to be seen to that he was given a heavier horse than altadena it is to jeremy braxton send it both ways there is a chance one or the other may get through     chapter xx    once again the tide of guests ebbed from the big house and more than one lunch and dinner found only the two men and paula at the table on such evenings while graham and dick yarned for their hour before bed paula no longer played soft things to herself at the piano but sat with them doing fine embroidery and listening to the talk  both men had much in common had lived life in somewhat similar ways and regarded life from the same angles their philosophy was harsh rather than sentimental and both were realists paula made a practice of calling them the pair of brass tacks  oh yes she laughed to them i understand your attitude you are successes the pair of youphysical successes i mean you have health you are resistant you can stand things you have survived where men less resistant have gone down you pull through african fevers and bury the other fellows this poor chap gets pneumonia in cripple creek and cashes in before you can get him to sea level now why didnt you get pneumonia because you were more deserving because you had lived more virtuously because you were more careful of risks and took more precautions  she shook her head  no because you were luckieri mean by birth by possession of constitution and stamina why dick buried his three mates and two engineers at guayaquil yellow fever why didnt the yellow fever germ or whatever it is kill dick and the same with you mr broad shouldered deepchested graham in this last trip of yours why didnt you die in the swamps instead of your photographer come confess how heavy was he how broad were his shoulders how deep his chestwide his nostrilstough his resistance  he weighed a hundred and thirtyfive graham admitted ruefully but he looked all right and fit at the start i think i was more surprised than he when he turned up his toes graham shook his head it wasnt because he was a light weight and small the small men are usually the toughest other things being equal but youve put your finger on the reason just the same he didnt have the physical stamina the resistanceyou know what i mean dick  in a way its like the quality of muscle and heart that enables some prizefighters to go the distancetwenty thirty forty rounds say dick concurred right now in san francisco there are several hundred youngsters dreaming of success in the ring ive watched them trying out all look good finebodied healthy fit as fiddles and young and their spirits are most willing and not one in ten of them can last ten rounds i dont mean they get knocked out i mean they blow up their muscles and their hearts are not made out of first grade fiber they simply are not made to move at high speed and tension for ten rounds and some of them blow up in four or five rounds and not one in forty can go the twentyround route give and take hammer and tongs one minute of rest to three of fight for a full hour of fighting and the lad who can last forty rounds is one in ten thousandlads like nelson gans and wolgast  you understand the point i am making paula took up here are the pair of you neither will see forty again youre a pair of hard bitten sinners youve gone through hardship and exposure that dropped others all along the way youve had your fun and folly youve roughed and rowdied over the world  played the wild ass graham laughed in  and drunk deep paula added why even alcohol hasnt burned you you were too tough you put the other fellows under the table or into the hospital or the grave and went your gorgeous way a song on your lips with tissues uncorroded and without even the morningafter headache and the point is that you are successes your muscles are blondbeast muscles your vital organs are blondbeast organs and from all this emanates your blondbeast philosophy thats why you are brass tacks and preach realism and practice realism shouldering and shoving and walking over lesser and unluckier creatures who dont dare talk back who like dicks prizefighting boys would blow up in the first round if they resorted to the arbitrament of force  dick whistled a long note of mock dismay  and thats why you preach the gospel of the strong paula went on if you had been weaklings youd have preached the gospel of the weak and turned the other cheek but youyou pair of bigmuscled giants when you are struck being what you are you dont turn the other cheek  no dick interrupted quietly we immediately roar knock his block off and then do itshes got us evan hip and thigh philosophy like religion is what the man is and is by him made in his own image  and while the talk led over the world paula sewed on her eyes filled with the picture of the two big men admiring wondering pondering without the surety of self that was theirs aware of a slipping and giving of convictions so long accepted that they had seemed part of her  later in the evening she gave voice to her trouble  the strangest part of it she said taking up a remark dick had just made is that too much philosophizing about life gets one worse than nowhere a philosophic atmosphere is confusingat least to a woman one hears so much about everything and against everything that nothing is sure for instance mendenhalls wife is a lutheran she hasnt a doubt about anything all is fixed ordained immovable stardrifts and iceages she knows nothing about and if she did they would not alter in the least her rules of conduct for men and women in this world and in relation to the next  but here with us you two pound your brass tacks terrence does a greek dance of epicurean anarchism hancock waves the glittering veils of bergsonian metaphysics leo makes solemn obeisance at the altar of beauty and dar hyal juggles his sophistic blastism to no end save all your applause for his cleverness dont you see the effect is that there is nothing solid in any human judgment nothing is right nothing is wrong one is left compassless rudderless chartless on a sea of ideas shall i do this must i refrain from that will it be wrong is there any virtue in it mrs mendenhall has her instant answer for every such question but do the philosophers  paula shook her head  no all they have is ideas they immediately proceed to talk about it and talk and talk and talk and with all their erudition reach no conclusion whatever and i am just as bad i listen and listen and talk and talk as i am talking now and remain convictionless there is no test  but there is dick said the old eternal test of truthwill it work  ah now you are pounding your favorite brass tack paula smiled and dar hyal with a few armwavings and wordwhirrings will show that all brass tacks are illusions and terrence that brass tacks are sordid irrelevant and nonessential things at best and hancock that the overhanging heaven of bergson is paved with brass tacks only that they are a much superior article to yours and leo that there is only one brass tack in the universe and that it is beauty and that it isnt brass at all but gold                                         come on red cloud go riding this afternoon paula asked her husband get the cobwebs out of your brain and let lawyers and mines and livestock go hang  id like to paul he answered but i cant ive got to rush in a machine all the way to the buckeye word came in just before lunch theyre in trouble at the dam there must have been a fault in the understrata and tooheavy dynamiting has opened it in short whats the good of a good dam when the bottom of the reservoir wont hold water  three hours later returning from the buckeye dick noted that for the first time paula and graham had gone riding together alone                                         the wainwrights and the coghlans in two machines out for a weeks trip to the russian river rested over for a day at the big house and were the cause of paulas taking out the tallyho for a picnic into the los baÃ±os hills starting in the morning it was impossible for dick to accompany them although he left blake in the thick of dictation to go out and see them off he assured himself that no detail was amiss in the harnessing and hitching and reseated the party insisting on graham coming forward into the boxseat beside paula  just must have a reserve of mans strength alongside of paula in case of need dick explained ive known a brakerod to carry away on a down grade somewhat to the inconvenience of the passengers some of them broke their necks and now to reassure you with paula at the helm ill sing you a song    what can little paula do     why drive a phaeton and two     can little paula do no more     yes drive a tallyho and four  all were in laughter as paula nodded to the grooms to release the horses heads took the feel of the four mouths on her hands and shortened and slipped the reins to adjustment of four horses into the collars and taut on the traces  in the babel of parting gibes to dick none of the guests was aware of aught else than a bright morning the promise of a happy day and a genial host bidding them a merry going but paula despite the keen exhilaration that should have arisen with the handling of four such horses was oppressed by a vague sadness in which somehow dicks being left behind figured through grahams mind dicks merry face had flashed a regret of conscience that instead of being seated there beside this one woman he should be on train and steamer fleeing to the other side of the world  but the merriness died on dicks face the moment he turned on his heel to enter the house it was a few minutes later than ten when he finished his dictation and mr blake rose to go he hesitated then said a trifle apologetically  you told me mr forrest to remind you of the proofs of your shorthorn book they wired their second hurryup yesterday  i wont be able to tackle it myself dick replied will you please correct the typographical submit the proofs to mr manson for correction of facttell him be sure to verify that pedigree of king of devonand ship them off  until eleven dick received his managers and foremen but not for a quarter of an hour after that did he get rid of his show manager mr pitts with the tentative makeup of the catalogue for the first annual stocksale on the ranch by that time mr bonbright was on hand with his sheaf of telegrams and the lunchhour was at hand ere they were cleaned up  for the first time alone since he had seen the tallyho off dick stepped out on his sleeping porch to the row of barometers and thermometers on the wall but he had come to consult not them but the girls face that laughed from the round wooden frame beneath them  paula paula he said aloud are you surprising yourself and me after all these years are you turning madcap at sober middle age  he put on leggings and spurs to be ready for riding after lunch and what his thoughts had been while buckling on the gear he epitomized to the girl in the frame  play the game he muttered and then after a pause as he turned to go a free field and no favor  and no favor                                         really if i dont go soon ill have to become a pensioner and join the philosophers of the madroÃ±o grove graham said laughingly to dick  it was the time of cocktail assembling and paula in addition to graham was the only one of the driving party as yet to put in an appearance  if all the philosophers together would just make one book dick demurred good lord man youve just got to complete your book here i got you started and ive got to see you through with it  paulas encouragement to graham to stay onmere stereotyped uninterested phraseswas music to dick his heart leapt after all might he not be entirely mistaken for two such mature wise middle aged individuals as paula and graham any such foolishness was preposterous and unthinkable they were not young things with their hearts on their sleeves  to the book he toasted he turned to paula a good cocktail he praised paul you excel yourself and you fail to teach oh joy the art his never quite touch yoursyes another please     chapter xxi    graham riding solitary through the redwood canyons among the hills that overlooked the ranch center was getting acquainted with selim the elevenhundredpound coalblack gelding which dick had furnished him in place of the lighter altadena as he rode along learning the good nature the roguishness and the dependableness of the animal graham hummed the words of the gypsy trail and allowed them to lead his thoughts quite carelessly foolishly thinking of bucolic lovers carving their initials on forest trees he broke a spray of laurel and another of redwood he had to stand in the stirrups to pluck a long stemmed fivefingered fern with which to bind the sprays into a cross when the patteran was fashioned he tossed it on the trail before him and noted that selim passed over without treading upon it glancing back graham watched it to the next turn of the trail a good omen was his thought that it had not been trampled  more fivefingered ferns to be had for the reaching more branches of redwood and laurel brushing his face as he rode invited him to continue the manufacture of patterans which he dropped as he fashioned them an hour later at the head of the canyon where he knew the trail over the divide was difficult and stiff he debated his course and turned back  selim warned him by nickering came an answering nicker from close at hand the trail was wide and easy and graham put his mount into a fox trot swung a wide bend and overtook paula on the fawn  hello he called hello hello  she reined in till he was alongside  i was just turning back she said why did you turn back i thought you were going over the divide to little grizzly  you knew i was ahead of you he asked admiring the frank boyish way of her eyes straightgazing into his  why shouldnt i i had no doubt at the second patteran  oh id forgotten about them he laughed guiltily why did you turn back  she waited until the fawn and selim had stepped over a fallen alder across the trail so that she could look into grahams eyes when she answered  because i did not care to follow your trailto follow anybodys trail she quickly amended i turned back at the second one  he failed of a ready answer and an awkward silence was between them both were aware of this awkwardness due to the known but unspoken things  do you make a practice of dropping patterans paula asked  the first i ever left he replied with a shake of the head but there was such a generous supply of materials it seemed a pity and besides the song was haunting me  it was haunting me this morning when i woke up she said this time her face straight ahead so that she might avoid a rope of wild grapevine that hung close to her side of the trail  and graham gazing at her face in profile at her crown of goldbrown hair at her singing throat felt the old ache at the heart the hunger and the yearning the nearness of her was a provocation the sight of her in her fawncolored silk corduroy tormented him with a rush of visions of that form of hersswimming mountain lad swan diving through forty feet of air moving down the long room in the dullblue dress of medieval fashion with the maddening kneelift of the clinging draperies  a penny for them she interrupted his visioning his answer was prompt  praise to the lord for one thing you havent once mentioned dick  do you so dislike him  be fair he commanded almost sternly it is because i like him otherwise  what she queried  her voice was brave although she looked straight before her at the fawns pricking ears  i cant understand why i remain i should have been gone long ago  why she asked her gaze still on the pricking ears  be fair be fair he warned you and i scarcely need speech for understanding  she turned full upon him her cheeks warming with color and without speech looked at him her whiphand rose quickly half way as if to press her breast and half way paused irresolutely then dropped down to her side but her eyes he saw were glad and startled there was no mistake the startle lay in them and also the gladness and he knowing as it is given some men to know changed the bridle rein to his other hand reined close to her put his arm around her drew her till the horses rocked and knee to knee and lips on lips kissed his desire to hers there was no mistakepressure to pressure warmth to warmth and with an elate thrill he felt her breathe against him  the next moment she had torn herself loose the blood had left her face her eyes were blazing her ridingwhip rose as if to strike him then fell on the startled fawn simultaneously she drove in both spurs with such suddenness and force as to fetch a groan and a leap from the mare  he listened to the soft thuds of hoofs die away along the forest path himself dizzy in the saddle from the pounding of his blood when the last hoofbeat had ceased he halfslipped halfsank from his saddle to the ground and sat on a mossy boulder he was hard hitharder than he had deemed possible until that one great moment when he had held her in his arms well the die was cast  he straightened up so abruptly as to alarm selim who sprang back the length of his bridle rein and snorted  what had just occurred had been unpremeditated it was one of those inevitable things it had to happen he had not planned it although he knew now that had he not procrastinated his going had he not drifted he could have foreseen it and now going could not mend matters the madness of it the hell of it and the joy of it was that no longer was there any doubt speech beyond speech his lips still tingling with the memory of hers she had told him he dwelt over that kiss returned his senses swimming deliciously in the sea of remembrance  he laid his hand caressingly on the knee that had touched hers and was grateful with the humility of the true lover wonderful it was that so wonderful a woman should love him this was no girl this was a woman knowing her own will and wisdom and she had breathed quickly in his arms and her lips had been live to his he had evoked what he had given and he had not dreamed after the years that he had had so much to give  he stood up made as if to mount selim who nozzled his shoulder then paused to debate  it was no longer a question of going that was definitely settled dick had certain rights true but paula had her rights and did he have the right to go after what had happened unless  unless she went with him to go now was to kiss and ride away surely since the world of sex decreed that often the same men should love the one woman and therefore that perfidy should immediately enter into such a trianglesurely it was the lesser evil to be perfidious to the man than to the woman  it was a real world he pondered as he rode slowly along and paula and dick and he were real persons in it were themselves conscious realists who looked the facts of life squarely in the face this was no affair of priest and code of other wisdoms and decisions of themselves must it be settled some one would be hurt but life was hurt success in living was the minimizing of pain dick believed that himself thanks be the three of them believed it and it was nothing new under the sun the countless triangles of the countless generations had all been somehow solved this then would be solved all human affairs reached some solution  he shook sober thought from his brain and returned to the bliss of memory reaching his hand to another caress of his knee his lips breathing again to the breathing of hers against them he even reined selim to a halt in order to gaze at the hollow resting place of his bent arm which she had filled  not until dinner did graham see paula again and he found her the very usual paula not even his eye keen with knowledge could detect any sign of the days great happening nor of the anger that had whitened her face and blazed in her eyes when she halflifted her whip to strike him in everything she was the same little lady of the big house even when it chanced that her eyes met his they were serene untroubled with no hint of any secret in them what made the situation easier was the presence of several new guests women friends of dick and her come for a couple of days  next morning in the music room he encountered them and paula at the piano  dont you sing mr graham a miss hoffman asked  she was the editor of a womans magazine published in san francisco graham had learned  oh adorably he assured her dont i mrs forrest he appealed  it is quite true paula smiled if for no other reason that he is kind enough not to drown me quite  and nothing remains but to prove our words he volunteered theres a duet we sang the other evening he glanced at paula for a sign which is particularly good for my kind of singing again he gave her a passing glance and received no cue to her will or wish the music is in the living room ill go and get it  its the gypsy trail a bright catchy thing he heard her saying to the others as he passed out  they did not sing it so recklessly as on that first occasion and much of the thrill and some of the fire they kept out of their voices but they sang it more richly more as the composer had intended it and with less of their own particular interpretation but graham was thinking as he sang and he knew too that paula was thinking that in their hearts another duet was pulsing all unguessed by the several women who applauded the songs close  you never sang it better ill wager he told paula  for he had heard a new note in her voice it had been fuller rounder with a generousness of volume that had vindicated that singing throat  and now because i know you dont know ill tell you what a patteran is she was saying     chapter xxii    dick boy your position is distinctly carlylean terrence mcfane said in fatherly tones  the sages of the madrono grove were at table and with paula dick and graham made up the dinner party of seven  mere naming of ones position does not settle it terrence dick replied i know my point is carlylean but that does not invalidate it heroworship is a very good thing i am talking not as a mere scholastic but as a practical breeder with whom the application of mendelian methods is an everyday commonplace  and i am to conclude hancock broke in that a hottentot is as good as a white man  now the south speaks aaron dick retorted with a smile prejudice not of birth but of early environment is too strong for all your philosophy to shake it is as bad as herbert spencers handicap of the early influence of the manchester school  and spencer is on a par with the hottentot dar hyal challenged  dick shook his head  let me say this hyal i think i can make it clear the average hottentot or the average melanesian is pretty close to being on a par with the average white man the difference lies in that there are proportionately so many more hottentots and negroes who are merely average while there is such a heavy percentage of white men who are not average who are above average these are what i called the pace makers that bring up the speed of their own race averagemen note that they do not change the nature or develop the intelligence of the averagemen but they give them better equipment better facilities enable them to travel a faster collective pace  give an indian a modern rifle in place of his bow and arrows and he will become a vastly more efficient gamegetter the indian hunter himself has not changed in the slightest but his entire indian race sported so few of the aboveaverage men that all of them in ten thousand generations were unable to equip him with a rifle  go on dick develop the idea terrence encouraged i begin to glimpse your drive and youll soon have aaron on the run with his race prejudices and silly vanities of superiority  these aboveaverage men dick continued these pacemakers are the inventors the discoverers the constructionists the sporting dominants a race that sports few such dominants is classified as a lower race as an inferior race it still hunts with bows and arrows it is not equipped now the average white man per se is just as bestial just as stupid just as inelastic just as stagnative just as retrogressive as the average savage but the average white man has a faster pace the large number of sporting dominants in his society give him the equipment the organization and impose the law  what great man what heroand by that i mean what sporting dominant has the hottentot race produced the hawaiian race produced only one kamehameha the negro race in america at the outside only two booker t washington and du boisand both with white blood in them  paula feigned a cheerful interest while the exposition went on she did not appear bored but to grahams sympathetic eyes she seemed inwardly to droop and in an interval of tilt between terrence and hancock she said in a low voice to graham  words words words so much and so many of them i suppose dick is righthe so nearly always is but i confess to my old weakness of inability to apply all these floods of words to lifeto my life i mean to my living to what i should do to what i must do her eyes were unfalteringly fixed on his while she spoke leaving no doubt in his mind to what she referred i dont know what bearing sporting dominants and racepaces have on my life they show me no right or wrong or way for my particular feet and now that theyve started they are liable to talk the rest of the evening  oh i do understand what they say she hastily assured him but it doesnt mean anything to me words words wordsand i want to know what to do what to do with myself what to do with you what to do with dick  but the devil of speech was in dick forrests tongue and before graham could murmur a reply to paula dick was challenging him for data on the subject from the south american tribes among which he had traveled to look at dicks face it would have been unguessed that he was aught but a carefree happy arguer nor did graham nor did paula dicks dozen years wife dream that his casual careless glances were missing no movement of a hand no change of position on a chair no shade of expression on their faces  whats up was dicks secret interrogation paulas not herself shes positively nervous and all the discussion is responsible and grahams off color his brain isnt working up to mark hes thinking about something else rather than about what he is saying what is that something else  and the devil of speech behind which dick hid his secret thoughts impelled him to urge the talk wider and wilder  for once i could almost hate the four sages paula broke out in an undertone to graham who had finished furnishing the required data  dick himself talking in cool sentences amplifying his thesis apparently engrossed in his subject saw paula make the aside although no word of it reached his ears saw her increasing nervousness saw the silent sympathy of graham and wondered what had been the few words she uttered while to the listening table he was saying  fischer and speiser are both agreed on the paucity of unitcharacters that circulate in the heredity of the lesser races as compared with the immense variety of unitcharacters in say the french or german or english  no one at the table suspected that dick deliberately dangled the bait of a new trend to the conversation nor did leo dream afterward that it was the mastercraft and deviltry of dick rather than his own question that changed the subject when he demanded to know what part the female sporting dominants played in the race  females dont sport leo my lad terrence with a wink to the others answered him females are conservative they keep the type true they fix it and hold it and are the everlasting clog on the chariot of progress if it wasnt for the females every blessed mothers son of us would be a sporting dominant i refer to our distinguished breeder and practical mendelian whom we have with us this evening to verify my random statements  let us get down first of all to bedrock and find out what we are talking about dick was prompt on the uptake what is woman he demanded with an air of earnestness  the ancient greeks said woman was natures failure to make a man dar hyal answered the while the imp of mockery laughed in the corners of his mouth and curled his thin cynical lips derisively  leo was shocked his face flushed there was pain in his eyes and his lips were trembling as he looked wistful appeal to dick  the halfsex hancock gibed as if the hand of god had been withdrawn midway in the making leaving her but a halfsoul a groping soul at best  no i no the boy cried out you must not say such thingsdick you know tell them tell them  i wish i could dick replied but this soul discussion is vague as souls themselves we all know of our selves that we often grope are often lost and are never so much lost as when we think we know where we are and all about ourselves what is the personality of a lunatic but a personality a little less or very much less coherent than ours what is the personality of a moron of an idiot of a feeble minded child of a horse a dog a mosquito a bullfrog a woodtick a garden snail and leo what is your own personality when you sleep and dream when you are seasick when you are in love when you have colic when you have a cramp in the leg when you are smitten abruptly with the fear of death when you are angry when you are exalted with the sense of the beauty of the world and think you think all inexpressible unutterable thoughts  i say think you think intentionally did you really think then your sense of the beauty of the world would not be inexpressible unutterable it would be clear sharp definite you could put it into words your personality would be clear sharp and definite as your thoughts and words ergo leo when you deem in exalted moods that you are at the summit of existence in truth you are thrilling vibrating dancing a mad orgy of the senses and not knowing a step of the dance or the meaning of the orgy you dont know yourself your soul your personality at that moment is a vague and groping thing possibly the bullfrog inflating himself on the edge of a pond and uttering hoarse croaks through the darkness to a warty mate possesses also at that moment a vague and groping personality  no leo personality is too vague for any of our vague personalities to grasp there are seeming men with the personalities of women there are plural personalities there are twolegged human creatures that are neither fish flesh nor fowl we as personalities float like fogwisps through glooms and darknesses and lightflashings it is all fog and mist and we are all foggy and misty in the thick of the mystery  maybe its mystification instead of mysterymanmade mystification paula said  there talks the true woman that leo thinks is not a halfsoul dick retorted the point is leo sex and soul are all interwoven and tangled together and we know little of one and less of the other  but women are beautiful the boy stammered  oh ho hancock broke in his black eyes gleaming wickedly so leo you identify woman with beauty  the young poets lips moved but he could only nod  very well then let us take the testimony of painting during the last thousand years as a reflex of economic conditions and political institutions and by it see how man has molded and daubed woman into the image of his desire and how she has permitted him  you must stop baiting leo paula interfered and be truthful all of you and say what you do know or do believe  woman is a very sacred subject dar hyal enunciated solemnly  there is the madonna graham suggested stepping into the breach to paulas aid  and the cÃ©rÃ©brale terrence added winning a nod of approval from dar hyal  one at a time hancock said let us consider the madonnaworship which was a particular womanworship in relation to the general woman worship of all women today and to which leo subscribes man is a lazy loafing savage he dislikes to be pestered he likes tranquillity repose and he finds himself ever since man began saddled to a restless nervous irritable hysterical traveling companion and her name is woman she has moods tears vanities angers and moral irresponsibilities he couldnt destroy her he had to have her although she was always spoiling his peace what was he to do  trust him to find a waythe cunning rascal terrence interjected  he made a heavenly image of her hancock kept on he idealized her good qualities and put her so far away that her bad qualities couldnt get on his nerves and prevent him from smoking his quiet lazy pipe of peace and meditating upon the stars and when the ordinary everyday woman tried to pester he brushed her aside from his thoughts and remembered his heavenwoman the perfect woman the bearer of life and custodian of immortality  then came the reformation down went the worship of the mother and there was man still saddled to his reposedestroyer what did he do then  ah the rascal terrence grinned  he said i will make of you a dream and an illusion and he did the madonna was his heavenly woman his highest conception of woman he transferred all his idealized qualities of her to the earthly woman to every woman and he has fooled himself into believing in them and in her ever since like leo does  for an unmarried man you betray an amazing intimacy with the pestiferousness of woman dick commented or is it all purely theoretical terrence began to laugh  dick boy its laura marholm aarons been just reading he can spout her chapter and verse  and with all this talk about woman we have not yet touched the hem of her garment graham said winning a grateful look from paula and leo  there is love leo breathed no one has said one word about love  and marriage laws and divorces and polygamy and monogamy and free love hancock rattled off  and why leo dar hyal queried is woman in the game of love always the pursuer the huntress  oh but she isnt the boy answered quietly with an air of superior knowledge that is just some of your shaw nonsense  bravo leo paula applauded  then wilde was wrong when he said woman attacks by sudden and strange surrenders dar hyal asked  but dont you see protested leo all such talk makes woman a monster a creature of prey as he turned to dick he stole a side glance at paula and love welled in his eyes is she a creature of prey dick  no dick answered slowly with a shake of head and gentleness was in his voice for sake of what he had just seen in the boys eyes i cannot say that woman is a creature of prey nor can i say she is a creature preyed upon nor will i say she is a creature of unfaltering joy to man but i will say that she is a creature of much joy to man   and of much foolishness hancock added  of much fine foolishness dick gravely amended  let me ask leo something dar hyal said leo why is it that a woman loves the man who beats her  and doesnt love the man who doesnt beat her leo countered  precisely  well dar you are partly right and mostly wrongoh i have learned about definitions from you fellows youve cunningly left them out of your two propositions now ill put them in for you a man who beats a woman he loves is a low type man a woman who loves the man who beats her is a low type woman no high type man beats the woman he loves no high type woman and all unconsciously leos eyes roved to paula could love a man who beats her  no leo dick said i assure you i have never never beaten paula  so you see dar leo went on with flushing cheeks you are wrong paula loves dick without being beaten  with what seemed pleased amusement beaming on his face dick turned to paula as if to ask her silent approval of the lads words but what dick sought was the effect of the impact of such words under the circumstances he apprehended in paulas eyes he thought he detected a flicker of something he knew not what grahams face he found expressionless insofar as there was no apparent change of the expression of interest that had been there  woman has certainly found her st george tonight graham complimented leo you shame me here i sit quietly by while you fight three dragons  and such dragons paula joined in if they drove ohay to drink what will they do to you leo  no knight of love can ever be discomfited by all the dragons in the world dick said and the best of it leo is in this case the dragons are more right than you think and you are more right than they just the same  heres a dragon thats a good dragon leo lad terrence spoke up this dragon is going to desert his disreputable companions and come over on your side and be a saint terrence and this saint terrence has a lovely question to ask you  let this dragon roar first hancock interposed leo by all in love that is sweet and lovely i ask you why do lovers out of jealousy so often kill the woman they love  because they are hurt because they are insane came the answer and because they have been unfortunate enough to love a woman so low in type that she could be guilty of making them jealous  but leo love will stray dick prompted you must give a more sufficient answer  true for dick terrence supplemented and its helping you i am to the full stroke of your sword love will stray among the highest types and when it does in steps the greeneyed monster suppose the most perfect woman you can imagine should cease to love the man who does not beat her and come to love another man who loves her and will not beat herwhat then all highest types mind you now up with your sword and slash into the dragons  the first man will not kill her nor injure her in any way leo asserted stoutly because if he did he would not be the man you describe he would not be high type but low type  you mean he would get out of the way dick asked at the same time busying himself with a cigarette so that he might glance at no ones face  leo nodded gravely  he would get out of the way and he would make the way easy for her and he would be very gentle with her  let us bring the argument right home hancock said well suppose youre in love with mrs forrest and mrs forrest is in love with you and you run away together in the big limousine  oh but i wouldnt the boy blurted out his cheeks burning  leo you are not complimentary paula encouraged  its just supposing leo hancock urged  the boys embarrassment was pitiful and his voice quivered but he turned bravely to dick and said  that is for dick to answer  and ill answer dick said i wouldnt kill paula nor would i kill you leo that wouldnt be playing the game no matter what i felt at heart id say bless you my children but just the same he paused and the laughter signals in the corners of his eyes advertised a whimseyid say to myself that leo was making a sad mistake you see he doesnt know paula  she would be for interrupting his meditations on the stars terrence smiled  never never leo i promise you paula exclaimed  there do you belie yourself mrs forrest terrence assured her in the first place you couldnt help doing it besides itd be your bounden duty to do it and finally if i may say so as somewhat of an authority when i was a mad young lover of a man with my heart full of a woman and my eyes full of the stars twas ever the dearest delight to be loved away from them by the woman out of my heart  terrence if you keep on saying such lovely things cried paula ill run away with both you and leo in the limousine  hurry the day said terrence gallantly but leave space among your fripperies for a few books on the stars that leo and i may be studying in odd moments  the combat ebbed away from leo and dar hyal and hancock beset dick  what do you mean by playing the game dar hyal asked  just what i said just what leo said dick answered and he knew that paulas boredom and nervousness had been banished for some time and that she was listening with an interest almost eager in my way of thinking and in accord with my temperament the most horrible spiritual suffering i can imagine would be to kiss a woman who endured my kiss  suppose she fooled you say for old sakes sake or through desire not to hurt you or pity for you hancock propounded  it would be to me the unforgivable sin came dicks reply it would not be playing the gamefor her i cannot conceive the fairness nor the satisfaction of holding the woman one loves a moment longer than she loves to be held leo is very right the drunken artisan with his fists may arouse and keep love alive in the breast of his stupid mate but the higher human males the males with some shadow of rationality some glimmer of spirituality cannot lay rough hands on love with leo i would make the way easy for the woman and i would be very gentle with her  then what becomes of your boasted monogamic marriage institution of western civilization dar hyal asked  and hancock you argue for free love then  i can only answer with a hackneyed truism dick said there can be no love that is not free always please remember the point of view is that of the higher types and the point of view answers you dar the vast majority of individuals must be held to law and labor by the monogamic institution or by a stern rigid marriage institution of some sort they are unfit for marriage freedom or love freedom freedom of love for them would be merely license of promiscuity only such nations have risen and endured where god and the state have kept the peoples instincts in discipline and order  then you dont believe in the marriage laws for say yourself dar hyal inquired while you do believe in them for other men  i believe in them for all men children family career society the stateall these things make marriage legal marriage imperative and by the same token that is why i believe in divorce men all men and women all women are capable of loving more than once of having the old love die and of finding a new love born the state cannot control love any more than can a man or a woman when one falls in love one falls in love and thats all he knows about it there it is throbbing sighing singing thrilling love but the state can control license  it is a complicated free love that you stand for hancock criticised true and for the reason that man living in society is a most complicated animal  but there are men lovers who would die at the loss of their loved one leo surprised the table by his initiative they would die if she died they would dieoh so more quicklyif she lived and loved another  well theyll have to keep on dying as they have always died in the past dick answered grimly and no blame attaches anywhere for their deaths we are so made that our hearts sometimes stray  my heart would never stray leo asserted proudly unaware that all at the table knew his secret i could never love twice i know  true for you lad terrence approved the voice of all true lovers is in your throat tis the absoluteness of love that is its joyhow did shelley put itor was it keatsall a wonder and a wild delight sure a miserable skinflint of a halfbaked lover would it be that could dream there was aught in woman form onethousandth part as sweet as ravishing and enticing as glorious and wonderful as his own woman that he could ever love again                                         and as they passed out from the dining room dick continuing the conversation with dar hyal was wondering whether paula would kiss him good night or slip off to bed from the piano and paula talking to leo about his latest sonnet which he had shown her was wondering if she could kiss dick and was suddenly greatly desirous to kiss him she knew not why     chapter xxiii    there was little talk that same evening after dinner paula singing at the piano disconcerted terrence in the midst of an apostrophe on love he quit a phrase midmost to listen to the something new he heard in her voice then slid noiselessly across the room to join leo at full length on the bearskin dar hyal and hancock likewise abandoned the discussion each isolating himself in a capacious chair graham seeming least attracted browsed in a current magazine but dick observed that he quickly ceased turning the pages nor did dick fail to catch the new note in paulas voice and to endeavor to sense its meaning  when she finished the song the three sages strove to tell her all at the same time that for once she had forgotten herself and sung out as they had always claimed she could leo lay without movement or speech his chin on his two hands his face transfigured  its all this talk on love paula laughed and all the lovely thoughts leo and terrence  and dick have put into my head  terrence shook his long mop of irongray hair  into your heart youd be meaning he corrected tis the very heart and throat of love that are yours this night and for the first time dear lady have i heard the full fair volume that is yours never again plaint that your voice is thin thick it is and round it is as a great rope a great golden rope for the mooring of argosies in the harbors of the happy isles  and for that i shall sing you the gloria she answered to celebrate the slaying of the dragons by saint leo by saint terrence  and of course by saint richard  dick missing nothing of the talk saved himself from speech by crossing to the concealed sideboard and mixing for himself a scotch and soda  while paula sang the gloria he sat on one of the couches sipping his drink and remembering keenly once before he had heard her sing like thatin paris during their swift courtship and directly afterward during their honeymoon on the all away  a little later using his empty glass in silent invitation to graham he mixed highballs for both of them and when graham had finished his suggested to paula that she and graham sing the gypsy trail  she shook her head and began das kraut vergessenheit  she was not a true woman she was a terrible woman the songs close wrung from leo and he was a true lover she broke his heart but still he loved her he cannot love again because he cannot forget his love for her  and now red cloud the song of the acorn paula said smiling over to her husband put down your glass and be good and plant the acorns  dick lazily hauled himself off the couch and stood up shaking his head mutinously as if tossing a mane and stamping ponderously with his feet in simulation of mountain lad  ill have leo know that he is not the only poet and loveknight on the ranch listen to mountain lads song all wonder and wild delight terrence and more mountain lad doesnt moon about the loved one he doesnt moon at all he incarnates love and rears right up in meeting and tells them so listen to him  dick filled the room and shook the air with wild glad stallion nickering and then with manetossing and footpawing chanted  hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills i fill the wide valleys the mares hear me and startle in quiet pastures for they know me the land is filled with fatness and the sap is in the trees it is the spring the spring is mine i am monarch of my kingdom of the spring the mares remember my voice they knew me aforetimes through their mothers before them hear me i am eros i stamp upon the hills and the wide valleys are my heralds echoing the sound of my approach  it was the first time the sages of the madrono grove had heard dicks song and they were loud in applause hancock took it for a fresh start in the discussion and was beginning to elaborate a biologic bergsonian definition of love when he was stopped by terrence who had noticed the pain that swept across leos face  go on please dear lady terrence begged and sing of love only of love for it is my experience that i meditate best upon the stars to the accompaniment of a womans voice  a little later oh joy entering the room waited till paula finished a song then moved noiselessly to graham and handed him a telegram dick scowled at the interruption  very importanti think the chinese explained to him  who took it dick demanded  mei took it was the answer night clerk at eldorado call on telephone he say important i take it  it is fairly so graham spoke up having finished reading the message can i get a train out tonight for san francisco dick  oh joy come back a moment dick called looking at his watch what train for san francisco stops at eldorado  eleventen came the instant information plenty time not too much i call chauffeur  dick nodded  you really must jump out tonight he asked graham  really it is quite important will i have time to pack  dick gave a confirmatory nod to oh joy and said to graham  just time to throw the needful into a grip he turned to oh joy is oh my up yet  yessr  send him to mr grahams room to help and let me know as soon as the machine is ready no limousine tell saunders to take the racer  one fine big strapping man that terrence commented after graham had left the room  they had gathered about dick with the exception of paula who remained at the piano listening  one of the few men id care to go along with hell for leather on a forlorn hope or anything of that sort dick said he was on the nethermere when she went ashore at pango in the 97 hurricane pango is just a strip of sand twelve feet above high water mark a lot of cocoanuts and uninhabited forty women among the passengers english officers wives and such graham had a bad arm big as a leg snake bite  it was a thundering sea boats couldnt live they smashed two and lost both crews four sailors volunteered in succession to carry a light line ashore and each man in turn dead at the end of it was hauled back on board while they were untying the last one graham with an arm like a leg stripped for it and went to it and he did it although the pounding he got on the sand broke his bad arm and staved in three ribs but he made the line fast before he quit in order to haul the hawser ashore six more volunteered to go in on evans line to the beach four of them arrived and only one woman of the forty was lostshe died of heart disease and fright  i asked him about it once he was as bad as an englishman all i could get out of the beggar was that the recovery was uneventful thought that the salt water the exercise and the breaking of the bone had served as counterirritants and done the arm good  oh joy and graham entered the room from opposite ends dick saw that grahams first questing glance was for paula  all ready sir oh joy announced  dick prepared to accompany his guest outside to the car but paula evidenced her intention of remaining in the house graham started over to her to murmur perfunctory regrets and goodby  and she warm with what dick had just told of him pleasured at the goodly sight of him dwelling with her eyes on the light high poise of head the careless sunsanded hair and the lightness almost debonaireness of his carriage despite his weight of body and breadth of shoulders as he drew near to her she centered her gaze on the long gray eyes whose hint of drooping lids hinted of boyish sullenness she waited for the expression of sullenness to vanish as the eyes lighted with the smile she had come to know so well  what he said was ordinary enough as were her regrets but in his eyes as he held her hand a moment was the significance which she had unconsciously expected and to which she replied with her own eyes the same significance was in the pressure of the momentary handclasp all unpremeditated she responded to that quick pressure as he had said there was little need for speech between them  as their hands fell apart she glanced swiftly at dick for she had learned much in their dozen years together of his flashes of observance and had come to stand in awe of his almost uncanny powers of guessing facts from nuances and of linking nuances into conclusions often startling in their thoroughness and correctness but dick his shoulder toward her laughing over some quip of hancock was just turning his laughtercrinkled eyes toward her as he started to accompany graham  no was her thought surely dick had seen nothing of the secret little that had been exchanged between them it had been very little very quicka light in the eyes a muscular quiver of the fingers and no lingering how could dick have seen or sensed their eyes had certainly been hidden from dick likewise their clasped hands for grahams back had been toward him  just the same she wished she had not made that swift glance at dick she was conscious of a feeling of guilt and the thought of it hurt her as she watched the two big men of a size and blondness go down the room side by side of what had she been guilty she asked herself why should she have anything to hide yet she was honest enough to face the fact and accept without quibble that she had something to hide and her cheeks burned at the thought that she was being drifted into deception  i wont be but a couple of days graham was saying as he shook hands with dick at the car  dick saw the square straight look of his eyes and recognized the firmness and heartiness of his gripping hand graham half began to say something then did not and dick knew he had changed his mind when he said  i think when i get back that ill have to pack  but the book dick protested inwardly cursing himself for the leap of joy which had been his at the others words  thats just why graham answered ive got to get it finished it doesnt seem i can work like you do the ranch is too alluring i cant get down to the book i sit over it and sit over it but the confounded meadowlarks keep echoing in my ears and i begin to see the fields and the redwood canyons and selim and after i waste an hour i give up and ring for selim and if it isnt that its any one of a thousand other enchantments  he put his foot on the runningboard of the pulsing car and said well so long old man  come back and make a stab at it urged dick if necessary well frame up a respectable daily grind and ill lock you in every morning until youve done it and if you dont do your work all day all day youll stay locked in ill make you workgot cigarettesmatches  right o  let her go saunders dick ordered the chauffeur and the car seemed to leap out into the darkness from the brilliantly lighted porte cochÃ©re  back in the house dick found paula playing to the madrono sages and ensconced himself on the couch to wait and wonder if she would kiss him good night when bedtime came it was not he recognized as if they made a regular schedule of kissing it had never been like that often and often he did not see her until midday and then in the presence of guests and often and often she slipped away to bed early disturbing no one with a good night kiss to her husband which might well hint to them that their bedtime had come  no dick concluded whether or not she kissed him on this particular night it would be equally without significance but still he wondered  she played on and sang on interminably until at last he fell asleep when he awoke he was alone in the room paula and the sages had gone out quietly he looked at his watch it marked one oclock she had played unusually late he knew for he knew she had just gone it was the cessation of music and movement that had awakened him  and still he wondered often he napped there to her playing and always when she had finished she kissed him awake and sent him to bed but this night she had not perhaps after all she was coming back he lay and drowsed and waited the next time he looked at his watch it was two oclock she had not come back  he turned off the lights and as he crossed the house pressed off the hall lights as he went while the many unimportant little nothings almost of themselves ranged themselves into an ordered text of doubt and conjecture that he could not refrain from reading  on his sleeping porch glancing at his barometers and thermometers her laughing face in the round frame caught his eyes and standing before it even bending closer to it he studied her long  oh well he muttered as he drew up the bedcovers propped the pillows behind him and reached for a stack of proofsheets whatever it is ill have to play it  he looked sidewise at her picture  but oh little woman i wish you wouldnt was the sighed good night     chapter xxiv    as luck would have it beyond chance guests for lunch or dinner the big house was empty in vain on the first and second days did dick lay out his work or defer it so as to be ready for any suggestion from paula to go for an afternoon swim or drive  he noted that she managed always to avoid the possibility of being kissed from her sleeping porch she called good night to him across the wide patio in the morning he prepared himself for her eleven oclock greeting mr agar and mr pitts with important matters concerning the forthcoming ranch sale of stock still unsettled dick promptly cleared out at the stroke of eleven up she was he knew for he had heard her singing as he waited seated at his desk for once he was idle a tray of letters before him continued to need his signature he remembered this morning pilgrimage of hers had been originated by her and by her somewhat persistently had been kept up and an adorable thing it was he decidedthat soft call of good morning merry gentleman and the folding of her kimonoclad figure in his arms  he remembered further that he had often cut that little visit short conveying the impression to her even while he clasped her of how busy he was and he remembered more than once the certain little wistful shadow on her face as she slipped away  quarter past eleven and she had not come he took down the receiver to telephone the dairy and in the swift rush of womens conversation ere he hung up he caught paulas voice  bother mr wade bring all the little wades and come if only for a couple of days  which was very strange of paula she had invariably welcomed the intervals of no guests when she and he were left alone with each other for a day or for several days and now she was trying to persuade mrs wade to come down from sacramento it would seem that paula did not wish to be alone with him and was seeking to protect herself with company  he smiled as he realized that that morning embrace now that it was not tendered him had become suddenly desirable the thought came to him of taking her away with him on one of their traveljaunts that would solve the problem perhaps and he would hold her very close to him and draw her closer why not an alaskan hunting trip she had always wanted to go or back to their old sailing grounds in the days of the all awaythe south seas steamers ran direct between san francisco and tahiti in twelve days they could be ashore in papeete he wondered if lavaina still ran her boarding house and his quick vision caught a picture of paula and himself at breakfast on lavainas porch in the shade of the mango trees  he brought his fist down on the desk no by god he was no coward to run away with his wife for fear of any man and would it be fair to her to take her away possibly from where her desire lay true he did not know where her desire lay nor how far it had gone between her and graham might it not be a spring madness with her that would vanish with the spring unfortunately he decided in the dozen years of their marriage she had never evidenced any predisposition toward spring madness she had never given his heart a moments doubt herself tremendously attractive to men seeing much of them receiving their admiration and even court she had remained always her equable and serene self dick forrests wife  good morning merry gentleman  she was peeping in on him quite naturally from the hall her eyes and lips smiling to him blowing him a kiss from her finger tips  and good morning my little haughty moon he called back himself equally his natural self  and now she would come in he thought and he would fold her in his arms and put her to the test of the kiss  he opened his arms in invitation but she did not enter instead she startled with one hand gathered her kimono at her breast with the other picked up the trailing skirt as if for flight at the same time looking apprehensively down the hall yet his keen ears had caught no sound she smiled back at him blew him another kiss and was gone  ten minutes later he had no ears for bonbright who telegrams in hand startled him as he sat motionless at his desk as he had sat without movement for ten minutes  and yet she was happy dick knew her too long in all the expressions of her moods not to realize the significance of her singing over the house in the arcades and out in the patio he did not leave his workroom till the stroke of lunch nor did she as she sometimes did come to gather him up on the way at the lunch gong from across the patio he heard her trilling die away into the house in the direction of the dining room  a colonel harrison stoddardcolonel from younger service in the national guard himself a retired merchant prince whose hobby was industrial relations and social unrestheld the table most of the meal upon the extension of the employers liability act so as to include agricultural laborers but paula found a space in which casually to give the news to dick that she was running away for the afternoon on a jaunt up to wickenberg to the masons  of course i dont know when ill be backyou know what the masons are and i dont dare ask you to come though id like you along  dick shook his head  and so she continued if youre not using saunders  dick nodded acquiescence  im using callahan this afternoon he explained on the instant planning his own time now that paula was out of the question i never can make out paul why you prefer saunders callahan is the better driver and of course the safest  perhaps thats why she said with a smile safety first means slowest most  just the same id back callahan against saunders on a speedtrack dick championed  where are you bound she asked  oh to show colonel stoddard my oneman and nohorse farmyou know the automatically cultivated tenacre stunt ive been frivoling with a lot of changes have been made that have been waiting a week for me to see tried out ive been too busy and after that im going to take him over the colonywhat do you thinkfive additions the last week  i thought the membership was full paula said  it was and still is dick beamed but these are babies and the least hopeful of the families had the rashness to have twins  a lot of wiseacres are shaking their heads over that experiment of yours and i make free to say that i am merely holding my judgment youve got to show me by bookkeeping colonel stoddard was saying immensely pleased at the invitation to be shown over in person  dick scarcely heard him such was the rush of other thoughts paula had not mentioned whether mrs wade and the little wades were coming much less mentioned that she had invited them yet this dick tried to consider no lapse on her part for often and often like himself she had guests whose arrival was the first he knew of their coming  it was however evident that mrs wade was not coming that day else paula would not be running away thirty miles up the valley that was it and there was no blinking it she was running away and from him she could not face being alone with him with the consequent perils of intimacyand perilous in such circumstances could have but the significance he feared and further she was making the evening sure she would not be back for dinner or till long after dinner it was a safe wager unless she brought the whole wickenberg crowd with her she would be back late enough to expect him to be in bed well he would not disappoint her he decided grimly as he replied to colonel stoddard  the experiment works out splendidly on paper with decently wide margins for human nature and there i admit is the doubt and the dangerthe human nature but the only way to test it is to test it which is what i am doing  it wont be the first dick has charged to profit and loss paula said  but five thousand acres all the working capital for two hundred and fifty farmers and a cash salary of a thousand dollars each a year colonel stoddard protested a few such failuresif it failswould put a heavy drain on the harvest  thats what the harvest needs dick answered lightly  colonel stoddard looked blank  precisely dick confirmed drainage you know the mines are floodedthe mexican situation  it was during the morning of the second daythe day of grahams expected returnthat dick who by being on horseback at eleven had avoided a repetition of the hurt of the previous days good morning merry gentleman across the distance of his workroom encountered ah ha in a hall with an armful of freshcut lilacs the houseboys way led toward the tower room but dick made sure  where are you taking them ah ha he asked  mr grahams roomhe come today  now whose thought was that dick pondered ah hasoh joysor paulas he remembered having heard graham more than once express his fancy for their lilacs  he deflected his course from the library and strolled out through the flowers near the tower room through the open windows of it came paulas happy humming dick pressed his lower lip with tight quickness between his teeth and strolled on  some great as well as many admirable men and women had occupied that room and for them paula had never supervised the flower arrangement dick meditated oh joy himself a master of flowers usually attended to that or had his housestaff ably drilled to do it  among the telegrams bonbright handed him was one from graham which dick read twice although it was simple and unmomentous being merely a postponement of his return  contrary to custom dick did not wait for the second lunchgong at the sound of the first he started for he felt the desire for one of oh joys cocktailsthe need of a prod of courage after the lilacs to meet paula but she was ahead of him he found herwho rarely drank and never alonejust placing an empty cocktail glass back on the tray  so she too had needed courage for the meal was his deduction as he nodded to oh joy and held up one finger  caught you at it he reproved gaily secret tippling the gravest of symptoms little i thought the day i stood up with you that the wife i was marrying was doomed to fill an alcoholics grave  before she could retort a young man strolled in whom she and dick greeted as mr winters and who also must have a cocktail dick tried to believe that it was not relief he sensed in paulas manner as she greeted the newcomer he had never seen her quite so cordial to him before although often enough she had met him at any rate there would be three at lunch  mr winters an agricultural college graduate and special writer for the pacific rural press as well as a sort of protÃ©gÃ© of dick had come for data for an article on california fishponds and dick mentally arranged his afternoons program for him  got a telegram from evan he told paula wont be back till the four oclock day after tomorrow  and after all my trouble she exclaimed now the lilacs will be wilted and spoiled  dick felt a warm glow of pleasure there spoke his frank straightforward paula no matter what the game was or its outcome at least she would play it without the petty deceptions she had always been that waytoo transparent to make a success of deceit  nevertheless he played his own part by a glance of scarcely interested interrogation  why in grahams room she explained i had the boys bring a big armful and i arranged them all myself hes so fond of them you know  up to the end of lunch she had made no mention of mrs wades coming and dick knew definitely she was not coming when paula queried casually  expecting anybody  he shook his head and asked are you doing anything this afternoon  havent thought about anything she answered and now i suppose i cant plan upon you with mr winters to be told all about fish  but you can dick assured her im turning him over to mr hanley whos got the trout counted down to the last egg hatched and who knows all the grandfather bass by name ill tell you what he paused and considered then his face lighted as with a sudden idea its a loafing afternoon lets take the rifles and go potting squirrels i noticed the other day theyve become populous on that hill above the little meadow  but he had not failed to observe the flutter of alarm that shadowed her eyes so swiftly and that so swiftly was gone as she clapped her hands and was herself  but dont take a rifle for me she said  if youd rather not he began gently  oh i want to go but i dont feel up to shooting ill take le galliennes last book alongit just came inand read to you in betweenwhiles remember the last time i did that when we went squirreling it was his quest of the golden girl i read to you     chapter xxv    paula on the fawn and dick on the outlaw rode out from the big house as nearly side by side as the outlaws wicked perversity permitted the conversation she permitted was fragmentary with tiny ears laid back and teeth exposed she would attempt to evade dicks restraint of rein and spur and win to a bite of paulas leg or the fawns sleek flank and with every defeat the pink flushed and faded in the whites of her eyes her restless headtossing and pitching attempts to rear thwarted by the martingale never ceased save when she pranced and sidled and tried to whirl  this is the last year of her dick announced shes indomitable ive worked two years on her without the slightest improvement she knows me knows my ways knows i am her master knows when she has to give in but is never satisfied she nourishes the perennial hope that some time shell catch me napping and for fear shell miss that time she never lets any time go by  and some time she may catch you paula said  thats why im giving her up it isnt exactly a strain on me but soon or late shes bound to get me if theres anything in the law of probability it may be a milliontoone shot but heaven alone knows where in the series of the million that fatal one is going to pop up  youre a wonder red cloud paula smiled  why  you think in statistics and percentages averages and exceptions i wonder when we first met what particular formula you measured me up by  ill be darned if i did he laughed back there was where all signs failed i didnt have a statistic that applied to you i merely acknowledged to myself that here was the most wonderful female woman ever born with two good legs and i knew that i wanted her more than i had ever wanted anything i just had to have her  and got her paula completed for him but since red cloud since surely youve accumulated enough statistics on me  a few quite a few he admitted but i hope never to get the last one  he broke off at sound of the unmistakable nicker of mountain lad the stallion appeared the cowboy on his back and dick gazed for a moment at the perfect action of the beasts great swinging trot  weve got to get out of this he warned as mountain lad at sight of them broke into a gallop  together they pricked their mares whirled them about and fled while from behind they heard the soothing whoas of the rider the thuds of the heavy hoofs on the roadway and a wild imperative neigh the outlaw answered and the fawn was but a moment behind her from the commotion they knew mountain lad was getting tempestuous  leaning to the curve they swept into a crossroad and in fifty paces pulled up where they waited till the danger was past  hes never really injured anybody yet paula said as they started back  except when he casually stepped on cowleys toes you remember he was laid up in bed for a month dick reminded her straightening out the outlaw from a sidle and with a flicker of glance catching the strange look with which paula was regarding him  there was question in it he could see and love in it and fearyes almost fear or at least apprehension that bordered on dismay but most of all a seeking a searching a questioning not entirely ungermane to her mood was his thought had been that remark of his thinking in statistics  but he made that he had not seen whipping out his pad and with an interested glance at a culvert they were passing making a note  they missed it he said it should have been repaired a month ago  what has become of all those nevada mustangs paula inquired  this was a flyer dick had taken when a bad season for nevada pasture had caused mustangs to sell for a song with the alternative of starving to death he had shipped a trainload down and ranged them in his wilder mountain pastures to the west  its time to break them he answered and im thinking of a real oldfashioned rodeo next week what do you say have a barbecue and all the rest and invite the country side  and then you wont be there paula objected  ill take a day off is it a go  they reined to one side of the road as she agreed to pass three farm tractors all with their trailage of ganged discs and harrows  moving them across to the rolling meadows he explained they pay over horses on the right ground  rising from the home valley passing through cultivated fields and wooded knolls they took a road busy with many wagons hauling road dressing from the rockcrusher they could hear growling and crunching higher up  needs more exercise than ive been giving her dick remarked jerking the outlaws bared teeth away from dangerous proximity to the fawns flank  and its disgraceful the way ive neglected duddy and fuddy paula said ive kept their feed down like a miser but theyre a lively handful just the same  dick heard her idly but within fortyeight hours he was to remember with hurt what she had said  they continued on till the crunch of the rockcrusher died away penetrated a belt of woodland crossed a tiny divide where the afternoon sunshine was winecolored by the manzanita and rosecolored by madronos and dipped down through a young planting of eucalyptus to the little meadow but before they reached it they dismounted and tied their horses dick took the 22 automatic rifle from his saddle holster and with paula advanced softly to a clump of redwoods on the edge of the meadow they disposed themselves in the shade and gazed out across the meadow to the steep slope of hill that came down to it a hundred and fifty yards away  there they arethreefour of them paula whispered as her keen eyes picked the squirrels out amongst the young grain  these were the wary ones the sports in the direction of infinite caution who had shunned the poisoned grain and steel traps of dicks vermin catchers they were the survivors each of a score of their fellows not so cautious themselves fit to repopulate the hillside  dick filled the chamber and magazine with tiny cartridges examined the silencer and lying at full length leaning on his elbow sighted across the meadow there was no sound of explosion when he fired only the click of the mechanism as the bullet was sped the empty cartridge ejected a fresh cartridge flipped into the chamber and the trigger recocked a big duncolored squirrel leaped in the air fell over and disappeared in the grain dick waited his eye along the rifle and directed toward several holes around which the dry earth showed widely as evidence of the grain which had been destroyed when the wounded squirrel appeared scrambling across the exposed ground to safety the rifle clicked again and he rolled over on his side and lay still  at the first click every squirrel but the stricken one had made into its burrow remained nothing to do but wait for their curiosity to master caution this was the interval dick had looked forward to as he lay and scanned the hillside for curious heads to appear he wondered if paula would have something to say to him in trouble she was but would she keep this trouble to herself it had never been her way always soon or late she brought her troubles to him but then he reflected she had never had a trouble of this nature before it was just the one thing that she would be least prone to discuss with him on the other hand he reasoned there was her everlasting frankness he had marveled at it and joyed in it all their years together was it to fail her now  so he lay and pondered she did not speak she was not restless he could hear no movement when he glanced to the side at her he saw her lying on her back eyes closed arms outstretched as if tired  a small head the color of the dry soil of its home peeped from a hole dick waited long minutes until assured that no danger lurked the owner of the head stood full up on its hind legs to seek the cause of the previous click that had startled it again the rifle clicked  did you get him paula queried without opening her eyes  yea and a fat one dick answered i stopped a line of generations right there  an hour passed the afternoon sun beat down but was not uncomfortable in the shade a gentle breeze fanned the young grain into lazy wavelets at times and stirred the redwood boughs above them dick added a third squirrel to the score paulas book lay beside her but she had not offered to read  anything the matter he finally nerved himself to ask  no headachea beastly little neuralgic hurt across the eyes thats all  too much embroidery he teased  not guilty was her reply  all was natural enough in all seeming but dick as he permitted an unusually big squirrel to leave its burrow and crawl a score of feet across the bare earth toward the grain thought to himself no there will be no talk between us this day nor will we nestle and kiss lying here in the grass  his victim was now at the edge of the grain he pulled trigger the creature fell over lay still a moment then ran in quick awkward fashion toward its hole click click click went the mechanism puffs of dust leaped from the earth close about the fleeing squirrel showing the closeness of the misses dick fired as rapidly as he could twitch his forefinger on the trigger so that it was as if he played a stream of lead from a hose  he had nearly finished refilling the magazine when paula spoke  my what a fusilladeget him  yea grandfather of all squirrels a mighty graineater and destroyer of sustenance for young calves but nine long smokeless cartridges on one squirrel doesnt pay ill have to do better  the sun dropped lower the breeze died out dick managed another squirrel and sadly watched the hillside for more he had arranged the time and made his bid for confidence the situation was as grave as he had feared graver it might be for all he knew for his world was crumbling about him old landmarks were shifting their places he was bewildered shaken had it been any other woman than paula he had been so sure there had been their dozen years to vindicate his surety  five oclock sun he get low he announced rising to his feet and preparing to help her up  it did me so much goodjust resting she said as they started for the horses my eyes feel much better its just as well i didnt try to read to you  and dont be piggy dick warned as lightly as if nothing were amiss with him dont dare steal the tiniest peek into le gallienne youve got to share him with me later on hold up your handnow honest to god paul  honest to god she obeyed  and may jackasses dance on your grandmothers grave  and may jackasses dance on my grandmothers grave she solemnly repeated  the third morning of grahams absence dick saw to it that he was occupied with his dairy manager when paula made her eleven oclock pilgrimage peeped in upon him and called her good morning merry gentleman from the door the masons arriving in several machines with their boisterous crowd of young people saved paula for lunch and the afternoon and on her urging dick noted she made the evening safe by holding them over for bridge and dancing  but the fourth morning the day of grahams expected return dick was alone in his workroom at eleven bending over his desk signing letters he heard paula tiptoe into the room he did not look up but while he continued writing his signature he listened with all his soul to the faint silken swish of her kimono he knew when she was bending over him and all but held his breath but when she had softly kissed his hair and called her good morning merry gentleman she evaded the hungry sweep of his arm and laughed her way out what affected him as strongly as the disappointment was the happiness he had seen in her face she who so poorly masked her moods was brighteyed and eager as a child and it was on this afternoon that graham was expected dick could not escape making the connection  he did not care to ascertain if she had replenished the lilacs in the tower room and at lunch which was shared with three farm college students from davis he found himself forced to extemporize a busy afternoon for himself when paula tentatively suggested that she would drive graham up from eldorado  drive dick asked  duddy and fuddy she explained theyre all on edge and i just feel like exercising them and myself of course if youll share the exercise well drive anywhere you say and let him come up in the machine  dick strove not to think there was anxiety in her manner while she waited for him to accept or decline her invitation  poor duddy and fuddy would be in the happy hunting grounds if they had to cover my ground this afternoon he laughed at the same time mapping his program between now and dinner ive got to do a hundred and twenty miles im taking the racer and its going to be some dust and bump and only an occasional low place i havent the heart to ask you along you go on and take it out of duddy and fuddy  paula sighed but so poor an actress was she that in the sigh intended for him as a customary reluctant yielding of his company he could not fail to detect the relief at his decision  whither away she asked brightly and again he noticed the color in her face the happiness and the brilliance of her eyes  oh im shooting away down the river to the dredging workcarlson insists i must advise himand then up in to sacramento running over the teal slough land on the way to see wing fo wong  and in heavens name who is this wing fo wong she laughingly queried that you must trot and see him  a very important personage my dear worth all of two millionsmade in potatoes and asparagus down in the delta country im leasing three hundred acres of the teal slough land to him dick addressed himself to the farm students that land lies just out of sacramento on the west side of the river its a good example of the land famine that is surely coming it was tule swamp when i bought it and i was well laughed at by the oldtimers i even had to buy out a dozen hunting preserves it averaged me eighteen dollars an acre and not so many years ago either  you know the tule swamps worthless save for ducks and lowwater pasturage it cost over three hundred an acre to dredge and drain and to pay my quota of the river reclamation work and on what basis of value do you think i am making a ten years lease to old wing fo wong two thousand an acre i couldnt net more than that if i truckfarmed it myself those chinese are wizards with vegetables and gluttons for work no eight hours for them its eighteen hours the last coolie is a partner with a microscopic share thats the way wing fo wong gets around the eight hour law                                         twice warned and once arrested was dick through the long afternoon he drove alone and though he drove with speed he drove with safety accidents for which he personally might be responsible were things he did not tolerate and they never occurred that same sureness and definiteness of adjustment with which without fumbling or approximating he picked up a pencil or reached for a doorknob was his in the more complicated adjustments with which as instance he drove a highpowered machine at high speed over busy country roads  but drive as he would transact business as he would at high pressure with carlson and wing fo wong continually in the middle ground of his consciousness persisted the thought that paula had gone out of her way and done the most unusual in driving graham the long eight miles from eldorado to the ranch  phew he started to mutter a thought aloud then suspended utterance and thought as he jumped the racer from fortyfive to seventy miles an hour swept past to the left of a horse and buggy going in the same direction and slanted back to the right side of the road with margin to spare but seemingly under the nose of a runabout coming from the opposite direction he reduced his speed to fifty and took up his thought  phew imagine little pauls thoughts if i dared that drive with some charming girl  he laughed at the fancy as he pictured it for most early in their marriage he had gauged paulas capacity for quiet jealousy never had she made a scene or dropped a direct remark or raised a question but from the first quietly but unmistakably she had conveyed the impression of hurt that was hers if he at all unduly attended upon any woman  he grinned with remembrance of mrs dehameny the pretty little brunette widowpaulas friend not hiswho had visited in the long ago in the big house paula had announced that she was not riding that afternoon and at lunch had heard him and mrs dehameny arrange to ride into the redwood canyons beyond the grove of the philosophers and who but paula not long after their start should overtake them and make the party three he had smiled to himself at the time and felt immensely tickled with paula for neither mrs dehameny nor the ride with her had meant anything to him  so it was from the beginning that he had restricted his attentions to other women ever since he had been far more circumspect than paula he had even encouraged her given her a free hand always had been proud that his wife did attract fine fellows had been glad that she was glad to be amused or entertained by them and with reason he mused he had been so safe so sure of hermore so he acknowledged than had she any right to be of him and the dozen years had vindicated his attitude so that he was as sure of her as he was of the diurnal rotation of the earth and now was the form his fancy took the rotation of the earth was a shaky proposition and old oom pauls flat world might be worth considering  he lifted the gauntlet from his left wrist to snatch a glimpse at his watch in five minutes graham would be getting off the train at eldorado dick himself homeward bound west from sacramento was eating up the miles in a quarter of an hour the train that he identified as having brought graham went by not until he was well past eldorado did he overtake duddy and fuddy and the trap graham sat beside paula who was driving dick slowed down as he passed waved a hello to graham and as he jumped into speed again called cheerily  sorry ive got to give you my dust ill beat you a game of billiards before dinner evan if you ever get in     chapter xxvi    this cant go on we must do somethingat once  they were in the music room paula at the piano her face turned up to graham who stood close to her almost over her  you must decide graham continued  neither face showed happiness in the great thing that had come upon them now that they considered what they must do  but i dont want you to go paula urged i dont know what i want you must bear with me i am not considering myself i am past considering myself but i must consider dick i must consider you i i am so unused to such a situation she concluded with a wan smile  but it must be settled dear love dick is not blind  what has there been for him to see she demanded nothing except that one kiss in the canyon and he couldnt have seen that do you think of anything elsei challenge you sir  would that there were he met the lighter touch in her mood then immediately relapsed i am mad over you mad for you and there i stop i do not know if you are equally mad i do not know if you are mad at all  as he spoke he dropped his hand to hers on the keys and she gently withdrew it  dont you see he complained yet you wanted me to come back  i wanted you to come back she acknowledged with her straight look into his eyes i wanted you to come back she repeated more softly as if musing  and im all at sea he exclaimed impatiently you do love me  i do love you evanyou know that but she paused and seemed to be weighing the matter judicially  but what he commanded go on  but i love dick too isnt it ridiculous  he did not respond to her smile and her eyes delightedly warmed to the boyish sullenness that vexed his own eyes a thought was hot on his tongue but he restrained the utterance of it while she wondered what it was disappointed not to have had it  it will work out she assured him gravely it will have to work out somehow dick says all things work out all is change what is static is dead and were not dead any of us are we  i dont blame you for loving dick for for continuing to love dick he answered impatiently and for that matter i dont see what you find in me compared with him this is honest he is a great man to me and great heart is his name she rewarded him with a smile and nod of approval but if you continue to love dick how about me  but i love you too  it cant be he cried tearing himself from the piano to make a hasty march across the room and stand contemplating the keith on the opposite wall as if he had never seen it before  she waited with a quiet smile pleasuring in his unruly impetuousness  you cant love two men at once he flung at her  oh but i do evan thats what i am trying to work out only i dont know which i love more dick i have known a long time you you are a  recent acquaintance he broke in returning to her with the same angry stride  not that no not that evan you have made a revelation to me of myself i love you as much as dick i love you more ii dont know  she broke down and buried her face in her hands permitting his hand to rest tenderly on her shoulder  you see it is not easy for me she went on there is so much involved so much that i cannot understand you say you are all at sea then think of me all at sea and worse confounded youoh why talk about ityou are a man with a mans experiences with a mans nature it is all very simple to you she loves me she loves me not but i am tangled confused iand i wasnt born yesterdayhave had no experience in loving variously i have never had affairs i loved only one man and now you you and this love for you have broken into a perfect marriage evan  i know he said  i dont know she went on i must have time either to work it out myself or to let it work itself out if it only werent for dick her voice trailed off pathetically  unconsciously grahams hand went farther about her shoulder  no nonot yet she said softly as softly she removed it her own lingering caressingly on his a moment ere she released it when you touch me i cant think she begged ii cant think  then i must go he threatened without any sense of threatening she made a gesture of protest the present situation is impossible unbearable i feel like a cur and all the time i know i am not a cur i hate deceptionoh i can lie with the pathan to the pathanbut i cant deceive a man like great heart id prefer going right up to him and saying dick i love your wife she loves me what are you going to do about it  do so paula said fired for the moment  graham straightened up with resolution  i will and now  no no she cried in sudden panic you must go away again her voice trailed off as she said but i cant let you go                                         if dick had had any reason to doubt his suspicion of the state of paulas heart that reason vanished with the return of graham he need look nowhere for confirmation save to paula she was in a flushed awakening burgeoning like the full spring all about them a happier tone in her happy laugh a richer song in her throat a warmness of excitement and a continuous energy of action animating her she was up early and to bed late she did not conserve herself but seemed to live on the champagne of her spirits until dick wondered if it was because she did not dare allow herself time to think  he watched her lose flesh and acknowledged to himself that the one result was to make her look lovelier than ever to take on an almost spiritual delicacy under her natural vividness of color and charm  and the big house ran on in its frictionless happy and remorseless way dick sometimes speculated how long it would continue so to run on and recoiled from contemplation of a future in which it might not so run on as yet he was confident no one knew no one guessed but himself but how long could that continue not long he was certain paula was not sufficiently the actress and were she a master at concealment of trivial sordid detail yet the new note and flush of her would be beyond the power of any woman to hide  he knew his asiatic servants were marvels of discernmentand discretion he had to add but there were the women women were cats to the best of them it would be great joy to catch the radiant unimpeachable paula as clay as any daughter of eve and any chance woman in the house for a day or an evening might glimpse the situationpaulas situation at least for he could not make out grahams attitude yet trust a woman to catch a woman  but paula different in other ways was different in this he had never seen her display cattishness never known her to be on the lookout for other women on the chance of catching them tripping except in relation to him and he grinned again at the deliciousness of the affair with mrs dehameney which had been an affair only in paulas apprehension  among other things of wonderment dick speculated if paula wondered if he knew  and paula did wonder and for a time without avail she could detect no change in his customary ways and moods or treatment of her he turned off his prodigious amount of work as usual played as usual chanted his songs and was the happy good fellow she tried to imagine an added sweetness toward her but vexed herself with the fear that it was imagined  but it was not for long that she was in doubt sometimes in a crowd at table in the living room in the evening or at cards she would gaze at him through halfveiled lashes when he was unaware until she was certain she saw the knowledge in his eyes and face but no hint of this did she give to graham his knowing would not help matters it might even send him away which she frankly admitted to herself was the last thing she should want to happen  but when she came to a realization that she was almost certain dick knew or guessed she hardened deliberately dared to play with the fire if dick knewsince he knew she framed it to herselfwhy did he not speak he was ever a straight talker she both desired and feared that he might until the fear faded and her earnest hope was that he would he was the one who acted did things no matter what they were she had always depended upon him as the doer graham had called the situation a triangle well dick could solve it he could solve anything then why didnt he  in the meantime she persisted in her ardent recklessness trying not to feel the consciencepricks of her divided allegiance refusing to think too deeply riding the top of the wave of her lifeas she assured herself living living living at times she scarcely knew what she thought save that she was very proud in having two such men at heel pride had always been one of her dominant keynotespride of accomplishment achievement mastery as with her music her appearance her swimming it was all oneto dance as she well knew beautifully to dress with distinction and beauty to swandive all grace and courage as few women dared or all fragility to avalanche down the spillway on the back of mountain lad and by the will and steel of her swim the huge beast across the tank  she was proud a woman of their own race and type to watch these two grayeyed blond men together she was excited feverish but not nervous quite coldly sometimes she compared the two when they were together and puzzled to know for which of them she made herself more beautiful more enticing graham she held and she had held dick and strove still to hold him  there was almost a touch of cruelty in the tingles of pride that were hers at thought of these two royal men suffering for her and because of her for she did not hide from herself the conviction that if dick knew or rather since he did know he too must be suffering she assured herself that she was a woman of imagination and purpose in sex matters and that no part of her attraction toward graham lay merely in his freshness newness difference and she denied to herself that passion played more than the most minor part deep down she was conscious of her own recklessness and madness and of an end to it all that could not but be dreadful to some one of them or all of them but she was content willfully to flutter far above such deeps and to refuse to consider their existence alone looking at herself in her mirror she would shake her head in mock reproof and cry out oh you huntress you huntress and when she did permit herself to think a little gravely it was to admit that shaw and the sages of the madrono grove might be right in their diatribes on the hunting proclivities of women  she denied dar hyals statement that woman was natures failure to make a man but again and again came to her wildes woman attacks by sudden and strange surrenders had she so attacked graham she asked herself sudden and strange to her were the surrenders she had already made were there to be more he wanted to go with her or without her he wanted to go but she held himhow was there a tacit promise of surrenders to come and she would laugh away further consideration confine herself to the fleeting present and make her body more beautiful and mood herself to be more fascinating and glow with happiness in that she was living thrilling as she had never dreamed to live and thrill     chapter xxvii    but it is not the way for a man and a woman in propinquity to maintain a definite unwavering distance asunder imperceptibly paula and graham drew closer from lingering eyegazings and handtouchings the way led to permitted caresses until there was a second clasping in the arms and a second kiss long on the lips nor this time did paula flame in anger instead she commanded  you must not go  i must not stay graham reiterated for the thousandth time oh i have kissed behind doors and been guilty of all the rest of the silly rubbish he complained but this is you and this is dick  it will work out i tell you evan  come with me then and of ourselves work it out come now  she recoiled  remember graham encouraged what dick said at dinner the night leo fought the dragonsthat if it were you paula his wife who ran away he would say bless you my children  and that is just why it is so hard evan he is great heart you named him well listenyou watch him now he is as gentle as he said he would be that nightgentle toward me i mean and more you watch him  he knowshe has spoken graham broke in  he has not spoken but i am sure he knows or guesses you watch him he wont compete against you  compete  just that he wont compete remember at the rodeo yesterday he was breaking mustangs when our party arrived but he never mounted again now he is a wonderful horsebreaker you tried your hand frankly while you did fairly well you couldnt touch him but he wouldnt show off against you that alone would make me certain that he guesses  listen of late havent you noticed that he never questions a statement you make as he used to question as he questions every one else he continues to play billiards with you because there you best him he fences and singlesticks with youthere you are even but he wont box or wrestle with you  he can outbox and outwrestle me graham muttered ruefully  you watch and you will see what i mean by not competing he is treating me like a spirited colt giving me my head to make a mess of things if i want to not for the world would he interfere oh trust me i know him it is his own code that he is living up to he could teach the philosophers what applied philosophy is  no no listen she rushed over grahams attempt to interrupt i want to tell you more there is a secret staircase that goes up from the library to dicks work room only he and i use it and his secretaries when you arrive at the head of it you are right in his room surrounded by shelves of books i have just come from there i was going in to see him when i heard voices of course it was ranch business i thought and they would soon be gone so i waited it was ranch business but it was so interesting so what hancock would call illuminating that i remained and eavesdropped it was illuminating of dick i mean  it was the wife of one of the workmen dick had on the carpet such things do arise on a large place like this i wouldnt know the woman if i saw her and i didnt recognize her name she was whimpering out her trouble when dick stopped her never mind all that he said what i want to know is did you give smith any encouragement  smith isnt his name but he is one of our foremen and has worked eight years for dick  oh no sir i could hear her answer he went out of his way from the first to bother me ive tried to keep out of his way always besides my husbands a violenttempered man and i did so want him to hold his job here hes worked nearly a year for you now and there arent any complaints are there before that it was irregular work for a long time and we had real hard times it wasnt his fault he aint a drinking man he always  thats all right dick stopped her his work and habits have nothing to do with the matter now you are sure you have never encouraged mr smith in any way and she was so sure that she talked for ten minutes detailing the foremans persedition of her she had a pleasant voiceone of those sweet timid womans voices and undoubtedly is quite attractive it was all i could do to resist peeping i wanted to see what she looked like  now this trouble yesterday morning dick said was it general i mean outside of your husband and mr smith was the scene such that those who live around you knew of it  yes sir you see he had no right to come into my kitchen my husband doesnt work under him anyway and he had his arm around me and was trying to kiss me when my husband came in my husband has a temper but he aint overly strong mr smith would make two of him so he pulled a knife and mr smith got him by the arms and they fought all over the kitchen i knew there was murder going to be done and i run out screaming for help the folks in the other cottagesd heard the racket already theyd smashed the window and the cook stove and the place was filled with smoke and ashes when the neighbors dragged them away from each other id done nothing to deserve all that disgrace you know sir the way the women will talk  and dick hushed her up there and took all of five minutes more in getting rid of her her great fear was that her husband would lose his place from what dick told her i waited he had made no decision and i knew the foreman was next on the carpet in he came id have given the world to see him but i could only listen  dick jumped right into the thick of it he described the scene and uproar and smith acknowledged that it had been riotous for a while she says she gave you no encouragement dick said next  then she lies said smith she has that way of looking with her eyes thats an invitation she looked at me that way from the first but it was by wordofmouth invitation that i was in her kitchen yesterday morning we didnt expect the husband but she began to struggle when he hove in sight when she says she gave me no encouragement  never mind all that dick stopped him its not essential but it is mr forrest if i am to clear myself smith insisted  no it is not essential to the thing you cant clear yourself of dick answered and i could hear that cold hard judicial note come into his voice smith could not understand dick told him the thing you have been guilty of mr smith is the scene the disturbance the scandal the wagging of the womens tongues now going on forty to the minute the impairment of the discipline and order of the ranch all of which is boiled down to the one grave thing the hurt to the ranch efficiency  and still smith couldnt see he thought the charge was of violating social morality by pursuing a married woman and tried to mitigate the offense by showing the woman encouraged him and by pleading and after all mr forrest a man is only a man and i admit she made a fool of me and i made a fool of myself mr smith dick said youve worked for me eight years youve been a foreman six years of that time i have no complaint against your work you certainly do know how to handle labor about your personal morality i dont care a damn you can be a mormon or a turk for all it matters to me your private acts are your private acts and are no concern of mine as long as they do not interfere with your work or my ranch any one of my drivers can drink his head off saturday night and every saturday night thats his business but the minute he shows a holdover on monday morning that is taken out on my horses that excites them or injures them or threatens to injure them or that decreases in the slightest the work they should perform on monday that moment it is my business and the driver goes down the hill  you you mean mr forrest smith stuttered that that im to go down the hill that is just what i mean mr smith you are to go down the hill not because you climbed over another mans fence thats your business and his but because you were guilty of causing a disturbance that is an impairment of ranch efficiency  do you know evan paula broke in on her recital dick can nose more human tragedy out of columns of ranch statistics than can the average fiction writer out of the whirl of a great city take the milk reportsthe individual reports of the milkersso many pounds of milk morning and night from cow soandso so many pounds from cow soandso he doesnt have to know the man but there is a decrease in the weight of milk mr parkman hell say to the head dairyman is barchi peratta married yes sir is he having trouble with his wife yes sir  or it will be mr parkman simpkins has the best longtime record of any of our milkers now hes slumped whats up mr parkman doesnt know investigate says dick theres something on his chest talk to him like an uncle and find out weve got to get it off his chest and mr parkman finds out simpkins boy working his way through stanford university has elected the joyride path and is in jail waiting trial for forgery dick put his own lawyers on the case smoothed it over got the boy out on probation and simpkins milk reports came back to par and the best of it is the boy made good dick kept an eye on him saw him through the college of engineering and hes now working for dick on the dredging end earning a hundred and fifty a month married with a future before him and his father still milks  you are right graham murmured sympathetically i well named him when i named him great heart  i call him my rock of ages paula said gratefully he is so solid he stands in any stormoh you dont really know him he is so sure he stands right up hes never taken a cropper in his life god smiles on him god has always smiled on him hes never been beaten down to his knees yet i i should not care to see that sight it would be heartbreaking and evan her hand went out to his in a pleading gesture that merged into a halfcaress i am afraid for him now that is why i dont know what to do it is not for myself that i back and fill and hesitate if he were ignoble if he were narrow if he were weak or had one tiniest shred of meanness if he had ever been beaten to his knees before why my dear my dear i should have been gone with you long ago  her eyes filled with sudden moisture she stilled him with a pressure of her hand and to regain herself she went back to her recital  your little finger mr smith i consider worth more to me and to the world dick told him than the whole body of this womans husband heres the report on him willing eager to please not bright not strong an indifferent workman at best yet you have to go down the hill and i am very very sorry  oh yes there was more but ive given you the main of it you see dicks code there and he lives his code he accords latitude to the individual whatever the individual may do so long as it does not hurt the group of individuals in which he lives is his own affair he believed smith had a perfect right to love the woman and to be loved by her if it came to that i have heard him always say that love could not be held nor enforced truly did i go with you he would say bless you my children though it broke his heart he would say it past love he believes gives no hold over the present and every hour of love i have heard him say pays for itself on both sides quittance in full he claims there can be no such thing as a love debt laughs at the absurdity of loveclaims  and i agree with him graham said you promised to love me always says the jilted one and then strives to collect as if it were a promissory note for so many dollars dollars are dollars but love lives or dies when it is dead how can it be collected we are all agreed and the way is simple we love it is enough why delay another minute  his fingers strayed along her fingers on the keyboard as he bent to her first kissing her hair then slowly turning her face up to his and kissing her willing lips  dick does not love me like you she said not madly i mean he has had me so long i think i have become a habit to him and often and often before i knew you i used to puzzle whether he cared more for the ranch or more for me  it is so simple graham urged all we have to do is to be straightforward let us go  he drew her to her feet and made as if to start  but she drew away from him suddenly sat down and buried her flushed face in her hands  you do not understand evan i love dick i shall always love him  and me graham demanded sharply  oh without saying she smiled you are the only man besides dick that has ever kissed me this way and that i have kissed this way but i cant make up my mind the triangle as you call it must be solved for me i cant solve it myself i compare the two of you weigh you measure you i remember dick and all our past years and i consult my heart for you and i dont know i dont know you are a great man my great lover but dick is a greater man than you you you are more clay morei grope to describe youmore human i fancy and that is why i love you more or at least i think perhaps i do  but wait she resisted him prisoning his eager hand in hers there is more i want to say i remember dick and all our past years but i remember him today as well and tomorrow i cannot bear the thought that any man should pity my husband that you should pity him and pity him you must when i confess that i love you more that is why i am not sure that is why i so quickly take it back and do not know  id die of shame if through act of mine any man pitied dick truly i would of all things ghastly i can think of none so ghastly as dick being pitied he has never been pitied in his life he has always been topdogbright light strong unassailable and more he doesnt deserve pity and its my fault and yours evan  she abruptly thrust evans hand away  and every act every permitted touch of you does make him pitiable dont you see how tangled it is for me and then there is my own pride that you should see me disloyal to him in little things such as this she caught his hand again and caressed it with soft fingertips hurts me in my love for you diminishes me must diminish me in your eyes i shrink from the thought that my disloyalty to him in this i do she laid his hand against her cheek gives you reason to pity him and censure me  she soothed the impatience of the hand on her cheek and almost absently musingly scrutinizing it without consciously seeing it turned it over and slowly kissed the palm the next moment she was drawn to her feet and into his arms  there you see was her reproach as she disengaged herself                                         why do you tell me all this about dick graham demanded another time as they walked their horses side by side to keep me away to protect yourself from me  paula nodded then quickly added no not quite that because you know i dont want to keep you away  too far i say it because dick is so much in my mind for twelve years you realize he filled my mind i say it because  because i think it i suppose think the situation you are trespassing on a perfect marriage  i know it he answered and i do not like the role of trespasser it is your insistence instead of going away with me that i should trespass and i cant help it i think away from you try to force my thoughts elsewhere i did half a chapter this morning and i know its rotten and will have to be rewritten for i cant succeed in thinking away from you what is south america and its ethnology compared to you and when i come near you my arms go about you before i know what i am doing and by god you want them there you want them there you know it  paula gathered her reins in signal for a gallop but first with a roguish smile she acknowledged  i do want them there dear trespasser  paula yielded and fought at the same time  i love my husbandnever forget that she would warn graham and within the minute be in his arms                                         there are only the three of us for once thank goodness paula cried seizing dick and graham by the hands and leading them toward dicks favorite lounging couch in the big room come let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the deaths of kings come milords and lordly perishers and we will talk of armageddon when the last sun goes down  she was in a merry mood and with surprise dick observed her light a cigarette he could count on his fingers the cigarettes she had smoked in a dozen years and then only under a hostesss provocation to give countenance to some smoking woman guest later when he mixed a highball for himself and graham she again surprised him by asking him to mix her a wee one  this is scotch he warned  oh a very wee one she insisted and then well be three good fellows together winding up the world and when youve got it all wound up and ready ill sing you the song of the valkyries  she took more part in the talk than usual and strove to draw her husband out nor was dick unaware of this although he yielded and permitted himself to let go full tilt on the theme of the blond sun perishers  she is trying to make him competewas grahams thought but paula scarcely thought of that phase of it her pleasure consisting in the spectacle of two such splendid men who were hers they talk of big game hunting she mused once to herself but did ever one small woman capture bigger game than this  she sat crosslegged on the couch where by a turn of the head she could view graham lounging comfortably in the big chair or dick on his elbow sprawled among the cushions and ever as they talked her eyes roved from one to the other and as they spoke of struggle and battle always in the cold iron terms of realists her own thoughts became so colored until she could look coolly at dick with no further urge of the pity that had intermittently ached her heart for days  she was proud of hima goodly eyefilling figure of a man to any woman but she no longer felt sorry for him they were right it was a game the race was to the swift the battle to the strong they had run such races fought such battles then why not she and as she continued to look that selfquery became reiterant  they were not anchorites these two men liberallived they must have been in that past out of which like mysteries they had come to her they had had the days and nights that women were deniedwomen such as she as for dick beyond all doubteven had she heard whispersthere had been other women in that wild career of his over the world men were men and they were two such men she felt a burn of jealousy against those unknown women who must have been and her heart hardened they had taken their fun where they found itkiplings line ran through her head  pity why should she pity any more than she should be pitied the whole thing was too big too natural for pity they were taking a hand in a big game and all could not be winners playing with the fancy she wandered on to a consideration of the outcome always she had avoided such consideration but the tiny highball had given her daring it came to her that she saw doom ahead doom vague and formless but terrible  she was brought back to herself by dicks hand before her eyes and apparently plucking from the empty air the something upon which she steadfastly stared  seeing things he teased as her eyes turned to meet his  his were laughing but she glimpsed in them what despite herself made her veil her own with her long lashes he knew beyond all possibility of error she knew now that he knew that was what she had seen in his eyes and what had made her veil her own  cynthia cynthia ive been athinking she gayly hummed to him and as he resumed his talk she reached and took a sip from his part empty glass  let come what would she asserted to herself she would play it out it was all a madness but it was life it was living she had never so lived before and it was worth it no matter what inevitable payment must be made in the end lovehad she ever really loved dick as she now felt herself capable of loving had she mistaken the fondness of affection for love all these years her eyes warmed as they rested on graham and she admitted that he had swept her as dick never had  unused to alcohol in such strength her heart was accelerated and dick with casual glances noted and knew the cause of the added brilliance the flushed vividness of cheeks and lips  he talked less and less and the discussion of the sunperishers died of mutual agreement as to its facts finally glancing at his watch he straightened up yawned stretched his arms and announced  bedtime he stop head belong this fellow white man too much sleepy along himnightcap evan  graham nodded for both felt the need of a stiffener  mrs topernightcap dick queried of paula  but she shook her head and busied herself at the piano putting away the music while the men had their drink  graham closed down the piano for her while dick waited in the doorway so that when they left he led them by a dozen feet as they came along graham under her instructions turned off the lights in the halls dick waited where the ways diverged and where graham would have to say good night on his way to the tower room  the one remaining light was turned off  oh not that one silly dick heard paula cry out we keep it on all night  dick heard nothing but the dark was fervent to him he cursed himself for his own past embraces in the dark for so the wisdom was given him to know the quick embrace that had occurred ere the next moment the light flashed on again  he found himself lacking the courage to look at their faces as they came toward him he did not want to see paulas frank eyes veiled by her lashes and he fumbled to light a cigarette while he cudgeled his wits for the wording of an ordinary good night  how goes the bookwhat chapter he called after graham down his hall as paula put her hand in his  her hand in his swinging his hopping and skipping and all achatter in simulation of a little girl with a grownup paula went on with dick while he sadly pondered what ruse she had in mind by which to avoid the longavoided good night kiss  evidently she had not found it when they reached the dividing of the ways that led to her quarters and to his still swinging his hand still buoyantly chattering fun she continued with him into his workroom here he surrendered he had neither heart nor energy to wait for her to develop whatever she contemplated  he feigned sudden recollection deflected her by the hand to his desk and picked up a letter  id promised myself to get a reply off on the first machine in the morning he explained as he pressed on the phonograph and began dictating  for a paragraph she still held his hand then he felt the parting pressure of her fingers and her whispered good night  good night little woman he answered mechanically and continued dictating as if oblivious to her going  nor did he cease until he knew she was well out of hearing     chapter xxviii    a dozen times that morning dictating to blake or indicating answers dick had been on the verge of saying to let the rest of the correspondence go  call up hennessy and mendenhall he told blake when at ten the latter gathered up his notes and rose to go you ought to catch them at the stallion barn tell them not to come this morning but tomorrow morning  bonbright entered prepared to shorthand dicks conversations with his managers for the next hour  andoh mr blake dick called ask hennessy about alden bessie the old mare was pretty bad last night he explained to bonbright  mr hanley must see you right away mr forrest bonbright said and added at sight of the irritated drawing up of his employers brows its the piping from buckeye dam somethings wrong with the plansa serious mistake he says  dick surrendered and for an hour discussed ranch business with his foremen and managers  once in the middle of a hot discussion over sheepdips with wardman he left his desk and paced over to the window the sound of voices and horses and of paulas laugh had attracted him  take that montana reportill send you a copy today he continued as he gazed out they found the formula didnt get down to it it was more a sedative than a germicide there wasnt enough kick in it  four horses bunched crossed his field of vision paula teasing the pair of them was between martinez and froelig old friends of dick a painter and sculptor respectively who had arrived on an early train graham on selim made the fourth and was slightly edged toward the rear so the party went by but dick reflected that quickly enough it would resolve itself into two and two  shortly after eleven restless and moody he wandered out with a cigarette into the big patio where he smiled grim amusement at the various telltale signs of paulas neglect of her goldfish the sight of them suggested her secret patio in whose fountain pools she kept her selected and more gorgeous blooms of fish thither he went through doors without knobs by ways known only to paula and the servants  this had been dicks one great gift to paula it was lovelavish as only a king of fortune could make it he had given her a free hand with it and insisted on her wildest extravagance and it had been his delight to tease his quondam guardians with the stubs of the checkbook she had used it bore no relation to the scheme and architecture of the big house and for that matter so deeply hidden was it that it played no part in jar of line or color a showplace of showplaces it was not often shown outside paulas sisters and intimates on rare occasions some artist was permitted to enter and catch his breath graham had heard of its existence but not even him had she invited to see  it was round and small enough to escape giving any cold hint of spaciousness the big house was of sturdy concrete but here was marble in exquisite delicacy the arches of the encircling arcade were of fretted white marble that had taken on just enough tender green to prevent any glare of reflected light palest of pink roses bloomed up the pillars and over the low flat roof they upheld where pucklike humorous and happy faces took the place of grinning gargoyles dick strolled the rosy marble pavement of the arcade and let the beauty of the place slowly steal in upon him and gentle his mood  the heart and key of the fairy patio was the fountain consisting of three related shallow basins at different levels of white marble and delicate as shell over these basins rollicked and frolicked life sized babies wrought from pink marble by no mean hand some peered over the edges into lower basins one reached arms covetously toward the goldfish one on his back laughed at the sky another stood with dimpled legs apart stretching himself others waded others were on the ground amongst the roses white and blush but all were of the fountain and touched it at some point so good was the color of the marble so true had been the sculptor that the illusion was of life no cherubs these but live warm human babies  dick regarded the rosy fellowship pleasantly and long finishing his cigarette and retaining it dead in his hand that was what she had needed he musedbabies children it had been her passion had she realized it he sighed and struck by a fresh thought looked to her favorite seat with certitude that he would not see the customary sewing lying on it in a pretty heap she did not sew these days  he did not enter the tiny gallery behind the arcade which contained her chosen paintings and etchings and copies in marble and bronze of her favorites of the european galleries instead he went up the stairway past the glorious winged victory on the landing where the staircase divided and on and up into her quarters that occupied the entire upper wing but first pausing by the victory he turned and gazed down into the fairy patio the thing was a cut jewel in its perfectness and color and he acknowledged although he had made it possible for her that it was entirely her own creationher one masterpiece it had long been her dream and he had realized it for her and yet now he meditated it meant nothing to her she was not mercenary that he knew and if he could not hold her mere baubles such as that would weigh nothing in the balance against her heart  he wandered idly through her rooms scarcely noting at what he gazed but gazing with fondness at it all like everything else of hers it was distinctive different eloquent of her but when he glanced into the bathroom with its sunken roman bath for the life of him he was unable to avoid seeing a tiny drip and making a mental note for the ranch plumber  as a matter of course he looked to her easel with the expectation of finding no new work but was disappointed for a portrait of himself confronted him he knew her trick of copying the pose and lines from a photograph and filling in from memory the particular photograph she was using had been a fortunate snapshop of him on horseback the outlaw for once and for a moment had been at peace and dick hat in hand hair just nicely rumpled face in repose unaware of the impending snap had at the instant looked squarely into the camera no portrait photographer could have caught a better likeness the head and shoulders paula had had enlarged and it was from this that she was working but the portrait had already gone beyond the photograph for dick could see her own touches  with a start he looked more closely was that expression of the eyes of the whole face his he glanced at the photograph it was not there he walked over to one of the mirrors relaxed his face and led his thoughts to paula and graham slowly the expression came into his eyes and face not content he returned to the easel and verified it paula knew paula knew that he knew she had learned it from him stolen it from him some time when it was unwittingly on his face and carried it in her memory to the canvas  paulas chinese maid oh dear entered from the wardrobe room and dick watched her unobserved as she came down the room toward him her eyes were down and she seemed deep in thought dick remarked the sadness of her face and that the little solicitous contraction of the brows that had led to her naming was gone she was not solicitous that was patent but cast down she was in heavy depression  it would seem that all our faces are beginning to say things he commented to himself  good morning oh dear he startled her  and as she returned the greeting he saw compassion in her eyes as they dwelt on him she knew the first outside themselves trust her a woman so much in paulas company when paula was alone to divine paulas secret  oh dears lips trembled and she wrung her trembling hands nerving herself as he could see to speech  mister forrest she began haltingly maybe you think me fool but i like say something you very kind man you very kind my old mother you very kind me long long time  she hesitated moistening her frightened lips with her tongue then braved her eyes to his and proceeded  mrs forrest she i think  but so forbidding did dicks face become that she broke off in confusion and blushed as dick surmised with shame at the thoughts she had been about to utter  very nice picture mrs forrest make he put her at her ease  the chinese girl sighed and the same compassion returned into her eyes as she looked long at dicks portrait  she sighed again but the coldness in her voice was not lost on dick as she answered yes very nice picture mrs forrest make  she looked at him with sudden sharp scrutiny studying his face then turned to the canvas and pointed at the eyes  no good she condemned  her voice was harsh touched with anger  no good she flung over her shoulder more loudly still more harshly as she continued down the room and out of sight on paulas sleeping porch  dick stiffened his shoulders unconsciously bracing himself to face what was now soon to happen well it was the beginning of the end oh dear knew soon more would know all would know and in a way he was glad of it glad that the torment of suspense would endure but little longer  but when he started to leave he whistled a merry jingle to advertise to oh dear that the world wagged very well with him so far as he knew anything about it                                         the same afternoon while dick was out and away with froelig and martinez and graham paula stole a pilgrimage to dicks quarters out on his sleeping porch she looked over his rows of press buttons his switchboard that from his bed connected him with every part of the ranch and most of the rest of california his phonograph on the hinged and swinging bracket the orderly array of books and magazines and agricultural bulletins waiting to be read the ash tray cigarettes scribble pads and thermos bottle  her photograph the only picture on the porch held her attention it hung under his barometers and thermometers which she knew was where he looked oftenest a fancy came to her and she turned the laughing face to the wall and glanced from the blankness of the back of the frame to the bed and back again with a quick panic movement she turned the laughing face out it belonged was her thought it did belong  the big automatic pistol in the holster on the wall handy to ones hand from the bed caught her eye she reached to it and lifted gently at the butt it was as she had expectedloosedicks way trust him no matter how long unused never to let a pistol freeze in its holster  back in the work room she wandered solemnly about glancing now at the prodigious filing system at the chart and blueprint cabinets at the revolving shelves of reference books and at the long rows of stoutly bound herd registers at last she came to his booksa goodly row of pamphlets bound magazine articles and an even dozen ambitious tomes she read the titles painstakingly corn in california silage practice farm organization farm bookkeeping the shire in america humus destruction soilage alfalfa in california cover crops for california the shorthorn in americaat this last she smiled affectionately with memory of the great controversy he had waged for the beef cow and the milch cow as against the dual purpose cow  she caressed the backs of the books with her palm pressed her cheek against them and leaned with closed eyes oh dick dicka thought began that faded to a vagueness of sorrow and died because she did not dare to think it  the desk was so typically dick there was no litter clean it was of all work save the wire tray with typed letters waiting his signature and an unusual pile of the flat yellow sheets on which his secretaries typed the telegrams relayed by telephone from eldorado carelessly she ran her eyes over the opening lines of the uppermost sheet and chanced upon a reference that puzzled and interested her she read closely with indrawn brows then went deeper into the heap till she found confirmation jeremy braxton was deadbig genial kindly jeremy braxton a mexican mob of pulquecrazed peons had killed him in the mountains through which he had been trying to escape from the harvest into arizona the date of the telegram was two days old dick had known it for two days and never worried her with it and it meant more it meant money it meant that the affairs of the harvest group were going from bad to worse and it was dicks way  and jeremy was dead the room seemed suddenly to have grown cold she shivered it was the way of lifedeath always at the end of the road and her own nameless dread came back upon her doom lay ahead doom for whom she did not attempt to guess sufficient that it was doom her mind was heavy with it and the quiet room was heavy with it as she passed slowly out     chapter xxix    tis a birdlike sensuousness that is all the little ladys own terrence was saying as he helped himself to a cocktail from the tray ah ha was passing around  it was the hour before dinner and graham leo and terrence mcfane had chanced together in the stagroom  no leo the irishman warned the young poet let the one suffice you your cheeks are warm with it a second one and youll conflagrate tis no right you have to be mixing beauty and strong drink in that lads head of yours leave the drink to your elders there is such a thing as consanguinity for drink you have it not as for me  he emptied the glass and paused to turn the cocktail reminiscently on his tongue  tis womens drink he shook his head in condemnation it likes me not it bites me not and devil a bit of a taste is there to itah ha my boy he called to the chinese mix me a highball in a long long glassa stiff one  he held up four fingers horizontally to indicate the measure of liquor he would have in the glass and to ah has query as to what kind of whiskey answered scotch or irish bourbon or ryewhichever comes nearest to hand  graham shook his head to the chinese and laughed to the irishman youll never drink me down terrence ive not forgotten what you did to ohay  twas an accident i would have you think was the reply they say when a mans not feeling any too fit a bit of drink will hit him like a club  and you graham questioned  have never been hit by a club i am a man of singularly few experiences  but terrence you were saying about mrs forrest leo begged it sounded as if it were going to be nice  as if it could be otherwise terrence censured but as i was saying tis a birdlike sensuousnessoh not the little hoppy wagtail kind nor yet the sleek and solemn dove but a merry sort of bird like the wild canaries you see bathing in the fountains always twittering and singing flinging the water in the sun and glowing the golden hearts of them on their happy breasts tis like that the little lady is i have observed her much  everything on the earth and under the earth and in the sky contributes to the passion of her daysthe untoward purple of the ground myrtle when it has no right to aught more than pale lavender a single red rose tossing in the bathing wind one perfect duchesse rose bursting from its bush into the sunshine as she said to me pink as the dawn terrence and shaped like a kiss  tis all one with herthe princesss silver neigh the sheep bells of a frosty morn the pretty angora goats making silky pictures on the hillside all day long the drifts of purple lupins along the fences the long hot grass on slope and roadside the summerburnt hills tawny as crouching lionsand even have i seen the sheer sensuous pleasure of the little lady with bathing her arms and neck in the blessed sun  she is the soul of beauty leo murmured one understands how men can die for women such as she  and how men can live for them and love them the lovely things terrence added listen mr graham and ill tell you a secret we philosophers of the madroÃ±o grove we wrecks and wastages of life here in the quiet backwater and easement of dicks munificence are a brotherhood of lovers and the lady of our hearts is all the onethe little lady we who merely talk and dream our days away and who would lift never a hand for god or country or the devil are pledged knights of the little lady  we would die for her leo affirmed slowly nodding his head  nay lad we would live for her and fight for her dying is that easy  graham missed nothing of it the boy did not understand but in the blue eyes of the celt peering from under the mop of irongray hair there was no mistaking the knowledge of the situation  voices of men were heard coming down the stairs and as martinez and dar hyal entered terrence was saying  tis fine weather they say theyre having down at catalina now and i hear the tunny fish are biting splendid  ah ha served cocktails around and was kept busy for hancock and froelig followed along terrence impartially drank stiff highballs of whatever liquor the immobilefaced chinese elected to serve him and discoursed fatherly to leo on the iniquities and abominations of the flowing bowl  oh my entered a folded note in his hand and looked about in doubt as to whom to give it  hither wingheeled celestial terrence waved him up  tis a petition couched in very proper terms terrence explained after a glance at its contents and ernestine and lute have arrived for tis they that petition listen and he read oh noble and glorious stags two poor and lowly meekeyed does wandering lonely in the forest do humbly entreat admission for the brief time before dinner to the stamping ground of the herd  the metaphor is mixed said terrence yet have they acted well tis the ruledicks ruleand a good rule it is no petticoats in the stagroom save by the stags unanimous consentis the herd ready for the question all those in favor will say ayecontrary mindedthe ayes have it  oh my fleet with thy heels and bring in the ladies  with sandals beaten from the crowns of kings leo added murmuring the words reverently loving them with his lips as his lips formed them and uttered them  shall he tread down the altars of their night terrence completed the passage the man who wrote that is a great man he is leos friend and dicks friend and proud am i that he is my friend  and that other line leo said from the same sonnet he explained to graham listen to the sound of it to hear what song the star of morning singsoh listen the boy went on his voice hushed low with beautylove for the words with perished beauty in his hands as clay shall he restore futurity its dream  he broke off as paulas sisters entered and rose shyly to greet them                                         dinner that night was as any dinner at which the madroÃ±o sages were present dick was as robustly controversial as usual locking horns with aaron hancock on bergson attacking the latters metaphysics in sharp realistic fashion  your bergson is a charlatan philosopher aaron dick concluded he has the same old medicinemans bag of metaphysical tricks all decked out and frilled with the latest ascertained facts of science  tis true terrence agreed bergson is a charlatan thinker tis why he is so popular  i deny hancock broke in  wait a wee aaron tis a thought i have glimmered let me catch it before it flutters away into the azure dicks caught bergson with the goods on him filched straight from the treasurehouse of science his very cocksureness is filched from darwins morality of strength based on the survival of the fittest and what did bergson do with it touched it up with a bit of james pragmatism rosied it over with the eternal hope in mans breast that he will live again and made it all ashine with nietzsches nothing succeeds like excess  wildes you mean corrected ernestine  heaven knows i should have filched it for myself had you not been present terrence sighed with a bow to her some day the antiquarians will decide the authorship personally i would say it smacked of methuselahbut as i was saying before i was delightfully interrupted  who more cocksure than dick aaron was challenging a little later while paula glanced significantly to graham  i was looking at the herd of yearling stallions but yesterday terrence replied and with the picture of the splendid beasties still in my eyes ill ask and who more delivers the goods  but hancocks objection is solid martinez ventured it would be a mean and profitless world without mystery dick sees no mystery  there you wrong him terrence defended i know him well dick recognizes mystery but not of the nurserychild variety no cockand bull stories for him such as you romanticists luxuriate in  terrence gets me dick nodded the world will always be mystery to me mans consciousness is no greater mystery than the reaction of the gases that make a simple drop of water grant that mystery and all the more complicated phenomena cease to be mysteries that simple chemical reaction is like one of the axioms on which the edifice of geometry is reared matter and force are the everlasting mysteries manifesting themselves in the twin mysteries of space and time the manifestations are not mysteriesonly the stuff of the manifestations matter and force and the theater of the manifestations space and time  dick ceased and idly watched the expressionless ah ha and ah me who chanced at the moment to be serving opposite him their faces did not talk was his thought although ten to one was a fair bet that they were informed with the same knowledge that had perturbed oh dear  and there you are terrence was triumphing tis the perfect joy of himnever up in the air with dizzy heels flat on the good ground he stands four square to fact and law set against all airy fancies and bubbly speculations                                         and as at table so afterward that evening no one could have guessed from dick that all was not well with him he seemed bent on celebrating lutes and ernestines return refused to tolerate the heavy talk of the philosophers and bubbled over with pranks and tricks paula yielded to the contagion and aided and abetted him in his practical jokes which none escaped  choicest among these was the kiss of welcome no man escaped it to graham was accorded the honor of receiving it first so that he might witness the discomfiture of the others who one by one were ushered in by dick from the patio  hancock dicks arm guiding him came down the room to confront paula and her sisters standing in a row on three chairs in the middle of the floor he scanned them suspiciously and insisted upon walking around behind them but there seemed nothing unusual about them save that each wore a mans felt hat  looks good to me hancock announced as he stood on the floor before them and looked up at them  and it is good dick assured him as representing the ranch in its fairest aspects they are to administer the kiss of welcome make your choice aaron  aaron with a quick whirl to catch some possible lurking disaster at his back demanded they are all three to kiss me  no make your choice which is to give you the kiss  the two i do not choose will not feel that i have discriminated against them aaron insisted  whiskers no objection was his next query  not in the way at all lute told him i have always wondered what it would be like to kiss black whiskers  heres where all the philosophers get kissed tonight so hurry up ernestine said the others are waiting i too have yet to be kissed by an alfalfa field  whom do you choose dick urged  as if after that there were any choice about it hancock returned jauntily i kiss my ladythe little lady  as he put up his lips paula bent her head forward and nicely directed from the indented crown of her hat canted a glassful of water into his face  when leos turn came he bravely made his choice of paula and nearly spoiled the show by reverently bending and kissing the hem of her gown  it will never do ernestine told him it must be a real kiss put up your lips to be kissed  let the last be first and kiss me leo lute begged to save him from his embarrassment  he looked his gratitude put up his lips but without enough tilt of his head so that he received the water from lutes hat down the back of his neck  all three shall kiss me and thus shall paradise be thrice multiplied was terrences way out of the difficulty and simultaneously he received three crowns of water for his gallantry  dicks boisterousness waxed apace his was the most carefree seeming in the world as he measured froelig and martinez against the door to settle the dispute that had arisen as to whether froelig or martinez was the taller  knees straight and together heads back dick commanded  and as their heads touched the wood from the other side came a rousing thump that jarred them the door swung open revealing ernestine with a padded gongstick in either hand  dick a highheeled satin slipper in his hand was under a sheet with terrence teaching him brother bob im bobbed to the uproarious joy of the others when the masons and watsons and all their wickenberg following entered upon the scene  whereupon dick insisted that the young men of their party receive the kiss of welcome nor did he miss in the hubbub of a dozen persons meeting as many more lottie masons oh good evening mr graham i thought you had gone  and dick in the midst of the confusion of settling such an influx of guests still maintaining his exuberant jolly pose waited for that sharp scrutiny that women have only for women not many moments later he saw lottie mason steal such a look keen with speculation at paula as she chanced face to face with graham saying something to him  not yet was dicks conclusion lottie did not know but suspicion was rife and nothing he was certain under the circumstances would gladden her womans heart more than to discover the unimpeachable paula as womanly weak as herself  lottie mason was a tall striking brunette of twentyfive undeniably beautiful and as dick had learned undeniably daring in the not remote past attracted by her and it must be submitted subtly invited by her he had been guilty of a philandering that he had not allowed to go as far as her wishes the thing had not been serious on his part nor had he permitted it to become serious on her side nevertheless sufficient flirtatious passages had taken place to impel him this night to look to her rather than to the other wickenberg women for the first signals of suspicion  oh yes hes a beautiful dancer dick as he came up to them half an hour later heard lottie mason telling little miss maxwell isnt he dick she appealed to him with innocent eyes of candor through which disguise he knew she was studying him  whograham you must mean he answered with untroubled directness he certainly is what do you say we start dancing and let miss maxwell see though theres only one woman here who can give him full swing to show his paces  paula of course said lottie  paula of course why you young chits dont know how to waltz you never had a chance to learnlottie tossed her fine head perhaps you learned a little before the new dancing came in he amended anyway ill get evan and paula started you take me on and ill wager well be the only couples on the floor  half through the waltz he broke it off with let them have the floor to themselves its worth seeing  and glowing with appreciation he stood and watched his wife and graham finish the dance while he knew that lottie beside him stealing side glances at him was having her suspicions allayed  the dancing became general and the evening being warm the big doors to the patio were thrown open now one couple and now another danced out and down the long arcades where the moonlight streamed until it became the general thing  what a boy he is paula said to graham as they listened to dick descanting to all and sundry on the virtues of his new night camera you heard aaron complaining at table and terrence explaining his sureness nothing terrible has ever happened to him in his life he has never been overthrown his sureness has always been vindicated as terrence said it has always delivered the goods he does know he does know and yet he is so sure of himself so sure of me  graham taken away to dance with miss maxwell paula continued her train of thought to herself dick was not suffering so much after all and she might have expected it he was the coolhead the philosopher he would take her loss with the same equanimity as he would take the loss of mountain lad as he had taken the death of jeremy braxton and the flooding of the harvest mines it was difficult she smiled to herself aflame as she was toward graham to be married to a philosopher who would not lift a hand to hold her and it came to her afresh that one phase of grahams charm for her was his humanness his flamingness they met on common ground at any rate even in the heyday of their coming together in paris dick had not so inflamed her a wonderful lover he had been too with his gift of speech and lovers phrases with his lovechants that had so delighted her but somehow it was different from this what she felt for graham and what graham must feel for her besides she had been most young in experience of love and lovers in that long ago when dick had burst so magnificently upon her  and so thinking she hardened toward him and recklessly permitted herself to flame toward graham the crowd the gayety the excitement the closeness and tenderness of contact in the dancing the summer warm of the evening the streaming moonlight and the nightscents of flowersall fanned her ardency and she looked forward eagerly to the at least one more dance she might dare with graham  no flash light is necessary dick was explaining its a german invention half a minute exposure under the ordinary lighting is sufficient and the best of it is that the plate can be immediately developed just like an ordinary blue print of course the drawback is one cannot print from the plate  but if its good an ordinary plate can be copied from it from which prints can be made ernestine amplified  she knew the huge twentyfoot spring snake coiled inside the camera and ready to leap out like a jackinthebox when dick squeezed the bulb and there were others who knew and who urged dick to get the camera and make an exposure  he was gone longer than he expected for bonbright had left on his desk several telegrams concerning the mexican situation that needed immediate replies trick camera in hand dick returned by a short cut across the house and patio the dancing couples were ebbing down the arcade and disappearing into the hall and he leaned against a pillar and watched them go by last of all came paula and evan passing so close that he could have reached out and touched them but though the moon shone full on him they did not see him they saw only each other in the tender sport of gazing  the last preceding couple was already inside when the music ceased graham and paula paused and he was for giving her his arm and leading her inside but she clung to him in sudden impulse manlike cautious he slightly resisted for a moment but with one arm around his neck she drew his head willingly down to the kiss it was a flash of quick passion the next instant paula on his arm they were passing in and paulas laugh was ringing merrily and naturally  dick clutched at the pillar and eased himself down abruptly until he sat flat on the pavement accompanying violent suffocation or causing it his heart seemed rising in his chest he panted for air the cursed thing rose and choked and stifled him until in the grim turn his fancy took it seemed to him that he chewed it between his teeth and gulped it back and down his throat along with the reviving air he felt chilled and was aware that he was wet with sudden sweat  and who ever heard of heart disease in the forrests he muttered as still sitting leaning against the pillar for support he mopped his face dry his hand was shaking and he felt a slight nausea from an internal quivering that still persisted  it was not as if graham had kissed her he pondered it was paula who had kissed graham that was love and passion he had seen it and as it burned again before his eyes he felt his heart surge and the premonitory sensation of suffocation seized him with a sharp effort of will he controlled himself and got to his feet  by god it came up in my mouth and i chewed it he muttered i chewed it  returning across the patio by the roundabout way he entered the lighted room jauntily enough camera in hand and unprepared for the reception he received  seen a ghost lute greeted  are you sickwhats the matter were other questions  what is the matter he countered  your facethe look of it ernestine said something has happened what is it  and while he oriented himself he did not fail to note lottie masons quick glance at the faces of graham and paula nor to note that ernestine had observed lotties glance and followed it up for herself  yes he lied bad news just got the word jeremy braxton is dead murdered the mexicans got him while he was trying to escape into arizona  old jeremy god love him for the fine man he was terrence said tucking his arm in dicks come on old man tis a stiffener youre wanting and im the lad to lead you to it  oh im all right dick smiled shaking his shoulders and squaring himself as if gathering himself together it did hit me hard for the moment i hadnt a doubt in the world but jeremy would make it out all right but they got him and two engineers with him they put up a devil of a fight first they got under a cliff and stood off a mob of half a thousand for a day and night and then the mexicans tossed dynamite down from above oh well all flesh is grass and there is no grass of yesteryear terrence your suggestion is a good one lead on  after a few steps he turned his head over his shoulder and called back now this isnt to stop the fun ill be right back to take that photograph you arrange the group ernestine and be sure to have them under the strongest light  terrence pressed open the concealed buffet at the far end of the room and set out the glasses while dick turned on a wall light and studied his face in the small mirror inside the buffet door  its all right now quite natural he announced  twas only a passing shade terrence agreed pouring the whiskey and man has well the right to take it hard the going of old friends  they toasted and drank silently  another one dick said extending his glass  say when said the irishman and with imperturbable eyes he watched the rising tide of liquor in the glass  dick waited till it was half full  again they toasted and drank silently eyes to eyes and dick was grateful for the offer of all his heart that he read in terrences eyes  back in the middle of the hall ernestine was gayly grouping the victims and privily from the faces of lottie paula and graham trying to learn more of the something untoward that she sensed why had lottie looked so immediately and searchingly at graham and paula she asked herself and something was wrong with paula now she was worried disturbed and not in the way to be expected from the announcement of jeremy braxtons death from graham ernestine could glean nothing he was quite his ordinary self his facetiousness the cause of much laughter to miss maxwell and mrs watson  paula was disturbed what had happened why had dick lied he had known of jeremys death for two days and she had never known anybodys death so to affect him she wondered if he had been drinking unduly in the course of their married life she had seen him several times in liquor he carried it well the only noticeable effects being a flush in his eyes and a loosening of his tongue to whimsical fancies and extemporized chants had he in his trouble been drinking with the ironheaded terrence down in the stag room she had found them all assembled there just before dinner the real cause for dicks strangeness never crossed her mind if for no other reason than that he was not given to spying  he came back laughing heartily at a joke of terrences and beckoned graham to join them while terrence repeated it and when the three had had their laugh he prepared to take the picture the burst of the huge snake from the camera and the genuine screams of the startled women served to dispel the gloom that threatened and next dick was arranging a tournament of peanutcarrying  from chair to chair placed a dozen yards apart the feat was with a table knife to carry the most peanuts in five minutes after the preliminary tryout dick chose paula for his partner and challenged the world wickenberg and the madroÃ±o grove included many boxes of candy were wagered and in the end he and paula won out against graham and ernestine who had proved the next best couple demands for a speech changed to clamor for a peanut song dick complied beating the accent indian fashion with stifflegged hops and handslaps on thighs  i am dick forrest son of richard the lucky son of jonathan the puritan son of john who was a searover as his father albert before him who was the son of mortimer a pirate who was hanged in chains and died without issue  i am the last of the forrests but first of the peanutcarriers neither nimrod nor sandow has anything on me i carry the peanuts on a knife a silver knife the peanuts are animated by the devil i carry the peanuts with grace and celerity and in quantity the peanut never sprouted that can best me  the peanuts roll the peanuts roll like atlas who holds the world i never let them fall not every one can carry peanuts i am godgifted i am master of the art it is a fine art the peanuts roll the peanuts roll and i carry them on forever  aaron is a philosopher he cannot carry peanuts ernestine is a blonde she cannot carry peanuts evan is a sportsman he drops peanuts paula is my partner she fumbles peanuts only i i by the grace of god and my own cleverness carry peanuts  when anybody has had enough of my song throw something at me i am proud i am tireless i can sing on forever i shall sing on forever  here beginneth the second canto when i die bury me in a peanut patch while i live  the expected avalanche of cushions quenched his song but not his ebullient spirits for he was soon in a corner with lottie mason and paula concocting a conspiracy against terrence  and so the evening continued to be danced and joked and played away at midnight supper was served and not till two in the morning were the wickenbergers ready to depart while they were getting on their wraps paula was proposing for the following afternoon a trip down to the sacramento river to look over dicks experiment in riceraising  i had something else in view he told her you know the mountain pasture above sycamore creek three yearlings have been killed there in the last ten days  mountain lions paula cried  two at leaststrayed in from the north he explained to graham they sometimes do that we got three five years agomoss and hartley will be there with the dogs waiting theyve located two of the beasts what do you say all of you join me we can leave right after lunch  let me have mollie lute asked  and you can ride altadena paula told ernestine  quickly the mounts were decided upon froelig and martinez agreeing to go but promising neither to shoot well nor ride well  all went out to see the wickenbergers off and after the machines were gone lingered to make arrangements for the hunting  good night everybody dick said as they started to move inside im going to take a look at alden bessie before i turn in hennessy is sitting up with her remember you girls come to lunch in your riding togs and curses on the head of whoevers late  the ancient dam of the fotherington princess was in a serious way but dick would not have made the visit at such an hour save that he wanted to be by himself and that he could not nerve himself for a chance moment alone with paula so soon after what he had overseen in the patio  light steps in the gravel made him turn his head ernestine caught up with him and took his arm  poor old alden bessie she explained i thought id go along  dick still acting up to his nights rÃ´le recalled to her various funny incidents of the evening and laughed and chuckled with reminiscent glee  dick she said in the first pause you are in trouble she could feel him stiffen and hurried on what can i do you know you can depend on me tell me  yes ill tell you he answered just one thing she pressed his arm gratefully ill have a telegram sent you tomorrow it will be urgent enough though not too serious you will just bundle up and depart with lute  is that all she faltered  it will be a great favor  you wont talk with me she protested quivering under the rebuff  ill have the telegram come so as to rout you out of bed and now never mind alden bessie you run a long in good night  he kissed her gently thrust her toward the house and went on his way     chapter xxx    on the way back from the sick mare dick paused once to listen to the restless stamp of mountain lad and his fellows in the stallion barn in the quiet air from somewhere up the hills came the ringing of a single bell from some grazing animal a catspaw of breeze fanned him with sudden balmy warmth all the night was balmy with the faint and almost aromatic scent of ripening grain and drying grass the stallion stamped again and dick with a deep breath and realization that never had he more loved it all looked up and circled the skyline where the crests of the mountains blotted the field of stars  no cato he mused aloud one cannot agree with you man does not depart from life as from an inn he departs as from a dwelling the one dwelling he will ever know he departs  nowhere it is good night for him the noiseless one  and the dark  he made as if to start but once again the stamp of the stallions held him and the hillside bell rang out he drew a deep inhalation through his nostrils of the air of balm and loved it and loved the fair land of his devising  i looked into time and saw none of me there he quoted then capped it smiling with a second quotation she gat me nine great sons the other nine were daughters  back at the house he did not immediately go in but stood a space gazing at the far flung lines of it nor inside did he immediately go to his own quarters instead he wandered through the silent rooms across the patios and along the dimlit halls his frame of mind was as of one about to depart on a journey he pressed on the lights in paulas fairy patio and sitting in an austere roman seat of marble smoked a cigarette quite through while he made his plans  oh he would do it nicely enough he could pull off a hunting accident that would fool the world trust him not to bungle it next day would be the day in the woods above sycamore creek grandfather jonathan forrest the straightlaced puritan had died of a hunting accident for the first time dick doubted that accident well if it hadnt been an accident the old fellow had done it well it had never been hinted in the family that it was aught but an accident  his hand on the button to turn off the lights dick delayed a moment for a last look at the marble babies that played in the fountain and among the roses  so long younglings he called softly to them youre the nearest i ever came to it  from his sleeping porch he looked across the big patio to paulas porch there was no light the chance was she slept  on the edge of the bed he found himself with one shoe unlaced and smiling at his absentness relaced it what need was there for him to sleep it was already four in the morning he would at least watch his last sunrise last things were coming fast already had he not dressed for the last time and the bath of the previous morning would be his last mere water could not stay the corruption of death he would have to shave howevera last vanity for the hair did continue to grow for a time on dead mens faces  he brought a copy of his will from the wallsafe to his desk and read it carefully several minor codicils suggested themselves and he wrote them out in longhand predating them six months as a precaution the last was the endowment of the sages of the madroÃ±o grove with a fellowship of seven  he ran through his life insurance policies verifying the permitted suicide clause in each one signed the tray of letters that had waited his signature since the previous morning and dictated a letter into the phonograph to the publisher of his books his desk cleaned he scrawled a quick summary of income and expense with all earnings from the harvest mines deducted he transposed the summary into a second summary increasing the expense margins and cutting down the income items to an absurdest least possible still the result was satisfactory  he tore up the sheets of figures and wrote out a program for the future handling of the harvest situation he did it sketchily with casual tentativeness so that when it was found among the papers there would be no suspicions in the same fashion he worked out a line breeding program for the shires and an inbreeding table up and down for mountain lad and the fotherington princess and certain selected individuals of their progeny  when oh my came in with coffee at six dick was on his last paragraph of his scheme for ricegrowing  although the italian rice may be worth experimenting with for quick maturity he wrote i shall for a time confine the main plantings in equal proportions to moti ioko and the wateribune thus with different times of maturing the same crews and the same machinery with the same overhead can work a larger acreage than if only one variety is planted  oh my served the coffee at his desk and made no sign even after a glance to the porch at the bed which had not been slept inall of which control dick permitted himself privily to admire  at sixthirty the telephone rang and he heard hennessys tired voice i knew youd be up and glad to know alden bessies pulled through it was a squeak though and now its me for the hay  when dick had shaved he looked at the shower hesitated a moment then his face set stubbornly im darned if i will was his thought a sheer waste of time he did however change his shoes to a pair of heavy highlaced ones fit for the roughness of hunting he was at his desk again looking over the notes in his scribble pads for the mornings work when paula entered she did not call her good morning merry gentleman but came quite close to him before she greeted him softly with  the acornplanter ever tireless never weary red cloud  he noted the violetblue shadows under her eyes as he arose without offering to touch her nor did she offer invitation  a white night he asked as he placed a chair  a white night she answered wearily not a seconds sleep though i tried so hard  both were reluctant of speech and they labored under a mutual inability to draw their eyes away from each other  you  you dont look any too fit yourself she said  yes my face he nodded i was looking at it while i shaved the expression wont come off  something happened to you last night she probed and he could not fail to see the same compassion in her eyes that he had seen in oh dears everybody remarked your expression what was it  he shrugged his shoulders it has been coming on for some time he evaded remembering that the first hint of it had been given him by paulas portrait of him youve noticed it he inquired casually  she nodded then was struck by a sudden thought he saw the idea leap to life ere her words uttered it  dick you havent an affair  it was a way out it would straighten all the tangle and hope was in her voice and in her face  he smiled shook his head slowly and watched her disappointment  i take it back he said i have an affair  of the heart  she was eager as he answered of the heart  but she was not prepared for what came next he abruptly drew his chair close till his knees touched hers and leaning forward quickly but gently prisoned her hands in his resting on her knees  dont be alarmed little birdwoman he quieted her i shall not kiss you it is a long time since i have i want to tell you about that affair but first i want to tell you how proud i amproud of myself i am proud that i am a lover at my age a lover it is unbelievable and it is wonderful and such a lover such a curious unusual and quite altogether remarkable lover in fact i have laughed all the books and all biology in the face i am a monogamist i love the woman the one woman after a dozen years of possession i love her quite madly oh so sweetly madly  her hands communicated her disappointment to him making a slight impulsive flutter to escape but he held them more firmly  i know her every weakness and weakness and strength and all i love her as madly as i loved her at the first in those mad moments when i first held her in my arms  her hands were mutinous of the restraint he put upon them and unconsciously she was beginning to pull and tug to be away from him also there was fear in her eyes he knew her fastidiousness and he guessed with the other mans lips recent on hers that she feared a more ardent expression on his part  and please please be not frightened timid sweet beautiful proud little birdwoman see i release you know that i love you most dearly and that i am considering you as well as myself and before myself all the while  he drew his chair away from her leaned back and saw confidence grow in her eyes  i shall tell you all my heart he continued and i shall want you to tell me all your heart  this love for me is something new she asked a recrudescence  yes a recrudescence and no  i thought that for a long time i had been a habit to you she said  but i was loving you all the time  not madly  no he acknowledged but with certainty i was so sure of you of myself it was to me all a permanent and forever established thing i plead guilty but when that permanency was shaken all my love for you fired up it was there all the time a steady longmarried flame  but about me she demanded  that is what we are coming to i know your worry right now and of a minute ago you are so intrinsically honest so intrinsically true that the thought of sharing two men is abhorrent to you i have not misread you it is a long time since you have permitted me any love touch he shrugged his shoulders and an equally long time since i offered you a lovetouch  then you have known from the first she asked quickly  he nodded  possibly he added with an air of judicious weighing i sensed it coming before even you knew it but we will not go into that or other things  you have seen she attempted to ask stung almost to shame at thought of her husband having witnessed any caress of hers and grahams  we will not demean ourselves with details paula besides there was and is nothing wrong about any of it also it was not necessary for me to see anything i have my memories of when i too kissed stolen kisses in the pause of the seconds between the frank outspoken good nights when all the signs of ripeness are visiblethe loveshades and lovenotes that cannot be hidden the unconscious caress of the eyes in a fleeting glance the involuntary softening of voices the cuckoosob in the throatwhy the nightparting kiss does not need to be seen it has to be still further oh my woman know that i justify you in everything  it it was not ever much she faltered  i should have been surprised if it had been it couldnt have been you as it is i have been surprised after our dozen years it was unexpected  dick she interrupted him leaning toward him and searching him she paused to frame her thought and then went on with directness in our dozen years will you say it has never been any more with you  i have told you that i justify you in everything he softened his reply  but you have not answered my question she insisted oh i do not mean mere flirtatious passages bits of primrose philandering i mean unfaithfulness and i mean it technically in the past you have  in the past he answered not much and not for a long long time  i often wondered she mused  and i have told you i justify you in everything he reiterated and now you know where lies the justification  then by the same token i had a similar right she said though i havent dick i havent she hastened to add well anyway you always did preach the single standard  alas not any longer he smiled ones imagination will conjure and in the past few weeks ive been forced to change my mind  you mean that you demand i must be faithful  he nodded and said so long as you live with me  but wheres the equity  there isnt any equity he shook his head oh i know it seems a preposterous change of view but at this late day i have made the discovery of the ancient truth that women are different from men all i have learned of book and theory goes glimmering before the everlasting fact that the women are the mothers of our children i i still had my hopes of children with you you see but thats all over and done with the question now is whats in your heart i have told you mine and afterward we can determine what is to be done  oh dick she breathed after silence had grown painful i do love you i shall always love you you are my red cloud why do you know only yesterday out on your sleeping porch i turned my face to the wall it was terrible it didnt seem right i turned it out again oh so quickly  he lighted a cigarette and waited  but you have not told me what is in your heart all of it he chided finally  i do love you she repeated  and evan  that is different it is horrible to have to talk this way to you besides i dont know i cant make up my mind what is in my heart  love or amorous adventure it must be one or the other  she shook her head  cant you understand she asked that i dont understand you see i am a woman i have never sown any wild oats and now that all this has happened i dont know what to make of it shaw and the rest must be right women are hunting animals you are both big game i cant help it it is a challenge to me and i find i am a puzzle to myself all my concepts have been toppled over by my conduct i want you i want evan i want both of you it is not amorous adventure oh believe me and if by any chance it is and i do not know itno it isnt i know it isnt  then it is love  but i do love you red cloud  and you say you love him you cant love both of us  but i can i do i do love both of youoh i am straight i shall be straight i must work this out i thought you might help me that is why i came to you this morning there must be some solution  she looked at him appealingly as he answered it is one or the other evan or me i cannot imagine any other solution  thats what he says but i cant bring myself to it he was for coming straight to you i would not permit him he has wanted to go but i held him here hard as it was on both of you in order to have you together to compare you two to weigh you in my heart and i get nowhere i want you both i cant give either of you up  unfortunately as you see dick began a slight twinkle in his eyes while you may be polyandrously inclined we stupid male men cannot reconcile ourselves to such a situation  dont be cruel dick she protested  forgive me it was not so meant it was out of my own hurtan effort to bear it with philosophical complacence  i have told him that he was the only man i had ever met who is as great as my husband and that my husband is greater  that was loyalty to me yes and loyalty to yourself dick explained you were mine until i ceased being the greatest man in the world he then became the greatest man in the world  she shook her head  let me try to solve it for you he continued you dont know your mind your desire you cant decide between us because you equally want us both  yes she whispered only rather differently want you both  then the thing is settled he concluded shortly  what do you mean  this paula i lose graham is the winner dont you see here am i even with him even and no more while my advantage over him is our dozen years togetherthe dozen years of past love the ties and bonds of heart and memory heavens if all this weight were thrown in the balance on evans side you wouldnt hesitate an instant in your decision it is the first time you have ever been bowled over in your life and the experience coming so late makes it hard for you to realize  but dick you bowled me over  he shook his head  i have always liked to think so and sometimes i have believedbut never really i never took you off your feet not even in the very beginning whirlwind as the affair was you may have been glamoured you were never mad as i was mad never swept as i was swept i loved you first  and you were a royal lover  i loved you first paula and though you did respond it was not in the same way i never took you off your feet it seems pretty clear that evan has  i wish i could be sure she mused i have a feeling of being bowled over and yet i hesitate the two are not compatible perhaps i never shall be bowled over by any man and you dont seem to help me in the least  you and you alone can solve it paula he said gravely  but if you would help if you would tryoh such a little to hold me she persisted  but i am helpless my hands are tied i cant put an arm to hold you you cant share two you have been in his arms he put up his hand to hush her protest please please dear dont you have been in his arms you flutter like a frightened bird at thought of my caressing you dont you see your actions decide against me you have decided though you may not know it your very flesh has decided you can bear his arms the thought of mine you cannot bear  she shook her head with slow resoluteness  and still i do not cannot make up my mind she persisted  but you must the present situation is intolerable you must decide quickly for evan must go you realize that or you must go you both cannot continue on here take all the time in the world send evan away or suppose you go and visit aunt martha for a while being away from both of us might aid you to get somewhere perhaps it will be better to call off the hunting ill go alone and you stay and talk it over with evan or come on along and talk it over with him as you ride whichever way i wont be in till late i may sleep out all night in one of the herders cabins when i come back evan must be gone whether or not you are gone with him will also have been decided  and if i should go she queried  dick shrugged his shoulders and stood up glancing at his wrist watch  i have sent word to blake to come earlier this morning he explained taking a step toward the door in invitation for her to go  at the door she paused and leaned toward him  kiss me dick she said and afterward this is not a love touch her voice had become suddenly husky its just in case i do decide to to go  the secretary approached along the hall but paula lingered  good morning mr blake dick greeted him sorry to rout you out so early first of all will you please telephone mr agar and mr pitts i wont be able to see them this morning oh and put the rest off till tomorrow too make a point of getting mr hanley tell him i approve of his plan for the buckeye spillway and to go right ahead i will see mr mendenhall though and mr manson tell them nine thirty  one thing dick paula said remember i made him stay it was not his fault or wish i wouldnt let him go  youve bowled him over right enough dick smiled i could not reconcile his staying on under the circumstances with what i knew of him but with you not permitting him to go and he as mad as a man has a right to be where you are concerned i can understand hes a whole lot better than a good sort they dont make many like him he will make you happy  she held up her hand  i dont know that i shall ever be happy again red cloud when i see what i have brought into your face and i was so happy and contented all our dozen years i cant forget it that is why i have been unable to decide but you are right the time has come for me to solve the  she hesitated and could not utter the word triangle which he saw forming on her lips the situation her voice trailed away well all go hunting ill talk with him as we ride and ill send him away no matter what i do  i shouldnt be precipitate paul dick advised you know i dont care a hang for morality except when it is useful and in this case it is exceedingly useful there may be childrenplease please he hushed her and in such case even old scandal is not exactly good for them desertion takes too long ill arrange to give you the real statutory grounds which will save a year in the divorce  if i so make up my mind she smiled wanly  he nodded  but i may not make up my mind that way i dont know it myself perhaps its all a dream and soon i shall wake up and oh dear will come in and tell me how soundly and long i have slept  she turned away reluctantly and paused suddenly when she had made half a dozen steps  dick she called you have told me your heart but not whats in your mind dont do anything foolish remember denny holbrookno hunting accident mind  he shook his head and twinkled his eyes in feigned amusement and marveled to himself that her intuition should have so squarely hit the mark  and leave all this he lied with a gesture that embraced the ranch and all its projects and that book on inandinbreeding and my first annual home sale of stock just ripe to come off  it would be preposterous she agreed with brightening face but dick in this difficulty of making up my mind please please know that she paused for the phrase then made a gesture in mimicry of his that included the big house and its treasures and said all this does not influence me a particle truly not  as if i did not know it he assured her of all unmercenary women   why dick she interrupted him fired by a new thought if i loved evan as madly as you think you would mean so little that id be content if it were the only way out for you to have a hunting accident but you see i dont anyway theres a brass tack for you to ponder  she made another reluctant step away then called back in a whisper her face over her shoulder  red cloud im dreadfully sorry and through it all im so glad that you do still love me  before blake returned dick found time to study his face in the glass printed there was the expression that had startled his company the preceding evening it had come to stay oh well was his thought one cannot chew his heart between his teeth without leaving some sign of it  he strolled out on the sleeping porch and looked at paulas picture under the barometers he turned it to the wall and sat on the bed and regarded the blankness for a space then he turned it back again  poor little kid he murmured having a hard time of it just waking up at this late day  but as he continued to gaze abruptly there leaped before his eyes the vision of her in the moonlight clinging to graham and drawing his lips down to hers  dick got up quickly with a shake of head to shake the vision from his eyes  by half past nine his correspondence was finished and his desk cleaned save for certain data to be used in his talks with his shorthorn and shire managers he was over at the window and waving a smiling farewell to lute and ernestine in the limousine as mendenhall entered and to him and to manson next dick managed in casual talk to impress much of his bigger breeding plans  weve got to keep an eagle eye on the bullget of king polo he told manson theres all the promise in the world for a greater than he from bleakhouse fawn or alberta maid or moravias nellie signal we missed it this year so far but next year or the year after soon or late king polo is going to be responsible for a real humdinger of winner  and as with manson with much more talk so with mendenhall dick succeeded in emphasizing the far application of his breeding theories  with their departure he got oh joy on the house phone and told him to take graham to the gun room to choose a rifle and any needed gear  at eleven he did not know that paula had come up the secret stairway from the library and was standing behind the shelves of books listening she had intended coming in but had been deterred by the sound of his voice she could hear him talking over the telephone to hanley about the spillway of the buckeye dam  and by the way dicks voice went on youve been over the reports on the big miramar very good discount them i disagree with them flatly the water is there i havent a doubt well find a fairly shallow artesian supply send up the boring outfit at once and start prospecting the soils ungodly rich and if we dont make that dry hole ten times as valuable in the next five years   paula sighed and turned back down the spiral to the library  red cloud the incorrigible always planting his acornswas her thought there he was with his loveworld crashing around him calmly considering dams and wellborings so that he might in the years to come plant more acorns  nor was dick ever to know that paula had come so near to him with her need and gone away again not aimlessly but to run through for the last time the notes of the scribble pad by his bed he was out on his sleeping porch his house was in order there was nothing left but to sign up the mornings dictation answer several telegrams then would come lunch and the hunting in the sycamore hills oh he would do it well the outlaw would bear the blame and he would have an eye witness either froelig or martinez but not both of them one pair of eyes would be enough to satisfy when the martingale parted and the mare reared and toppled backward upon him into the brush and from that screen of brush swiftly linking accident to catastrophe the witness would hear the rifle go off  martinez was more emotional than the sculptor and would therefore make a more satisfactory witness dick decided him would he maneuver to have with him in the narrow trail when the outlaw should be made the scapegoat martinez was no horseman all the better it would be well dick judged to make the outlaw act up in real devilishness for a minute or two before the culmination it would give verisimilitude also it would excite martinezs horse and therefore excite martinez so that he would not see occurrences too clearly  he clenched his hands with sudden hurt the little lady was mad she must be mad on no other ground could he understand such arrant cruelty listening to her voice and grahams from the open windows of the music room as they sang together the gypsy trail  nor did he unclench his hands during all the time they sang and they sang the mad reckless song clear through to its mad reckless end and he continued to stand listening to her laugh herself merrily away from graham and on across the house to her wing from the porches of which she continued to laugh as she teased and chided oh dear for fancied derelictions  from far off came the dim but unmistakable trumpeting of mountain lad king polo asserted his lordly self and the harems of mares and heifers sent back their answering calls dick listened to all the whinnying and nickering and bawling of sex and sighed aloud well the land is better for my having been it is a good thought to take to bed     chapter xxxi    a ring of his bed phone made dick sit on the bed to take up the receiver as he listened he looked out across the patio to paulas porches bonbright was explaining that it was a call from chauncey bishop who was at eldorado in a machine chauncey bishop editor and owner of the san francisco dispatch was sufficiently important a person in bonbrights mind as well as old friend of dicks to be connected directly to him  you can get here for lunch dick told the newspaper owner and say suppose you put up for the night never mind your special writers were going hunting mountain lions this afternoon and theres sure to be a kill got them located who whats she write what of it she can stick around the ranch and get half a dozen columns out of any of half a dozen subjects while the writer chap can get the dope on lionhunting sure sure ill put him on a horse a child can ride  the more the merrier especially newspaper chaps dick grinned to himselfand grandfather jonathan forrest would have nothing on him when it came to pulling off a successful finish  but how could paula have been so wantonly cruel as to sing the gypsy trail so immediately afterward dick asked himself as receiver near to ear he could distantly hear chauncey bishop persuading his writer man to the hunting  all right then come a running dick told bishop in conclusion im giving orders now for the horses and you can have that bay you rode last time  scarcely had he hung up when the bell rang again this time it was paula  red cloud dear red cloud she said your reasoning is all wrong i think i love you best i am just about making up my mind and its for you and now just to help me to be sure tell me what you told me a little while agoyou know i love the woman the one woman after a dozen years of possession i love her quite madly oh so sweetly madly say it to me red cloud  i do truly love the woman the one woman dick repeated after a dozen years of possession i do love her quite madly oh so sweetly madly  there was a pause when he had finished which waiting he did not dare to break  there is one little thing i almost forgot to tell you she said very softly very slowly very clearly i do love you i have never loved you so much as right now after our dozen years youve bowled me over at last and i was bowled over from the beginning although i did not know it i have made up my mind now once and for all  she hung up abruptly  with the thought that he knew how a man felt receiving a reprieve at the eleventh hour dick sat on thinking forgetful that he had not hooked the receiver until bonbright came in from the secretaries room to remind him  it was from mr bishop bonbright explained sprung an axle i took the liberty of sending one of our machines to bring them in  and see what our men can do with repairing theirs dick nodded  alone again he got up and stretched walked absently the length of the room and back  well martinez old man he addressed the empty air this afternoon youll be defrauded out of as fine a histrionic stunt as you will never know youve missed  he pressed the switch for paulas telephone and rang her up  oh dear answered and quickly brought her mistress  ive a little song i want to sing to you paul he said then chanted the old negro spiritual    fer itself fer itself      fer itself fer itself      every soul got ter confess      fer itself  and i want you to tell me again fer yourself fer yourself what you just told me  her laughter came in a merry gurgle that delighted him  red cloud i do love you she said my mind is made up i shall never have any man but you in all this world now be good and let me dress ill have to rush for lunch as it is  may i come overfor a moment he begged  not yet eager one in ten minutes let me finish with oh dear first then ill be all ready for the hunt im putting on my robin hood outfityou know the greens and russets and the long feather and im taking my 3030 its heavy enough for mountain lions  youve made me very happy dick continued  and youre making me late ring offred cloud i love you more this minute  he heard her hang up and was surprised the next moment that somehow he was reluctant to yield to the happiness that he had claimed was his rather did it seem that he could still hear her voice and grahams recklessly singing the gypsy trail  had she been playing with graham or had she been playing with him such conduct for her was unprecedented and incomprehensible as he groped for a solution he saw her again in the moonlight clinging to graham with upturned lips drawing grahams lips down to hers  dick shook his head in bafflement and glanced at his watch at any rate in ten minutes in less than ten minutes he would hold her in his arms and know  so tedious was the brief space of time that he strolled slowly on the way pausing to light a cigarette throwing it away with the first inhalation pausing again to listen to the busy click of typewriters from the secretaries room with still two minutes to spare and knowing that one minute would take him to the door without a knob he stopped in the patio and gazed at the wild canaries bathing in the fountain  when they startled into the air a cloud of fluttering gold and crystal droppings in the sunshine dick startled the report of the rifle had come from paulas wing above and he identified it as her 3030 as he dashed across the patio she beat me to it was his next thought and what had been incomprehensible the moment before was as sharply definite as the roar of her rifle  and across the patio up the stairs through the door left wideflung behind him continued to pulse in his brain she beat me to it she beat me to it  she lay crumpled and quivering in hunting costume complete save for the pair of tiny bronze spurs held over her in anguished impotence by the frightened maid  his examination was quick paula breathed although she was unconscious from front to back on the left side the bullet had torn through his next spring was to the telephone and as he waited the delay of connecting through the house central he prayed that hennessy would be at the stallion barn a stable boy answered and while he ran to fetch the veterinary dick ordered oh joy to stay by the switches and to send oh my to him at once  from the tail of his eye he saw graham rush into the room and on to paula  hennessy dick commanded come on the jump bring the needful for first aid its a rifle shot through the lungs or heart or both come right to mrs forrests rooms now jump  dont touch her he said sharply to graham it might make it worse start a worse hemorrhage  next he was back at oh joy  start callahan with the racing car for eldorado tell him hell meet doctor robinson on the way and that he is to bring doctor robinson back with him on the jump tell him to jump like the devil was after him tell him mrs forrest is hurt and that if he makes time hell save her life  receiver to ear he turned to look at paula graham bending over her but not touching her met his eyes  forrest he began if you have done  but dick hushed him with a warning glance directed toward oh dear who still held the bronze spurs in speechless helplessness  it can be discussed later dick said shortly as he turned his mouth to the transmitter  doctor robinson good mrs forrest has a rifleshot through lungs or heart or maybe both callahan is on his way to meet you in the racing car keep coming as fast as godll let you till you meet callahan goodby  back to paula graham stepped aside as dick on his knees bent over her his examination was brief he looked up at graham with a shake of the head and said  its too ticklish to fool with  he turned to oh dear  put down those spurs and bring pillowsevan lend a hand on the other side and lift gently and steadilyoh dear shove that pillow undereasy easy  he looked up and saw oh my standing silently awaiting orders  get mr bonbright to relieve oh joy at the switches dick commanded tell oh joy to stand near to mr bonbright to rush orders tell oh joy to have all the house boys around him to rush the orders as soon as saunders comes back with mr bishops crowd tell oh joy to start him out on the jump to eldorado to look for callahan in case callahan has a smash up tell oh joy to get hold of mr manson and mr pitts or any two of the managers who have machines and have them with their machines waiting here at the house tell oh joy to take care of mr bishops crowd as usual and you come back here where i can call you  dick turned to oh dear  now tell me how it happened  oh dear shook her head and wrung her hands  where were you when the rifle went off  the chinese girl swallowed and pointed toward the wardrobe room  go on talk dick commanded harshly  mrs forrest tell me to get spurs i forget before i go quick i hear gun i come back quick i run  she pointed to paula to show what she had found  but the gun dick asked  some trouble maybe gun no work maybe four minutes maybe five minutes mrs forrest try make gun work  was she trying to make the gun work when you went for the spurs  oh dear nodded  before that i say maybe oh joy can fix gun mrs forrest say never mind she say you can fix she put gun down then she try once more fix gun then she tell me get spurs then gun go off  hennessys arrival shut off further interrogation his examination was scarcely less brief than dicks he looked up with a shake of the head  nothing i can dare tackle mr forrest the hemorrhage has eased of itself though it must be gathering inside youve sent for a doctor  robinson i caught him in his officehes young a good surgeon dick explained to graham hes nervy and daring and id trust him in this farther than some of the old ones with reputationswhat do you think mr hennessy what chance has she  looks pretty bad though im no judge being only a horse doctor robinsonll know nothing to do but wait  dick nodded and walked out on paulas sleeping porch to listen for the exhaust of the racing machine callahan drove he heard the ranch limousine arrive leisurely and swiftly depart graham came out on the porch to him  i want to apologize forrest he said i was rather off for the moment i found you here and i thought you were here when it happened it must have been an accident  poor little kid dick agreed and she so prided herself on never being careless with guns  ive looked at the rifle graham said but i couldnt find anything wrong with it  and thats how it happened whatever was wrong got right thats how it went off  and while dick talked building the fabric of the lie so that even graham should be fooled to himself he was understanding how well paula had played the trick that last singing of the gypsy trail had been her farewell to graham and at the same time had provided against any suspicion on his part of what she had intended directly to do it had been the same with him she had had her farewell with him and the last thing over the telephone had assured him that she would never have any man but him in all the world  he walked away from graham to the far end of the porch  she had the grit she had the grit he muttered to himself with quivering lips poor kid she couldnt decide between the two and so she solved it this way  the noise of the racing machine drew him and graham together and together they entered the room to wait for the doctor graham betrayed unrest reluctant to go yet feeling that he must  please stay on evan dick told him she liked you much and if she does open her eyes shell be glad to see you  dick and graham stood apart from paula while doctor robinson made his examination when he arose with an air of finality dick looked his question robinson shook his head  nothing to be done he said it is a matter of hours maybe of minutes he hesitated studying dicks face for a moment i can ease her off if you say the word she might possibly recover consciousness and suffer for a space  dick took a turn down the room and back and when he spoke it was to graham  why not let her live again brief as the time may be the pain is immaterial it will have its inevitable quick anodyne it is what i would wish what you would wish she loved life every moment of it why should we deny her any of the little left her  graham bent his head in agreement and dick turned to the doctor  perhaps you can stir her stimulate her to a return of consciousness if you can do so and if the pain proves too severe then you can ease her                                         when her eyes fluttered open dick nodded graham up beside him at first bewilderment was all she betrayed then her eyes focused first on dicks face then on grahams and with recognition her lips parted in a pitiful smile  i i thought at first that i was dead she said  but quickly another thought was in her mind and dick divined it in her eyes as they searched him the question was if he knew it was no accident he gave no sign she had planned it so and she must pass believing it so  i was wrong she said she spoke slowly faintly in evident pain with a pause for strength of utterance between each word i was always so cocksure id never have an accident and look what ive gone and done  its a darn shame dick said sympathetically what was it a jam  she nodded and again her lips parted in the pitiful brave smile as she said whimsically oh dick go call the neighbors in and show them what little paulas din  how serious is it she asked be honest red cloud you know me she added after the briefest of pauses in which dick had not replied  he shook his head  how long she queried  not long came his answer you can ease off any time  you mean she glanced aside curiously at the doctor and back to dick who nodded  its only what i should have expected from you red cloud she murmured gratefully but is doctor robinson game for it  the doctor stepped around so that she could see him and nodded  thank you doctor and remember i am to say when  is there much pain dick queried  her eyes were wide and brave and dreadful and her lips quivered for the moment ere she replied not much but dreadful quite dreadful i wont care to stand it very long ill say when  once more the smile on her lips announced a whimsey  life is queer most queer isnt it and do you know i want to go out with lovesongs in my ears you first evan sing the gypsy trailwhy i was singing it with you less than an hour ago think of it do evan please  graham looked to dick for permission and dick gave it with his eyes  oh and sing it robustly gladly madly just as a womaning gypsy man should sing it she urged and stand back there so where i can see you  and while graham sang the whole song through to its    the heart of a man to the heart of a maid light of my         tents be fleet    morning waits at the end of the world and the world is        all at our feet  oh my immobilefaced a statue stood in the far doorway awaiting commands oh dear griefstricken stood at her mistresss head no longer wringing her hands but holding them so tightly clasped that the fingertips and nails showed white to the rear at paulas dressing table doctor robinson noiselessly dissolved in a glass the anodyne pellets and filled his hypodermic  when graham had finished paula thanked him with her eyes closed them and lay still for a space  and now red cloud she said when next she opened them the song of aikut and of the dewwoman the lushwoman stand where evan did so that i can see you well  and dick chanted  i am aikut the first man of the nishinam aikut is the short for adam and my father and my mother were the coyote and the moon and this is yototowi my wife yototowi is the short for eve she is the first woman of the nishinam  me i am aikut this is my dew of women this is my honeydew of women her father and her mother were the sierra dawn and the summer east wind of the mountains together they conspired and from the air and earth they sweated all sweetness till in a mist of their own love the leaves of the chaparral and the manzanita were dewed with the honey dew  yototowi is my honeydew woman hear me i am aikut yototowi is my quailwoman my deerwoman my lushwoman of all soft rain and fat soil she was born of the thin starlight and the brittle dawn light in the morning of the world and she is the one woman of all women to me  again with closed eyes she lay silent for a while once she attempted to draw a deeper breath which caused her to cough slightly several times  try not to cough dick said  they could see her brows contract with the effort of will to control the irritating tickle that might precipitate a paroxysm  oh dear come around where i can see you she said when she opened her eyes  the chinese girl obeyed moving blindly so that robinson with a hand on her arm was compelled to guide her  goodby oh dear youve been very good to me always and sometimes maybe i have not been good to you i am sorry remember mr forrest will always be your father and your mother and all my jade is yours  she closed her eyes in token that the brief audience was over  again she was vexed by the tickling cough that threatened to grow more pronounced  i am ready dick she said faintly still with closed eyes i want to make my sleepy sleepy noise is the doctor ready come closer hold my hand like you did before in the little death  she turned her eyes to graham and dick did not look for he knew love was in that last look of hers as he knew it would be when she looked into his eyes at the last  once she explained to graham i had to go on the table and i made dick go with me into the anaesthetic chamber and hold my hand until i went under you remember henley called it the drunken dark the little death in life it was very easy  in the silence she continued her look then turned her face and eyes back to dick who knelt close to her holding her hand  with a pressure of her fingers on his and a beckoning of her eyes she drew his ear down to her lips  red cloud she whispered i love you best and i am proud i belonged to you for such a long long time still closer she drew him with the pressure of her fingers im sorry there were no babies red cloud  with the relaxing of her fingers she eased him from her so that she could look from one to the other  two bonnie bonnie men goodby bonnie men goodby red cloud  in the pause they waited while the doctor bared her arm for the needle  sleepy sleepy she twittered in mimicry of drowsy birds i am ready doctor stretch the skin tight first you know i dont like to be hurthold me tight dick  robinson receiving the eye permission from dick easily and quickly thrust the needle through the stretched skin with steady hand sank the piston home and with the ball of the finger soothingly rubbed the morphine into circulation  sleepy sleepy booful sleepy she murmured drowsily after a time  semiconsciously she halfturned on her side curved her free arm on the pillow and nestled her head on it and drew her body up in nestling curves in the way dick knew she loved to sleep  after a long time she sighed faintly and began so easily to go that she was gone before they guessed from without the twittering of the canaries bathing in the fountain penetrated the silence of the room and from afar came the trumpeting of mountain lad and the silver whinny of the fotherington princess     the end
