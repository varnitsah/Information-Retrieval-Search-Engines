50049098	the observations of henry   by jerome k jerome  author of three men in a boat diary of a pilgrimage three men on the bummel etc  bristol j w arrowsmith quay street london simpkin marshall hamilton kent and company limited 1901     the ghost of the marchioness of appleford   this is the story among others of henry the waiteror as he now prefers to call himself henritold to me in the long diningroom of the riffel alp hotel where i once stayed for a melancholy week between seasons sharing the echoing emptiness of the place with two maiden ladies who talked all day to one another in frightened whispers  henrys construction i have discarded for its amateurishness his method being generally to commence a story at the end and then working backwards to the beginning wind up with the middle  but in all other respects i have endeavoured to retain his method which was individual and this i think is the story as he would have told it to me himself had he told it in this order  my first placewell to be honest it was a coffee shop in the mile end roadim not ashamed of it  we all have our beginnings  young kipper as we called himhe had no name of his own not that he knew of anyhow and that seemed to fit him down to the groundhad fixed his pitch just outside between our door and the music hall at the corner and sometimes when i might happen to have a bit on id get a paper from him and pay him for it when the governor was not about with a mug of coffee and odds and ends that the other customers had left on their platesan arrangement that suited both of us  he was just about as sharp as they make boys even in the mile end road which is saying a good deal and now and then spying around among the right sort and keeping his ears open he would put me up to a good thing and i would tip him a bob or a tanner as the case might be  he was the sort that gets onyou know  one day in he walks for all the world as if the show belonged to him with a young imp of a girl on his arm and down they sits at one of the tables  garsong he calls out whats the menoo today  the menoo today i says is that you get outside fore i clip you over the ear and that you take that back and put it where you found it meaning o course the kid  she was a pretty little thing even then in spite of the dirt with those eyes like saucers and red hair  it used to be called carrots in those days  now all the swells have taken it upor as near as they can get to itand its auburn  enery he replied to me without so much as turning a hair im afraid youre forgetting your position  when im on the kerb shouting speshul and you comes to me with yer apenny in yer and youre master an im man  when i comes into your shop to order refreshments and to pay for em im boss  savey  you can bring me a rasher and two eggs and see that theyre this seasons  the lidy will have a fullsized haddick and a cocoa  well there was justice in what he said  he always did have sense and i took his order  you dont often see anybody put it away like that girl did  i took it she hadnt had a square meal for many a long day  she polished off a ninepenny haddick skin and all and after that she had two penny rashers with six slices of bread and butterdoorsteps as we used to call themand two half pints of cocoa which is a meal in itself the way we used to make it  kipper must have had a bit of luck that day  he couldnt have urged her on more had it been a free feed  ave an egg he suggested the moment the rashers had disappeared  one of these eggs will just about finish yer  i dont really think as i can says she after considering like  well you know your own strength he answers  perhaps youre best without it  speshully if yer not used to igh living  i was glad to see them finish cause i was beginning to get a bit nervous about the coin but he paid up right enough and giv me a hapenny for myself  that was the first time i ever waited upon those two but it wasnt to be the last by many a long chalk as youll see  he often used to bring her in after that  who she was and what she was he didnt know and she didnt know so there was a pair of them  shed run away from an old woman down limehouse way who used to beat her  that was all she could tell him  he got her a lodging with an old woman who had an attic in the same house where he sleptwhen it would run to thattaught her to yell speshul and found a corner for her  there aint room for boys and girls in the mileend road  theyre either kids down there or theyre grownups  kipper and carrotsas we named herlooked upon themselves as sweethearts though he couldnt have been more than fifteen and she barely twelve and that he was regular gone on her anyone could see with half an eye  not that he was soft about itthat wasnt his style  he kept her in order and she had just to mind which i guess was a good thing for her and when she wanted it hed use his hand on her and make no bones about it  thats the way among that class  they up and give the old woman a friendly clump just as you or me would swear at the missus or fling a bootjack at her  they dont mean anything more  i left the coffee shop later on for a place in the city and saw nothing more of them for five years  when i did it was at a restaurant in oxford streetone of those amatoor shows run by a lot of women who know nothing about the business and spend the whole day gossiping and flirtingloveshops i call em  there was a yellowhaired lady manageress who never heard you when you spoke to her cause she was always trying to hear what some seedy old fool would be whispering to her across the counter  then there were waitresses and their notion of waiting was to spend an hour talking to a twopenny cup of coffee and to look haughty and insulted whenever anybody as really wanted something ventured to ask for it  a frizzlehaired cashier used to make love all day out of her pigeonhole with the two boxoffice boys from the oxford music hall who took it turn and turn about  sometimes shed leave off to take a customers money and sometimes she wouldnt  ive been to some rummy places in my time and a waiter aint the blind owl as hes supposed to be  but never in my life have i seen so much lovemaking not all at once as used to go on in that place  it was a dismal gloomy sort of hole and spoony couples seemed to scent it out by instinct and would spend hours there over a pot of tea and assorted pastry  idyllic some folks would have thought it i used to get the fair dismals watching it  there was one girla weirdlooking creature with red eyes and long thin hands that gave you the creeps to look at  shed come in regular with her young man a palefaced nervous sort of chap at three oclock every afternoon  theirs was the funniest lovemaking i ever saw  shed pinch him under the table and run pins into him and hed sit with his eyes glued on her as if shed been a steaming dish of steak and onions and he a starving beggar the other side of the window  a strange story that wasas i came to learn it later on  ill tell you that one day  id been engaged for the heavy work but as the heaviest order i ever heard given there was for a cold ham and chicken which i had to slip out for to the nearest cookshop i must have been chiefly useful from an ornamental point of view  id been there about a fortnight and was feeling pretty sick of it when in walked young kipper  i didnt know him at first hed changed so he was swinging a silvermounted crutch stick which was the kind that was fashionable just then and was dressed in a showy check suit and a white hat  but the thing that struck me most was his gloves  i suppose i hadnt improved quite so much myself for he knew me in a moment and held out his hand  what enery he says youve moved on then  yes i says shaking hands with him and i could move on again from this shop without feeling sad  but youve got on a bit i says  soso he says im a journalist  oh i says what sort for id seen a good many of that lot during six months id spent at a house in fleet street and their getup hadnt sumptuousness about it so to speak  kippers rigout must have totted up to a tidy little sum  he had a diamond pin in his tie that must have cost somebody fifty quid if not him  well he answers i dont wind out the confidential advice to old beaky and that sort of thing  i do the tips yer know  capn kit thats my name  what the captain kit i says  o course id heard of him  beold he says  oh its easy enough he goes on  some of ems bound to come out right and when one does you take it from me our paper mentions the fact  and when it is a wrong unwell a man cant always be shouting about himself can e  he ordered a cup of coffee  he said he was waiting for someone and we got to chatting about old times  hows carrots i asked  miss caroline trevelyan he answered is doing well  oh i says youve found out her famly name then  weve found out one or two things about that lidy he replies  dyer remember er dancing  i have seen her flinging her petticoats about outside the shop when the copper wasnt by if thats what you mean i says  thats what i mean he answers  thats all the rage now skirtdancing they calls it  shes acoming out at the oxford tomorrow  its er im waiting for  shes acoming on i tell you she is he says  shouldnt wonder says i that was her disposition  and theres another thing weve found out about er he says  he leant over the table and whispered it as if he was afraid that anybody else might hear shes got a voice  yes i says some women have  ah he says but er voice is the sort of voice yer want to listen to  oh i says thats its speciality is it  thats it sonny he replies  she came in a little later  id a known her anywhere for her eyes and her red hair in spite of her being that clean you might have eaten your dinner out of her hand  and as for her clothes  well ive mixed a good deal with the toffs in my time and ive seen duchesses dressed more showily and maybe more expensively but her clothes seemed to be just a framework to show her up  she was a beauty you can take it from me and its not to be wondered that the ladedas were round her when they did see her like flies round an open jam tart  before three months were up she was the rage of londonleastways of the musichall part of itwith her portrait in all the shop windows and interviews with her in half the newspapers  it seems she was the daughter of an officer who had died in india when she was a baby and the niece of a bishop somewhere in australia  he was dead too  there didnt seem to be any of her ancestry as wasnt dead but they had all been swells  she had been educated privately she had by a relative and had early displayed an aptitude for dancing though her friends at first had much opposed her going upon the stage  there was a lot more of ityou know the sort of thing  of course she was a connection of one of our best known judgesthey all areand she merely acted in order to support a grandmother or an invalid sister i forget which  a wonderful talent for swallowing these newspaper chaps has some of em  kipper never touched a penny of her money but if he had been her agent at twentyfive per cent he couldnt have worked harder and he just kept up the hum about her till if you didnt want to hear anything more about caroline trevelyan your only chance would have been to lie in bed and never look at a newspaper  it was caroline trevelyan at home caroline trevelyan at brighton caroline trevelyan and the shah of persia caroline trevelyan and the old applewoman  when it wasnt caroline trevelyan herself it would be caroline trevelyans dog as would be doing something out of the common getting himself lost or summoned or drownedit didnt matter much what  i moved from oxford street to the new horseshoe that yearit had just been rebuiltand there i saw a good deal of them for they came in to lunch there or supper pretty regular  young kipperor the captain as everybody called himgave out that he was her halfbrother  iad to be some sort of a relation you see he explained to me  id a been er brother out and out that would have been simpler only the family likeness wasnt strong enough  our styles o beauty aint similar  they certainly wasnt  why dont you marry her i says and have done with it  he looked thoughtful at that  i did think of it he says and i know jolly well that if i ad suggested it fore shed found herself shed have agreed but it dont seem quite fair now  how dye mean fair i says  well not fair to er he says  ive got on all right in a small way but shewell she can just ave er pick of the nobs  theres one on em as ive made inquiries about  ell be a dook if a kid pegs out as is expected to and anyhow ell be a markis and e means the straight thingno errer  it aint fair for me to stand in er way  well i says you know your own business but it seems to me she wouldnt have much way to stand in if it hadnt been for you  oh thats all right he says  im fond enough of the gell but i shant clamour for a tombstone with wiolets even if she aint ever mrs captn kit  business is business and i aint going to queer er pitch for er  ive often wondered what shed a said if hed up and put the case to her plain for she was a good sort but naturally enough her head was a bit swelled and shed read so much rot about herself in the papers that shed got at last to half believe some of it  the thought of her connection with the wellknown judge seemed to hamper her at times and she wasnt quite so chummy with kipper as used to be the case in the mileend road days and he wasnt the sort as is slow to see a thing  one day when he was having lunch by himself and i was waiting on him he says raising his glass to his lips well enery heres luck to yer  i wont be seeing you agen for some time  oh i says  whats up now  i am he says or rather my time is  im off to africa  oh i says and what about  thats all right he interrupts  ive fixed up thata treat  truth thats why im going  i thought at first he meant she was going with him  no he says shes going to be the duchess of ridingshire with the kind consent o the kid i spoke about  if not shell be the marchioness of appleford  es doing the square thing  theres going to be a quiet marriage tomorrow at the registry office and then im off  what need for you to go i says  no need he says its a fancy o mine  you see me gone theres nothing to amper ernothing to interfere with er settling down as a quiet respectable toff  with a alfbrother whos always got to be spry with some fake about is lineage and is ancestral estates and who drops is hs complications are sooner or later bound to arise  me out of iteverythings simple  savey  well thats just how it happened  of course there was a big row when the family heard of it and a smart lawyer was put up to try and undo the thing  no expense was spared you bet but it was all no go  nothing could be found out against her  she just sat tight and said nothing  so the thing had to stand  they went and lived quietly in the country and abroad for a year or two and then folks forgot a bit and they came back to london  i often used to see her name in print and then the papers always said as how she was charming and graceful and beautiful so i suppose the family had made up its mind to get used to her  one evening in she comes to the savoy  my wife put me up to getting that job and a good job it is mind you when you know your way about  id never have had the cheek to try for it if it hadnt been for the missis shes a clever oneshe is  i did a good days work when i married her  you shave off that moustache of yoursit aint an ornament she says to me and chance it  dont get attempting the lingo  keep to the broken english and put in a shrug or two  you can manage that all right  i followed her tip  of course the manager saw through me but i got in a oui monsieur now and again and they being short handed at the time could not afford to be strict i suppose  anyhow i got took on and there i stopped for the whole season and that was the making of me  well as i was saying in she comes to the supper rooms and toffy enough she looked in her diamonds and furs and as for haughtiness there wasnt a born marchioness she couldnt have given points to  she comes straight up to my table and sits down  her husband was with her but he didnt seem to have much to say except to repeat her orders  of course i looked as if id never set eyes on her before in all my life though all the time she was apecking at the mayonnaise and asipping at the giessler i was thinking of the coffeeshop and of the ninepenny haddick and the pint of cocoa  go and fetch my cloak she says to him after a while  i am cold  and up he gets and goes out  she never moved her head and spoke as though she was merely giving me some order and i stands behind her chair respectful like and answers according to the same tip  ever hear from kipper she says to me  i have had one or two letters from him your ladyship i answers  oh stow that she says  i am sick of your ladyship  talk english i dont hear much of it  hows he getting on  seems to be doing himself well i says  hes started an hotel and is regular raking it in he tells me  wish i was behind the bar with him says she  why dont it work then i asks  its just like a funeral with the corpse left out says she  serves me jolly well right for being a fool  the marquis he comes back with her cloak at that moment and i says certainement madame and gets clear  i often used to see her there and when a chance occurred she would talk to me  it seemed to be a relief to her to use her own tongue but it made me nervous at times for fear someone would hear her  then one day i got a letter from kipper to say he was over for a holiday and was stopping at morleys and asking me to look him up  he had not changed much except to get a bit fatter and more prosperous looking  of course we talked about her ladyship and i told him what she said  rum things women he says never know their own minds  oh they know them all right when they get there i says  how could she tell what being a marchioness was like till shed tried it  pity he says musing like  i reckoned it the very thing shed tumble to  i only come over to get a sight of er and to satisfy myself as she was getting along all right  seems id better a stopped away  you aint ever thought of marrying yourself i asks  yes i have he says  its slow for a man over thirty with no wife and kids to bustle him you take it from me and i aint the talent for the don juan fake  youre like me i says a days work and then a pipe by your own fireside with your slippers on  thats my swarry  youll find someone as will suit you before long  no i shant says he  ive come across a few as might if it adnt been for er  its like the toffs as come out our way  theyve been brought up on ris de veau a la financier and sich like and it just spoils em for the bacon and greens  i give her the office the next time i see her and they met accidental like in kensington gardens early one morning  what they said to one another i dont know for he sailed that same evening and it being the end of the season i didnt see her ladyship again for a long while  when i did it was at the hotel bristol in paris and she was in widows weeds the marquis having died eight months before  he never dropped into that dukedom the kid turning out healthier than was expected and hanging on so she was still only a marchioness and her fortune though tidy was nothing very bignot as that class reckons  by luck i was told off to wait on her she having asked for someone as could speak english  she seemed glad to see me and to talk to me  well i says i suppose youll be bossing that bar in capetown now before long  talk sense she answers  how can the marchioness of appleford marry a hotel keeper  why not i says if she fancies him  whats the good of being a marchioness if you cant do what you like  thats just it she snaps out you cant  it would not be doing the straight thing by the family  no she says ive spent their money and im spending it now  they dont love me but they shant say as i have disgraced them  theyve got their feelings same as ive got mine  why not chuck the money i says  theyll be glad enough to get it back they being a poor lot as i heard her say  how can i she says  its a life interest  as long as i live ive got to have it and as long as i live ive got to remain the marchioness of appleford  she finishes her soup and pushes the plate away from her  as long as i live she says talking to herself  by jove she says starting up why not  why not what i says  nothing she answers  get me an african telegraph form and be quick about it  i fetched it for her and she wrote it and gave it to the porter then and there and that done she sat down and finished her dinner  she was a bit short with me after that so i judged it best to keep my own place  in the morning she got an answer that seemed to excite her and that afternoon she left and the next i heard of her was a paragraph in the newspaper headeddeath of the marchioness of appleford  sad accident  it seemed she had gone for a row on one of the italian lakes with no one but a boatman  a squall had come on and the boat had capsized  the boatman had swum ashore but he had been unable to save his passenger and her body had never been recovered  the paper reminded its readers that she had formerly been the celebrated tragic actress caroline trevelyan daughter of the wellknown indian judge of that name  it gave me the blues for a day or twothat bit of news  i had known her from a baby as you might say and had taken an interest in her  you can call it silly but hotels and restaurants seemed to me less interesting now there was no chance of ever seeing her come into one again  i went from paris to one of the smaller hotels in venice  the missis thought id do well to pick up a bit of italian and perhaps she fancied venice for herself  thats one of the advantages of our profession  you can go about  it was a secondrate sort of place and one evening just before lightingup time i had the salleamanger all to myself and had just taken up a paper when i hears the door open and i turns round  i saw her coming down the room  there was no mistaking her  she wasnt that sort  i sat with my eyes coming out of my head till she was close to me and then i says  carrots i says in a whisper like  that was the name that come to me  carrots it is she says and down she sits just opposite to me and then she laughs  i could not speak i could not move i was that took aback and the more frightened i looked the more she laughed till kipper comes into the room  there was nothing ghostly about him  i never see a man look more as if he had backed the winner  why its enery he says and he gives me a slap on the back as knocks the life into me again  i heard you was dead i says still staring at her  i read it in the paperdeath of the marchioness of appleford  thats all right she says  the marchioness of appleford is as dead as a doornail and a good job too  mrs captain kits my name nee carrots  you said as ow id find someone to suit me fore long says kipper to me and by jove you were right i ave  i was waiting till i found something equal to her ladyship and id ave ad to wait a long time im thinking if i adnt come across this one ere and he tucks her up under his arm just as i remember his doing that day he first brought her into the coffeeshop and lord what a long time ago that was        that is the story among others told me by henry the waiter  i have at his request substituted artificial names for real ones  for henry tells me that at capetown captain kits firstclass family and commercial hotel still runs and that the landlady is still a beautiful woman with fine eyes and red hair who might almost be taken for a duchessuntil she opens her mouth when her accent is found to be still slightly reminiscent of the mileend road     the uses and abuses of joseph   it is just the same with what you may call the human joints observed henry  he was in one of his philosophic moods that evening  it all depends upon the cooking  i never see a youngster hanging up in the refrigerator as one may put it but i says to myself now i wonder what the cook is going to make of you  will you be minced and devilled and fricasseed till you are all sauce and no meat  will you be hammered tender and grilled over a slow fire till you are a blessing to mankind or will you be spoilt in the boiling and come out a stringy rag an immediate curse and a permanent injury to those who have got to swallow you  there was a youngster i knew in my old coffeeshop days continued henry that in the end came to be eaten by cannibals  at least so the newspapers said  speaking for myself i never believed the report he wasnt that sort  if anybody was eaten it was more likely the cannibal but that is neither here nor there  what i am thinking of is what happened before he and the cannibals ever got nigh to one another  he was fourteen when i first set eyes on himmile end fourteen that is which is the same i take it as city eighteen and west end fiveandtwentyand he was smart for his age into the bargain a trifle too smart as a matter of fact  he always came into the shop at the same timehalfpast two he always sat in the seat next the window and three days out of six he would order the same dinner a fourpenny beefsteak puddingwe called it beefsteak and for all practical purposes it was beefsteaka penny plate of potatoes and a penny slice of rolypoly puddingchest expander was the name our customers gave itto follow that showed sense i always thought that dinner alone a more satisfying menu at the price i defy any human being to work out  he always had a book with him and he generally read during his meal which is not a bad plan if you dont want to think too much about what you are eating  there was a seedy chap i remember used to dine at a cheap restaurant where i once served just off the euston road  he would stick a book up in front of himeppy something or otherand read the whole time  our fourcourse shilling table dhote with eppy he would say was a banquet fit for a prince without eppy he was of opinion that a policeman wouldnt touch it  but he was one of those men that report things for the newspapers and was given to exaggeration  a coffeeshop becomes a bit of a desert towards three oclock and after a while young tidelman for that was his name got to putting down his book and chatting to me  his father was dead which judging from what he told me about the old man must have been a bit of luck for everybody and his mother it turned out had come from my own village in suffolk and that constituted a sort of bond between us seeing i had known all her people pretty intimately  he was earning good money at a dairy where his work was scouring milkcans and his christian namewhich was the only thing christian about him and that somehow or another didnt seem to fit himwas joseph  one afternoon he came into the shop looking as if he had lost a shilling and found sixpence as the saying is and instead of drinking water as usual sent the girl out for a pint of ale  the moment it came he drank off half of it at a gulp and then sat staring out of the window  whats up i says  got the shove  yes he answers but as it happens its a shove up  ive been taken off the yard and put on the walk with a rise of two bob a week then he took another pull at the beer and looked more savage than ever  well i says that aint the sort of thing to be humpy about  yes it is he snaps back it means that if i dont take precious good care ill drift into being a blooming milkman spending my life yelling milk ahoi and spooning smuttyfaced servantgals across area railings  oh i says and what may you prefer to spoonduchesses  yes he answers sulkylike duchesses are right enoughsome of em  so are servantgals i says some of em  your hats feeling a bit small for you this morning aint it  hats all right says he its the world as im complaining ofbeastly place theres nothing to do in it  oh i says some of us find theres a bit too much  id been up since five that morning myself and his own work which was scouring milk cans for twelve hours a day didnt strike me as suggesting a life of leisured ease  i dont mean that he says  i mean things worth doing  well what do you want to do i says that this world aint big enough for  it aint the size of it he says its the dulness of it  things used to be different in the old days  how do you know i says  you can read about it he answers  oh i says and what do they know about itthese gents that sit down and write about it for their living  you show me a book cracking up the old times writ by a chap as lived in em and ill believe you  till then ill stick to my opinion that the old days were much the same as these days and maybe a trifle worse  from a sunday school point of view perhaps yes says he but theres no gainsaying  no what i says  no gainsaying repeats he its a common word in literatoor  maybe says i but this happens to be the blue posts coffee house established in the year 1863  we will use modern english here if you dont mind  one had to take him down like that at times  he was the sort of boy as would talk poetry to you if you werent firm with him  well then theres no denying the fact says he if you prefer it that way that in the old days there was more opportunity for adventure  what about australia says i  australia retorts he what would i do there  be a shepherd like you see in the picture wear ribbons and play the flute  theres not much of that sort of shepherding over there says i unless ive been deceived but if australia aint sufficiently uncivilised for you what about africa  whats the good of africa replies he you dont read advertisements in the clerkenwell news young men wanted as explorers  id drift into a barbers shop at cape town more likely than anything else  what about the gold diggings i suggests  i like to see a youngster with the spirit of adventure in him  it shows grit as a rule  played out says he  you are employed by a company wages ten dollars a week and a pension for your old age  everythings played out he continues  men aint wanted nowadays  theres only room for clerks and intelligent artisans and shopboys  go for a soldier says i theres excitement for you  that would have been all right says he in the days when there was real fighting  theres a good bit of it going about nowadays i says  we are generally at it on and off between shouting about the blessings of peace  not the sort of fighting i mean replies he i want to do something myself not be one of a row  well i says i give you up  youve dropped into the wrong world it seems to me  we dont seem able to cater for you here  ive come a bit too late he answers thats the mistake ive made two hundred years ago there were lots of things a fellow might have done  yes i know whats in your mind i says pirates  yes pirates would be all right says he they got plenty of seaair and exercise and didnt need to join a blooming funeral club  youve got ideas above your station i says  you work hard and one day youll have a milkshop of your own and be walking out with a pretty housemaid on your arm feeling as if you were the prince of wales himself  stow it he says it makes me shiver for fear it might come true  im not cut out for a respectable cove and i wont be one neither if i can help it  what do you mean to be then i says weve all got to be something until were stiff uns  well he says quite coollike i think i shall be a burglar  i dropped into the seat opposite and stared at him  if any other lad had said it i should have known it was only foolishness but he was just the sort to mean it  its the only calling i can think of says he that has got any element of excitement left in it  you call seven years at portland excitement do you says i thinking of the argument most likely to tell upon him  whats the difference answers he between portland and the ordinary labouring mans life except that at portland you never need fear being out of work  he was a rare one to argue  besides says he its only the fools as gets copped  look at that diamond robbery in bond street two years ago  fifty thousand pounds worth of jewels stolen and never a clue to this day  look at the dublin bank robbery says he his eyes all alight and his face flushed like a girls  three thousand pounds in golden sovereigns walked away with in broad daylight and never so much as the flick of a coattail seen  those are the sort of men im thinking of not the bricklayer out of work who smashes a window and gets ten years for breaking open a cheesemongers till with nine and fourpence hapenny in it  yes says i and are you forgetting the chap who was nabbed at birmingham only last week  he wasnt exactly an amatoor  how long do think hell get  a man like that deserves what he gets answers he couldnt hit a policeman at six yards  you bloodthirsty young scoundrel i says do you mean you wouldnt stick at murder  its all in the game says he not in the least put out  i take my risks he takes his  its no more murder than soldiering is  its taking a human creatures life i says  well he says what of it  theres plenty more where he comes from  i tried reasoning with him from time to time but he wasnt a sort of boy to be moved from a purpose  his mother was the only argument that had any weight with him  i believe so long as she had lived he would have kept straight that was the only soft spot in him  but unfortunately she died a couple of years later and then i lost sight of joe altogether  i made enquiries but no one could tell me anything  he had just disappeared thats all  one afternoon four years later i was sitting in the coffeeroom of a city restaurant where i was working reading the account of a clever robbery committed the day before  the thief described as a welldressed young man of gentlemanly appearance wearing a short black beard and moustache had walked into a branch of the london and westminster bank during the dinnerhour when only the manager and one clerk were there he had gone straight through to the managers room at the back of the bank taken the key from the inside of the door and before the man could get round his desk had locked him in  the clerk with a knife to his throat had then been persuaded to empty all the loose cash in the bank amounting in gold and notes to nearly five hundred pounds into a bag which the thief had thoughtfully brought with him  after which both of themfor the thief seems to have been of a sociable dispositiongot into a cab which was waiting outside and drove away  they drove straight to the city the clerk with a knife pricking the back of his neck all the time finding it no doubt a tiresome ride  in the middle of threadneedle street the gentlemanly young man suddenly stopped the cab and got out leaving the clerk to pay the cabman  somehow or other the story brought back joseph to my mind  i seemed to see him as that welldressed gentlemanly young man and raising my eyes from the paper there he stood before me  he had scarcely changed at all since i last saw him except that he had grown better looking and seemed more cheerful  he nodded to me as though we had parted the day before and ordered a chop and a small hock  i spread a fresh serviette for him and asked him if he cared to see the paper  anything interesting in it henry says he  rather a daring robbery committed on the westminster bank yesterday i answers  oh ah  i did see something about that says he  the thief was described as a welldressed young man of gentlemanly appearance wearing a black beard and moustache says i  he laughs pleasantly  that will make it awkward for nice young men with black beards and moustaches says he  yes i says  fortunately for you and me were clean shaved  i felt as certain he was the man as though id seen him do it  he gives me a sharp glance but i was busy with the cruets and he had to make what he chose out of it  yes he replies as you say it was a daring robbery  but the man seems to have got away all right  i could see he was dying to talk to somebody about it  hes all right today says i but the police aint the fools theyre reckoned  ive noticed they generally get there in the end  theres some very intelligent men among them says he no question of it  i shouldnt be surprised if they had a clue  no i says no more should i though no doubt hes telling himself there never was such a clever thief  well we shall see says he  thats about it says i  we talked a bit about old acquaintances and other things and then having finished he handed me a sovereign and rose to go  wait a minute i says your bill comes to threeandeight  say fourpence for the waiter that leaves sixteen shillings change which ill ask you to put in your pocket  as you will he says laughing though i could see he didnt like it  and one other thing says i  weve been sort of pals and its not my business to talk unless im spoken to  but im a married man i says and i dont consider you the sort worth getting into trouble for if i never see you i know nothing about you  understand  he took my tip and i didnt see him again at that restaurant  i kept my eye on the paper but the westminster bank thief was never discovered and success no doubt gave him confidence  anyhow i read of two or three burglaries that winter which i unhesitatingly put down to mr josephi suppose theres style in housebreaking as in other thingsand early the next spring an exciting bit of business occurred which i knew to be his work by the description of the man  he had broken into a big country house during the servants supperhour and had stuffed his pockets with jewels  one of the guests a young officer coming upstairs interrupted him just as he had finished  joseph threatened the man with his revolver but this time it was not a nervous young clerk he had to deal with  the man sprang at him and a desperate struggle followed with the result that in the end the officer was left with a bullet in his leg while joseph jumped clean through the window and fell thirty feet  cut and bleeding if not broken he would never have got away but that fortunately for him a tradesmans cart happened to be standing at the servants entrance  joe was in it and off like a flash of greased lightning  how he managed to escape with all the country in an uproar i cant tell you but he did it  the horse and cart when found sixteen miles off were neither worth much  that it seems sobered him down for a bit and nobody heard any more of him till nine months later when he walked into the monico where i was then working and held out his hand to me as bold as brass  its all right says he its the hand of an honest man  its come into your possession very recently then says i  he was dressed in a black frockcoat and wore whiskers  if i hadnt known him i should have put him down for a parson out of work  he laughs  ill tell you all about it he says  not here i answers because im too busy but if you like to meet me this evening and youre talking straight  straight as a bullet says he  come and have a bit of dinner with me at the craven its quiet there and we can talk  ive been looking for you for the last week  well i met him and he told me  it was the old story a gal was at the bottom of it  he had broken into a small house at hampstead  he was on the floor packing up the silver when the door opens and he sees a gal standing there  she held a candle in one hand and a revolver in the other  put your hands up above your head says she  i looked at the revolver said joe telling me it was about eighteen inches off my nose and then i looked at the gal  theres lots of em will threaten to blow your brains out for you but youve only got to look at em to know they wont  they are thinking of the coroners inquest and wondering how the judge will sum up  she met my eyes and i held up my hands  if i hadnt i wouldnt have been here  now you go in front says she to joe and he went  she laid her candle down in the hall and unbolted the front door  what are you going to do says joe call the police  because if so my dear ill take my chance of that revolver being loaded and of your pulling the trigger in time  it will be a more dignified ending  no says she i had a brother that got seven years for forgery  i dont want to think of another face like his when he came out  im going to see you outside my masters house and thats all i care about  she went down the gardenpath with him and opened the gate  you turn round says she before you reach the bottom of the lane and i give the alarm  and joe went straight and didnt look behind him  well it was a rum beginning to a courtship but the end was rummer  the girl was willing to marry him if he would turn honest  joe wanted to turn honest but didnt know how  its no use fixing me down my dear to any quiet respectable calling says joe to the gal because even if the police would let me alone i wouldnt be able to stop there  id break out sooner or later try as i might  the girl went to her master who seems to have been an odd sort of a cove and told him the whole story  the old gent said hed see joe and joe called on him  whats your religion says the old gent to joe  im not particular sir ill leave it to you says joe  good says the old gent  youre no fanatic  what are your principles  at first joe didnt think hed got any but the old gent leading he found to his surprise as he had  i believe says joe in doing a job thoroughly  what your hand finds to do you believe in doing with all your might eh says the old gent  thats it sir says joe  thats what ive always tried to do  anything else asks the old gent  yes stick to your pals said joe  through thick and thin suggests the old gent  to the blooming end agrees joe  thats right says the old gent  faithful unto death  and you really want to turn over a new leafto put your wits and your energy and your courage to good use instead of bad  thats the idea says joe  the old gent murmurs something to himself about a stone which the builders wouldnt have at any price and then he turns and puts it straight  if you undertake the work says he youll go through with it without falteringyoull devote your life to it  if i undertake the job ill do that says joe  what may it be  to go to africa says the old gent as a missionary  joe sits down and stares at the old gent and the old gent looks him back  its a dangerous station says the old gent  two of our people have lost their lives there  it wants a man therea man who will do something besides preach who will save these poor people we have gathered together there from being scattered and lost who will be their champion their protector their friend  in the end joe took on the job and went out with his wife  a better missionary that society never had and never wanted  i read one of his early reports home and if the others were anything like it his life must have been exciting enough even for him  his station was a small island of civilisation as one may say in the middle of a sea of savages before he had been there a month the place had been attacked twice  on the first occasion joes flock had crowded into the mission house and commenced to pray that having been the plan of defence adopted by his predecessor  joe cut the prayer short and preached to them from the text heaven helps them as helps themselves after which he proceeded to deal out axes and old rifles  in his report he mentioned that he had taken a hand himself merely as an example to the flock i bet he had never enjoyed an evening more in all his life  the second fight began as usual round the mission but seems to have ended two miles off  in less than six months he had rebuilt the schoolhouse organised a police force converted all that was left of one tribe and started a tin church  he added but i dont think they read that part of his report aloud that law and order was going to be respected and life and property secure in his district so long as he had a bullet left  later on the society sent him still further inland to open up a fresh station and there it was that according to the newspapers the cannibals got hold of him and ate him  as i said personally i dont believe it  one of these days hell turn up sound and whole he is that sort     the surprise of mr milberry   its not the sort of thing to tell em remarked henry as with his napkin over his arm he leant against one of the pillars of the verandah and sipped the glass of burgundy i had poured out for him and they wouldnt believe it if you did tell em not one of em  but its the truth for all that  without the clothes they couldnt do it  who wouldnt believe what i asked  he had a curious habit had henry of commenting aloud upon his own unspoken thoughts thereby bestowing upon his conversation much of the quality of the double acrostic  we had been discussing the question whether sardines served their purpose better as a hors doeuvre or as a savoury and i found myself wondering for the moment why sardines above all other fish should be of an unbelieving nature while endeavouring to picture to myself the costume best adapted to display the somewhat difficult figure of a sardine  henry put down his glass and came to my rescue with the necessary explanation  why womenthat they can tell one baby from another without its clothes  ive got a sister a monthly nurse and she will tell you for a fact if you care to ask her that up to three months of age there isnt really any difference between em  you can tell a girl from a boy and a christian child from a black heathen perhaps but to fancy you can put your finger on an unclothed infant and say thats a smith or thats a jones as the case may bewhy its sheer nonsense  take the things off em and shake them up in a blanket and ill bet you what you like that which is which youd never be able to tell again so long as you lived  i agreed with henry so far as my own personal powers of discrimination might be concerned but i suggested that to mrs jones or mrs smith there would surely occur some means of identification  so theyd tell you themselves no doubt replied henry and of course i am not thinking of cases where the child might have a mole or a squint as might come in useful  but take em in general kids are as much alike as sardines of the same age would be  anyhow i knew a case where a fool of a young nurse mixed up two children at an hotel and to this day neither of those women is sure that shes got her own  do you mean i said there was no possible means of distinguishing  there wasnt a fleabite to go by answered henry  they had the same bumps the same pimples the same scratches they were the same age to within three days they weighed the same to an ounce and they measured the same to an inch  one father was tall and fair and the other was short and dark  the tall fair man had a dark short wife and the short dark man had married a tall fair woman  for a week they changed those kids to and fro a dozen times a day and cried and quarrelled over them  each woman felt sure she was the mother of the one that was crowing at the moment and when it yelled she was positive it was no child of hers  they thought they would trust to the instinct of the children  neither child so long as it wasnt hungry appeared to care a curse for anybody and when it was hungry it always wanted the mother that the other kid had got  they decided in the end to leave it to time  its three years ago now and possibly enough some likeness to the parents will develop that will settle the question  all i say is up to three months old you cant tell em i dont care who says you can  he paused and appeared to be absorbed in contemplation of the distant matterhorn then clad in its rosy robe of evening  there was a vein of poetry in henry not uncommon among cooks and waiters  the perpetual atmosphere of hot food i am inclined to think favourable to the growth of the softer emotions  one of the most sentimental men i ever knew kept a hamandbeef shop just off the farringdon road  in the early morning he could be shrewd and businesslike but when hovering with a knife and fork above the mingled steam of bubbling sausages and hissing peaspudding any whimpering tramp with any impossible tale of woe could impose upon him easily  but the rummiest go i ever recollect in connection with a baby continued henry after a while his gaze still fixed upon the distant snow crowned peaks happened to me at warwick in the jubilee year  ill never forget that  is it a proper story i asked a story fit for me to hear  on consideration henry saw no harm in it and told it to me accordingly        he came by the bus that meets the 452  hed a handbag and a sort of hamper it looked to me like a linenbasket  he wouldnt let the boots touch the hamper but carried it up into his bedroom himself  he carried it in front of him by the handles and grazed his knuckles at every second step  he slipped going round the bend of the stairs and knocked his head a rattling good thump against the balustrade but he never let go that hamperonly swore and plunged on  i could see he was nervous and excited but one gets used to nervous and excited people in hotels whether a mans running away from a thing or running after a thing he stops at a hotel on his way and so long as he looks as if he could pay his bill one doesnt trouble much about him  but this man interested me he was so uncommonly young and innocentlooking  besides it was a dull hole of a place after the sort of jobs id been used to and when youve been doing nothing for three months but waiting on commercial gents as are having an exceptionally bad season and spoony couples with guide books you get a bit depressed and welcome any incident however slight that promises to be out of the common  i followed him up into his room and asked him if i could do anything for him  he flopped the hamper on the bed with a sigh of relief took off his hat wiped his head with his handkerchief and then turned to answer me  are you a married man says he  it was an odd question to put to a waiter but coming from a gent there was nothing to be alarmed about  well not exactly i saysi was only engaged at that time and that not to my wife if you understand what i meanbut i know a good deal about it i says and if its a matter of advice  it isnt that he answers interrupting me but i dont want you to laugh at me  i thought if you were a married man you would be able to understand the thing better  have you got an intelligent woman in the house  weve got women i says  as to their intelligence thats a matter of opinion theyre the average sort of women  shall i call the chambermaid  ah do he says  wait a minute he says well open it first  he began to fumble with the cord then he suddenly lets go and begins to chuckle to himself  no he says you open it  open it carefully it will surprise you  i dont take much stock in surprises myself  my experience is that theyre mostly unpleasant  whats in it i says  youll see if you open it he says it wont hurt you  and off he goes again chuckling to himself  well i says to myself i hope youre a harmless specimen  then an idea struck me and i stopped with the knot in my fingers  it aint a corpse i says is it  he turned as white as the sheet on the bed and clutched the mantlepiece good god dont suggest such a thing he says i never thought of that  open it quickly  id rather you came and opened it yourself sir i says  i was beginning not to half like the business  i cant he says after that suggestion of yoursyouve put me all in a tremble  open it quick man tell me its all right  well my own curiosity helped me  i cut the cord threw open the lid and looked in  he kept his eyes turned away as if he were frightened to look for himself  is it all right he says  is it alive  its about as alive i says as anybodyll ever want it to be i should say  is it breathing all right he says  if you cant hear it breathing i says im afraid youre deaf  you might have heard its breathing outside in the street  he listened and even he was satisfied  thank heaven he says and down he plumped in the easychair by the fireplace  you know i never thought of that he goes on  hes been shut up in that basket for over an hour and if by any chance hed managed to get his head entangled in the clothesill never do such a fools trick again  youre fond of it i says  he looked round at me  fond of it he repeats  why im his father and then he begins to laugh again  oh i says  then i presume i have the pleasure of addressing mr coster king  coster king he answers in surprise  my names milberry  i says the father of this child according to the label inside the cover is coster king out of starlight his mother being jenny deans out of darby the devil  he looks at me in a nervous fashion and puts the chair between us  it was evidently his turn to think as how i was mad  satisfying himself i suppose that at all events i wasnt dangerous he crept closer till he could get a look inside the basket  i never heard a man give such an unearthly yell in all my life  he stood on one side of the bed and i on the other  the dog awakened by the noise sat up and grinned first at one of us and then at the other  i took it to be a bullpup of about nine months old and a fine specimen for its age  my child he shrieks with his eyes starting out of his head that thing isnt my child  whats happened  am i going mad  youre on that way i says and so he was  calm yourself i says what did you expect to see  my child he shrieks again my only childmy baby  do you mean a real child i says a human child  some folks have such a silly way of talking about their dogsyou never can tell  of course i do he says the prettiest child you ever saw in all your life just thirteen weeks old on sunday  he cut his first tooth yesterday  the sight of the dogs face seemed to madden him  he flung himself upon the basket and would i believe have strangled the poor beast if i hadnt interposed between them  taint the dogs fault i says i daresay hes as sick about the whole business as you are  hes lost too  somebodys been having a lark with you  theyve took your baby out and put this inthat is if there ever was a baby there  what do you mean he says  well sir i says if youll excuse me gentlemen in their sober senses dont take their babies about in dogbaskets  where do you come from  from banbury he says im well known in banbury  i can quite believe it i says youre the sort of young man that would be known anywhere  im mr milberry he says the grocer in the high street  then what are you doing here with this dog i says  dont irritate me he answers  i tell you i dont know myself  my wifes stopping here at warwick nursing her mother and in every letter shes written home for the last fortnight shes said oh how i do long to see eric  if only i could see eric for a moment  a very motherly sentiment i says which does her credit  so this afternoon continues he it being earlyclosing day i thought id bring the child here so that she might see it and see that it was all right  she cant leave her mother for more than about an hour and i cant go up to the house because the old lady doesnt like me and i excite her  i wish to wait here and millythats my wifewas to come to me when she could get away  i meant this to be a surprise to her  and i guess i says it will be the biggest one you have ever given her  dont try to be funny about it he says im not altogether myself and i may do you an injury  he was right  it wasnt a subject for joking though it had its humorous side  but why i says put it in a dogbasket  it isnt a dogbasket he answers irritably its a picnic hamper  at the last moment i found i hadnt got the face to carry the child in my arms i thought of what the streetboys would call out after me  hes a rare one to sleep and i thought if i made him comfortable in that he couldnt hurt just for so short a journey  i took it in the carriage with me and carried it on my knees i havent let it out of my hands a blessed moment  its witchcraft thats what it is  i shall believe in the devil after this  dont be ridiculous i says theres some explanation it only wants finding  you are sure this is the identical hamper you packed the child in  he was calmer now  he leant over and examined it carefully  it looks like it he says but i cant swear to it  you tell me i says you never let it go out of your hands  now think  no he says its been on my knees all the time  but thats nonsense i says unless you packed the dog yourself in mistake for your baby  now think it over quietly  im not your wife im only trying to help you  i shant say anything even if you did take your eyes off the thing for a minute  he thought again and a light broke over his face  by jove he says youre right  i did put it down for a moment on the platform at banbury while i bought a titbits  there you are i says now youre talking sense  and wait a minute isnt tomorrow the first day of the birmingham dog show  i believe youre right he says  now were getting warm i says  by a coincidence this dog was being taken to birmingham packed in a hamper exactly similar to the one you put your baby in  youve got this mans bullpup hes got your baby and i wouldnt like to say offhand at this moment which of yous feeling the madder  as likely as not he thinks youve done it on purpose  he leant his head against the bedpost and groaned  milly may be here at any moment says he and ill have to tell her the babys been sent by mistake to a dog show  i daresnt do it he says i daresnt do it  go on to birmingham i says and try and find it  you can catch the quarter to six and be back here before eight  come with me he says youre a good man come with me  i aint fit to go by myself  he was right hed have got run over outside the door the state he was in then  well i says if the guvnor dont object  oh he wont he cant cries the young fellow wringing his hands tell him its a matter of a lifes happiness  tell him  ill tell him its a matter of half sovereign extra on to the bill i says  thatll more likely do the trick  and so it did with the result that in another twenty minutes me and young milberry and the bullpup in its hamper were in a thirdclass carriage on our way to birmingham  then the difficulties of the chase began to occur to me  suppose by luck i was right suppose the pup was booked for the birmingham dog show and suppose by a bit more luck a gent with a hamper answering description had been noticed getting out of the 513 train then where were we  we might have to interview every cabman in the town  as likely as not by the time we did find the kid it wouldnt be worth the trouble of unpacking  still it wasnt my cue to blab my thoughts  the father poor fellow was feeling i take it just about as bad as he wanted to feel  my business was to put hope into him so when he asked me for about the twentieth time if i thought as he would ever see his child alive again i snapped him up shortish  dont you fret yourself about that i says  youll see a good deal of that child before youve done with it  babies aint the sort of things as gets lost easily  its only on the stage that folks ever have any particular use for other peoples children  ive known some bad characters in my time but id have trusted the worst of em with a wagon load of other peoples kids  dont you flatter yourself youre going to lose it  whoevers got it you take it from me his idea is to do the honest thing and never rest till hes succeeded in returning it to the rightful owner  well my talking like that cheered him and when we reached birmingham he was easier  we tackled the stationmaster and he tackled all the porters who could have been about the platform when the 513 came in  all of em agreed that no gent got out of that train carrying a hamper  the stationmaster was a family man himself and when we explained the case to him he sympathised and telegraphed to banbury  the bookingclerk at banbury remembered only three gents booking by that particular train  one had been mr jessop the cornchandler the second was a stranger who had booked to wolverhampton and the third had been young milberry himself  the business began to look hopeless when one of smiths newsboys who was hanging around struck in  i see an old lady says he hovering about outside the station and a hailing cabs and she had a hamper with her as was as like that one there as two peas  i thought young milberry would have fallen upon the boys neck and kissed him  with the boy to help us we started among the cabmen  old ladies with dogbaskets aint so difficult to trace  she had gone to a small secondrate hotel in the aston road  i heard all particulars from the chambermaid and the old girl seems to have had as bad a time in her way as my gent had in his  they couldnt get the hamper into the cab it had to go on the top  the old lady was very worried as it was raining at the time and she made the cabman cover it with his apron  getting it off the cab they dropped the whole thing in the road that woke the child up and it began to cry  good lord maam what is it asks the chambermaid a baby  yes my dear its my baby answers the old lady who seems to have been a cheerful sort of old soulleastways she was cheerful up to then poor dear i hope they havent hurt him  the old lady had ordered a room with a fire in it  the boots took the hamper up and laid it on the hearthrug  the old lady said she and the chambermaid would see to it and turned him out  by this time according to the girls account it was roaring like a steamsiren  pretty dear says the old lady fumbling with the cord dont cry mothers opening it as fast as she can  then she turns to the chambermaidif you open my bag says she you will find a bottle of milk and some dogbiscuits  dogbiscuits says the chambermaid  yes says the old lady laughing my baby loves dogbiscuits  the girl opened the bag and there sure enough was a bottle of milk and half a dozen spratts biscuits  she had her back to the old lady when she heard a sort of a groan and a thud as made her turn round  the old lady was lying stretched dead on the hearthrugso the chambermaid thought  the kid was sitting up in the hamper yelling the roof off  in her excitement not knowing what she was doing she handed it a biscuit which it snatched at greedily and began sucking  then she set to work to slap the old lady back to life again  in about a minute the poor old soul opened her eyes and looked round  the baby was quiet now gnawing the dogbiscuit  the old lady looked at the child then turned and hid her face against the chambermaids bosom  what is it she says speaking in an awed voice  the thing in the hamper  its a baby maam says the maid  youre sure it aint a dog says the old lady  look again  the girl began to feel nervous and to wish that she wasnt alone with the old lady  i aint likely to mistake a dog for a baby maam says the girl  its a childa human infant  the old lady began to cry softly  its a judgment on me she says  i used to talk to that dog as if it had been a christian and now this thing has happened as a punishment  whats happened says the chambermaid who was naturally enough growing more and more curious  i dont know says the old lady sitting up on the floor  if this isnt a dream and if i aint mad i started from my home at farthinghoe two hours ago with a oneyearold bulldog packed in that hamper  you saw me open it you see whats inside it now  but bulldogs says the chambermaid aint changed into babies by magic  i dont know how its done says the old lady and i dont see that it matters  i know i started with a bulldog and somehow or other its got turned into that  somebodys put it there says the chambermaid somebody as wanted to get rid of a child  theyve took your dog out and put that in its place  they must have been precious smart says the old lady the hamper hasnt been out of my sight for more than five minutes when i went into the refreshmentroom at banbury for a cup of tea  thats when they did it says the chambermaid and a clever trick it was  the old lady suddenly grasped her position and jumped up from the floor and a nice thing for me she says  an unmarried woman in a scandal mongering village  this is awful  its a finelooking child says the chambermaid  would you like it says the old lady  the chambermaid said she wouldnt  the old lady sat down and tried to think and the more she thought the worse she felt  the chambermaid was positive that if we hadnt come when we did the poor creature would have gone mad  when the boots appeared at the door to say there was a gent and a bulldog downstairs enquiring after a baby she flung her arms round the mans neck and hugged him  we just caught the train to warwick and by luck got back to the hotel ten minutes before the mother turned up  young milberry carried the child in his arms all the way  he said i could have the hamper for myself and gave me halfasovereign extra on the understanding that i kept my mouth shut which i did  i dont think he ever told the childs mother what had happenedleastways if he wasnt a fool right through he didnt     the probation of james wrench   there are two sorts of men as gets henpecked remarked henryi forgot how the subject had originated but we had been discussing the merits of henry viii considered as a father and a husbandthe sort as likes it and the sort as dont and i wouldnt be too cocksure that the sort as does isnt on the whole in the majority  you see continued henry argumentatively it gives as it were a kind of interest to life which nowadays with everything going smoothly and no chance of a row anywhere except in your own house is apt to become a bit monotonous  there was a chap i got to know pretty well one winter when i was working in dresden at the europaischer hof a quiet meek little man he was a journeyman butcher by trade and his wife was a dressmaker a schneiderin as they call them over there and ran a fairly big business in the praguer strasse  ive always been told that german husbands are the worst going treating their wives like slaves or at the best as mere upper servants  but my experience is that human nature dont alter so much according to distance from london as we fancy it does and that husbands have their troubles same as wives all the world over  anyhow ive come across a german husband or two as didnt carry about with him any sign of the slave driver such as you might notice at all events not in his own house and i know for a fact that meister anton which was the name of the chap im telling you about couldnt have been much worse off not even if hed been an englishman born and bred  there were no children to occupy her mind so she just devoted herself to him and the workgirls and made things hum as they say in america for all of them  as for the girls they got away at six in the evening and not many of them stopped more than the first month  but the old man not being able to give notice had to put up with an average of eighteen hours a day of it  and even when as was sometimes the case he managed to get away for an hour or two in the evening for a quiet talk with a few of us over a glass of beer he could never be quite happy thinking of what was accumulating for him at home  of course everybody as knew him knew of his troublesfor a scolding wife aint the sort of thing as can be hid under a busheland was sorry for him he being as amiable and goodtempered a fellow as ever lived and most of us spent our time with him advising him for his good  some of the more ardent would give him recipes for managing her but they being generally speaking bachelors their suggestions lacked practicability as you might say  one man bored his life out persuading him to try a bucket of cold water  he was one of those coldwater enthusiasts this fellow took it himself for everything and always went to a hydropathic establishment for his holidays  rumour had it that meister anton really did try this experiment on one unfortunate occasionworried into it i suppose by the other chaps persistency  anyhow we didnt see him again for a week he being confined to his bed with a chill on the liver  and the next suggestion made to him he rejected quite huffily explaining that he had no intention of putting any fresh ideas into his wifes head  she wasnt a bad woman mind youmerely given to fits of temper  at times she could be quite pleasant but when she wasnt life with her must have been exciting  he had stood it for about seven years and then one day without a word of warning to anyone he went away and left her  as she was quite able to keep herself this seemed to be the best arrangement possible and everybody wondered why he had never thought of it before i did not see him again for nine months until i ran against him by pure chance on the koln platform where i was waiting for a train to paris  he told me they had made up all their differences by correspondence and that he was then on his way back to her  he seemed quite cheerful and expectant  do you think shes really reformed i says  do you think nine months is long enough to have taught her a lesson  i didnt want to damp him but personally i have never known but one case of a woman being cured of nagging and that being brought about by a fall from a thirdstory window resulting in what the doctors called permanent paralysis of the vocal organs can hardly be taken as a precedent  no he answers nor nine years  but its been long enough to teach me a lesson  you know me he goes on  i aint a quarrelsome sort of chap  if nobody says a word to me i never says a word to anybody and its been like that ever since i left her day in and day out all just the same up in the morning do your bit of work drink your glass of beer and to bed in the evening nothing to excite you nothing to rouse you  why its a mere animal existence  he was a rum sort of chap always thought things out from his own point of view as it were  yes a curious case i remarked to henry not the sort of story to put about however  it might give women the idea that nagging is attractive and encourage them to try it upon husbands who do not care for that kind of excitement  not much fear of that replied henry  the nagging woman is born as they say not made and shell nag like the roses bloom not because she wants to but because she cant help it  and a woman to whom it dont come natural will never be any real good at it try as she may  and as for the men why well just go on selecting wives according to the old rule so that you never know what youve got till its too late for you to do anything but make the best or the worst of it according as your fancy takes you  there was a fellow continued henry as used to work with me a good many years ago now at a small hotel in the city  he was a waiter like myselfnot a bad sort of chap though a bit of a toff in his offhours hed been engaged for some two or three years to one of the chambermaids a pretty gentlelooking little thing she was with big childish eyes and a voice like the pouring out of water  they are strange things women one can never tell what they are made of from the taste of them and while i was there it having been a good season for both of them they thought theyd risk it and get married  they did the sensible thing he coming back to his work after the weeks holiday and she to hers the only difference being that they took a couple of rooms of their own in middleton row from where in summertime you can catch the glimpse of a green tree or two and slept out  the first few months they were as happy as a couple in a play she thinking almost as much of him as he thought of himself which must have been a comfort to both of them and he as proud of her as if he made her himself  and then some fifteenth cousin or so of his a man he had never heard of before died in new zealand and left him a fortune  that was the beginning of his troubles and hers too  i dont say it was enough to buy a peerage but to a man accustomed to dream of half crown tips it seemed an enormous fortune  anyhow it was sufficient to turn his head and give him ideas above his station  his first move of course was to chuck his berth and set fire to his dress suit which being tolerably greasy burned well  had he stopped there nobody could have blamed him  ive often thought myself that i would willingly give ten years of my life provided anybody wanted them which i dont see how they should to put my own behind the fire  but he didnt  he took a house in a mews with the front door in a street off grosvenor square furnished it like a secondclass german restaurant dressed himself like a bookmaker and fancied that with the help of a few shady city chaps and a brokendown swell or two he had gathered round him he was fairly on the road to park lane and the house of lords  and the only thing that struck him as being at all in his way was his wife  in her cap and apron or her sunday print she had always looked as dainty and fetching a little piece of goods as a man could wish to be seen out with  dressed according to the advice of his newfound friends of course she looked like nothing else so much as a barnyard chicken in turkeycocks feathers  he was shocked to find that her size in gloves was sevenandaquarter and in boots something over four and that sort of thing naturally irritates a woman more even than finding fault with her immortal soul  i guess for about a year he made her life pretty well a burden for her trying to bring her up to the standard of the saturday tomondayatbrighton set with which he had surrounded himself or which to speak more correctly had got round him  shed a precious sight more gumption than he had ever possessed and if he had listened to her instead of insisting upon her listening to him it would have been better for him  but there are some men who think that if you have a taste for champagne and the ballet that proves you are intended by nature for a nob and he was one of them and any commonsense suggestion of hers only convinced him of her natural unfitness for an exalted station  he grumbled at her accent which seeing that his own was acquired in limehouse and finished off in the minories was just the sort of thing a fool would do  and he insisted on her reading all the society novels as they came outyou know the sort i meanwhere everybody snaps everybody elses head off and all the proverbs are upside down people leave them about the hotels when theyve done with them and one gets into the habit of dipping into them when ones nothing better to do  his hope was that she might with pains get to talk like these books  that was his ideal  she did her best but of course the more she got away from herself the more absurd she became and the rubbish and worse that he had about him would ridicule her more or less openly  and he instead of kicking them out into the mewswhich could have been done easily without grosvenor square knowing anything about it and thereby having its highclass feelings hurthe would blame her when they had all gone just as if it was her fault that she was the daughter of a respectable bootmaker in the mile end road instead of something more likely than not turned out of the third row of the ballet because it couldnt dance and didnt want to learn  he played a bit in the city and won at first and that swelled his head worse than ever  it also brought him a good deal of sympathy from an italian countess the sort you find at homburg and that generally speaking is a widow  her chief sorrow was for societythat in him was losing an ornament  she explained to him how an accomplished and experienced woman could help a man to gain admittance into the tiptop circles which according to her were just thirsting for him  as a waiter he had his share of brains and its a business that requires more insight than perhaps youd fancy if you dont want to waste your time on a rabbitskin coat and a paste ring and give the burnt sole to the real gent  but in the hands of this swell mob he was of course just the young man from the country and the end of it was that he played the game down pretty low  shenot the countess i shouldnt like you to have that idea but his wifecame to be pretty friendly with my missus later on and thats how i got to know the details  he comes to her one day looking pretty sheepishlike as one can well believe and maybe hed been drinking a bit to give himself courage  we aint been getting along too well together of late have we susan says he  we aint seen much of one another she answers but i agree with you we dont seem to enjoy it much when we do  it aint your fault says he  im glad you think that she answers it shows me you aint quite as foolish as i was beginning to think you  of course i didnt know when i married you he goes on as i was going to come into this money  no nor i either says she or you bet it wouldnt have happened  it seems to have been a bit of a mistake says he as things have turned out  it would have been a mistake and more than a bit of a one in any case answers she  im glad you agree with me says he therell be no need to quarrel  ive always tried to agree with you says she  weve never quarrelled yet and that ought to be sufficient proof to you that we never shall  its a mistake that can be rectified says he if you are sensible and that without any harm to anyone  oh says she it must be a new sort of mistake that kind  were not fitted for one another says he  out with it says she  dont you be afraid of my feelings they are well under control as i think i can fairly say by this time  with a man in your own station of life says he youd be happier  theres many a man i might have been happier with replies she  that aint the thing to be discussed seeing as ive got you  you might get rid of me says he  you mean you might get rid of me she answers  it comes to the same thing he says  no it dont she replies nor anything like it  i shouldnt have got rid of you for my pleasure and im not going to do it for yours  you can live like a decent man and ill go on putting up with you or you can live like a fool and i shant stand in your way  but you cant do both and im not going to help you try  well he argued with her and he tried the coaxing dodge and he tried the bullying dodge but it didnt work neither of it  ive done my duty by you says she so far as ive been able and that ill go on doing or not just as you please but i dont do more  we cant go on living like this says he and it isnt fair to ask me to  youre hammering my prospects  i dont want to do that says she  you take your proper position in society whatever that may be and ill take mine  ill be glad enough to get back to it you may rest assured  what do you mean says he  its simple enough she answers  i was earning my living before i married you and i can earn it again  you go your way i go mine  it didnt satisfy him but there was nothing else to be done and there was no moving her now in any other direction whatever even had he wanted to  he offered her anything in the way of moneyhe wasnt a mean chapbut she wouldnt touch a penny  she had kept her old clothesim not sure that some idea of needing them hadnt always been in her headapplied for a place under her former manager who was then bossing a hotel in kensington and got it  and there was an end of high life so far as she was concerned  as for him he went the usual way  it always seems to me as if men and women were just like water sooner or later they get back to the level from which they startedthat is of course generally speaking  here and there a drop clings where it climbs but taking them on the whole pumpingup is a slow business  lord  i have seen them many of them jolly clever theyve thought themselves with their diamond rings and big cigars  wait a bit ive always said to myself therell come a day when youll walk in and be glad enough of your chop and potatoes again with your halfpint of bitter  and nine cases out of ten ive been right  james wrench followed the course of the majority only a little more so tried to do others a precious sight sharper than himself and got done tried a dozen times to scramble up again each time coming down heavier than before till there wasnt another spring left in him and his only ambition victuals  then of course he thought of his wifeits a wonderful domesticator ill luckand wondered what she was doing  fortunately for him shed been doing well  her father died and left her a bit just a couple of hundred or so and with this and her own savings she started with a small inn in a growing town and had sold out again three years later at four times what she had paid for it  she had done even better than that for herself  she had developed a talent for cookingthat was a settled income in itselfand at this time was running a small hotel in brighton and making it pay to a tune that would have made the shareholders of some of its bigger rivals a bit envious could they have known  he came to me having found out i dont know hownecessity smartens the wits i supposethat my missis still kept up a sort of friendship with her and begged me to try and arrange a meeting between them which i did though i told him frankly that from what i knew his welcome wouldnt be much more enthusiastic than what hed any right to expect but he was always of a sanguine disposition and borrowing his fare and an old greatcoat of mine he started off evidently thinking that all his troubles were over  but they werent exactly  the married womens property act had altered things a bit and master james found himself greeted without any suggestion of tenderness by a businesslike woman of thirtysix or thereabouts and told to wait in the room behind the bar till she could find time to talk to him  she kept him waiting there for threequarters of an hour just sufficient time to take the side out of him and then she walks in and closes the door behind her  id say you hadnt changed hardly a day susan says he if it wasnt that youd grown handsomer than ever  i guess hed been turning that over in his mind during the threequarters of an hour  it was his fancy that he knew a bit about women  my names mrs wrench says she and if you take your hat off and stand up while im talking to you it will be more what im accustomed to  well that staggered him a bit but there didnt seem anything else to be done so he just made as if he thought it funny though i doubt if at the time he saw the full humour of it  and now what do you want says she seating herself in front of her desk and leaving him standing first on one leg and then on the other twiddling his hat in his hands  ive been a bad husband to you susan begins he  i could have told you that she answers  what i asked you was what you wanted  i want for us to let bygones be bygones says he  thats quite my own idea says she and if you dont allude to the past i shant  youre an angel susan says he  ive told you once answers she that my names mrs wrench  im susan to my friends not to every brokendown tramp looking for a job  aint i your husband says he trying a bit of dignity  she got up and took a glance through the glassdoor to see that nobody was there to overhear her  for the first and last time says she let you and me understand one another  ive been eleven years without a husband and ive got used to it  i dont feel now as i want one of any kind and if i did it wouldnt be your sort  eleven years ago i wasnt good enough for you and now youre not good enough for me  i want to reform says he  i want to see you do it says she  give me a chance says he  im going to says she but its going to be my experiment this time not yours  eleven years ago i didnt give you satisfaction so you turned me out of doors  you went susan says he you know it was your own idea  dont you remind me too much of the circumstances replies she turning on him with a look in her eyes that was probably new to him i went because there wasnt room for two of us you know that  the other kind suited you better  now im going to see whether you suit me and she sits herself again in her landladys chair  in what way says he  in the way of earning your living says she and starting on the road to becoming a decent member of society  he stood for a while cogitating  dont you think says he at last as i could manage this hotel for you  thanks says she im doing that myself  what about looking to the financial side of things says he and keeping the accounts  its hardly your work  nor yours either answers she drily judging by the way youve been keeping your own  you wouldnt like me to be headwaiter i suppose says he  it would be a bit of a comedown  youre thinking of the hotel i suppose says she  perhaps you are right  my customers are mostly an oldfashioned class its probable enough they might not like you  you had better suggest something else  i could hardly be an underwaiter says he  perhaps not says she your manners strike me as a bit too familiar for that  then he thought hed try sarcasm  perhaps youd fancy my being the boots says he  thats more reasonable says she  you couldnt do much harm there and i could keep an eye on you  you really mean that says he starting to put on his dignity  but she cut him short by ringing the bell  if you think you can do better for yourself she says theres an end of it  by a curious coincidence the place is just now vacant  ill keep it open for you till tomorrow night you can turn it over in your mind and one of the page boys coming in she just says goodmorning and the interview was at an end  well he turned it over and he took the job  he thought shed relent after the first week or two but she didnt  he just kept that place for over fifteen months and learnt the business  in the house he was james the boots and she mrs wrench the landlady and she saw to it that he didnt forget it  he had his wages and he made his tips and the food was plentiful but i take it he worked harder during that time than hed ever worked before in his life and found that a landlady is just twice as difficult to please as the strictest landlord it can be a mans misfortune to get under and that mrs wrench was no exception to the rule  at the end of the fifteen months she sends for him into the office  he didnt want telling by this time he just stood with his hat in his hand and waited respectful like  james says she after she had finished what she was doing i find i shall want another waiter for the coffeeroom this season  would you care to try the place  thank you mrs wrench he answers its more what ive been used to and i think ill be able to give satisfaction  theres no wages attached as i suppose you know continues she but the second floor goes with it and if you know your business you ought to make from twentyfive to thirty shillings a week  thank you mrs wrench thatll suit me very well replies he and it was settled  he did better as a waiter hed got it in his blood as you might say and so after a time he worked up to be headwaiter  now and then of course it came about that he found himself waiting on the very folks that hed been chums with in his classy days and that must have been a bit rough on him  but hed taken in a good deal of sense since then and when one of the old sort all rings and shirtfront dining there one sunday evening started chaffing him jimmy just shut him up with a quiet yes i guess we were both a bit out of our place in those days the difference between us now is that i have got back to mine which cost him his tip but must nave been a satisfaction to him  altogether he worked in that hotel for some three and a half years and then mrs wrench sends for him again into the office  sit down james says she  thank you mrs wrench says james and sat  im thinking of giving up this hotel james says she and taking another near dover a quiet place with just such a clientele as i shall like  do you care to come with me  thank you says he but im thinking mrs wrench of making a change myself  oh says she im sorry to hear that james  i thought wed been getting on very well together  ive tried to do my best mrs wrench says he and i hope as ive given satisfaction  ive nothing to complain of james says she  i thank you for saying it says he and i thank you for the opportunity you gave me when i wanted it  its been the making of me  she didnt answer for about a minute  then says she youve been meeting some of your old friends james im afraid and theyve been persuading you to go back into the city  no mrs wrench says he no more city for me and no more neighbourhood of grosvenor square unless it be in the way of business and that couldnt be of course for a good long while to come  what do you mean by business asks she  the hotel business replies he  i believe i know the bearings by now  ive saved a bit thanks to you mrs wrench and a bits come in from the wreck that i never hoped for  enough to start you asks she  not quite enough for that answers he  my idea is a small partnership  how much is it altogether says she if its not an impertinent question  not at all answers he  it tots up to 900 pounds about  she turns back to her desk and goes on with her writing  dover wouldnt suit you i suppose says she without looking round  dovers all right says he if the business is a good one  it can be worked up into one of the best things going says she and im getting it dirt cheap  you can have a third share for a thousand pounds thats just what its costing and owe me the other hundred  and what position do i take says he  if you come in on those terms says she then of course its a partnership  he rose and came over to her  life isnt all business susan says he  ive found it so mostly says she  fourteen years ago says he i made the mistake now youre making it  what mistake am i making says she  that mans the only thing as cant learn a lesson says he  oh says she and whats the lesson that youve learnt  that i never get on without you susan says he  well says she you suggested a partnership and i agreed to it  what more do you want  i want to know the name of the firm says he  mr and mrs wrench says she turning round to him and holding out her hand  how will that suit you  thatll do me all right answers he  and ill try and give satisfaction adds he  i believe you says she  and in that way they made a fresh start as it were     the wooing of tom sleights wife   its competition replied henry that makes the world go round  you never want a thing particularly until you see another fellow trying to get it then it strikes you all of a sudden that youve a better right to it than he has  take barmaids whats the attraction about em  in looks theyre no better than the average girl in the street while as for their temper well thats a bit above the averageleastways so far as my experience goes  yet the thinnest of em has her dozen making sheepseyes at her across the counter  ive known girls that on the level couldnt have got a policeman to look at em  put em behind a row of tumblers and a shillingsworth of stale pastry and nothing outside a lincoln and bennett is good enough for em  its the competition thats the making of em  now ill tell you a story continued henry that bears upon the subject  its a pretty story if you look at it from one point of view though my wife maintainsand shes a bit of a judge mind youthat its not yet finished she arguing that theres a difference between marrying and being married  you can have a fancy for the one without caring much about the other  what i tell her is that a boy isnt a man and a man isnt a boy  besides its five years ago now and nothing has happened since though of course one can never say  i would like to hear the story i ventured to suggest ill be able to judge better afterwards  its not a long one replied henry though as a matter of fact it began seventeen years ago in portsmouth new hampshire  he was a wild young fellow and always had been  who was i interrupted  tom sleight answered henry the chap im telling you about  he belonged to a good family his father being a magistrate for monmouthshire but there had been no doing anything with young tom from the very first  at fifteen he ran away from school at clifton and with everything belonging to him tied up in a pockethandkerchief made his way to bristol docks  there he shipped as boy on board an american schooner the capn not pressing for any particulars being shorthanded and the boy himself not volunteering much  whether his folks made much of an effort to get him back or whether they didnt i cant tell you  maybe they thought a little roughing it would knock some sense into him anyhow the fact remains that for the next seven or eight years until the sudden death of his father made him a country gentleman a more or less jolly sailorman he continued to be  and it was during that periodto be exact three years after he ran away and four years before he returnedthat as i have said at portsmouth new hampshire he married after ten days courtship mary godselle only daughter of jean godselle saloon keeper of that town  that makes him just eighteen i remarked somewhat young for a bridegroom  but a good deal older than the bride was henrys comment she being at the time a few months over fourteen  was it legal i enquired  quite legal answered henry  in new hampshire it would seem they encourage early marriages  cant begin a good thing too soon is i suppose their motto  how did the marriage turn out was my next question  the married life of a lady and gentleman the united ages of whom amounted to thirtytwo promised interesting developments  practically speaking replied henry it wasnt a marriage at all  it had been a secret affair from the beginning as perhaps you can imagine the old man had other ideas for his daughter and wasnt the sort of father to be played with  they separated at the church door intending to meet again in the evening  two hours later master tom sleight got knocked on the head in a street brawl  if a row was to be had anywhere within walking distance he was the sort of fellow to be in it  when he came to his senses he found himself lying in his bunk and the susan prideif that was the name of the ship i think it wasten miles out to sea  the captain declined to put the vessel about to please either a loving seaman or a loving seamans wife and to come to the point the next time mr tom sleight saw mrs tom sleight was seven years later at the american bar of the grand central in paris and then he didnt know her  but what had she been doing all the time i queried  do you mean to tell me that she a married woman had been content to let her husband disappear without making any attempt to trace him  i was making it short retorted henry in an injured tone for your benefit if you want to have the whole of it of course you can  he wasnt a scamp he was just a scatterbrainthat was the worst you could say against him  he tried to communicate with her but never got an answer  then he wrote to the father and told him frankly the whole story  the letter came back six months later markedgone away left no address  you see what had happened was this the old man died suddenly a month or two after the marriage without ever having heard a word about it  the girl hadnt a relative or friend in the town all her folks being french canadians  shed got her pride and shed got a sense of humour not common in a woman  i was with her at the grand central for over a year and came to know her pretty well  she didnt choose to advertise the fact that her husband had run away from her as she thought an hour after he had married her  she knew he was a gentleman with rich relatives somewhere in england and as the months went by without bringing word or sign of him she concluded hed thought the matter over and was ashamed of her  you must remember she was merely a child at the time and hardly understood her position  maybe later on she would have seen the necessity of doing something  but chance as it were saved her the trouble for she had not been serving in the cafe more than a month when early one afternoon in walked her lord and master  mamsell marie as of course we called her over there was at that moment busy talking to two customers while smiling at a third and our hero he gave a start the moment he set eyes on her  you told me that when he saw her there he didnt know her i reminded henry  quite right sir replied henry so i did but he knew a pretty girl when he saw one anywhere at any timehe was that sort and a prettier saucier looking young personage than marie in spite of her misfortunes as i suppose youd call em you wouldnt have found had you searched paris from the place de la bastille to the arc de triomphe  did she i asked know him or was the forgetfulness mutual  she recognised him returned henry before he entered the cafe owing to catching sight of his face through the glass door while he was trying to find the handle  women on some points have better memories than men added to which when you come to think of it the game was a bit onesided  except that his moustache maybe was a little more imposing and that he wore the clothes of a gentleman in place of those of an able bodied seaman before the mast he was to all intents and purposes the same as when they parted six years ago outside the church door while she had changed from a child in a short muslin frock and a flapper as i believe they call it tied up in blue ribbon to a selfpossessed young woman in a frock that might have come out of a bond street show window and a japanese coiffure that being then the fashion  she finished with her french customers not hurrying herself in the leastthat wasnt her way and then strolling over to her husband asked him in french what she could have the pleasure of doing for him  his education on board the susan pride and others had i take it gone back rather than forward  he couldnt understand her so she translated it for him into broken english with an accent  he asked her how she knew he was english  she told him it was because englishmen had such pretty moustaches and came back with his order which was rum punch  she kept him waiting about a quarter of an hour before she returned with it  he filled up the time looking into the glass behind him when he thought nobody was observing him  one american drink as they used to concoct it in that bar was generally enough for most of our customers but he before he left contrived to put away three also contriving during the same short space of time to inform mamsel marie that paris since he had looked into her eyes had become the only town worth living in so far as he was concerned throughout the whole universe  he had his failings had master tom sleight but shyness wasnt one of them  she gave him a smile when he left that would have brought a less impressionable young man than he back again to that cafe but for the rest of the day i noticed mamsel marie frowned to herself a good deal and was quite unusually cynical in her view of things in general  next afternoon he found his way to us again and much the same sort of thing went on only a little more of it  a sailorman so i am told makes love with his hour of departure always before his mind and so gets into the habit of not wasting time  he gave her short lessons in english for which she appeared to be grateful and she at his request taught him the french for you are just charming  i love you with which so he explained it was his intention on his return to england to surprise his mother  he turned up again after dinner and the next day before lunch when after that i looked up and missed him at his usual table the feeling would come to me that business was going down  marie always appeared delighted to see him and pouted when he left but what puzzled me at the time was that though she fooled him to the top of his bent she flirted every bit as much if not more with her other customersleastways with the nicer ones among them  there was one young frenchman in particulara goodlooking chap a monsieur flammard son of the painter  up till then hed been making love pretty steadily to miss marie as indeed had most of em without ever getting much forrarder for hitherto a chat about the weather and a smile that might have meant she was in love with you or might have meant she was laughing at youno man could ever tell whichwas all the most persistent had got out of her  now however and evidently to his own surprise young monsieur flammard found himself in clover  provided his english rival happened to be present and not too far removed he could have as much flirtation as he wanted which you may take it worked out at a very tolerable amount master tom could sit and scowl and for the matter of that did but as marie would explain to him always with the sweetest of smiles her business was to be nice to all her customers and to this of course he had nothing to reply that he couldnt understand a word of what she and flammard talked and laughed about didnt seem to make him any the happier  well this sort of thing went on for perhaps a fortnight and then one morning over our dejeune when she and i had the cafe entirely to ourselves i took the opportunity of talking to mamsel marie like a father  she heard me out without a murmur which showed her sense for liking the girl sincerely i didnt mince matters with her but spoke plainly for her good  the result was she told me her story much as i have told it to you  its a funny tale says i when shed finished though maybe you yourself dont see the humour of it  yes i do was her answer  but theres a serious side to it also says she and that interests me more  youre sure youre not making a mistake i suggested  hes been in my thoughts too much for me to forget him she replied besides hes told me his name and all about himself  not quite all says i  no and thats why i feel hard toward him answers she  now you listen to me says i  this is a very pretty comedy and the way youve played it does you credit up till now  dont you run it on too long and turn it into a problem play  how dye mean says she  a mans a man says i anyhow hes one  he fell in love with you six years ago when you were only a child and now youre a woman hes fallen in love with you again  if that dont convince you of his constancy nothing will  you stop there  dont you try to find out any more  i mean to find out one thing answers she whether hes a manor a cad  thats a severe remark says i to make about your own husband  what am i to think says she  he fooled me into loving him when as you say i was only a child  do you think i havent suffered all these years  its the girl that cries her eyes out for her lover we learn to take em for what theyre worth later on  but hes in love with you still i says  i knew what was in her mind but i wanted to lead her away from it if i could  thats a lie says she and you know it  she wasnt choosing her words she was feeling if you understand  hes in love with a pretty waitress that he met for the first time a fortnight ago  thats because she reminds him of you i replied or because you remind him of her whichever you prefer  it shows youre the sort of woman hell always be falling in love with  she laughed at that but the next moment she was serious again  a mans got to fall out of love before he falls into it again she replied  i want a man thatll stop there  besides she goes on a woman isnt always young and pretty weve got to remember that  we want something else in a husband besides eyes  you seem to know a lot about it says i  ive thought a lot about it says she  what sort of husband do you want says i  i want a man of honour says she  that was sense  one dont often find a girl her age talking it but her life had made her older than she looked  all i could find to say was that he appeared to be an honest chap and maybe was one  maybe says she thats what i mean to find out  and if youll do me a kindness she adds you wont mind calling me marie luthier for the future instead of godselle  it was my mothers name and ive a fancy for it  well there i left her to work out the thing for herself having come to the conclusion she was capable of doing it and so for another couple of weeks i merely watched  there was no doubt about his being in love with her  he had entered that cafe at the beginning of the month with as good an opinion of himself as a man can conveniently carry without tumbling down and falling over it  before the month was out he would sit with his head between his hands evidently wondering why he had been born  ive seen the game played before and ive seen it played since  a waiter has plenty of opportunities if he only makes use of them for if it comes to a matter of figures i suppose theres more lovemaking done in a month under the electric light of the restaurant than the moon sees in a yearleastways so far as concerns what we call the civilised world ive seen men fooled from boys without hair on their faces to old men without much on their heads  ive seen it done in a way that was pretty to watch and ive seen it done in a manner that has made me feel that given a wig and a petticoat i could do it better myself  but never have i seen it neater played than marie played it on that young man of hers one day she would greet him for all the world like a tired child that at last has found its mother and the next day respond to him in a style calculated to give you the idea of a smallsized empress in misfortune compelled to tolerate the familiarities of an anarchist  one moment she would throw him a pout that said as clearly as words what a fool you are not to put your arms round me and kiss me and five minutes later chill him with a laugh that as good as told him he must be blind not to see that she was merely playing with him  what happened outside the cafefor now and then she would let him meet her of a morning in the tuileries and walk down to the cafe with her and once or twice had allowed him to see her part of the way homei cannot tell you i only know that before strangers it was her instinct to be reserved  i take it that on such occasions his experiences were interesting but whether they left him elated or depressed i doubt if he could have told you himself  but all the time marie herself was just going from bad to worse  she had come to the cafe a lighthearted sweettempered girl now when she wasnt engaged in her playactingfor thats all it was i could see plainly enoughshe would go about her work silent and miserablelooking or if she spoke at all it would be to say something bitter  then one morning after a holiday she had asked for and which i had given her without any questions she came to business more like her old self than i had seen her since the afternoon master tom sleight had appeared upon the scene  all that day she went about smiling to herself and young flammard presuming a bit too far maybe upon past favours found himself sharply snubbed it was a bit rough on him the whole thing  its come to a head says i to myself he has explained everything and has managed to satisfy her  hes a cleverer chap than i took him for  he didnt turn up at the cafe that day however at all and she never said a word until closing time when she asked me to walk part of the way home with her  well i says so soon as we had reached a quieter street is the comedy over  no says she so far as im concerned its commenced  to tell you the truth its been a bit too serious up to now to please me  im only just beginning to enjoy myself and she laughed quite her old light hearted laugh  you seem to be a bit more cheerful i says  im feeling it says she hes not as bad as i thought  we went to versailles yesterday  pretty place versailles says i paths a bit complicated if you dont know your way among em  they do wind says she  and there he told you that he loved you and explained everything  youre quite right says she thats just what happened  and then he kissed me for the first and last time and now hes on his way to america  on his way to america says i stopping still in the middle of the street  to find his wife she says  hes pretty well ashamed of himself for not having tried to do it before  i gave him one or two hints how to set about ithes not over smartand ive got an idea he will discover her  she dropped her joking manner and gave my arm a little squeeze shed have flirted with her own grandfatherthats my opinion of her  he was really nice she continues  i had to keep lecturing myself or id have been sorry for him  he told me it was his love for me that had shown him what a wretch he had been  he said he knew i didnt care for him two strawsand there i didnt contradict himand that he respected me all the more for it  i cant explain to you how he worked it out but what he meant was that i was so good myself that no one but a thoroughly good fellow could possibly have any chance with me and that any other sort of fellow ought to be ashamed of himself for daring even to be in love with me and that he couldnt rest until he had proved to himself that he was worthy to have loved me and then he wasnt going to love me any more  its a bit complicated says i  i suppose you understood it  it was perfectly plain says she somewhat shortly and as i told him made me really like him for the first time  it didnt occur to him to ask you why you had been flirting like a volcano with a chap you didnt like says i  he didnt refer to it as flirtation says she  he regarded it as kindness to a lonely man in a strange land  i think youll be all right says i  theres all the makings of a good husband in himseems to be simpleminded enough anyhow  he has a very lovable personality when you once know him says she all sailors are apt to be thoughtless  i should try and break him of it later on says i  besides she was a bit of a fool herself going away and leaving no address adds she and having reached her turning we said goodnight to one another  about a month passed after that without anything happening  for the first week marie was as merry as a kitten but as the days went by and no sign came she grew restless and excited  then one morning she came into the cafe twice as important as she had gone out the night before and i could see by her face that her little venture was panning out successfully  she waited till we had the cafe to ourselves which usually happened about midday and then she took a letter out of her pocket and showed it me  it was a nice respectful letter containing sentiments that would have done honour to a churchwarden  thanks to maries suggestions for which he could never be sufficiently grateful and which proved her to be as wise as she was good and beautiful he had traced mrs sleight nee mary godselle to quebec  from quebec on the death of her uncle she had left to take a situation as waitress in a new york hotel and he was now on his way there to continue his search  the result he would with miss maries permission write and inform her  if he obtained happiness he would owe it all to her  she it was who had shown him his duty there was a good deal of it but thats what it meant  a week later came another letter dated from new york this time  mary could not be discovered anywhere her situation she had left just two years ago but for what or for where nobody seemed to know  what was to be done  mamsel marie sat down and wrote him by return of post and wrote him somewhat sharplyin broken english  it seemed to her he must be strangely lacking in intelligence  mary as he knew spoke french as well as she did english  such girlsespecially such waitresseshe might know were sought after on the continent  very possibly there were agencies in new york whose business it was to offer good continental engagements to such young ladies  even she herself had heard of one suchbrathwaite in west twentythird street or maybe twentyfourth she signed her new name marie luthier and added a ps to the effect that a rightfeeling husband who couldnt find his wife would have written in a tone less suggestive of resignation  that helped him considerably that suggestion of maries about the agent brathwaite  a fortnight later came a third letter  wonderful to relate his wife was actually in paris of all places in the world  she had taken a situation in the hotel du louvre  master tom expected to be in paris almost as soon as his letter  i think ill go round to the louvre if you can spare me for quarter of an hour said marie and see the manager  two days after at one oclock precisely mr tom sleight walked into the cafe  he didnt look cheerful and he didnt look sad  he had been to the louvre mary godselle had left there about a year ago but he had obtained her address in paris and had received a letter from her that very morning  he showed it to marie  it was short and not well written  she would meet him in the tuileries that evening at seven by the diana and the nymph he would know her by her wearing the onyx brooch he had given her the day before their wedding  she mentioned it was onyx in case he had forgotten  he only stopped a few minutes and both he and marie spoke gravely and in low tones  he left a small case in her hands at parting he said he hoped she would wear it in remembrance of one in whose thoughts she would always remain enshrined  i cant tell you what he meant i only tell you what he said  he also gave me a very handsome walkingstick with a gold handlewhat for i dont know i take it he felt like that  marie asked to leave that evening at halfpast six  i never saw her looking prettier  she called me into the office before she went  she wanted my advice  she had in one hand a beautiful opal brooch set in diamondsit was what he had given her that morningand in her other hand the one of onyx  shall i wear them both asked she or only the one  she was half laughing half crying already  i thought for a bit  i should wear the onyx tonight i said by itself
