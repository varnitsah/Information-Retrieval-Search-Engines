xiv  how otto saw the great emperor     foreword  between the far away past history of the world and that which lies near to us in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and had passed away and our own days of light had not yet come there lay a great black gulf in human history a gulf of ignorance of superstition of cruelty and of wickedness  that time we call the dark or middle ages  few records remain to us of that dreadful period in our worlds history and we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have been handed down to us through the generations  yet though the worlds life then was so wicked and black there yet remained a few good men and women here and there mostly in peaceful and quiet monasteries far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds bloody battle who knew the right and the truth and lived according to what they knew who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the dear christ taught and lived and died for in palestine so long ago  this tale that i am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and suffered in those dark middle ages of how he saw both the good and the bad of men and of how by gentleness and love and not by strife and hatred he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to by all and should you follow the story to the end i hope you may find it a pleasure as i have done to ramble through those dark ancient castles to lie with little otto and brother john in the high belfrytower or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny old monastery garden for of all the story i love best those early peaceful years that little otto spent in the dear old white cross on the hill  poor little ottos life was a stony and a thorny pathway and it is well for all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth     i the dragons house  up from the gray rocks rising sheer and bold and bare stood the walls and towers of castle drachenhausen a great gateway with a heavy ironpointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above yawned blackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm between the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the steep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath there in the lap of the hills around stood the wretched strawthatched huts of the peasants belonging to the castlemiserable serfs who half timid half fierce tilled their poor patches of ground wrenching from the hard soil barely enough to keep body and soul together among those vile hovels played the little children like foxes about their dens their wild fierce eyes peering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair  beyond these squalid huts lay the rushing foaming river spanned by a high rude stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it and beyond the river stretched the great black forest within whose gloomy depths the savage wild beasts made their lair and where in winter time the howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and under the network of the black shadows from the naked boughs above  the watchman in the cold windy bartizan or watchtower that clung to the gray walls above the castle gateway looked from his narrow window where the wind piped and hummed across the treetops that rolled in endless billows of green over hill and over valley to the blue and distant slope of the keiserberg where on the mountain side glimmered far away the walls of castle trutzdrachen  within the massive stone walls through which the gaping gateway led three great cheerless brick buildings so forbidding that even the yellow sunlight could not light them into brightness looked down with row upon row of windows upon three sides of the bleak stone courtyard back of and above them clustered a jumble of other buildings tower and turret one highpeaked roof overtopping another  the great house in the centre was the barons hall the part to the left was called the roderhausen between the two stood a huge square pile rising dizzily up into the clear air high above the restthe great melchior tower  at the top clustered a jumble of buildings hanging high aloft in the windy space a crooked wooden belfry a tall narrow watchtower and a rude wooden house that clung partly to the roof of the great tower and partly to the walls  from the chimney of this crazy hut a thin thread of smoke would now and then rise into the air for there were folk living far up in that empty airy desert and oftentimes wild uncouth little children were seen playing on the edge of the dizzy height or sitting with their bare legs hanging down over the sheer depths as they gazed below at what was going on in the courtyard there they sat just as little children in the town might sit upon their fathers doorstep and as the sparrows might fly around the feet of the little town children so the circling flocks of rooks and daws flew around the feet of these airborn creatures  it was schwartz carl and his wife and little ones who lived far up there in the melchior tower for it overlooked the top of the hill behind the castle and so down into the valley upon the further side there day after day schwartz carl kept watch upon the gray road that ran like a ribbon through the valley from the rich town of gruenstaldt to the rich town of staffenburgen where passed merchant caravans from the one to the otherfor the lord of drachenhausen was a robber baron  dong dong the great alarm bell would suddenly ring out from the belfry high up upon the melchior tower dong dong till the rooks and daws whirled clamoring and screaming dong dong till the fierce wolfhounds in the rocky kennels behind the castle stables howled dismally in answer dong dongdong dong  then would follow a great noise and uproar and hurry in the castle courtyard below men shouting and calling to one another the ringing of armor and the clatter of horses hoofs upon the hard stone with the creaking and groaning of the windlass the ironpointed portcullis would be slowly raised and with a clank and rattle and clash of iron chains the drawbridge would fall crashing then over it would thunder horse and man clattering away down the winding stony pathway until the great forest would swallow them and they would be gone  then for a while peace would fall upon the castle courtyard the cock would crow the cook would scold a lazy maid and gretchen leaning out of a window would sing a snatch of a song just as though it were a peaceful farmhouse instead of a den of robbers  maybe it would be evening before the men would return once more perhaps one would have a bloody cloth bound about his head perhaps one would carry his arm in a sling perhaps onemaybe more than onewould be left behind never to return again and soon forgotten by all excepting some poor woman who would weep silently in the loneliness of her daily work  nearly always the adventurers would bring back with them packhorses laden with bales of goods sometimes besides these they would return with a poor soul his hands tied behind his back and his feet beneath the horses body his fur cloak and his flat cap wofully awry a while he would disappear in some gloomy cell of the dungeonkeep until an envoy would come from the town with a fat purse when his ransom would be paid the dungeon would disgorge him and he would be allowed to go upon his way again  one man always rode beside baron conrad in his expeditions and adventures a short deepchested broadshouldered man with sinewy arms so long that when he stood his hands hung nearly to his knees  his coarse closeclipped hair came so low upon his brow that only a strip of forehead showed between it and his bushy black eyebrows one eye was blind the other twinkled and gleamed like a spark under the penthouse of his brows many folk said that the oneeyed hans had drunk beer with the hillman who had given him the strength of ten for he could bend an iron spit like a hazel twig and could lift a barrel of wine from the floor to his head as easily as though it were a basket of eggs  as for the oneeyed hans he never said that he had not drunk beer with the hillman for he liked the credit that such reports gave him with the other folk and so like a half savage mastiff faithful to death to his master but to him alone he went his sullen way and lived his sullen life within the castle walls half respected half feared by the other inmates for it was dangerous trifling with the oneeyed hans     ii how the baron went forth to shear  baron conrad and baroness matilda sat together at their morning meal below their raised seats stretched the long heavy wooden table loaded with coarse foodblack bread boiled cabbage bacon eggs a great chine from a wild boar sausages such as we eat nowadays and flagons and jars of beer and wine along the board sat ranged in the order of the household the followers and retainers four or five slatternly women and girls served the others as they fed noisily at the table moving here and there behind the men with wooden or pewter dishes of food now and then laughing at the jests that passed or joining in the talk a huge fire blazed and crackled and roared in the great open fireplace before which were stretched two fierce shaggy wolfishlooking hounds outside the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves and every now and then a chill draught of wind would breathe through the open windows of the great black dininghall and set the fire roaring  along the dullgray wall of stone hung pieces of armor and swords and lances and great branching antlers of the stag overhead arched the rude heavy oaken beams blackened with age and smoke and underfoot was a chill pavement of stone  upon baron conrads shoulder leaned the pale slender yellowhaired baroness the only one in all the world with whom the fierce lord of drachenhausen softened to gentleness the only one upon whom his savage brows looked kindly and to whom his harsh voice softened with love  the baroness was talking to her husband in a low voice as he looked down into her pale face with its gentle blue eyes  and wilt thou not then said she do that one thing for me  nay he growled in his deep voice i cannot promise thee never more to attack the townspeople in the valley over yonder how else could i live an i did not take from the fat town hogs to fill our own larder  nay said the baroness thou couldst live as some others do for all do not rob the burgher folk as thou dost alas mishap will come upon thee some day and if thou shouldst be slain what then would come of me  prut said the baron thy foolish fears but he laid his rough hairy hand softly upon the baroness head and stroked her yellow hair  for my sake conrad whispered the baroness  a pause followed the baron sat looking thoughtfully down into the baroness face a moment more and he might have promised what she besought a moment more and he might have been saved all the bitter trouble that was to follow but it was not to be  suddenly a harsh sound broke the quietness of all into a confusion of noises dong dongit was the great alarmbell from melchiors tower  the baron started at the sound he sat for a moment or two with his hand clinched upon the arm of his seat as though about to rise then he sunk back into his chair again  all the others had risen tumultuously from the table and now stood looking at him awaiting his orders  for my sake conrad said the baroness again  dong dong rang the alarmbell the baron sat with his eyes bent upon the floor scowling blackly  the baroness took his hand in both of hers for my sake she pleaded and the tears filled her blue eyes as she looked up at him do not go this time  from the courtyard without came the sound of horses hoofs clashing against the stone pavement and those in the hall stood watching and wondering at this strange delay of the lord baron just then the door opened and one came pushing past the rest it was the oneeyed hans he came straight to where the baron sat and leaning over whispered something into his masters ear  for my sake implored the baroness again but the scale was turned the baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet forward he roared in a voice of thunder and a great shout went up in answer as he strode clanking down the hall and out of the open door  the baroness covered her face with her hands and wept  never mind little bird said old ursela the nurse soothingly he will come back to thee again as he has come back to thee before  but the poor young baroness continued weeping with her face buried in her hands because he had not done that thing she had asked  a white young face framed in yellow hair looked out into the courtyard from a window above but if baron conrad of drachenhausen saw it from beneath the bars of his shining helmet he made no sign  forward he cried again  down thundered the drawbridge and away they rode with clashing hoofs and ringing armor through the gray shroud of drilling rain  the day had passed and the evening had come and the baroness and her women sat beside a roaring fire all were chattering and talking and laughing but twothe fair young baroness and old ursela the one sat listening listening listening the other sat with her chin resting in the palm of her hand silently watching her young mistress the night was falling gray and chill when suddenly the clear notes of a bugle rang from without the castle walls the young baroness started and the rosy light flashed up into her pale cheeks  yes good said old ursela the red fox has come back to his den again and i warrant he brings a fat town goose in his mouth now well have fine clothes to wear and thou another gold chain to hang about thy pretty neck  the young baroness laughed merrily at the old womans speech this time said she i will choose a string of pearls like that one my aunt used to wear and which i had about my neck when conrad first saw me  minute after minute passed the baroness sat nervously playing with a bracelet of golden beads about her wrist how long he stays said she  yes said ursela but it is not cousin wish that holds him by the coat  as she spoke a door banged in the passageway without and the ring of iron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor clank clank clank  the baroness rose to her feet her face all alight the door opened then the flush of joy faded away and the face grew white white white one hand clutched the back of the bench whereon she had been sitting the other hand pressed tightly against her side  it was hans the oneeyed who stood in the doorway and black trouble sat on his brow all were looking at him waiting  conrad whispered the baroness at last where is conrad where is your master and even her lips were white as she spoke  the oneeyed hans said nothing  just then came the noise of men s voices in the corridor and the shuffle and scuffle of feet carrying a heavy load nearer and nearer they came and oneeyed hans stood aside six men came struggling through the doorway carrying a litter and on the litter lay the great baron conrad the flaming torch thrust into the iron bracket against the wall flashed up with the draught of air from the open door and the light fell upon the white face and the closed eyes and showed upon his body armor a great red stain that was not the stain of rust  suddenly ursela cried out in a sharp shrill voice catch her she falls  it was the baroness  then the old crone turned fiercely upon the oneeyed hans thou fool she cried why didst thou bring him here thou hast killed thy lady  i did not know said the oneeyed hans stupidly     iii how the baron came home shorn  but baron conrad was not dead for days he lay upon his hard bed now muttering incoherent words beneath his red beard now raving fiercely with the fever of his wound but one day he woke again to the things about him  he turned his head first to the one side and then to the other there sat schwartz carl and the oneeyed hans two or three other retainers stood by a great window that looked out into the courtyard beneath jesting and laughing together in low tones and one lay upon the heavy oaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep  where is your lady said the baron presently and why is she not with me at this time  the man that lay upon the bench started up at the sound of his voice and those at the window came hurrying to his bedside but schwartz carl and the oneeyed hans looked at one another and neither of them spoke the baron saw the look and in it read a certain meaning that brought him to his elbow though only to sink back upon his pillow again with a groan  why do you not answer me said he at last in a hollow voice then to the oneeyed hans hast no tongue fool that thou standest gaping there like a fish answer me where is thy mistress  ii do not know stammered poor hans  for a while the baron lay silently looking from one face to the other then he spoke again how long have i been lying here said he  a sennight my lord said master rudolph the steward who had come into the room and who now stood among the others at the bedside  a sennight repeated the baron in a low voice and then to master rudolph and has the baroness been often beside me in that time master rudolph hesitated answer me said the baron harshly  notnot often said master rudolph hesitatingly  the baron lay silent for a long time at last he passed his hands over his face and held them there for a minute then of a sudden before anyone knew what he was about to do he rose upon his elbow and then sat upright upon the bed the green wound broke out afresh and a dark red spot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings his face was drawn and haggard with the pain of his moving and his eyes wild and bloodshot great drops of sweat gathered and stood upon his forehead as he sat there swaying slightly from side to side  my shoes said he hoarsely  master rudolph stepped forward but my lord baron he began and then stopped short for the baron shot him such a look that his tongue stood still in his head  hans saw that look out of his one eye down he dropped upon his knees and fumbling under the bed brought forth a pair of soft leathern shoes which he slipped upon the barons feet and then laced the thongs above the instep  your shoulder said the baron he rose slowly to his feet gripping hans in the stress of his agony until the fellow winced again for a moment he stood as though gathering strength then doggedly started forth upon that quest which he had set upon himself  at the door he stopped for a moment as though overcome by his weakness and there master nicholas his cousin met him for the steward had sent one of the retainers to tell the old man what the baron was about to do  thou must go back again conrad said master nicholas thou art not fit to be abroad  the baron answered him never a word but he glared at him from out of his bloodshot eyes and ground his teeth together then he started forth again upon his way  down the long hall he went slowly and laboriously the others following silently behind him then up the steep winding stairs step by step now and then stopping to lean against the wall so he reached a long and gloomy passageway lit only by the light of a little window at the further end  he stopped at the door of one of the rooms that opened into this passageway stood for a moment then he pushed it open  no one was within but old ursela who sat crooning over a fire with a bundle upon her knees she did not see the baron or know that he was there  where is your lady said he in a hollow voice  then the old nurse looked up with a start jesu bless us cried she and crossed herself  where is your lady said the baron again in the same hoarse voice and then not waiting for an answer is she dead  the old woman looked at him for a minute blinking her watery eyes and then suddenly broke into a shrill longdrawn wail the baron needed to hear no more  as though in answer to the old womans cry a thin piping complaint came from the bundle in her lap  at the sound the red blood flashed up into the barons face what is that you have there said he pointing to the bundle upon the old womans knees  she drew back the coverings and there lay a poor weak little baby that once again raised its faint reedy pipe  it is your son said ursela that the dear baroness left behind her when the holy angels took her to paradise she blessed him and called him otto before she left us     iv the white cross on the hill  here the glassy waters of the river rhine holding upon its bosom a mimic picture of the blue sky and white clouds floating above runs smoothly around a jutting point of land st michaelsburg rising from the reedy banks of the stream sweeps up with a smooth swell until it cuts sharp and clear against the sky stubby vineyards covered its earthy breast and field and garden and orchard crowned its brow where lay the monastery of st michaelsburgthe white cross on the hill there within the white walls where the warm yellow sunlight slept all was peaceful quietness broken only now and then by the crowing of the cock or the clamorous cackle of a hen the lowing of kine or the bleating of goats a solitary voice in prayer the faint accord of distant singing or the resonant toll of the monastery bell from the highpeaked belfry that overlooked the hill and valley and the smooth farwinding stream no other sounds broke the stillness for in this peaceful haven was never heard the clash of armor the ring of ironshod hoofs or the hoarse call to arms  all men were not wicked and cruel and fierce in that dark faraway age all were not robbers and terrorspreading tyrants even in that time when mens hands were against their neighbors and war and rapine dwelt in place of peace and justice  abbot otto of st michaelsburg was a gentle patient palefaced old man his white hands were soft and smooth and no one would have thought that they could have known the harsh touch of swordhilt and lance and yet in the days of the emperor frederickthe grandson of the great redbeardno one stood higher in the prowess of arms than he but all at oncefor why no man could tella change came over him and in the flower of his youth and fame and growing power he gave up everything in life and entered the quiet sanctuary of that white monastery on the hillside so far away from the tumult and the conflict of the world in which he had lived  some said that it was because the lady he had loved had loved his brother and that when they were married otto of wolbergen had left the church with a broken heart  but such stories are old songs that have been sung before  clatter clatter jingle jingle it was a fullarmed knight that came riding up the steep hill road that wound from left to right and right to left amid the vineyards on the slopes of st michaelsburg polished helm and corselet blazed in the noon sunlight for no knight in those days dared to ride the roads except in full armor in front of him the solitary knight carried a bundle wrapped in the folds of his coarse gray cloak  it was a sorely sick man that rode up the heights of st michaelsburg his head hung upon his breast through the faintness of weariness and pain for it was the baron conrad  he had left his bed of sickness that morning had saddled his horse in the gray dawn with his own hands and had ridden away into the misty twilight of the forest without the knowledge of anyone excepting the porter who winking and blinking in the bewilderment of his broken slumber had opened the gates to the sick man hardly knowing what he was doing until he beheld his master far away clattering down the steep bridlepath  eight leagues had he ridden that day with neither a stop nor a stay but now at last the end of his journey had come and he drew rein under the shade of the great wooden gateway of st michaelsburg  he reached up to the knotted rope and gave it a pull and from within sounded the answering ring of the porters bell by and by a little wicket opened in the great wooden portals and the gentle wrinkled face of old brother benedict the porter peeped out at the strange ironclad visitor and the great black warhorse streaked and wet with the sweat of the journey flecked and dappled with flakes of foam a few words passed between them and then the little window was closed again and within the shuffling pat of the sandalled feet sounded fainter and fainter as brother benedict bore the message from baron conrad to abbot otto and the mailclad figure was left alone sitting there as silent as a statue  by and by the footsteps sounded again there came a noise of clattering chains and the rattle of the key in the lock and the rasping of the bolts dragged back then the gate swung slowly open and baron conrad rode into the shelter of the white cross and as the hoofs of his warhorse clashed upon the stones of the courtyard within the wooden gate swung slowly to behind him  abbot otto stood by the table when baron conrad entered the highvaulted room from the farther end the light from the oriel window behind the old man shed broken rays of light upon him and seemed to frame his thin gray hairs with a golden glory his white delicate hand rested upon the table beside him and upon some sheets of parchment covered with rows of ancient greek writing which he had been engaged in deciphering  clank clank clank baron conrad strode across the stone floor and then stopped short in front of the good old man  what dost thou seek here my son said the abbot  i seek sanctuary for my son and thy brothers grandson said the baron conrad and he flung back the folds of his cloak and showed the face of the sleeping babe  for a while the abbot said nothing but stood gazing dreamily at the baby after a while he looked up and the childs mother said hewhat hath she to say at this  she hath naught to say said baron conrad hoarsely and then stopped short in his speech she is dead said he at last in a husky voice and is with gods angels in paradise  the abbot looked intently in the barons face so said he under his breath and then for the first time noticed how white and drawn was the barons face art sick thyself he asked  ay said the baron i have come from deaths door but that is no matter wilt thou take this little babe into sanctuary my house is a vile rough place and not fit for such as he and his mother with the blessed saints in heaven and once more conrad of drachenhausens face began twitching with the pain of his thoughts  yes said the old man gently he shall live here and he stretched out his hands and took the babe would said he that all the little children in these dark times might be thus brought to the house of god and there learn mercy and peace instead of rapine and war  for a while he stood looking down in silence at the baby in his arms but with his mind far away upon other things at last he roused himself with a start and thou said he to the baron conradhath not thy heart been chastened and softened by this surely thou wilt not go back to thy old life of rapine and extortion  nay said baron conrad gruffly i will rob the city swine no longer for that was the last thing that my dear one asked of me  the old abbots face lit up with a smile i am right glad that thy heart was softened and that thou art willing at last to cease from war and violence  nay cried the baron roughly i said nothing of ceasing from war by heaven no i will have revenge and he clashed his iron foot upon the floor and clinched his fists and ground his teeth together listen said he and i will tell thee how my troubles happened a fortnight ago i rode out upon an expedition against a caravan of fat burghers in the valley of gruenhoffen they outnumbered us many to one but city swine such as they are not of the stuff to stand against our kind for a long time nevertheless while the menatarms who guarded the caravan were staying us with pike and crossbow from behind a tree which they had felled in front of a high bridge the others had driven the packhorses off so that by the time we had forced the bridge they were a league or more away we pushed after them as hard as we were able but when we came up with them we found that they had been joined by baron frederick of trutzdrachen to whom for three years and more the burghers of gruenstadt have been paying a tribute for his protection against others then again they made a stand and this time the baron frederick himself was with them but though the dogs fought well we were forcing them back and might have got the better of them had not my horse stumbled upon a sloping stone and so fell and rolled over upon me while i lay there with my horse upon me baron frederick ran me down with his lance and gave me that foul wound that came so near to slaying meand did slay my dear wife nevertheless my men were able to bring me out from that press and away and we had bitten the trutzdrachen dogs so deep that they were too sore to follow us and so let us go our way in peace but when those fools of mine brought me to my castle they bore me lying upon a litter to my wifes chamber there she beheld me and thinking me dead swooned a deathswoon so that she only lived long enough to bless her newborn babe and name it otto for you her fathers brother but by heavens i will have revenge root and branch upon that vile tribe the roderburgs of trutzdrachen their greatgrandsire built that castle in scorn of baron casper in the old days their grandsire slew my fathers grandsire baron nicholas slew two of our kindred and now this baron frederick gives me that foul wound and kills my dear wife through my body here the baron stopped short then of a sudden shaking his fist above his head he cried out in his hoarse voice i swear by all the saints in heaven either the red cock shall crow over the roof of trutzdrachen or else it shall crow over my house the black dog shall sit on baron fredericks shoulders or else he shall sit on mine again he stopped and fixing his blazing eyes upon the old man hearest thou that priest said he and broke into a great boisterous laugh  abbot otto sighed heavily but he tried no further to persuade the other into different thoughts  thou art wounded said he at last in a gentle voice at least stay here with us until thou art healed  nay said the baron roughly i will tarry no longer than to hear thee promise to care for my child  i promise said the abbot but lay aside thy armor and rest  nay said the baron i go back again today  at this the abbot cried out in amazement sure thou wounded man would not take that long journey without a due stay for resting think night will be upon thee before thou canst reach home again and the forests are beset with wolves  the baron laughed those are not the wolves i fear said he urge me no further i must return tonight yet if thou hast a mind to do me a kindness thou canst give me some food to eat and a flask of your golden michaelsburg beyond these i ask no further favor of any man be he priest or layman  what comfort i can give thee thou shalt have said the abbot in his patient voice and so left the room to give the needful orders bearing the babe with him     v how otto dwelt at st michaelsburg  so the poor little motherless waif lived among the old monks at the white cross on the hill thriving and growing apace until he had reached eleven or twelve years of age a slender fairhaired little fellow with a strange quiet serious manner  poor little child old brother benedict would sometimes say to the others poor little child the troubles in which he was born must have broken his wits like a glass cup what think ye he said to me today dear brother benedict said he dost thou shave the hair off of the top of thy head so that the dear god may see thy thoughts the better think of that now and the good old man shook with silent laughter  when such talk came to the good father abbots ears he smiled quietly to himself it may be said he that the wisdom of little children flies higher than our heavy wits can follow  at least otto was not slow with his studies and brother emmanuel who taught him his lessons said more than once that if his wits were cracked in other ways they were sound enough in latin  otto in a quaint simple way which belonged to him was gentle and obedient to all but there was one among the brethren of st michaelsburg whom he loved far above all the restbrother john a poor halfwitted fellow of some twentyfive or thirty years of age when a very little child he had fallen from his nurses arms and hurt his head and as he grew up into boyhood and showed that his wits had been addled by his fall his family knew not what else to do with him and so sent him off to the monastery of st michaelsburg where he lived his simple witless life upon a sort of sufferance as though he were a tame harmless animal  while otto was still a little baby he had been given into brother johns care thereafter and until otto had grown old enough to care for himself poor brother john never left his little charge night or day oftentimes the good father abbot coming into the garden where he loved to walk alone in his meditations would find the poor simple brother sitting under the shade of the peartree close to the beehives rocking the little baby in his arms singing strange crazy songs to it and gazing far away into the blue empty sky with his curious pale eyes  although as otto grew up into boyhood his lessons and his tasks separated him from brother john the bond between them seemed to grow stronger rather than weaker during the hours that otto had for his own they were scarcely ever apart down in the vineyard where the monks were gathering the grapes for the vintage in the garden or in the fields the two were always seen together either wandering hand in hand or seated in some shady nook or corner  but most of all they loved to lie up in the airy wooden belfry the great gaping bell hanging darkly above them the mouldering crossbeams glimmering far up under the dim shadows of the roof where dwelt a great brown owl that unfrightened at their familiar presence stared down at them with his round solemn eyes below them stretched the white walls of the garden beyond them the vineyard and beyond that again the far shining river that seemed to ottos mind to lead into wonderland there the two would lie upon the belfry floor by the hour talking together of the strangest things  i saw the dear angel gabriel again yester morn said brother john  so says otto seriously and where was that  it was out in the garden in the old appletree said brother john i was walking there and my wits were running around in the grass like a mouse what heard i but a wonderful sound of singing and it was like the hum of a great bee only sweeter than honey so i looked up into the tree and there i saw two sparks i thought at first that they were two stars that had fallen out of heaven but what think you they were little child  i do not know said otto breathlessly  they were angels eyes said brother john and he smiled in the strangest way as he gazed up into the blue sky so i looked at the two sparks and felt happy as one does in spring time when the cold weather is gone and the warm sun shines and the cuckoo sings again then byandby i saw the face to which the eyes belonged first it shone white and thin like the moon in the daylight but it grew brighter and brighter until it hurt ones eyes to look at it as though it had been the blessed sun itself angel gabriels hand was as white as silver and in it he held a green bough with blossoms like those that grow on the thorn bush as for his robe it was all of one piece and finer than the father abbots linen and shone beside like the sunlight on pure snow so i knew from all these things that it was the blessed angel gabriel  what do they say about this tree brother john said he to me  they say it is dying my lord angel said i and that the gardener will bring a sharp axe and cut it down  and what dost thou say about it brother john said he  i also say yes and that it is dying said i  at that he smiled until his face shone so bright that i had to shut my eyes  now i begin to believe brother john that thou art as foolish as men say said he look till i show thee and thereat i opened mine eyes again  then angel gabriel touched the dead branches with the flowery twig that he held in his hand and there was the dead wood all covered with green leaves and fair blossoms and beautiful apples as yellow as gold each smelling more sweetly than a garden of flowers and better to the taste than white bread and honey  they are souls of the apples said the good angel and they can never wither and die  then ill tell the gardener that he shall not cut the tree down said i  no no said the dear gabriel that will never do for if the tree is not cut down here on the earth it can never be planted in paradise  here brother john stopped short in his story and began singing one of his crazy songs as he gazed with his pale eyes far away into nothing at all  but tell me brother john said little otto in a hushed voice what else did the good angel say to thee  brother john stopped short in his song and began looking from right to left and up and down as though to gather his wits  so said he there was something else that he told me tschk if i could but think now yes good this is itnothing that has lived said he shall ever die and nothing that has died shall ever live  otto drew a deep breath i would that i might see the beautiful angel gabriel sometime said he but brother john was singing again and did not seem to hear what he said  next to brother john the nearest one to the little child was the good abbot otto for though he had never seen wonderful things with the eyes of his soul such as brother johns had beheld and so could not tell of them he was yet able to give little otto another pleasure that no one else could give  he was a great lover of books the old abbot and had under lock and key wonderful and beautiful volumes bound in hogskin and metal and with covers inlaid with carved ivory or studded with precious stones but within these covers beautiful as they were lay the real wonder of the books like the soul in the body for there beside the black letters and initials gay with red and blue and gold were beautiful pictures painted upon the creamy parchment saints and angels the blessed virgin with the golden oriole about her head good st joseph the three kings the simple shepherds kneeling in the fields while angels with glories about their brow called to the poor peasants from the blue sky above but most beautiful of all was the picture of the christ child lying in the manger with the mildeyed kine gazing at him  sometimes the old abbot would unlock the ironbound chest where these treasures lay hidden and carefully and lovingly brushing the few grains of dust from them would lay them upon the table beside the oriel window in front of his little namesake allowing the little boy freedom to turn the leaves as he chose  always it was one picture that little otto sought the christ child in the manger with the virgin st joseph the shepherds and the kine and as he would hang breathlessly gazing and gazing upon it the old abbot would sit watching him with a faint halfsad smile flickering around his thin lips and his pale narrow face  it was a pleasant peaceful life but byandby the end came otto was now nearly twelve years old  one bright clear day near the hour of noon little otto heard the porters bell sounding below in the courtyarddong dong brother emmanuel had been appointed as the boys instructor and just then otto was conning his lessons in the good monks cell nevertheless at the sound of the bell he pricked up his ears and listened for a visitor was a strange matter in that outoftheway place and he wondered who it could be so while his wits wandered his lessons lagged  postera phoeba lustrabat lampade terras continued brother emmanuel inexorably running his horny fingernail beneath the line humentemque aurora polo dimoverat umbram the lesson dragged along  just then a sandaled footstep sounded without in the stone corridor and a light tap fell upon brother emmanuels door it was brother ignatius and the abbot wished little otto to come to the refectory  as they crossed the courtyard otto stared to see a group of mailclad menatarms some sitting upon their horses some standing by the saddlebow yonder is the young baron he heard one of them say in a gruff voice and thereupon all turned and stared at him  a stranger was in the refectory standing beside the good old abbot while food and wine were being brought and set upon the table for his refreshment a great tall broadshouldered man beside whom the abbot looked thinner and slighter than ever  the stranger was clad all in polished and gleaming armor of plate and chain over which was drawn a loose robe of gray woollen stuff reaching to the knees and bound about the waist by a broad leathern swordbelt upon his arm he carried a great helmet which he had just removed from his head his face was weatherbeaten and rugged and on lip and chin was a wiry bristling beard once red now frosted with white  brother ignatius had bidden otto to enter and had then closed the door behind him and now as the lad walked slowly up the long room he gazed with round wondering blue eyes at the stranger  dost know who i am otto said the mailclad knight in a deep growling voice  methinks you are my father sir said otto  aye thou art right said baron conrad and i am glad to see that these milkchurning monks have not allowed thee to forget me and who thou art thyself  an it please you said otto no one churneth milk here but brother fritz we be makers of wine and not makers of butter at st michaelsburg  baron conrad broke into a great loud laugh but abbot ottos sad and thoughtful face lit up with no shadow of an answering smile  conrad said he turning to the other again let me urge thee do not take the child hence his life can never be your life for he is not fitted for it i had thought said he after a moments pause i had thought that thou hadst meant to consecrate himthis motherless oneto the care of the universal mother church  so said the baron thou hadst thought that hadst thou thou hadst thought that i had intended to deliver over this boy the last of the vuelphs to the arms of the church what then was to become of our name and the glory of our race if it was to end with him in a monastery no drachenhausen is the home of the vuelphs and there the last of the race shall live as his sires have lived before him holding to his rights by the power and the might of his right hand  the abbot turned and looked at the boy who was gaping in simple wideeyed wonderment from one to the other as they spoke  and dost thou think conrad said the old man in his gentle patient voice that that poor child can maintain his rights by the strength of his right hand  the barons look followed the abbots and he said nothing  in the few seconds of silence that followed little otto in his simple mind was wondering what all this talk portended why had his father come hither to st michaelsburg lighting up the dim silence of the monastery with the flash and ring of his polished armor why had he talked about churning butter but now when all the world knew that the monks of st michaelsburg made wine  it was baron conrads deep voice that broke the little pause of silence  if you have made a milkmaid of the boy he burst out at last i thank the dear heaven that there is yet time to undo your work and to make a man of him  the abbot sighed the child is yours conrad said he the will of the blessed saints be done mayhap if he goes to dwell at drachenhausen he may make you the better instead of you making him the worse  then light came to the darkness of little ottos wonderment he saw what all this talk meant and why his father had come hither he was to leave the happy sunny silence of the dear white cross and to go out into that great world that he had so often looked down upon from the high windy belfry on the steep hillside     vi how otto lived in the dragons house  the gates of the monastery stood wide open the world lay beyond and all was ready for departure baron conrad and his menatarms sat foot in stirrup the milkwhite horse that had been brought for otto stood waiting for him beside his fathers great charger  farewell otto said the good old abbot as he stooped and kissed the boys cheek  farewell answered otto in his simple quiet way and it brought a pang to the old mans heart that the child should seem to grieve so little at the leavetaking  farewell otto said the brethren that stood about farewell farewell  then poor brother john came forward and took the boys hand and looked up into his face as he sat upon his horse we will meet again said he with his strange vacant smile but maybe it will be in paradise and there perhaps they will let us lie in the fathers belfry and look down upon the angels in the courtyard below  aye answered otto with an answering smile  forward cried the baron in a deep voice and with a clash of hoofs and jingle of armor they were gone and the great wooden gates were shut to behind them  down the steep winding pathway they rode and out into the great wide world beyond upon which otto and brother john had gazed so often from the wooden belfry of the white cross on the hill  hast been taught to ride a horse by the priests up yonder on michaelsburg asked the baron when they had reached the level road  nay said otto we had no horse to ride but only to bring in the harvest or the grapes from the further vineyards to the vintage  prut said the baron methought the abbot would have had enough of the blood of old days in his veins to have taught thee what is fitting for a knight to know art not afeared  nay said otto with a smile i am not afeared  there at least thou showest thyself a vuelph said the grim baron but perhaps ottos thought of fear and baron conrads thought of fear were two very different matters  the afternoon had passed by the time they had reached the end of their journey up the steep stony path they rode to the drawbridge and the great gaping gateway of drachenhausen where wall and tower and battlement looked darker and more forbidding than ever in the gray twilight of the coming night little otto looked up with great wondering awestruck eyes at this grim new home of his  the next moment they clattered over the drawbridge that spanned the narrow black gulph between the roadway and the wall and the next were past the echoing arch of the great gateway and in the gray gloaming of the paved courtyard within  otto looked around upon the many faces gathered there to catch the first sight of the little baron hard rugged faces seamed and weatherbeaten very different from those of the gentle brethren among whom he had lived and it seemed strange to him that there was none there whom he should know  as he climbed the steep stony steps to the door of the barons house old ursela came running down to meet him she flung her withered arms around him and hugged him close to her my little child she cried and then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break  here is someone knoweth me thought the little boy  his new home was all very strange and wonderful to otto the armors the trophies the flags the long galleries with their ranges of rooms the great hall below with its vaulted roof and its great fireplace of grotesquely carved stone and all the strange people with their lives and thoughts so different from what he had been used to know  and it was a wonderful thing to explore all the strange places in the dark old castle places where it seemed to otto no one could have ever been before  once he wandered down a long dark passageway below the hall pushed open a narrow ironbound oaken door and found himself all at once in a strange new land the gray light coming in through a range of tall narrow windows fell upon a row of silent motionless figures carven in stone knights and ladies in strange armor and dress each lying upon his or her stony couch with clasped hands and gazing with fixed motionless stony eyeballs up into the gloomy vaulted arch above them there lay in a cold silent row all of the vuelphs who had died since the ancient castle had been built  it was the chapel into which otto had made his way now long since fallen out of use excepting as a burial place of the race  at another time he clambered up into the loft under the high peaked roof where lay numberless forgotten things covered with the dim dust of years there a flock of pigeons had made their roost and flapped noisily out into the sunlight when he pushed open the door from below here he hunted among the mouldering things of the past until oh joy of joys in an ancient oaken chest he found a great lot of wormeaten books that had belonged to some old chaplain of the castle in days gone by they were not precious and beautiful volumes such as the father abbot had showed him but all the same they had their quaint painted pictures of the blessed saints and angels  again at another time going into the courtyard otto had found the door of melchiors tower standing invitingly open for old hilda schwartz carls wife had come down below upon some business or other  then upon the shaky wooden steps otto ran without waiting for a second thought for he had often gazed at those curious buildings hanging so far up in the air and had wondered what they were like round and round and up and up otto climbed until his head spun at last he reached a landingstage and gazing over the edge and down beheld the stone pavement far far below lit by a faint glimmer of light that entered through the arched doorway otto clutched tight hold of the wooden rail he had no thought that he had climbed so far  upon the other side of the landing was a window that pierced the thick stone walls of the tower out of the window he looked and then drew suddenly back again with a gasp for it was through the outer wall he peered and down down below in the dizzy depths he saw the hard gray rocks where the black swine looking no larger than ants in the distance fed upon the refuse thrown out over the walls of the castle there lay the moving treetops like a billowy green sea and the coarse thatched roofs of the peasant cottages round which crawled the little children like tiny human specks  then otto turned and crept down the stairs frightened at the height to which he had climbed  at the doorway he met mother hilda bless us she cried starting back and crossing herself and then seeing who it was ducked him a courtesy with as pleasant a smile as her forbidding face with its little deepset eyes was able to put upon itself  old ursela seemed nearer to the boy than anyone else about the castle excepting it was his father and it was a newfound delight to otto to sit beside her and listen to her quaint stories so different from the monkish tales that he had heard and read at the monastery  but one day it was a tale of a different sort that she told him and one that opened his eyes to what he had never dreamed of before  the mellow sunlight fell through the window upon old ursela as she sat in the warmth with her distaff in her hands while otto lay close to her feet upon a bear skin silently thinking over the strange story of a brave knight and a fiery dragon that she had just told him suddenly ursela broke the silence  little one said she thou art wondrously like thy own dear mother didst ever hear how she died  nay said otto but tell me ursela how it was  tis strange said the old woman that no one should have told thee in all this time and then in her own fashion she related to him the story of how his father had set forth upon that expedition in spite of all that ottos mother had said beseeching him to abide at home how he had been foully wounded and how the poor lady had died from her fright and grief  otto listened with eyes that grew wider and wider though not all with wonder he no longer lay upon the bear skin but sat up with his hands clasped for a moment or two after the old woman had ended her story he sat staring silently at her then he cried out in a sharp voice and is this truth that you tell me ursela and did my father seek to rob the towns people of their goods  old ursela laughed aye said she that he did and many times ah me those days are all gone now and she fetched a deep sigh then we lived in plenty and had both silks and linens and velvets besides in the store closets and were able to buy good wines and live in plenty upon the best now we dress in frieze and live upon what we can get and sometimes that is little enough with nothing better than sour beer to drink but there is one comfort in it all and that is that our good baron paid back the score he owed the trutzdrachen people not only for that but for all that they had done from the very first  thereupon she went on to tell otto how baron conrad had fulfilled the pledge of revenge that he had made abbot otto how he had watched day after day until one time he had caught the trutzdrachen folk with baron frederick at their head in a narrow defile back of the kaiserburg of the fierce fight that was there fought of how the roderburgs at last fled leaving baron frederick behind them wounded of how he had kneeled before the baron conrad asking for mercy and of how baron conrad had answered aye thou shalt have such mercy as thou deservest and had therewith raised his great twohanded sword and laid his kneeling enemy dead at one blow  poor little otto had never dreamed that such cruelty and wickedness could be he listened to the old womans story with gaping horror and when the last came and she told him with a smack of her lips how his father had killed his enemy with his own hand he gave a gasping cry and sprang to his feet just then the door at the other end of the chamber was noisily opened and baron conrad himself strode into the room otto turned his head and seeing who it was gave another cry loud and quavering and ran to his father and caught him by the hand  oh father he cried oh father is it true that thou hast killed a man with thy own hand  aye said the baron grimly it is true enough and i think me i have killed many more than one but what of that otto thou must get out of those foolish notions that the old monks have taught thee here in the world it is different from what it is at st michaelsburg here a man must either slay or be slain  but poor little otto with his face hidden in his fathers robe cried as though his heart would break oh father he said again and again it cannot beit cannot be that thou who art so kind to me should have killed a man with thine own hands then i wish that i were back in the monastery again i am afraid out here in the great wide world perhaps somebody may kill me for i am only a weak little boy and could not save my own life if they chose to take it from me  baron conrad looked down upon otto all this while drawing his bushy eyebrows together once he reached out his hand as though to stroke the boys hair but drew it back again  turning angrily upon the old woman ursela said he thou must tell the child no more such stories as these he knowest not at all of such things as yet keep thy tongue busy with the old womans tales that he loves to hear thee tell and leave it with me to teach him what becometh a true knight and a vuelph  that night the father and son sat together beside the roaring fire in the great ball tell me otto said the baron dost thou hate me for having done what ursela told thee today that i did  otto looked for a while into his fathers face i know not said he at last in his quaint quiet voice but methinks that i do not hate thee for it  the baron drew his bushy brows together until his eyes twinkled out of the depths beneath them then of a sudden he broke into a great loud laugh smiting his horny palm with a smack upon his thigh     vii the red cock crows on drachenhausen  there was a new emperor in germany who had come from a far away swiss castle count rudolph of hapsburg a good honest man with a good honest homely face but bringing with him a stern sense of justice and of right and a determination to put down the lawlessness of the savage german barons among whom he had come as emperor  one day two strangers came galloping up the winding path to the gates of the dragons house a horn sounded thin and clear a parley was held across the chasm in the road between the two strangers and the porter who appeared at the little wicket then a messenger was sent running to the baron who presently came striding across the open courtyard to the gateway to parley with the strangers  the two bore with them a folded parchment with a great red seal hanging from it like a clot of blood it was a message from the emperor demanding that the baron should come to the imperial court to answer certain charges that had been brought against him and to give his bond to maintain the peace of the empire  one by one those barons who had been carrying on their private wars or had been despoiling the burgher folk in their traffic from town to town and against whom complaint had been lodged were summoned to the imperial court where they were compelled to promise peace and to swear allegiance to the new order of things all those who came willingly were allowed to return home again after giving security for maintaining the peace all those who came not willingly were either brought in chains or rooted out of their strongholds with fire and sword and their roofs burned over their heads  now it was baron conrads turn to be summoned to the imperial court for complaint had been lodged against him by his old enemy of trutzdrachenbaron henrythe nephew of the old baron frederick who had been slain while kneeling in the dust of the road back of the kaiserburg  no one at drachenhausen could read but master rudolph the steward who was sand blind and little otto so the boy read the summons to his father while the grim baron sat silent with his chin resting upon his clenched fist and his eyebrows drawn together into a thoughtful frown as he gazed into the pale face of his son who sat by the rude oaken table with the great parchment spread out before him  should he answer the summons or scorn it as he would have done under the old emperors baron conrad knew not which to do pride said one thing and policy another the emperor was a man with an iron hand and baron conrad knew what had happened to those who had refused to obey the imperial commands so at last he decided that he would go to the court taking with him a suitable escort to support his dignity  it was with nearly a hundred armed men clattering behind him that baron conrad rode away to court to answer the imperial summons the castle was stripped of its fighting men and only eight remained behind to guard the great stone fortress and the little simplewitted boy  it was a sad mistake  three days had passed since the baron had left the castle and now the third night had come the moon was hanging midway in the sky white and full for it was barely past midnight  the high precipitous banks of the rocky road threw a dense black shadow into the gully below and in that crooked inky line that scarred the white face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping slowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to castle drachenhausen at the head of them was a tall slender knight clad in light chain armor his head covered only by a steel cap or bascinet  along the shadow they crept with only now and then a faint clink or jingle of armor to break the stillness for most of those who followed the armed knight were clad in leathern jerkins only one or two wearing even so much as a steel breastplate by way of armor  so at last they reached the chasm that yawned beneath the roadway and there they stopped for they had reached the spot toward which they had been journeying it was baron henry of trutzdrachen who had thus come in the silence of the night time to the dragons house and his visit boded no good to those within  the baron and two or three of his men talked together in low tones now and then looking up at the sheer wall that towered above them  yonder is the place lord baron said one of those who stood with him i have scanned every foot of the wall at night for a week past an we get not in by that way we get not in at all a keen eye a true aim and a bold man are all that we need and the business is done here again all looked upward at the gray wall above them rising up in the silent night air  high aloft hung the wooden bartizan or watchtower clinging to the face of the outer wall and looming black against the pale sky above three great beams pierced the wall and upon them the wooden tower rested the middle beam jutted out beyond the rest to the distance of five or six feet and the end of it was carved into the rude semblance of a dragons head  so good said the baron at last then let us see if thy plan holds and if hans schmidts aim is true enough to earn the three marks that i have promised him where is the bag  one of those who stood near handed the baron a leathern pouch the baron opened it and drew out a ball of fine thread another of twine a coil of stout rope and a great bundle that looked until it was unrolled like a coarse fishnet it was a rope ladder while these were being made ready hans schmidt a thickset lowbrowed broadshouldered archer strung his stout bow and carefully choosing three arrows from those in his quiver he stuck them point downward in the earth unwinding the ball of thread he laid it loosely in large loops upon the ground so that it might run easily without hitching then he tied the end of the thread tightly around one of his arrows he fitted the arrow to the bow and drew the feather to his ear twang rang the bowstring and the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the watchtower the very first shaft did the work  good said hans schmidt the archer in his heavy voice the three marks are mine lord baron  the arrow had fallen over and across the jutting beam between the carved dragons head and the bartizan carrying with it the thread which now hung from above glimmering white in the moonlight like a cobweb  the rest was an easy task enough first the twine was drawn up to and over the beam by the thread then the rope was drawn up by the twine and last of all the rope ladder by the rope there it hung like a thin slender black line against the silent gray walls  and now said the baron who will go first and win fifty marks for his own and climb the rope ladder to the tower yonder those around hesitated is there none brave enough to venture said the baron after a pause of silence  a stout young fellow of about eighteen years of age stepped forward and flung his flat leathern cap upon the ground i will go my lord baron said he  good said the baron the fifty marks are thine and now listen if thou findest no one in the watchtower whistle thus if the watchman be at his post see that thou makest all safe before thou givest the signal when all is ready the others will follow thee and now go and good luck go with thee  the young fellow spat upon his hands and seizing the ropes began slowly and carefully to mount the flimsy shaking ladder those below held it as tight as they were able but nevertheless he swung backward and forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward once he stopped upon the way and those below saw him clutch the ladder close to him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began again up up up like some great black spider presently he came out from the black shadow below and into the white moonlight and then his shadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way at last he reached the jutting beam and there again he stopped for a moment clutching tightly to it the next he was upon the beam dragging himself toward the window of the bartizan just above slowly raising himself upon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within those watching him from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side and then place something between his teeth it was his dagger reaching up he clutched the window sill above him and with a silent spring seated himself upon it the next moment he disappeared within a few seconds of silence followed then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness there was another pause of silence then a faint shrill whistle sounded from above  who will go next said the baron it was hans schmidt who stepped forward another followed the arch up the ladder and another and another last of all went the baron henry himself and nothing was left but the rope ladder hanging from above and swaying back and forth in the wind  that night schwartz carl had been bousing it over a pot of yellow wine in the pantry with his old crony master rudolph the steward and the two chatting and gossiping together had passed the time away until long after the rest of the castle had been wrapped in sleep then perhaps a little unsteady upon his feet schwartz carl betook himself homeward to the melchior tower  he stood for a while in the shadow of the doorway gazing up into the pale sky above him at the great bright round moon that hung like a bubble above the sharp peaks of the roofs standing black as ink against the sky but all of a sudden he started up from the post against which he had been leaning and with head bent to one side stood listening breathlessly for he too had heard that smothered cry from the watchtower so he stood intently motionlessly listening listening but all was silent except for the monotonous dripping of water in one of the nooks of the courtyard and the distant murmur of the river borne upon the breath of the night air mayhap i was mistaken muttered schwartz carl to himself  but the next moment the silence was broken again by a faint shrill whistle what did it mean  back of the heavy oaken door of the tower was schwartz carls crossbow the portable windlass with which the bowstring was drawn back and a pouch of bolts schwartz carl reached back into the darkness fumbling in the gloom until his fingers met the weapon setting his foot in the iron stirrup at the end of the stock he wound the stout bowstring into the notch of the trigger and carefully fitted the heavy murderouslooking bolt into the groove  minute after minute passed and schwartz carl holding his arbelast in his hand stood silently waiting and watching in the sharpcut black shadow of the doorway motionless as a stone statue minute after minute passed suddenly there was a movement in the shadow of the arch of the great gateway across the courtyard and the next moment a leathernclad figure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement and stood there listening his head bent to one side schwartz carl knew very well that it was no one belonging to the castle and from the nature of his action that he was upon no good errand  he did not stop to challenge the suspicious stranger the taking of anothers life was thought too small a matter for much thought or care in those days schwartz carl would have shot a man for a much smaller reason than the suspicious actions of this fellow the leatherclad figure stood a fine target in the moonlight for a crossbow bolt schwartz carl slowly raised the weapon to his shoulder and took a long and steady aim just then the stranger put his fingers to his lips and gave a low shrill whistle it was the last whistle that he was to give upon this earth there was a sharp jarring twang of the bowstring the hiss of the flying bolt and the dull thud as it struck its mark the man gave a shrill quavering cry and went staggering back and then fell all of a heap against the wall behind him as though in answer to the cry half a dozen men rushed tumultuously out from the shadow of the gateway whence the stranger had just come and then stood in the courtyard looking uncertainly this way and that not knowing from what quarter the stroke had come that had laid their comrade low  but schwartz carl did not give them time to discover that there was no chance to string his cumbersome weapon again down he flung it upon the ground to arms he roared in a voice of thunder and then clapped to the door of melchiors tower and shot the great iron bolts with a clang and rattle  the next instant the trutzdrachen men were thundering at the door but schwartz carl was already far up the winding steps  but now the others came pouring out from the gateway to the house roared baron henry  then suddenly a clashing clanging uproar crashed out upon the night dong dong it was the great alarm bell from melchiors towerschwartz carl was at his post  little baron otto lay sleeping upon the great rough bed in his room dreaming of the white cross on the hill and of brother john by and by he heard the convent bell ringing and knew that there must be visitors at the gate for loud voices sounded through his dream presently he knew that he was coming awake but though the sunny monastery garden grew dimmer and dimmer to his sleeping sight the clanging of the bell and the sound of shouts grew louder and louder then he opened his eyes flaming red lights from torches carried hither and thither by people in the courtyard outside flashed and ran along the wall of his room hoarse shouts and cries filled the air and suddenly the shrill piercing shriek of a woman rang from wall to wall and through the noises the great bell from far above upon melchiors tower clashed and clanged its harsh resonant alarm  otto sprang from his bed and looked out of the window and down upon the courtyard below dear god what dreadful thing hath happened he cried and clasped his hands together  a cloud of smoke was pouring out from the windows of the building across the courtyard whence a dull ruddy glow flashed and flickered strange men were running here and there with flaming torches and the now continuous shrieking of women pierced the air  just beneath the window lay the figure of a man half naked and face downward upon the stones then suddenly otto cried out in fear and horror for as he looked with dazed and bewildered eyes down into the lurid courtyard beneath a savage man in a shining breastplate and steel cap came dragging the dark silent figure of a woman across the stones but whether she was dead or in a swoon otto could not tell  and every moment the pulsing of that dull red glare from the windows of the building across the courtyard shone more brightly and the glare from other flaming buildings which otto could not see from his window turned the black starry night into a lurid day  just then the door of the room was burst open and in rushed poor old ursela crazy with her terror she flung herself down upon the floor and caught otto around the knees save me she cried save me as though the poor pale child could be of any help to her at such a time in the passageway without shone the light of torches and the sound of loud footsteps came nearer and nearer  and still through all the din sounded continually the clash and clang and clamor of the great alarm bell  the red light flashed into the room and in the doorway stood a tall thin figure clad from head to foot in glittering chain armor from behind this fierce knight with his dark narrow cruel face its deepset eyes glistening in the light of the torches crowded six or eight savage lowbrowed brutal men who stared into the room and at the whitefaced boy as he stood by the window with the old woman clinging to his knees and praying to him for help  we have cracked the nut and here is the kernel said one of them who stood behind the rest and thereupon a roar of brutal laughter went up but the cruel face of the armed knight never relaxed into a smile he strode into the room and laid his iron hand heavily upon the boys shoulder art thou the young baron otto said he in a harsh voice  aye said the lad but do not kill me  the knight did not answer him fetch the cord hither said he and drag the old witch away  it took two of them to loosen poor old urselas crazy clutch from about her young master then amid roars of laughter they dragged her away screaming and scratching and striking with her fists  they drew back ottos arms behind his back and wrapped them round and round with a bowstring then they pushed and hustled and thrust him forth from the room and along the passageway now bright with the flames that roared and crackled without down the steep stairway they drove him where thrice he stumbled and fell amid roars of laughter at last they were out into the open air of the courtyard here was a terrible sight but otto saw nothing of it his blue eyes were gazing far away and his lips moved softly with the prayer that the good monks of st michaelsburg had taught him for he thought that they meant to slay him  all around the courtyard the flames roared and snapped and crackled four or five figures lay scattered here and there silent in all the glare and uproar the heat was so intense that they were soon forced back into the shelter of the great gateway where the women captives under the guard of three or four of the trutzdrachen men were crowded together in dumb bewildered terror only one man was to be seen among the captives poor old half blind master rudolph the steward who crouched tremblingly among the women they had set the blaze to melchiors tower and now below it was a seething furnace above the smoke rolled in black clouds from the windows but still the alarm bell sounded through all the blaze and smoke higher and higher the flames rose a trickle of fire ran along the frame buildings hanging aloft in the air a clear flame burst out at the peak of the roof but still the bell rang forth its clamorous clangor presently those who watched below saw the cluster of buildings bend and sink and sway there was a crash and roar a cloud of sparks flew up as though to the very heavens themselves and the bell of melchiors tower was stilled forever a great shout arose from the watching upturned faces  forward cried baron henry and out from the gateway they swept and across the drawbridge leaving drachenhausen behind them a flaming furnace blazing against the gray of the early dawning     viii in the house of the dragon scorner  tall narrow gloomy room no furniture but a rude bench a bare stone floor cold stone walls and a gloomy ceiling of arched stone over head a long narrow slit of a window high above in the wall through the iron bars of which otto could see a small patch of blue sky and now and then a darting swallow for an instant seen the next instant gone such was the little barons prison in trutzdrachen fastened to a bolt and hanging against the walls hung a pair of heavy chains with gaping fetters at the ends they were thick with rust and the red stain of the rust streaked the wall below where they hung like a smear of blood little otto shuddered as he looked at them can those be meant for me he thought  nothing was to be seen but that one patch of blue sky far up in the wall no sound from without was to be heard in that gloomy cell of stone for the window pierced the outer wall and the earth and its noises lay far below  suddenly a door crashed without and the footsteps of men were heard coming along the corridor they stopped in front of ottos cell he heard the jingle of keys and then a loud rattle of one thrust into the lock of the heavy oaken door the rusty bolt was shot back with a screech the door opened and there stood baron henry no longer in his armor but clad in a long black robe that reached nearly to his feet a broad leather belt was girdled about his waist and from it dangled a short heavy hunting sword  another man was with the baron a heavyfaced fellow clad in a leathern jerkin over which was drawn a short coat of linked mail  the two stood for a moment looking into the room and otto his pale face glimmering in the gloom sat upon the edge of the heavy wooden bench or bed looking back at them out of his great blue eyes then the two entered and closed the door behind them  dost thou know why thou art here said the baron in his deep harsh voice  nay said otto i know not  so said the baron then i will tell thee three years ago the good baron frederick my uncle kneeled in the dust and besought mercy at thy fathers hands the mercy he received was the coward blow that slew him thou knowest the story  aye said otto tremblingly i know it  then dost thou not know why i am here said the baron  nay dear lord baron i know not said poor little otto and began to weep  the baron stood for a moment or two looking gloomily upon him as the little boy sat there with the tears running down his white face  i will tell thee said he at last i swore an oath that the red cock should crow on drachenhausen and i have given it to the dames i swore an oath that no vuelph that ever left my hands should be able to strike such a blow as thy father gave to baron frederick and now i will fulfil that too catch the boy casper and hold him  as the man in the mail shirt stepped toward little otto the boy leaped up from where he sat and caught the baron about the knees oh dear lord baron he cried do not harm me i am only a little child i have never done harm to thee do not harm me  take him away said the baron harshly  the fellow stooped and loosening ottos hold in spite of his struggles and cries carried him to the bench against which he held him whilst the baron stood above him  baron henry and the other came forth from the cell carefully closing the wooden door behind them at the end of the corridor the baron turned let the leech be sent to the boy said he and then he turned and walked away  otto lay upon the hard couch in his cell covered with a shaggy bear skin his face was paler and thinner than ever and dark rings encircled his blue eyes he was looking toward the door for there was a noise of someone fumbling with the lock without  since that dreadful day when baron henry had come to his cell only two souls had visited otto one was the fellow who had come with the baron that time his name otto found was casper he brought the boy his rude meals of bread and meat and water the other visitor was the leech or doctor a thin weasand little man with a kindly wrinkled face and a gossiping tongue who besides binding wounds bleeding and leeching and administering his simple remedies to those who were taken sick in the castle acted as the barons barber  the baron had left the key in the lock of the door so that these two might enter when they chose but otto knew that it was neither the one nor the other whom he now heard at the door working uncertainly with the key striving to turn it in the rusty cumbersome lock at last the bolts grated back there was a pause and then the door opened a little way and otto thought that he could see someone peeping in from without by and by the door opened further there was another pause and then a slender elfishlooking little girl with straight black hair and shining black eyes crept noiselessly into the room  she stood close by the door with her finger in her mouth staring at the boy where he lay upon his couch and otto upon his part lay full of wonder gazing back upon the little elfin creature  she seeing that he made no sign or motion stepped a little nearer and then after a moments pause a little nearer still until at last she stood within a few feet of where he lay  art thou the baron otto said she  yes answered otto  prut said she and is that so why i thought that thou wert a great tall fellow at least and here thou art a little boy no older than carl max the gooseherd then after a little pausemy name is pauline and my father is the baron i heard him tell my mother all about thee and so i wanted to come here and see thee myself art thou sick  yes said otto i am sick  and did my father hurt thee  aye said otto and his eyes filled with tears until one sparkling drop trickled slowly down his white face  little pauline stood looking seriously at him for a while i am sorry for thee otto said she at last and then at her childish pity he began crying in earnest  this was only the first visit of many from the little maid for after that she often came to ottos prison who began to look for her coming from day to day as the one bright spot in the darkness and the gloom  sitting upon the edge of his bed and gazing into his face with wide open eyes she would listen to him by the hour as he told her of his life in that far away monastery home of poor simple brother johns wonderful visions of the good abbots books with their beautiful pictures and of all the monkish tales and stories of knights and dragons and heroes and emperors of ancient rome which brother emmanuel had taught him to read in the crabbed monkish latin in which they were written  one day the little maid sat for a long while silent after he had ended speaking at last she drew a deep breath and are all these things that thou tellest me about the priests in their castle really true said she  yes said otto all are true  and do they never go out to fight other priests  no said otto they know nothing of fighting  so said she and then fell silent in the thought of the wonder of it all and that there should be men in the world that knew nothing of violence and bloodshed for in all the eight years of her life she had scarcely been outside of the walls of castle trutzdrachen  at another time it was of ottos mother that they were speaking  and didst thou never see her otto said the little girl  aye said otto i see her sometimes in my dreams and her face always shines so bright that i know she is an angel for brother john has often seen the dear angels and he tells me that their faces always shine in that way i saw her the night thy father hurt me so for i could not sleep and my head felt as though it would break asunder then she came and leaned over me and kissed my forehead and after that i fell asleep  but where did she come from otto said the little girl  from paradise i think said otto with that patient seriousness that he had caught from the monks and that sat so quaintly upon him  so said little pauline and then after a pause that is why thy mother kissed thee when thy head achedbecause she is an angel when i was sick my mother bade gretchen carry me to a far part of the house because i cried and so troubled her did thy mother ever strike thee otto  nay said otto  mine hath often struck me said pauline  one day little pauline came bustling into ottos cell her head full of the news which she carried my father says that thy father is out in the woods somewhere yonder back of the castle for fritz the swineherd told my father that last night he had seen a fire in the woods and that he had crept up to it without anyone knowing there he had seen the baron conrad and six of his men and that they were eating one of the swine that they had killed and roasted maybe said she seating herself upon the edge of ottos couch maybe my father will kill thy father and they will bring him here and let him lie upon a black bed with bright candles burning around him as they did my uncle frederick when he was killed  god forbid said otto and then lay for a while with his hands clasped dost thou love me pauline said he after a while  yes said pauline for thou art a good child though my father says that thy wits are cracked  mayhap they are said otto simply for i have often been told so before but thou wouldst not see me die pauline wouldst thou  nay said pauline i would not see thee die for then thou couldst tell me no more stories for they told me that uncle frederick could not speak because he was dead  then listen pauline said otto if i go not away from here i shall surely die every day i grow more sick and the leech cannot cure me here he broke down and turning his face upon the couch began crying while little pauline sat looking seriously at him  why dost thou cry otto said she after a while  because said he i am so sick and i want my father to come and take me away from here  but why dost thou want to go away said pauline if thy father takes thee away thou canst not tell me any more stories  yes i can said otto for when i grow to be a man i will come again and marry thee and when thou art my wife i can tell thee all the stories that i know dear pauline canst thou not tell my father where i am that he may come here and take me away before i die  mayhap i could do so said pauline after a little while for sometimes i go with casper max to see his mother who nursed me when i was a baby she is the wife of fritz the swineherd and she will make him tell thy father for she will do whatever i ask of her and fritz will do whatever she bids him do  and for my sake wilt thou tell him pauline said otto  but see otto said the little girl if i tell him wilt thou promise to come indeed and marry me when thou art grown a man  yes said otto very seriously i will promise  then i will tell thy father where thou art said she  but thou wilt do it without the baron henry knowing wilt thou not pauline  yes said she for if my father and my mother knew that i did such a thing they would strike me mayhap send me to my bed alone in the dark     ix how oneeyed hans came to trutzdrachen  fritz the swineherd sat eating his late supper of porridge out of a great coarse wooden bowl wife katherine sat at the other end of the table and the halfnaked little children played upon the earthen floor a shaggy dog lay curled up in front of the fire and a grunting pig scratched against a leg of the rude table close beside where the woman sat  yes yes said katherine speaking of the matter of which they had already been talking it is all very true that the drachenhausens are a bad lot and i for one am of no mind to say no to that all the same it is a sad thing that a simplewitted little child like the young baron should be so treated as the boy has been and now that our lord baron has served him so that he at least will never be able to do us harm i for one say that he should not be left there to die alone in that black cell  fritz the swineherd gave a grunt at this without raising his eyes from the bowl  yes good said katherine i know what thou meanest fritz and that it is none of my business to be thrusting my finger into the barons dish but to hear the way that dear little child spoke when she was here this mornit would have moved a heart of stone to hear her tell of all his pretty talk thou wilt try to let the redbeard know that that poor boy his son is sick to death in the black cell wilt thou not fritz  the swineherd dropped his wooden spoon into the bowl with a clatter potstausand he cried art thou gone out of thy head to let thy wits run upon such things as this of which thou talkest to me if it should come to our lord barons ears he would cut the tongue from out thy head and my head from off my shoulders for it dost thou think i am going to meddle in such a matter as this listen these proud baron folk with their masterful ways drive our sort hither and thither they beat us they drive us they kill us as they choose our lives are not as much to them as one of my black swine why should i trouble my head if they choose to lop and trim one another the fewer there are of them the better for us say i we poor folk have a hard enough life of it without thrusting our heads into the noose to help them out of their troubles what thinkest thou would happen to us if baron henry should hear of our betraying his affairs to the redbeard  nay said katherine thou hast naught to do in the matter but to tell the redbeard in what part of the castle the little baron lies  and what good would that do said fritz the swineherd  i know not said katherine but i have promised the little one that thou wouldst find the baron conrad and tell him that much  thou hast promised a mares egg said her husband angrily how shall i find the baron conrad to bear a message to him when our baron has been looking for him in vain for two days past  thou has found him once and thou mayst find him again said katherine for it is not likely that he will keep far away from here whilst his boy is in such sore need of help  i will have nothing to do with it said fritz and he got up from the wooden block whereon he was sitting and stumped out of the house but then katherine had heard him talk in that way before and knew in spite of his saying no that sooner or later he would do as she wished  two days later a very stout little oneeyed man clad in a leathern jerkin and wearing a round leathern cap upon his head came toiling up the path to the postern door of trutzdrachen his back bowed under the burthen of a great peddlers pack it was our old friend the oneeyed hans though even his brother would hardly have known him in his present guise for besides having turned peddler he had grown of a sudden surprisingly fat  raptaptap he knocked at the door with a knotted end of the crooked thorned staff upon which he leaned he waited for a while and then knocked againraptaptap  presently with a click a little square wicket that pierced the door was opened and a womans face peered out through the iron bars  the oneeyed hans whipped off his leathern cap  good day pretty one said he and hast thou any need of glass beads ribbons combs or trinkets here i am come all the way from gruenstadt with a pack full of such gay things as thou never laid eyes on before here be rings and bracelets and necklaces that might be of pure silver and set with diamonds and rubies for anything that thy dear one could tell if he saw thee decked in them and all are so cheap that thou hast only to say i want them and they are thine  the frightened face at the window looked from right to left and from left to right hush said the girl and laid her finger upon her lips there thou hadst best get away from here poor soul as fast as thy legs can carry thee for if the lord baron should find thee here talking secretly at the postern door he would loose the wolfhounds upon thee  prut said oneeyed hans with a grin the baron is too big a fly to see such a little gnat as i but wolfhounds or no wolfhounds i can never go hence without showing thee the pretty things that i have brought from the town even though my stay be at the danger of my own hide  he flung the pack from off his shoulders as he spoke and fell to unstrapping it while the round face of the lass her eyes big with curiosity peered down at him through the grated iron bars  hans held up a necklace of blue and white beads that glistened like jewels in the sun and from them hung a gorgeous filigree cross didst thou ever see a sweeter thing than this said he and look here is a comb that even the silversmith would swear was pure silver all the way through then in a soft wheedling voice canst thou not let me in my little bird sure there are other lasses besides thyself who would like to trade with a poor peddler who has travelled all the way from gruenstadt just to please the pretty ones of trutzdrachen  nay said the lass in a frightened voice i cannot let thee in i know not what the baron would do to me even now if he knew that i was here talking to a stranger at the postern and she made as if she would clap to the little window in his face but the oneeyed hans thrust his staff betwixt the bars and so kept the shutter open  nay nay said he eagerly do not go away from me too soon look dear one seest thou this necklace  aye said she looking hungrily at it  then listen if thou wilt but let me into the castle so that i may strike a trade i will give it to thee for thine own without thy paying a barley corn for it  the girl looked and hesitated and then looked again the temptation was too great there was a noise of softly drawn bolts and bars the door was hesitatingly opened a little way and in a twinkling the oneeyed hans had slipped inside the castle pack and all  the necklace said the girl in a frightened whisper  hans thrust it into her hand its thine said he and now wilt thou not help me to a trade  i will tell my sister that thou art here said she and away she ran from the little stone hallway carefully bolting and locking the further door behind her  the door that the girl had locked was the only one that connected the postern hail with the castle  the oneeyed hans stood looking after her thou fool he muttered to himself to lock the door behind thee what shall i do next i should like to know here am i just as badly off as i was when i stood outside the walls thou hussy if thou hadst but let me into the castle for only two little minutes i would have found somewhere to have hidden myself while thy back was turned but what shall i do now he rested his pack upon the floor and stood looking about him  built in the stone wall opposite to him was a high narrow fireplace without carving of any sort as hans one eye wandered around the bare stone space his glance fell at last upon it and there it rested for a while he stood looking intently at it presently he began rubbing his hand over his bristling chin in a thoughtful meditative manner finally he drew a deep breath and giving himself a shake as though to arouse himself from his thoughts and after listening a moment or two to make sure that no one was nigh he walked softly to the fireplace and stooping peered up the chimney above him yawned a black cavernous depth inky with the soot of years hans straightened himself and tilting his leathern cap to one side began scratching his bullethead at last he drew a long breath yes good he muttered to himself he who jumps into the river must een swim the best he can it is a vile dirty place to thrust ones self but i am in for it now and must make the best of a lame horse  he settled the cap more firmly upon his head spat upon his hands and once more stooping in the fireplace gave a leap and up the chimney he went with a rattle of loose mortar and a black trickle of soot  by and by footsteps sounded outside the door there was a pause a hurried whispering of womens voices the twitter of a nervous laugh and then the door was pushed softly opens and the girl to whom the oneeyed hans had given the necklace of blue and white beads with the filigree cross hanging from it peeped uncertainly into the room behind her broad heavy face were three others equally homely and stolid for a while all four stood there looking blankly into the room and around it nothing was there but the peddlers knapsack lying in the middle of the floorthe man was gone the light of expectancy slowly faded out of the girls face and in its place succeeded first bewilderment and then dull alarm but dear heaven she said where then has the peddler man gone  a moment or two of silence followed her speech perhaps said one of the others in a voice hushed with awe perhaps it was the evil one himself to whom thou didst open the door  again there was a hushed and breathless pause it was the lass who had let hans in at the postern who next spoke  yes said she in a voice trembling with fright at what she had done yes it must have been the evil one for now i remember he had but one eye the four girls crossed themselves and their eyes grew big and round with the fright  suddenly a shower of mortar came rattling down the chimney ach cried the four as with one voice bang the door was clapped to and away they scurried like a flock of frightened rabbits  when jacob the watchman came that way an hour later upon his evening round of the castle he found a peddlers knapsack lying in the middle of the floor he turned it over with his pikestaff and saw that it was full of beads and trinkets and ribbons  how came this here said he and then without waiting for the answer which he did not expect he flung it over his shoulder and marched away with it     x how hans brought terror to the kitchen  hans found himself in a pretty pickle in the chimney for the soot got into his one eye and set it to watering and into his nose and set him to sneezing and into his mouth and his ears and his hair but still he struggled on up and up for every chimney has a top said hans to himself and i am sure to climb out somewhere or other suddenly he came to a place where another chimney joined the one he was climbing and here he stopped to consider the matter at his leisure see now he muttered if i still go upward i may come out at the top of some tall chimneystack with no way of getting down outside now below here there must be a fireplace somewhere for a chimney does not start from nothing at all yes good we will go down a while and see what we make of that  it was a crooked zigzag road that he had to travel and rough and hard into the bargain his one eye tingled and smarted and his knees and elbows were rubbed to the quick nevertheless oneeyed hans had been in worse trouble than this in his life  down he went and down he went further than he had climbed upward before sure i must be near some place or other he thought  as though in instant answer to his thoughts he heard the sudden sound of a voice so close beneath him that he stopped short in his downward climbing and stood as still as a mouse with his heart in his mouth a few inches more and he would have been discoveredwhat would have happened then would have been no hard matter to foretell  hans braced his back against one side of the chimney his feet against the other and then leaning forward looked down between his knees the gray light of the coming evening glimmered in a wide stone fireplace just below him within the fireplace two people were moving about upon the broad hearth a great fat woman and a shockheaded boy the woman held a spit with two newly trussed fowls upon it so that oneeyed hans knew that she must be the cook  thou ugly toad said the woman to the boy did i not bid thee make a fire an hour ago and now here there is not so much as a spark to roast the fowls withall and they to be basted for the lord barons supper where hast thou been for all this time  no matter said the boy sullenly as he laid the fagots ready for the lighting no matter i was not running after long jacob the bowman to try to catch him for a sweetheart as thou hast been doing  the reply was instant and ready the cook raised her hand smack she struck and a roar from the scullion followed  yes good thought hans as he looked down upon them i am glad that the boys ear was not on my head  now give me no more of thy talk said the woman but do the work that thou hast been bidden thenhow came all this black soot here i should like to know  how should i know snuffled the scullion mayhap thou wouldst blame that on me also  that is my doing whispered hans to himself but if they light the fire what then becomes of me  see now said the cook i go to make the cakes ready if i come back and find that thou hast not built the fire i will warm thy other ear for thee  so thought hans then will be my time to come down the chimney for there will be but one of them  the next moment he heard the door close and knew that the cook had gone to make the cakes ready as she said and as he looked down he saw that the boy was bending over the bundle of fagots blowing the spark that he had brought in upon the punk into a flame the dry fagots began to crackle and blaze now is my time said hans to himself bracing his elbows against each side of the chimney he straightened his legs so that he might fall clear his motions loosened little shower of soot that fell rattling upon the fagots that were now beginning to blaze brightly whereupon the boy raised his face and looked up hans loosened his hold upon the chimney crash he fell lighting upon his feet in the midst of the burning fagots the scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor where he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as dough and eyes and mouth agape staring speechlessly at the frightful inkyblack figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke then his scattered wits came back to him it is the evil one he roared and thereupon turning upon his side he half rolled half scrambled to the door then out he leaped and banging it to behind him flew down the passageway yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind him  all the time oneeyed hans was brushing away the sparks that clung to his clothes he was as black as ink from head to foot with the soot from the chimney  so far all is good he muttered to himself but if i go wandering about in my sooty shoes i will leave black tracks to follow me so there is nothing to do but een to go barefoot  he stooped and drawing the pointed soft leather shoes from his feet he threw them upon the now blazing fagots where they writhed and twisted and wrinkled and at last burst into a flame meanwhile hans lost no time he must find a hidingplace and quickly if he would yet hope to escape a great bread trough stood in the corner of the kitchena hoppershaped chest with a flat lid it was the best hiding place that the room afforded without further thought hans ran to it snatching up from the table as he passed a loaf of black bread and a bottle half full of stale wine for he had had nothing to eat since that morning into the great bread trough he climbed and drawing the lid down upon him curled himself up as snugly as a mouse in its nest  for a while the kitchen lay in silence but at last the sound of voices was heard at the door whispering together in low tones suddenly the door was flung open and a tall lean lanternjawed fellow clad in rough frieze strode into the room and stood there glaring with half frightened boldness around about him three or four women and the trembling scullion crowded together in a frightened group behind him  the man was long jacob the bowman but after all his boldness was all wasted for not a thread or a hair was to be seen but only the crackling fire throwing its cheerful ruddy glow upon the wall of the room now rapidly darkening in the falling gray of the twilight without  the fat cooks fright began rapidly to turn into anger  thou imp she cried it is one of thy tricks and she made a dive for the scullion who ducked around the skirts of one of the other women and so escaped for the time but long jacob wrinkled up his nose and sniffed nay said he me thinks that there lieth some truth in the tale that the boy hath told for here is a vile smell of burned horn that the black one bath left behind him  it was the smell from the soft leather shoes that hans had burned  the silence of night had fallen over the castle of trutzdrachen not a sound was heard but the squeaking of mice scurring behind the wainscoting the dull dripping of moisture from the eaves or the sighing of the night wind around the gables and through the naked windows of the castle  the lid of the great dough trough was softly raised and a face black with soot peeped cautiously out from under it then little by little arose a figure as black as the face and oneeyed hans stepped out upon the floor stretching and rubbing himself  methinks i must have slept he muttered hui i am as stiff as a new leather doublet and now what next is to become of me i hope my luck may yet stick to me in spite of this foul black soot  along the middle of the front of the great hall of the castle ran a long stone gallery opening at one end upon the courtyard by a high flight of stone steps a manatarms in breastplate and steel cap and bearing a long pike paced up and down the length of this gallery now and then stopping leaning over the edge and gazing up into the starry sky above then with a long drawn yawn lazily turning back to the monotonous watch again  a dark figure crept out from an arched doorway at the lower part of the long straight building and some little distance below the end gallery but the sentry saw nothing of it for his back was turned as silently and as stealthily as a cat the figure crawled along by the dark shadowy wall now and then stopping and then again creeping slowly forward toward the gallery where the manatarms moved monotonously up and down it was oneeyed hans in his bare feet  inch by inch foot by footthe black figure crawled along in the angle of the wall inch by inch and foot by foot but ever nearer and nearer to the long straight row of stone steps that led to the covered gallery at last it crouched at the lowest step of the flight just then the sentinel upon watch came to the very end of the gallery and stood there leaning upon his spear had he looked down below he could not have failed to have seen oneeyed hans lying there motionlessly but he was gazing far away over the steep black roofs beyond and never saw the unsuspected presence minute after minute passed and the one stood there looking out into the night and the other lay crouching by the wall then with a weary sigh the sentry turned and began slowly pacing back again toward the farther end of the gallery  instantly the motionless figure below arose and glided noiselessly and swiftly up the flight of steps  two rude stone pillars flanked either side of the end of the gallery like a shadow the black figure slipped behind one of these flattening itself up against the wall where it stood straight and motionless as the shadows around it  down the long gallery came the watchman his sword clinking loudly in the silence as he walked tramp tramp tramp clink clank jingle  within three feet of the motionless figure behind the pillar he turned and began retracing his monotonous steps instantly the other left the shadow of the post and crept rapidly and stealthily after him one step two steps the sentinel took for a moment the black figure behind him seemed to crouch and draw together then like a flash it leaped forward upon its victim  a shadowy cloth fell upon the mans face and in an instant he was flung back and down with a muffled crash upon the stones then followed a fierce and silent struggle in the darkness but strong and sturdy as the man was he was no match for the almost superhuman strength of oneeyed hans the cloth which he had flung over his head was tied tightly and securely then the man was forced upon his face and in spite of his fierce struggles his arms were bound around and around with strong fine cord next his feet were bound in the same way and the task was done then hans stood upon his feet and wiped the sweat from his swarthy forehead listen brother he whispered and as he spoke he stooped and pressed something cold and hard against the neck of the other dost thou know the feel of this it is a broad dagger and if thou dost contrive to loose that gag from thy mouth and makest any outcry it shall be sheathed in thy weasand  so saying he thrust the knife back again into its sheath then stooping and picking up the other he flung him across his shoulder like a sack and running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at all he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a little while before there having first stripped his prisoner of all his weapons hans sat the man up in the angle of the wall so brother said he now we can talk with more ease than we could up yonder i will tell thee frankly why i am here it is to find where the young baron otto of drachenhausen is kept if thou canst tell me well and good if not i must een cut thy weasand and find me one who knoweth more now canst thou tell me what i would learn brother  the other nodded dimly in the darkness  that is good said hans then i will loose thy gag until thou hast told me only bear in mind what i said concerning my dagger  thereupon he unbound his prisoner and the fellow slowly rose to his feet he shook himself and looked all about him in a heavy bewildered fashion as though he had just awakened from a dream  his right hand slid furtively down to his side but the daggersheath was empty  come brother said hans impatiently time is passing and once lost can never be found again show me the way to the young baron otto or and he whetted the shining blade of his dagger on his horny palm  the fellow needed no further bidding turning he led the way and together they were swallowed up in the yawning shadows and again the hush of nighttime lay upon the castle of trutzdrachen     xi how otto was saved  little otto was lying upon the hard couch in his cell tossing in restless and feverish sleep suddenly a heavy hand was laid upon him and a voice whispered in his ear baron baron otto waken rouse yourself i am come to help you i am oneeyed hans  otto was awake in an instant and raised himself upon his elbow in the darkness oneeyed hans he breathed oneeyed hans who is oneeyed hans  true said the other thou dost not know me i am thy fathers trusted servant and am the only one excepting his own blood and kin who has clung to him in this hour of trouble yes all are gone but me alone and so i have come to help thee away from this vile place  oh dear good hans if only thou canst cried otto if only thou canst take me away from this wicked place alas dear hans i am weary and sick to death and poor little otto began to weep silently in the darkness  aye aye said hans gruffly it is no place for a little child to be canst thou climb my little master canst thou climb a knotted rope  nay said otto i can never climb again see hans and he flung back the covers from off him  i cannot see said hans it is too dark  then feel dear hans said otto  hans bent over the poor little white figure glimmering palely in the darkness suddenly he drew back with a snarl like an angry wolf oh the black bloody wretches he cried hoarsely and have they done that to thee a little child  yes said otto the baron henry did it and then again he began to cry  there there said hans roughly weep no more thou shalt get away from here even if thou canst not climb i myself will help thee thy father is already waiting below the window here and thou shalt soon be with him there there cry no more  while he was speaking hans had stripped off his peddlers leathern jacket and there around his body was wrapped coil after coil of stout hempen rope tied in knots at short distances he began unwinding the rope and when he had done he was as thin as ever he had been before next he drew from the pouch that hung at his side a ball of fine cord and a leaden weight pierced by a hole both of which he had brought with him for the use to which he now put them he tied the lead to the end of the cord then whirling the weight above his head he flung it up toward the window high above twice the piece of lead fell back again into the room the third time it flew out between the iron bars carrying the cord with it hans held the ball in his hand and paid out the string as the weight carried it downward toward the ground beneath suddenly the cord stopped running hans jerked it and shook it but it moved no farther pray heaven little child said he that it hath reached the ground for if it hath not we are certainly lost  i do pray said otto and he bowed his head  then as though in answer to his prayer there came a twitch upon the cord  see said hans they have heard thee up above in heaven it was thy father who did that quickly and deftly he tied the cord to the end of the knotted rope then he gave an answering jerk upon the string the next moment the rope was drawn up to the window and down the outside by those below otto lay watching the rope as it crawled up to the window and out into the night like a great snake while oneeyed hans held the other end lest it should be drawn too far at last it stopped good muttered hans as though to himself the rope is long enough  he waited for a few minutes and then drawing upon the rope and finding that it was held from below he spat upon his hands and began slowly climbing up to the window above winding his arm around the iron bars of the grating that guarded it he thrust his hand into the pouch that hung by his side and drawing forth a file fell to work cutting through all that now lay between otto and liberty  it was slow slow work and it seemed to otto as though hans would never finish his task as lying upon his hard couch he watched that figure black against the sky bending over its work now and then the file screeched against the hard iron and then hans would cease for a moment but only to begin again as industriously as ever three or four times he tried the effects of his work but still the iron held at last he set his shoulder against it and as otto looked he saw the iron bend suddenly there was a sharp crack and a piece of the grating went flying out into the night  hans tied the rope securely about the stump of the stout iron bar that yet remained and then slid down again into the room below  my little lord said he dost thou think that if i carry thee thou wilt be able and strong enough to cling to my neck  aye said otto methinks i will be able to do that  then come said hans  he stooped as he spoke and gently lifting otto from his rude and rugged bed he drew his broad leathern belt around them both buckling it firmly and securely it does not hurt thee said he  not much whispered otto faintly  then hans spat upon his hands and began slowly climbing the rope  they reached the edge of the window and there they rested for a moment and otto renewed his hold around the neck of the faithful hans  and now art thou ready said hans  aye said otto  then courage said hans and he turned and swung his leg over the abyss below  the next moment they were hanging in midair  otto looked down and gave a gasp the mother of heaven bless us he whispered and then closed his eyes faint and dizzy at the sight of that sheer depth beneath hans said nothing but shutting his teeth and wrapping his legs around the rope he began slowly descending hand under hand down down down he went until to otto with his eyes shut and his head leaning upon hans shoulder it seemed as though it could never end down down down suddenly he felt hans draw a deep breath there was a slight jar and otto opened his eyes hans was standing upon the ground  a figure wrapped in a dark cloak arose from the shadow of the wall and took otto in its arms it was baron conrad  my sonmy little child he cried in a choked trembling voice and that was all and otto pressed his cheek against his fathers and began crying  suddenly the baron gave a sharp fierce cry dear heaven he cried what have they done to thee but poor little otto could not answer  oh gasped the baron in a strangled voice my little child my little child and therewith he broke down and his whole body shook with fierce dry sobs for men in those days did not seek to hide their grief as they do now but were fierce and strong in the expression of that as of all else  never mind dear father whispered otto it did not hurt me so very much and he pressed his lips against his fathers cheek  little otto had but one hand     xii a ride for life  but not yet was otto safe and all danger past and gone by suddenly as they stood there the harsh clangor of a bell broke the silence of the starry night above their heads and as they raised their faces and looked up they saw lights flashing from window to window presently came the sound of a hoarse voice shouting something that from the distance they could not understand  oneeyed hans smote his hand upon his thigh look said he here is what comes of having a soft heart in ones bosom i overcame and bound a watchman up yonder and forced him to tell me where our young baron lay it was on my mind to run my knife into him after he had told me every thing but then bethinking how the young baron hated the thought of bloodshed i said to myself no hans i will spare the villains life see now what comes of being merciful here by hook or by crook the fellow has loosed himself from his bonds and brings the whole castle about our ears like a nest of wasps  we must fly said the baron for nothing else in the world is left me now that all have deserted me in this black time of trouble excepting these six faithful ones  his voice was bitter bitter as he spoke then stooping he raised otto in his arms and bearing him gently began rapidly descending the rocky slope to the level road that ran along the edge of the hill beneath close behind him followed the rest hans still grimed with soot and in his bare feet a little distance from the road and under the shade of the forest trees seven horses stood waiting the baron mounted upon his great black charger seating little otto upon the saddle in front of him forward he cried and away they clattered and out upon the road thento st michaelsburg said baron conrad in his deep voice and the horses heads were turned to the westward and away they galloped through the black shadows of the forest leaving trutzdrachen behind them  but still the sound of the alarm bell rang through the beating of the horses hoofs and as hans looked over his shoulder he saw the light of torches flashing hither and thither along the outer walls in front of the great barbican  in castle trutzdrachen all was confusion and uproar flashing torches lit up the dull gray walls horses neighed and stamped and men shouted and called to one another in the bustle of making ready presently baron henry came striding along the corridor clad in light armor which he had hastily donned when roused from his sleep by the news that his prisoner had escaped below in the courtyard his horse was standing and without waiting for assistance he swung himself into the saddle then away they all rode and down the steep path armor ringing swords clanking and ironshod hoofs striking sparks of fire from the hard stones at their head rode baron henry his triangular shield hung over his shoulder and in his hand he bore a long heavy steelpointed lance with a pennant flickering darkly from the end  at the highroad at the base of the slope they paused for they were at a loss to know which direction the fugitives had taken a half a score of the retainers leaped from their horses and began hurrying about hither and thither and up and down like hounds searching for the lost scent and all the time baron henry sat still as a rock in the midst of the confusion  suddenly a shout was raised from the forest just beyond the road they had come upon the place where the horses had been tied it was an easy matter to trace the way that baron conrad and his followers had taken thence back to the highroad but there again they were at a loss the road ran straight as an arrow eastward and westwardhad the fugitives taken their way to the east or to the west  baron henry called his headman nicholas stein to him and the two spoke together for a while in an undertone at last the barons lieutenant reined his horse back and choosing first one and then another divided the company into two parties the baron placed himself at the head of one band and nicholas stein at the head of the other forward he cried and away clattered the two companies of horsemen in opposite directions  it was toward the westward that baron henry of trutzdrachen rode at the head of his men  the early springtide sun shot its rays of misty yellow light across the rolling tops of the forest trees where the little birds were singing in the glory of the may morning but baron henry and his followers thought nothing of the beauty of the peaceful day and heard nothing of the multitudinous sound of the singing birds as with a confused sound of galloping hoofs they swept along the highway leaving behind them a slowcurling lowtrailing cloud of dust  as the sun rose more full and warm the misty wreaths began to dissolve until at last they parted and rolled asunder like a white curtain and there before the pursuing horsemen lay the crest of the mountain toward which they were riding and up which the road wound steeply  yonder they are cried a sudden voice behind baron henry of trutzdrachen and at the cry all looked upward  far away upon the mountainside curled a cloud of dust from the midst of which came the starlike flash of burnished armor gleaming in the sun  baron henry said never a word but his lips curled in a grim smile  and as the mist wreaths parted oneeyed hans looked behind and down into the leafy valley beneath yonder they come said he they have followed sharply to gain so much upon us even though our horses are wearied with all the travelling we have done hither and yon these five days past how far is it lord baron from here to michaelsburg  about ten leagues said the baron in a gloomy voice  hans puckered his mouth as though to whistle but the baron saw nothing of it for he was gazing straight before him with a set and stony face those who followed him looked at one another and the same thought was in the mind of eachhow long would it be before those who pursued would close the distance between them  when that happened it meant death to one and all  they reached the crest of the hill and down they dashed upon the other side for there the road was smooth and level as it sloped away into the valley but it was in dead silence that they rode now and then those who followed the baron looked back over their shoulders they had gained a mile upon their pursuers when the helmeted heads rose above the crest of the mountain but what was the gain of a mile with a smooth road between them and fresh horses to weary ones  on they rode and on they rode the sun rose higher and higher and hotter and hotter there was no time to rest and water their panting horses only once when they crossed a shallow stretch of water the poor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool stream and the oneeyed hans washed a part of the soot from his hands and face on and on they rode never once did the baron conrad move his head or alter that steadfast look as gazing straight before him he rode steadily forward along the endless stretch of road with poor little ottos yellow head and white face resting against his steelclad shoulderand st michaelsburg still eight leagues away  a little rise of ground lay before them and as they climbed it all excepting the baron turned their heads as with one accord and looked behind them then more than one heart failed for through the leaves of the trees below they caught the glint of armor of those who followednot more than a mile away the next moment they swept over the crest and there below them lay the broad shining river and nearer a tributary stream spanned by a rude narrow threearched stone bridge where the road crossed the deep slowmoving water  down the slope plodded the weary horses and so to the bridgehead  halt cried the baron suddenly and drew rein  the others stood bewildered what did he mean to do he turned to hans and his blue eyes shone like steel  hans said he in his deep voice thou hast served me long and truly wilt thou for this one last time do my bidding  aye said hans briefly  swear it said the baron  i swear it said hans and he drew the sign of the cross upon his heart  that is good said the baron grimly then take thou this child and with the others ride with all the speed that thou canst to st michaelsburg give the child into the charge of the abbot otto tell him how that i have sworn fealty to the emperor and what i have gained therebymy castle burnt my people slain and this poor simple child my only son mutilated by my enemy  and thou my lord baron said hans  i will stay here said the baron quietly and keep back those who follow as long as god will give me grace so to do  a murmur of remonstrance rose among the faithful few who were with him two of whom were near of kin but conrad of drachenhausen turned fiercely upon them  how now said he have i fallen so low in my troubles that even ye dare to raise your voices against me by the good heaven i will begin my work here by slaying the first man who dares to raise word against my bidding then he turned from them here hans said he take the boy and remember knave what thou hast sworn  he pressed otto close to his breast in one last embrace my little child he murmured try not to hate thy father when thou thinkest of him hereafter even though he be hard and bloody as thou knowest  but with his suffering and weakness little otto knew nothing of what was passing it was only as in a faint flickering dream that he lived in what was done around him  farewell otto said the baron but ottos lips only moved faintly in answer his father kissed him upon either cheek come hans said he hastily take him hence and he loosed ottos arms from about his neck  hans took otto upon the saddle in front of him  oh my dear lord baron said he and then stopped with a gulp and turned his grotesquely twitching face aside  go said the baron harshly there is no time to lose in womans tears  farewell conrad farewell conrad said his two kinsmen and coming forward they kissed him upon the cheek then they turned and rode away after hans and baron conrad was left alone to face his mortal foe     xiii how baron conrad held the bridge  as the last of his followers swept around the curving road and was lost to sight baron conrad gave himself a shake as though to drive away the thoughts that lay upon him then he rode slowly forward to the middle of the bridge where he wheeled his horse so as to face his coming enemies he lowered the vizor of his helmet and bolted it to its place and then saw that sword and dagger were loose in the scabbard and easy to draw when the need for drawing should arise   down the steep path from the hill above swept the pursuing horsemen down the steep path to the bridgehead and there drew rein for in the middle of the narrow way sat the motionless steelclad figure upon the great warhorse with wide red panting nostrils and body streaked with sweat and flecked with patches of foam  one side of the roadway of the bridge was guarded by a low stone wall the other side was naked and open and bare to the deep slowmoving water beneath it was a dangerous place to attack a desperate man clad in armor of proof  forward cried baron henry but not a soul stirred in answer and still the ironclad figure sat motionless and erect upon the panting horse  how cried the baron henry are ye afraid of one man then follow me and he spurred forward to the bridgehead but still no one moved in answer and the lord of trutzdrachen reined back his horse again he wheeled his horse and glared round upon the stolid faces of his followers until his eyes seemed fairly to blaze with passion beneath the bars of his vizor  baron conrad gave a roar of laughter how now he cried are ye all afraid of one man is there none among ye that dares come forward and meet me i know thee baron henry thou art not afraid to cut off the hand of a little child hast thou not now the courage to face the father  baron henry gnashed his teeth with rage as he glared around upon the faces of his menatarms suddenly his eye lit upon one of them ha carl spigler he cried thou hast thy crossbow with theeshoot me down yonder dog nay he said thou canst do him no harm under his armor shoot the horse upon which he sits  baron conrad heard the speech oh thou coward villain he cried stay do not shoot the good horse i will dismount and fight ye upon foot thereupon armed as he was he leaped clashing from his horse and turning the animals head gave it a slap upon the flank the good horse first trotted and then walked to the further end of the bridge where it stopped and began cropping at the grass that grew beside the road  now then cried baron henry fiercely now then ye cannot fear him villains down with him forward  slowly the troopers spurred their horses forward upon the bridge and toward that one figure that grasping tightly the great twohanded sword stood there alone guarding the passage  then baron conrad whirled the great blade above his head until it caught the sunlight and flashed again he did not wait for the attack but when the first of the advancing horsemen had come within a few feet of him he leaped with a shout upon them the fellow thrust at him with his lance and the baron went staggering a few feet back but instantly he recovered himself and again leaped forward the great sword flashed in the air whistling it fell and the nearest man dropped his lance clattering and with a loud inarticulate cry grasped the mane of his horse with both hands again the blade whistled in the air and this time it was stained with red again it fell and with another shrill cry the man toppled headlong beneath the horses feet the next instant they were upon him each striving to strike at the one figure to ride him down or to thrust him down with their lances there was no room now to swing the long blade but holding the hilt in both hands baron conrad thrust with it as though it were a lance stabbing at horse or man it mattered not crowded upon the narrow roadway of the bridge those who attacked had not only to guard themselves against the dreadful strokes of that terrible sword but to keep their wounded horses rearing and mad with fright from toppling bodily over with them into the water beneath  presently the cry was raised back back and those nearest the baron began reining in their horses forward roared baron henry from the midst of the crowd but in spite of his command and even the blows that he gave those behind were borne back by those in front struggling and shouting and the bridge was cleared again excepting for three figures that lay motionless upon the roadway and that one who with the brightness of his armor dimmed and stained leaned panting against the wall of the bridge  the baron henry raged like a madman gnashing his teeth together he rode back a little way then turning and couching his lance he suddenly clapped spurs to his horse and the next instant came thundering down upon his solitary enemy  baron conrad whirled his sword in the air as he saw the other coming like a thunderbolt upon him he leaped aside and the lance passed close to him as it passed he struck and the iron point flew from the shaft of the spear at the blow and fell clattering upon the stone roadway of the bridge  baron henry drew in his horse until it rested upon its haunches then slowly reined it backward down the bridge still facing his foe and still holding the wooden stump of the lance in his hand at the bridgehead he flung it from him  another lance he cried hoarsely one was silently reached to him and he took it his hand trembling with rage again he rode to a little distance and wheeled his horse then driving his steel spurs into its quivering side he came again thundering down upon the other once more the terrible sword whirled in the air and fell but this time the lance was snatched to one side and the blow fell harmlessly the next instant and with a twitch of the bridlerein the horse struck full and fair against the man  conrad of drachenhausen was whirled backward and downward and the cruel iron hoofs crashed over his prostrate body as horse and man passed with a rush beyond him and to the bridgehead beyond a shout went up from those who stood watching the next moment the prostrate figure rose and staggered blindly to the side of the bridge and stood leaning against the stone wall  at the further end of the bridge baron henry had wheeled his horse once again he couched lance and again he drove down upon his bruised and wounded enemy this time the lance struck full and fair and those who watched saw the steel point pierce the iron breastplate and then snap short leaving the barbed point within the wound  baron conrad sunk to his knees and the roderburg looming upon his horse above him unsheathed his sword to finish the work he had begun  then those who stood looking on saw a wondrous thing happen the wounded man rose suddenly to his feet and before his enemy could strike he leaped with a great and bitter cry of agony and despair upon him as he sat in the saddle above  henry of trutzdrachen grasped at his horses mane but the attack was so fierce so sudden and so unexpected that before he could save himself he was dragged to one side and fell crashing in his armor upon the stone roadway of the bridge  the dragon the dragon roared baron conrad in a voice of thunder and with the energy of despair he dragged his prostrate foe toward the open side of the bridge  forward cried the chief of the trutzdrachen men and down they rode upon the struggling knights to the rescue of their master in this new danger but they were too late  there was a pause at the edge of the bridge for baron henry had gained his feet and stunned and bewildered as he was by the suddenness of his fall he was now struggling fiercely desperately for a moment they stood swaying backward and forward clasped in one anothers arms the blood from the wounded mans breast staining the armor of both the moment passed and then with a shower of stones and mortar from beneath their ironshod heels they toppled and fell there was a thunderous splash in the water below and as the menatarms came hurrying up and peered with awestruck faces over the parapet of the bridge they saw the whirling eddies sweep down with the current of the stream a few bubbles rise to the surface of the water and thennothing for the smooth river flowed onward as silently as ever  presently a loud voice burst through the awed hush that followed it came from william of roderburg baron henrys kinsman  forward he cried a murmur of voices from the others was all the answer that he received forward cried the young man again the boy and those with him are not so far away but that we might yet catch up with them  then one of the men spoke up in answera man with a seamed weatherbeaten face and crisp grizzled hair nay said he our lord baron is gone and this is no quarrel of ours here be four of us that are wounded and three i misdoubt that are dead why should we follow further only to suffer more blows for no gain a growl of assent rose from those that stood around and william of roderburg saw that nothing more was to be done by the trutzdragons that day     xiv how otto saw the great emperor  through weakness and sickness and faintness otto had lain in a half swoon through all that long journey under the hot may sun it was as in a dreadful nightmare that he had heard on and on and on that monotonous throbbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground had felt that last kiss that his father had given him upon his cheek then the onward ride again until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more when next he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his nostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow he opened his eyes and then closed them again thinking he must have been in a dream for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the white cross on the hill the good father abbot sat near by gazing upon his face with the old absent student look brother john sat in the deep window seat also gazing at him and brother theodore the leech of the monastery sat beside him bathing his head beside these old familiar faces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight the oneeyed hans old master nicholas his kinsman and the others so he closed his eyes thinking that maybe it was all a dream but the sharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he was still awake  am i then really home in st michaelsburg again he murmured without unclosing his eyes  brother theodore began snuffling through his nose there was a pause yes said the old abbot at last and his gentle voice trembled as he spoke yes my dear little child thou art back again in thine own home thou hast not been long out in the great world but truly thou hast had a sharp and bitter trial of it  but they will not take me away again will they said otto quickly unclosing his blue eyes  nay said the abbot gently not until thou art healed in body and art ready and willing to go  three months and more had passed and otto was well again and now escorted by oneeyed hans and those faithful few who had clung to the baron conrad through his last few bitter days he was riding into the quaint old town of nurnburg for the emperor rudolph was there at that time waiting for king ottocar of bohemia to come thither and answer the imperial summons before the council and otto was travelling to the court  as they rode in through the gates of the town otto looked up at the highpeaked houses with their overhanging gables the like of which he had never seen before and he stared with his round blue eyes at seeing them so crowded together along the length of the street but most of all he wondered at the number of people that passed hither and thither jostling each other in their hurry and at the tradesmens booths opening upon the street with the wonderful wares hanging within armor at the smiths glittering ornaments at the goldsmiths and rich fabrics of silks and satins at the mercers he had never seen anything so rich and grand in all of his life for little otto had never been in a town before  oh look he cried at that wonderful lady see holy father sure the emperors wife can be no finer than that lady  the abbot smiled nay otto said he that is but a burghers wife or daughter the ladies at the emperors court are far grander than such as she  so said otto and then fell silent with wonder  and now at last the great moment had come when little otto with his own eyes was to behold the mighty emperor who ruled over all the powerful kingdoms of germany and austria and italy and bohemia and other kingdoms and principalities and states his heart beat so that he could hardly speak as for a moment the good abbot who held him by the hand stopped outside of the arrased doorway to whisper some last instructions into his ear then they entered the apartment  it was a long stonepaved room the floor was covered with rich rugs and the walls were hung with woven tapestry wherein were depicted knights and ladies in leafy gardens and kings and warriors at battle a long row of high glazed windows extended along the length of the apartment flooding it with the mellow light of the autumn day at the further end of the room far away and standing by a great carved chimney place wherein smouldered the remains of a fire stood a group of nobles in gorgeous dress of velvet and silks and with glittering golden chains hung about their necks  one figure stood alone in front of the great yawning fireplace his hands were clasped behind him and his look bent thoughtfully upon the floor he was dressed only in a simple gray robe without ornament or adornment a plain leathern belt girded his waist and from it hung a sword with a bone hilt encased in a brown leathern scabbard a noble staghound lay close behind him curled up upon the floor basking in the grateful warmth of the fire  as the father abbot and otto drew near he raised his head and looked at them it was a plain homely face that otto saw with a wrinkled forehead and a long mouth drawn down at the corners it was the face of a good honest burgher burdened with the cares of a prosperous trade who can he be thought otto and why does the poor man stand there among all the great nobles  but the abbot walked straight up to him and kneeled upon the floor and little otto full of wonder did the same it was the great emperor rudolph  who have we here said the emperor and he bent his brow upon the abbot and the boy  sire said abbot otto we have humbly besought you by petition in the name of your late vassal baron conrad of vuelph of drachenhausen for justice to this his son the baron otto whom sire as you may see hath been cruelly mutilated at the hands of baron henry of roderburg of trutzdrachen he hath moreover been despoiled of his lands his castle burnt and his household made prisoner  the emperor frowned until the shaggy eyebrows nearly hid the keen gray twinkle of the eyes beneath yes said he i do remember me of that petition and have given it consideration both in private and in council he turned to the group of listening nobles look said he at this little child marred by the inhumanity and the cruelty of those robber villains by heavens i will put down their lawless rapine if i have to give every castle from the north to the south to the flames and to the sword then turning to otto again poor little child said he thy wrongs shall be righted and so far as they are able those cruel roderburgs shall pay thee penny for penny and grain for grain for what thou hast lost and until such indemnity hath been paid the family of the man who wrought this deed shall be held as surety  little otto looked up in the kind rugged face above him nay lord emperor said he in his quaint quiet way there are but two in the familythe mother and the daughterand i have promised to marry the little girl when she and i are old enough so if you please i would not have harm happen to her  the emperor continued to look down at the kneeling boy and at last he gave a short dry laugh so be it said he thy plan is not without its wisdom mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be ended thus peacefully the estates of the roderburgs shall be held in trust for thee until thou art come of age otherwise it shall be as thou hast proposed the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own care and as to theeart thou willing that i should take thee under my own charge in the room of thy father who is dead  aye said otto simply i am willing for it seems to me that thou art a good man  the nobles who stood near smiled at the boys speech as for the emperor he laughed outright i give thee thanks my lord baron said he there is no one in all my court who has paid me greater courtesy than that  so comes the end of our tale  but perhaps you may like to know what happened afterward for no one cares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it  eight years had passed and otto grew up to manhood in the emperors court and was with him through war and peace  but he himself never drew sword or struck a blow for the right hand that hung at his side was of pure silver and the hard cold fingers never closed folks called him otto of the silver hand but perhaps there was another reason than that for the name that had been given him for the pure simple wisdom that the old monks of the white cross on the hill had taught him clung to him through all the honors that the emperor bestowed upon his favorite and as he grew older his words were listened to and weighed by those who were high in council and even by the emperor himself  and now for the end of all  one day otto stood uncertainly at the doorway of a room in the imperial castle hesitating before he entered and yet there was nothing so very dreadful within only one poor girl whose heart fluttered more than his poor little pauline whom he had not seen since that last day in the black cell at trutzdrachen  at last he pushed aside the hangings and entered the room  she was sitting upon a rude bench beside the window looking at him out of her great dark eyes  he stopped short and stood for a moment confused and silent for he had no thought in his mind but of the little girl whom he had last seen and for a moment he stood confused before the fair maiden with her great beautiful dark eyes  she on her part beheld a tall slender youth with curling golden hair one hand white and delicate the other of pure and shining silver  he came to her and took her hand and set it to his lips and all that she could do was to gaze with her great dark eyes upon the hero of whom she had heard so many talk the favorite of the emperor the wise young otto of the silver hand     afterword  the ruins of drachenhausen were rebuilt for the walls were as sound as ever though empty and gaping to the sky but it was no longer the den of a robber baron for beneath the scutcheon over the great gate was carved a new motto of the vuelphs a motto which the emperor rudolph himself had given  manus argentea quam manus ferrea melior est
