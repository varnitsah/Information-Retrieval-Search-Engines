6897396	illustration                   piper in the woods                         by                  philip k dick           earth maintained an important garrison on  asteroid y3 now suddenly it was imperiled with  a biological impossibilitymen becoming plants   well corporal westerburg doctor henry harris said gently just why do you think youre a plant  as he spoke harris glanced down again at the card on his desk it was from the base commander himself made out in coxs heavy scrawl doc this is the lad i told you about talk to him and try to find out how he got this delusion hes from the new garrison the new checkstation on asteroid y3 and we dont want anything to go wrong there especially a silly damn thing like this  harris pushed the card aside and stared back up at the youth across the desk from him the young man seemed ill at ease and appeared to be avoiding answering the question harris had put to him harris frowned westerburg was a goodlooking chap actually handsome in his patrol uniform a shock of blond hair over one eye he was tall almost six feet a fine healthy lad just two years out of training according to the card born in detroit had measles when he was nine interested in jet engines tennis and girls twentysix years old  well corporal westerburg doctor harris said again why do you think youre a plant  the corporal looked up shyly he cleared his throat sir i am a plant i dont just think so ive been a plant for several days now  i see the doctor nodded you mean that you werent always a plant  no sir i just became a plant recently  and what were you before you became a plant  well sir i was just like the rest of you  there was silence doctor harris took up his pen and scratched a few lines but nothing of importance came a plant and such a healthylooking lad harris removed his steelrimmed glasses and polished them with his handkerchief he put them on again and leaned back in his chair care for a cigarette corporal  no sir  the doctor lit one himself resting his arm on the edge of the chair corporal you must realize that there are very few men who become plants especially on such short notice i have to admit you are the first person who has ever told me such a thing  yes sir i realize its quite rare  you can understand why im interested then when you say youre a plant you mean youre not capable of mobility or do you mean youre a vegetable as opposed to an animal or just what  the corporal looked away i cant tell you any more he murmured im sorry sir  well would you mind telling me how you became a plant  corporal westerburg hesitated he stared down at the floor then out the window at the spaceport then at a fly on the desk at last he stood up getting slowly to his feet i cant even tell you that sir he said  you cant why not  becausebecause i promised not to                                       the room was silent doctor harris rose too and they both stood facing each other harris frowned rubbing his jaw corporal just who did you promise  i cant even tell you that sir im sorry  the doctor considered this at last he went to the door and opened it all right corporal you may go now and thanks for your time  im sorry im not more helpful the corporal went slowly out and harris closed the door after him then he went across his office to the vidphone he rang commander coxs letter a moment later the beefy goodnatured face of the base commander appeared  cox this is harris i talked to him all right all i could get is the statement that hes a plant what else is there what kind of behavior pattern  well cox said the first thing they noticed was that he wouldnt do any work the garrison chief reported that this westerburg would wander off outside the garrison and just sit all day long just sit  in the sun  yes just sit in the sun then at nightfall he would come back in when they asked why he wasnt working in the jet repair building he told them he had to be out in the sun then he said cox hesitated  yes said what  he said that work was unnatural that it was a waste of time that the only worthwhile thing was to sit and contemplateoutside  what then  then they asked him how he got that idea and then he revealed to them that he had become a plant  im going to have to talk to him again i can see harris said and hes applied for a permanent discharge from the patrol what reason did he give  the same that hes a plant now and has no more interest in being a patrolman all he wants to do is sit in the sun its the damnedest thing i ever heard  all right i think ill visit him in his quarters harris looked at his watch ill go over after dinner  good luck cox said gloomily but who ever heard of a man turning into a plant we told him it wasnt possible but he just smiled at us  ill let you know how i make out harris said                                       harris walked slowly down the hall it was after six the evening meal was over a dim concept was coming into his mind but it was much too soon to be sure he increased his pace turning right at the end of the hall two nurses passed hurrying by westerburg was quartered with a buddy a man who had been injured in a jet blast and who was now almost recovered harris came to the dorm wing and stopped checking the numbers on the doors  can i help you sir the robot attendant said gliding up  im looking for corporal westerburgs room  three doors to the right  harris went on asteroid y3 had only recently been garrisoned and staffed it had become the primary checkpoint to halt and examine ships entering the system from outer space the garrison made sure that no dangerous bacteria fungus or whatnot arrived to infect the system a nice asteroid it was warm wellwatered with trees and lakes and lots of sunlight and the most modern garrison in the nine planets he shook his head coming to the third door he stopped raising his hand and knocking  whos there sounded through the door  i want to see corporal westerburg  the door opened a bovine youth with hornrimmed glasses looked out a book in his hand who are you  doctor harris  im sorry sir corporal westerburg is asleep  would he mind if i woke him up i want very much to talk to him harris peered inside he could see a neat room with a desk a rug and lamp and two bunks on one of the bunks was westerburg lying face up his arms folded across his chest his eyes tightly closed  sir the bovine youth said im afraid i cant wake him up for you much as id like to  you cant why not  sir corporal westerburg wont wake up not after the sun sets he just wont he cant be wakened  cataleptic really  but in the morning as soon as the sun comes up he leaps out of bed and goes outside stays the whole day  i see the doctor said well thanks anyhow he went back out into the hall and the door shut after him theres more to this than i realized he murmured he went on back the way he had come                                       it was a warm sunny day the sky was almost free of clouds and a gentle wind moved through the cedars along the bank of the stream there was a path leading from the hospital building down the slope to the stream at the stream a small bridge led over to the other side and a few patients were standing on the bridge wrapped in their bathrobes looking aimlessly down at the water  it took harris several minutes to find westerburg the youth was not with the other patients near or around the bridge he had gone farther down past the cedar trees and out onto a strip of bright meadow where poppies and grass grew everywhere he was sitting on the stream bank on a flat grey stone leaning back and staring up his mouth open a little he did not notice the doctor until harris was almost beside him  hello harris said softly  westerburg opened his eyes looking up he smiled and got slowly to his feet a graceful flowing motion that was rather surprising for a man of his size hello doctor what brings you out here  nothing thought id get some sun  here you can share my rock westerburg moved over and harris sat down gingerly being careful not to catch his trousers on the sharp edges of the rock he lit a cigarette and gazed silently down at the water beside him westerburg had resumed his strange position leaning back resting on his hands staring up with his eyes shut tight  nice day the doctor said  yes  do you come here every day  yes  you like it better out here than inside  i cant stay inside westerburg said  you cant how do you mean cant  you would die without air wouldnt you the corporal said  and youd die without sunlight  westerburg nodded  corporal may i ask you something do you plan to do this the rest of your life sit out in the sun on a flat rock nothing else  westerburg nodded  how about your job you went to school for years to become a patrolman you wanted to enter the patrol very badly you were given a fine rating and a firstclass position how do you feel giving all that up you know it wont be easy to get back in again do you realize that  i realize it  and youre really going to give it all up  thats right                                       harris was silent for a while at last he put his cigarette out and turned toward the youth all right lets say you give up your job and sit in the sun well what happens then someone else has to do the job instead of you isnt that true the job has to be done your job has to be done and if you dont do it someone else has to  i suppose so  westerburg suppose everyone felt the way you do suppose everyone wanted to sit in the sun all day what would happen no one would check ships coming from outer space bacteria and toxic crystals would enter the system and cause mass death and suffering isnt that right  if everyone felt the way i do they wouldnt be going into outer space  but they have to they have to trade they have to get minerals and products and new plants  why  to keep society going  why  well harris gestured people couldnt live without society  westerburg said nothing to that harris watched him but the youth did not answer  isnt that right harris said  perhaps its a peculiar business doctor you know i struggled for years to get through training i had to work and pay my own way washed dishes worked in kitchens studied at night learned crammed worked on and on and you know what i think now  what  i wish id become a plant earlier  doctor harris stood up westerburg when you come inside will you stop off at my office i want to give you a few tests if you dont mind  the shock box westerburg smiled i knew that would be coming around sure i dont mind  nettled harris left the rock walking back up the bank a short distance about three corporal  the corporal nodded  harris made his way up the hill to the path toward the hospital building the whole thing was beginning to become more clear to him a boy who had struggled all his life financial insecurity idealized goal getting a patrol assignment finally reached it found the load too great and on asteroid y3 there was too much vegetation to look at all day primitive identification and projection on the flora of the asteroid concept of security involved in immobility and permanence unchanging forest  he entered the building a robot orderly stopped him almost at once sir commander cox wants you urgently on the vidphone  thanks harris strode to his office he dialed coxs letter and the commanders face came presently into focus cox this is harris ive been out talking to the boy im beginning to get this lined up now i can see the pattern too much load too long finally gets what he wants and the idealization shatters under the  harris cox barked shut up and listen i just got a report from y3 theyre sending an express rocket here its on the way  an express rocket  five more cases like westerburg all say theyre plants the garrison chief is worried as hell says we must find out what it is or the garrison will fall apart right away do you get me harris find out what it is  yes sir harris murmured yes sir                                       by the end of the week there were twenty cases and all of course were from asteroid y3  commander cox and harris stood together at the top of the hill looking gloomily down at the stream below sixteen men and four women sat in the sun along the bank none of them moving none speaking an hour had gone by since cox and harris appeared and in all that time the twenty people below had not stirred  i dont get it cox said shaking his head i just absolutely dont get it harris is this the beginning of the end is everything going to start cracking around us it gives me a hell of a strange feeling to see those people down there basking away in the sun just sitting and basking  whos that man there with the red hair  thats ulrich deutsch he was second in command at the garrison now look at him sits and dozes with his mouth open and his eyes shut a week ago that man was climbing going right up to the top when the garrison chief retires he was supposed to take over maybe another year at the most all his life hes been climbing to get up there  and now he sits in the sun harris finished  that woman the brunette with the short hair career woman head of the entire office staff of the garrison and the man beside her janitor and that cute little gal there with the bosom secretary just out of school all kinds and i got a note this morning three more coming in sometime today  harris nodded the strange thing isthey really want to sit down there theyre completely rational they could do something else but they just dont care to  well cox said what are you going to do have you found anything were counting on you lets hear it  i couldnt get anything out of them directly harris said but ive had some interesting results with the shock box lets go inside and ill show you  fine cox turned and started toward the hospital show me anything youve got this is serious now i know how tiberius felt when christianity showed up in high places                                       harris snapped off the light the room was pitch black ill run this first reel for you the subject is one of the best biologists stationed at the garrison robert bradshaw he came in yesterday i got a good run from the shock box because bradshaws mind is so highly differentiated theres a lot of repressed material of a nonrational nature more than usual  he pressed a switch the projector whirred and on the far wall a threedimensional image appeared in color so real that it might have been the man himself robert bradshaw was a man of fifty heavyset with iron grey hair and a square jaw he sat in the chair calmly his hands resting on the arms oblivious to the electrodes attached to his neck and wrist there i go harris said watch  his filmimage appeared approaching bradshaw now mr bradshaw his image said this wont hurt you at all and itll help us a lot the image rotated the controls on the shock box bradshaw stiffened and his jaw set but otherwise he gave no sign the image of harris regarded him for a time and then stepped away from the controls  can you hear me mr bradshaw the image asked  yes  what is your name  robert c bradshaw  what is your position  chief biologist at the checkstation on y3  are you there now  no im back on terra in a hospital  why  because i admitted to the garrison chief that i had become a plant  is that true that you are a plant  yes in a nonbiological sense i retain the physiology of a human being of course  what do you mean then that youre a plant  the reference is to attitudinal response to weltanschauung  go on  it is possible for a warmblooded animal an upper primate to adopt the psychology of a plant to some extent  yes  i refer to this  and the others they refer to this also  yes  how did this occur your adopting this attitude  bradshaws image hesitated the lips twisting see harris said to cox strong conflict he wouldnt have gone on if he had been fully conscious  i  yes  i was taught to become a plant  the image of harris showed surprise and interest what do you mean you were taught to become a plant  they realized my problems and taught me to become a plant now im free from them the problems  who who taught you  the pipers  who the pipers who are the pipers  there was no answer  mr bradshaw who are the pipers  after a long agonized pause the heavy lips parted they live in the woods  harris snapped off the projector and the lights came on he and cox blinked that was all i could get harris said but i was lucky to get that he wasnt supposed to tell not at all that was the thing they all promised not to do tell who taught them to become plants the pipers who live in the woods on asteroid y3  you got this story from all twenty  no harris grimaced most of them put up too much fight i couldnt even get this much from them  cox reflected the pipers well what do you propose to do just wait around until you can get the full story is that your program  no harris said not at all im going to y3 and find out who the pipers are myself                                       the small patrol ship made its landing with care and precision its jets choking into final silence the hatch slid back and doctor henry harris found himself staring out at a field a brown sunbaked landing field at the end of the field was a tall signal tower around the field on all sides were long grey buildings the garrison checkstation itself not far off a huge venusian cruiser was parked a vast green hulk like an enormous lime the technicians from the station were swarming all over it checking and examining each inch of it for lethal lifeforms and poisons that might have attached themselves to the hull  all out sir the pilot said  harris nodded he took hold of his two suitcases and stepped carefully down the ground was hot underfoot and he blinked in the bright sunlight jupiter was in the sky and the vast planet reflected considerable sunlight down onto the asteroid  harris started across the field carrying his suitcases a field attendant was already busy opening the storage compartment of the patrol ship extracting his trunk the attendant lowered the trunk into a waiting dolly and came after him manipulating the little truck with bored skill  as harris came to the entrance of the signal tower the gate slid back and a man came forward an older man large and robust with white hair and a steady walk  how are you doctor he said holding his hand out im lawrence watts the garrison chief  they shook hands watts smiled down at harris he was a huge old man still regal and straight in his dark blue uniform with his gold epaulets sparkling on his shoulders  have a good trip watts asked come on inside and ill have a drink fixed for you it gets hot around here with the big mirror up there  jupiter harris followed him inside the building the signal tower was cool and dark a welcome relief why is the gravity so near terras i expected to go flying off like a kangaroo is it artificial  no theres a dense core of some kind to the asteroid some kind of metallic deposit thats why we picked this asteroid out of all the others it made the construction problem much simpler and it also explains why the asteroid has natural air and water did you see the hills  the hills  when we get up higher in the tower well be able to see over the buildings theres quite a natural park here a regular little forest complete with everything youd want come in here harris this is my office the old man strode at quite a clip around the corner and into a large wellfurnished apartment isnt this pleasant i intend to make my last year here as amiable as possible he frowned of course with deutsch gone i may be here forever oh well he shrugged sit down harris  thanks harris took a chair stretching his legs out he watched watts as he closed the door to the hall by the way any more cases come up  two more today watts was grim makes almost thirty in all we have three hundred men in this station at the rate its going  chief you spoke about a forest on the asteroid do you allow the crew to go into the forest at will or do you restrict them to the buildings and grounds                                       watts rubbed his jaw well its a difficult situation harris i have to let the men leave the grounds sometimes they can see the forest from the buildings and as long as you can see a nice place to stretch out and relax that does it once every ten days they have a full period of rest then they go out and fool around  and then it happens  yes i suppose so but as long as they can see the forest theyll want to go i cant help it  i know im not censuring you well whats your theory what happens to them out there what do they do  what happens once they get out there and take it easy for a while they dont want to come back and work its boondoggling playing hookey they dont want to work so off they go  how about this business of their delusions  watts laughed goodnaturedly listen harris you know as well as i do thats a lot of poppycock theyre no more plants than you or i they just dont want to work thats all when i was a cadet we had a few ways to make people work i wish we could lay a few on their backs like we used to  you think this is simple goldbricking then  dont you think it is  no harris said they really believe theyre plants i put them through the highfrequency shock treatment the shock box the whole nervous system is paralyzed all inhibitions stopped cold they tell the truth then and they said the same thingand more  watts paced back and forth his hands clasped behind his back harris youre a doctor and i suppose you know what youre talking about but look at the situation here we have a garrison a good modern garrison were probably the most modern outfit in the system every new device and gadget is here that science can produce harris this garrison is one vast machine the men are parts and each has his job the maintenance crew the biologists the office crew the managerial staff  look what happens when one person steps away from his job everything else begins to creak we cant service the bugs if no one services the machines we cant order food to feed the crews if no one makes out reports takes inventories we cant direct any kind of activity if the second in command decides to go out and sit in the sun all day  thirty people one tenth of the garrison but we cant run without them the garrison is built that way if you take the supports out the whole building falls no one can leave were all tied here and these people know it they know they have no right to do that run off on their own no one has that right anymore were all too tightly interwoven to suddenly start doing what we want its unfair to the rest the majority                                       harris nodded chief can i ask you something  what is it  are there any inhabitants on the asteroid any natives  natives watts considered yes theres some kind of aborigines living out there he waved vaguely toward the window  what are they like have you seen them  yes ive seen them at least i saw them when we first came here they hung around for a while watching us then after a time they disappeared  did they die off diseases of some kind  no they justjust disappeared into their forest theyre still there someplace  what kind of people are they  well the story is that theyre originally from mars they dont look much like martians though theyre dark a kind of coppery color thin very agile in their own way they hunt and fish no written language we dont pay much attention to them  i see harris paused chief have you ever heard of anything calledthe pipers  the pipers watts frowned no why  the patients mentioned something called the pipers according to bradshaw the pipers taught him to become a plant he learned it from them a kind of teaching  the pipers what are they  i dont know harris admitted i thought maybe you might know my first assumption of course was that theyre the natives but now im not so sure not after hearing your description of them  the natives are primitive savages they dont have anything to teach anybody especially a topflight biologist  harris hesitated chief id like to go into the woods and look around is that possible  certainly i can arrange it for you ill give you one of the men to show you around  id rather go alone is there any danger  no none that i know of except  except the pipers harris finished i know well theres only one way to find them and thats it ill have to take my chances                                       if you walk in a straight line chief watts said youll find yourself back at the garrison in about six hours its a damn small asteroid theres a couple of streams and lakes so dont fall in  how about snakes or poisonous insects  nothing like that reported we did a lot of tramping around at first but its grown back now the way it was we never encountered anything dangerous  thanks chief harris said they shook hands ill see you before nightfall  good luck the chief and his two armed escorts turned and went back across the rise down the other side toward the garrison harris watched them go until they disappeared inside the building then he turned and started into the grove of trees  the woods were very silent around him as he walked trees towered up on all sides of him huge darkgreen trees like eucalyptus the ground underfoot was soft with endless leaves that had fallen and rotted into soil after a while the grove of high trees fell behind and he found himself crossing a dry meadow the grass and weeds burned brown in the sun insects buzzed around him rising up from the dry weedstalks something scuttled ahead hurrying through the undergrowth he caught sight of a grey ball with many legs scampering furiously its antennae weaving  the meadow ended at the bottom of a hill he was going up now going higher and higher ahead of him an endless expanse of green rose acres of wild growth he scrambled to the top finally blowing and panting catching his breath  he went on now he was going down again plunging into a deep gully tall ferns grew as large as trees he was entering a living jurassic forest ferns that stretched out endlessly ahead of him down he went walking carefully the air began to turn cold around him the floor of the gully was damp and silent underfoot the ground was almost wet  he came out on a level table it was dark with the ferns growing up on all sides dense growths of ferns silent and unmoving he came upon a natural path an old stream bed rough and rocky but easy to follow the air was thick and oppressive beyond the ferns he could see the side of the next hill a green field rising up  something grey was ahead rocks piledup boulders scattered and stacked here and there the stream bed led directly to them apparently this had been a pool of some kind a stream emptying from it he climbed the first of the boulders awkwardly feeling his way up at the top he paused resting again  as yet he had had no luck so far he had not met any of the natives it would be through them that he would find the mysterious pipers that were stealing the men away if such really existed if he could find the natives talk to them perhaps he could find out something but as yet he had been unsuccessful he looked around the woods were very silent a slight breeze moved through the ferns rustling them but that was all where were the natives probably they had a settlement of some sort huts a clearing the asteroid was small he should be able to find them by nightfall                                       he started down the rocks more rocks rose up ahead and he climbed them suddenly he stopped listening far off he could hear a sound the sound of water was he approaching a pool of some kind he went on again trying to locate the sound he scrambled down rocks and up rocks and all around him there was silence except for the splashing of distant water maybe a waterfall water in motion a stream if he found the stream he might find the natives  the rocks ended and the stream bed began again but this time it was wet the bottom muddy and overgrown with moss he was on the right track not too long ago this stream had flowed probably during the rainy season he went up on the side of the stream pushing through the ferns and vines a golden snake slid expertly out of his path something glinted ahead something sparkling through the ferns water a pool he hurried pushing the vines aside and stepping out leaving them behind  he was standing on the edge of a pool a deep pool sunk in a hollow of grey rocks surrounded by ferns and vines the water was clear and bright and in motion flowing in a waterfall at the far end it was beautiful and he stood watching marveling at it the undisturbed quality of it untouched it was just as it had always been probably as long as the asteroid existed was he the first to see it perhaps it was so hidden so concealed by the ferns it gave him a strange feeling a feeling almost of ownership he stepped down a little toward the water  and it was then he noticed her  the girl was sitting on the far edge of the pool staring down into the water resting her head on one drawnup knee she had been bathing he could see that at once her coppery body was still wet and glistening with moisture sparkling in the sun she had not seen him he stopped holding his breath watching her  she was lovely very lovely with long dark hair that wound around her shoulders and arms her body was slim very slender with a supple grace to it that made him stare accustomed as he was to various forms of anatomy how silent she was silent and unmoving staring down at the water time passed strange unchanging time as he watched the girl time might even have ceased with the girl sitting on the rock staring into the water and the rows of great ferns behind her as rigid as if they had been painted there  all at once the girl looked up harris shifted suddenly conscious of himself as an intruder he stepped back im sorry he murmured im from the garrison i didnt mean to come poking around  she nodded without speaking  you dont mind harris asked presently  no  so she spoke terran he moved a little toward her around the side of the pool i hope you dont mind my bothering you i wont be on the asteroid very long this is my first day here i just arrived from terra  she smiled faintly  im a doctor henry harris he looked down at her at the slim coppery body gleaming in the sunlight a faint sheen of moisture on her arms and thighs you might be interested in why im here he paused maybe you can even help me  she looked up a little oh  would you like to help me  she smiled yes of course  thats good mind if i sit down he looked around and found himself a flat rock he sat down slowly facing her cigarette  no  well ill have one he lit up taking a deep breath you see we have a problem at the garrison something has been happening to some of the men and it seems to be spreading we have to find out what causes it or we wont be able to run the garrison                                       he waited for a moment she nodded slightly how silent she was silent and unmoving like the ferns  well ive been able to find out a few things from them and one very interesting fact stands out they keep saying that something calledcalled the pipers are responsible for their condition they say the pipers taught them he stopped a strange look had flitted across her dark small face do you know the pipers  she nodded  acute satisfaction flooded over harris you do i was sure the natives would know he stood up again i was sure they would if the pipers really existed then they do exist do they  they exist  harris frowned and theyre here in the woods  yes  i see he ground his cigarette out impatiently you dont suppose theres any chance you could take me to them do you  take you  yes i have this problem and i have to solve it you see the base commander on terra has assigned this to me this business about the pipers it has to be solved and im the one assigned to the job so its important to me to find them do you see do you understand  she nodded  well will you take me to them  the girl was silent for a long time she sat staring down into the water resting her head against her knee harris began to become impatient he fidgeted back and forth resting first on one leg and then on the other  well will you he said again its important to the whole garrison what do you say he felt around in his pockets maybe i could give you something what do i have he brought out his lighter i could give you my lighter  the girl stood up rising slowly gracefully without motion or effort harris mouth fell open how supple she was gliding to her feet in a single motion he blinked without effort she had stood seemingly without change all at once she was standing instead of sitting standing and looking calmly at him her small face expressionless  will you he said  yes come along she turned away moving toward the row of ferns  harris followed quickly stumbling across the rocks fine he said thanks a lot im very interested to meet these pipers where are you taking me to your village how much time do we have before nightfall  the girl did not answer she had entered the ferns already and harris quickened his pace to keep from losing her how silently she glided  wait he called wait for me  the girl paused waiting for him slim and lovely looking silently back  he entered the ferns hurrying after her                                       well ill be damned commander cox said it sure didnt take you long he leaped down the steps two at a time let me give you a hand  harris grinned lugging his heavy suitcases he set them down and breathed a sigh of relief it isnt worth it he said im going to give up taking so much  come on inside soldier give him a hand a patrolman hurried over and took one of the suitcases the three men went inside and down the corridor to harris quarters harris unlocked the door and the patrolman deposited his suitcase inside  thanks harris said he set the other down beside it its good to be back even for a little while  a little while  i just came back to settle my affairs i have to return to y3 tomorrow morning  then you didnt solve the problem  i solved it but i havent cured it im going back and get to work right away theres a lot to be done  but you found out what it is  yes it was just what the men said the pipers  the pipers do exist  yes harris nodded they do exist he removed his coat and put it over the back of the chair then he went to the window and let it down warm spring air rushed into the room he settled himself on the bed leaning back  the pipers exist all rightin the minds of the garrison crew to the crew the pipers are real the crew created them its a mass hypnosis a group projection and all the men there have it to some degree  how did it start  those men on y3 were sent there because they were skilled highlytrained men with exceptional ability all their lives theyve been schooled by complex modern society fast tempo and high integration between people constant pressure toward some goal some job to be done  those men are put down suddenly on an asteroid where there are natives living the most primitive of existence completely vegetable lives no concept of goal no concept of purpose and hence no ability to plan the natives live the way the animals live from day to day sleeping picking food from the trees a kind of gardenofeden existence without struggle or conflict  so but  each of the garrison crew sees the natives and unconsciously thinks of his own early life when he was a child when he had no worries no responsibilities before he joined modern society a baby lying in the sun  but he cant admit this to himself he cant admit that he might want to live like the natives to lie and sleep all day so he invents the pipers the idea of a mysterious group living in the woods who trap him lead him into their kind of life then he can blame them not himself they teach him to become a part of the woods  what are you going to do have the woods burned  no harris shook his head thats not the answer the woods are harmless the answer is psychotherapy for the men thats why im going right back so i can begin work theyve got to be made to see that the pipers are inside them their own unconscious voices calling to them to give up their responsibilities theyve got to be made to realize that there are no pipers at least not outside themselves the woods are harmless and the natives have nothing to teach anyone theyre primitive savages without even a written language were seeing a psychological projection by a whole garrison of men who want to lay down their work and take it easy for a while  the room was silent  i see cox said presently well it makes sense he got to his feet i hope you can do something with the men when you get back  i hope so too harris agreed and i think i can after all its just a question of increasing their selfawareness when they have that the pipers will vanish  cox nodded well you go ahead with your unpacking doc ill see you at dinner and maybe before you leave tomorrow  fine                                       harris opened the door and the commander went out into the hall harris closed the door after him and then went back across the room he looked out the window for a moment his hands in his pockets  it was becoming evening the air was turning cool the sun was just setting as he watched disappearing behind the buildings of the city surrounding the hospital he watched it go down  then he went over to his two suitcases he was tired very tired from his trip a great weariness was beginning to descend over him there were so many things to do so terribly many how could he hope to do them all back to the asteroid and then what  he yawned his eyes closing how sleepy he was he looked over at the bed then he sat down on the edge of it and took his shoes off so much to do the next day  he put his shoes in the corner of the room then he bent over unsnapping one of the suitcases he opened the suitcase from it he took a bulging gunnysack carefully he emptied the contents of the sack out on the floor dirt rich soft dirt dirt he had collected during his last hours there dirt he had carefully gathered up  when the dirt was spread out on the floor he sat down in the middle of it he stretched himself out leaning back when he was fully comfortable he folded his hands across his chest and closed his eyes so much work to dobut later on of course tomorrow how warm the dirt was  he was sound asleep in a moment
