reign of king henry vii of england there had been a great show in london for that day his grace opened the newly convened parliament and announced to his faithful peoplewho received the news with much cheering since war is ever popular at firsthis intention of invading france and of leading the english armies in person in parliament itself it is true the general enthusiasm was somewhat dashed when allusion was made to the finding of the needful funds but the crowds without formed for the most part of persons who would not be called upon to pay the money did not suffer that side of the question to trouble them so when their gracious liege appeared surrounded by his glittering escort of nobles and menatarms they threw their caps into the air and shouted themselves hoarse  the king himself although he was still young in years already a wearylooking man with a fine pinched face smiled a little sarcastically at their clamour but remembering how glad he should be to hear it who still sat upon a somewhat doubtful throne said a few soft words and sending for two or three of the leaders of the people gave them his royal hand and suffered certain children to touch his robe that they might be cured of the evil then having paused a while to receive petitions from poor folk which he handed to one of his officers to be read amidst renewed shouting he passed on to the great feast that was made ready in his palace of westminster  among those who rode near to him was the ambassador de ayala accredited to the english court by the spanish sovereigns ferdinand and isabella and his following of splendidly attired lords and secretaries that spain was much in favour there was evident from his place in the procession how could it be otherwise indeed seeing that already four years or more before at the age of twelve months prince arthur the eldest son of the king had been formally affianced to the infanta catherine daughter of ferdinand and isabella aged one year and nine months for in those days it was thought well that the affections of princes and princesses should be directed early into such paths as their royal parents and governors considered likely to prove most profitable to themselves  at the ambassadors left hand mounted on a fine black horse and dressed richly but simply in black velvet with a cap of the same material in which was fastened a single pearl rode a tall cavalier he was about fiveandthirty years of age and very handsome having piercing black eyes and a stern cleancut face  in every man it is said there can be found a resemblance often far off and fanciful enough to some beast or bird or other creature and certainly in this case it was not hard to discover the man resembled an eagle which whether by chance or design was the crest he bore upon his servants livery and the trappings of his horse the unflinching eyes the hooked nose the air of pride and mastery the thin long hand the quick grace of movement all suggested that king of birds suggested also as his motto said that what he sought he would find and what he found he would keep just now he was watching the interview between the english king and the leaders of the crowd whom his grace had been pleased to summon with an air of mingled amusement and contempt  you find the scene strange marquis said the ambassador glancing at him shrewdly  señor here in england if it pleases your excellency he answered gravely señor daguilar the marquis you mentioned lives in spainan accredited envoy to the moors of granada the señor daguilar a humble servant of holy church and he crossed himself travels abroadupon the churchs business and that of their majesties  and his own too sometimes i believe answered the ambassador drily but to be frank what i do not understand about you señor daguilar as i know that you have abandoned political ambitions is why you do not enter my profession and put on the black robe once and for all what did i sayblack with your opportunities and connections it might be red by now with a hat to match  the señor daguilar smiled a little as he replied  you said i think that sometimes i travel on my own business well there is your answer you are right i have abandoned worldly ambitionsmost of them they are troublesome and for some people if they be born too high and yet not altogether rightly very dangerous the acorn of ambition often grows into an oak from which men hang  or into a log upon which mens heads can be cut off señor i congratulate you you have the wisdom that grasps the substance and lets the shadows flit it is really very rare  you asked why i do not change the cut of my garments went on daguilar without noticing the interruption excellency to be frank because of my own business i have failings like other men for instance wealth is that substance of which you spoke rule is the shadow he who has the wealth has the real rule again bright eyes may draw me or a hate may seek its slaking and these things do not suit robes black or red  yet many such things have been done by those who wore them replied the ambassador with meaning  aye excellency to the discredit of holy church as you a priest know better than most men let the earth be evil as it must but let the church be like heaven above it pure unstained the vault of prayer the house of mercy and of righteous judgment wherein walks no sinner such as i and again he crossed himself  there was a ring of earnestness in the speakers voice that caused de ayala who knew something of his private reputation to look at him curiously  a true fanatic and therefore to us a useful man he thought to himself though one who knows how to make the best of two worlds as well as most of them but aloud he said no wonder that our church rejoices in such a son and that her enemies tremble when he lifts her sword but señor you have not told me what you think of all this ceremony and people  the people i know well excellency for i dwelt among them in past years and speak their language and that is why i have left granada to look after itself for a while and am here today to watch and make report he checked himself then added as for the ceremony were i a king i would have it otherwise why in that house just now those vulgar commonsfor so they call them do they notalmost threatened their royal master when he humbly craved a tithe of the countrys wealth to fight the countrys war yes and i saw him turn pale and tremble at the rough voices as though their echoes shook his throne i tell you excellency that the time will come in this land when those commons will be king look now at that fellow whom his grace holds by the hand calling him sir and master and yet whom he knows to be as i do a heretic a jew in disguise whose sins if he had his rights should be purged by fire why to my knowledge last night that israelite said things against the church  whereof the church or its servant doubtless made notes to be used when the time comes broke in de ayala but the audience is done and his highness beckons us forward to the feast where there will be no heretics to vex us and as it is lent not much to eat come señor for we stop the way  three hours had gone by and the sun sank redly for even at that spring season it was cold upon the marshy lands of westminster and there was frost in the air on the open space opposite to the banquetinghall in front of which were gathered squires and grooms with horses stood and walked many citizens of london who their days work done came to see the king pass by in state among these were a man and a lady the latter attended by a handsome young woman who were all three sufficiently striking in appearance to attract some notice in the throng  the man a person of about thirty years of age dressed in a merchants robe of cloth and wearing a knife in his girdle seemed over six feet in height while his companion in her flowing furtrimmed cloak was for a woman also of unusual stature he was not strictly speaking a handsome man being somewhat too high of forehead and prominent of feature moreover one of his cleanshaven cheeks the right was marred by the long red scar of a swordcut which stretched from the temple to the strong chin his face however was open and manly if rather stern and the grey eyes were steady and frank it was not the face of a merchant but rather that of one of good degree accustomed to camps and war for the rest his figure was wellbuilt and active and his voice when he spoke which was seldom clear and distinct to loudness but cultivated and pleasantagain not the voice of a merchant  of the ladys figure little could be seen because of the long cloak that hid it but the face which appeared within its hood when she turned and the dying sunlight filled her eyes was lovely indeed for from her birth to her deathday margaret castellfair margaret as she was calledhad this gift to a degree that is rarely granted to woman rounded and flowerlike was that face most delicately tinted also with rich and curving lips and a broad snowwhite brow but the wonder of it what distinguished her above everything else from other beautiful women of her time was to be found in her eyes for these were not blue or grey as might have been expected from her general colouring but large black and lustrous soft too as the eyes of a deer and overhung by curling lashes of an ebon black the effect of these eyes of hers shining above those tinted cheeks and beneath the brow of ivory whiteness was so strange as to be almost startling they caught the beholder and held him as might the sudden sight of a rose in snow or the morning star hanging luminous among the mists of dawn also although they were so gentle and modest if that beholder chanced to be a man on the good side of fifty it was often long before he could forget them especially if he were privileged to see how well they matched the hair of chestnut shading into black that waved above them and fell tress upon tress upon the shapely shoulders and down to the slender waist  peter brome for he was so named looked a little anxiously about him at the crowd then turning addressed margaret in his strong clear voice  there are rough folk around he said do you think you should stop here your father might be angered cousin  here it may be explained that in reality their kinship was of the slightest a mere dash of blood that came to her through her mother still they called each other thus since it is a convenient title that may mean much or nothing  oh why not she answered in her rich slow tones that had in them some foreign quality something soft and sweet as the caress of a southern wind at night with you cousin and she glanced approvingly at his stalwart soldierlike form i have nothing to fear from men however rough and i do greatly want to see the king close by and so does betty dont you betty and she turned to her companion  betty dene whom she addressed was also a cousin of margaret though only a distant connection of peter brome she was of very good blood but her father a wild and dissolute man had broken her mothers heart and like that mother died early leaving betty dependent upon margarets mother in whose house she had been brought up this betty was in her way remarkable both in body and mind fair splendidly formed strong with wide bold blue eyes and ripe red lips such was the fashion of her in speech she was careless and vigorous fond of the society of men and fonder still of their admiration for she was romantic and vain betty at the age of fiveandtwenty was yet an honest girl and well able to take care of herself as more than one of her admirers had discovered although her position was humble at heart she was very proud of her lineage ambitious also her great desire being to raise herself by marriage back to the station from which her fathers folly had cast her downno easy business for one who passed as a waitingwoman and was without fortune  for the rest she loved and admired her cousin margaret more than any one on earth while peter she liked and respected none the less perhaps because try as she wouldand being nettled she did try hard enoughher beauty and other charms left him quite unmoved  in answer to margarets question she laughed and answered  of course we are all too busy up in holborn to get the chance of so many shows that i should wish to miss one still master peter is very wise and i am always counselled to obey him also it will soon be dark  well well said margaret with a sigh and a little shrug of her shoulders as you are both against me perhaps we had best be going next time i come out walking cousin peter it shall be with some one who is more kind  then she turned and began to make her way as quickly as she could through the thickening crowd finding this difficult before peter could stop her for she was very swift in her movements margaret bore to the right entering the space immediately in front of the banquetinghall where the grooms with horses and soldiers were assembled awaiting their lords for here there was more room to walk for a few moments peter and betty were unable to escape from the mob which closed in behind her and thus it came about that margaret found herself alone among these people in the midst indeed of the guard of the spanish ambassador de ayala men who were notorious for their lawlessness for they reckoned upon their masters privilege to protect them also for the most part they were just then more or less in liquor  one of these fellows a great redhaired scotchman whom the priestdiplomatist had brought with him from that country where he had also been ambassador suddenly perceiving before him a woman who appeared to be young and pretty determined to examine her more closely and to this end made use of a rude stratagem pretending to stumble he grasped at margarets cloak as though to save himself and with a wrench tore it open revealing her beautiful face and graceful figure  a dove comradesa dove he shouted in a voice thick with drink who has flown here to give me a kiss and casting his long arms about her he strove to draw her to him  peter help me peter cried margaret as she struggled fiercely in his grip  no no if you want a saint my bonny lass said the drunken scotchman andrew is as good as peter at which witticism those of the others who understood him laughed for the mans name was andrew  next instant they laughed again and to the ruffian andrew it seemed as though suddenly he had fallen into the power of a whirlwind at least margaret was wrenched away from him while he spun round and round to fall violently upon his face  thats peter exclaimed one of the soldiers in spanish  yes answered another and a patron saint worth having while a third pulled the recumbent andrew to his feet  the man looked like a devil his cap had gone and his fiery red hair was smeared with mud moreover his nose had been broken on a cobble stone and blood from it poured all over him while his little red eyes glared like a ferrets and his face turned a dirty white with pain and rage howling out something in scotch of a sudden he drew his sword and rushed straight at his adversary purposing to kill him  now peter had no sword but only his short knife which he found no time to draw in his hand however he carried a stout holly staff shod with iron and while margaret clasped her hands and betty screamed on this he caught the descending blow and furious as it was parried and turned it then before the man could strike again that staff was up and peter had leapt upon him it fell with fearful force breaking the scotchmans shoulder and sending him reeling back  shrewdly struck peter well done peter shouted the spectators  but peter neither saw nor heard them for he was mad with rage at the insult that had been offered to margaret up flew the irontipped staff again and down it came this time full on andrews head which it shattered like an eggshell so that the brute fell backwards dead  for a moment there was silence for the joke had taken a tragic turn then one of the spaniards said glancing at the prostrate form  name of god our mate is done for that merchant hits hard  instantly there arose a murmur among the dead mans comrades and one of them cried  cut him down  understanding that he was to be set on peter sprang forward and snatched the scotchmans sword from the ground where it had fallen at the same time dropping his staff and drawing his dagger with the left hand now he was well armed and looked so fierce and soldierlike as he faced his foes that although four or five blades were out they held back then peter spoke for the first time for he knew that against so many he had no chance  englishmen he cried in ringing tones but without shifting his head or glance will you see me murdered by these spanish dogs  there was a moments pause then a voice behind cried  by god not i and a brawny kentish manatarms ranged up beside him his cloak thrown over his left arm and his sword in his right hand  nor i said another peter brome and i have fought together before  nor i shouted a third for we were born in the same essex hundred  and so it went on until there were as many stout englishmen at his side as there were spaniards and scotchmen before him  that will do said peter we want no more than man to man look to the women comrades behind there now you murderers if you would see english swordplay come on or if you are afraid let us go in peace  yes come on you foreign cowards shouted the mob who did not love these turbulent and privileged guards  by now the spanish blood was up and the old racehatred awake in broken english the sergeant of the guard shouted out some filthy insult about margaret and called upon his followers to cut the throats of the london swine swords shone red in the red sunset light men shifted their feet and bent forward and in another instant a great and bloody fray would have begun  but it did not begin for at that moment a tall señor who had been standing in the shadow and watching all that passed walked between the opposing lines as he went striking up the swords with his arm  have done said daguilar quietly for it was he speaking in spanish you fools do you want to see every spaniard in london torn to pieces as for that drunken brute and he touched the corpse of andrew with his foot he brought his death upon himself moreover he was not a spaniard there is no blood quarrel come obey me or must i tell you who i am  we know you marquis said the leader in a cowed voice sheath your swords comrades after all it is no affair of ours  the men obeyed somewhat unwillingly but at this moment arrived the ambassador de ayala very angry for he had heard of the death of his servant demanding in a loud voice that the man who had killed him should be given up  we will not give him up to a spanish priest shouted the mob come and take him if you want him and once more the tumult grew while peter and his companions made ready to fight  fighting there would have been also notwithstanding all that daguilar could do to prevent it but of a sudden the noise began to die away and a hush fell upon the place then between the uplifted weapons walked a short richly clad man who turned suddenly and faced the mob it was king henry himself  who dare to draw swords in my streets before my very palace doors he asked in a cold voice  a dozen hands pointed at peter  speak said the king to him  margaret come here cried peter and the girl was thrust forward to him  sire he said that man and he pointed to the corpse of andrew tried to do wrong to this maiden john castells child i her cousin threw him down he drew his sword and came at me and i killed him with my staff see it lies there then the spaniardshis comradeswould have cut me down and i called for english help sire that is all  the king looked him up and down  a merchant by your dress he said but a soldier by your mien how are you named  peter brome sire  ah there was a certain sir peter brome who fell at bosworth fieldnot fighting for me and he smiled did you know him perchance  he was my father sire and i saw him slainaye and slew the slayer  well can i believe it answered henry considering him but how comes it that peter bromes son who wears that battle scar across his face is clad in merchants woollen  sire said peter coolly my father sold his lands lent his all to the crown and i have never rendered the account therefore i must live as i can  the king laughed outright as he replied  i like you peter brome though doubtless you hate me  not so sire while richard lived i fought for richard richard is gone and if need be i would fight for henry who am an englishman and serve englands king  well said and i may have need of you yet nor do i bear you any grudge but i forgot is it thus that you would fight for me by causing riot in my streets and bringing me into trouble with my good friends the spaniards  sire you know the story  i know your story but who bears witness to it do you maiden castell the merchants daughter  aye sire the man whom my cousin killed maltreated me whose only wrong was that i waited to see your grace pass by look on my torn cloak  little wonder that he killed him for the sake of those eyes of yours maiden but this witness may be tainted and again he smiled adding is there no other  betty advanced to speak but daguilar stepping forward lifted his bonnet from his head bowed and said in english  your grace there is i saw it all this gallant gentleman had no blame it was the servants of my countryman de ayala who were to blame at any rate at first and afterwards came the trouble  now the ambassador de ayala broke in claiming satisfaction for the killing of his man for he was still very angry and saying that if it were not given he would report the matter to their majesties of spain and let them know how their servants were treated in london  at these words henry grew grave who above all things wished to give no offence to ferdinand and isabella  you have done an ill days work peter brome he said and one of which my attorney must consider meanwhile you will be best in safe keeping and he turned as though to order his arrest  sire exclaimed peter i live at master castells house in holborn nor shall i run away  who will answer for that asked the king or that you will not make more riots on your road thither  i will answer your grace said daguilar quietly if this lady will permit that i escort her and her cousin home also he added in a low voice it seems to me that to hale him to a prison would be more like to breed a riot than to let him go  henry glanced round him at the great crowd who were gathered watching this scene and saw something in their faces which caused him to agree with daguilar  so be it marquis he said i have your word and that of peter brome that he will be forthcoming if called upon let that dead man be laid in the abbey till tomorrow when this matter shall be inquired of excellency give me your arm i have greater questions of which i wish to speak with you ere we sleep    chapter ii  john castell  when the king was gone peter turned to those men who had stood by him and thanked them very heartily then he said to margaret  come cousin that is over for this time and you have had your wish and seen his grace now the sooner you are safe at home the better i shall be pleased  certainly she replied i have seen more than i desire to see again but before we go let us thank this spanish señor and she paused  daguilar lady or at least that name will serve said the spaniard in his cultured voice bowing low before her his eyes fixed all the while upon her beautiful face  señor daguilar i thank you and so does my cousin peter brome whose life perhaps you saveddont you peter oh and so will my father  yes answered peter somewhat sulkily i thank him very much though as for my life i trusted to my own arm and to those of my friends there good night sir  i fear señor answered daguilar with a smile that we cannot part just yet you forget i have become bond for you and must therefore accompany you to where you live that i may certify the place also perhaps it is safest for these countrymen of mine are revengeful and were i not with you might waylay you  now seeing from his face that peter was still bent upon declining this escort margaret interposed quickly  yes that is wisest also my father would wish it señor i will show you the way and accompanied by daguilar who gallantly offered her his arm she stepped forward briskly leaving peter to follow with her cousin betty  thus they walked in the twilight across the fields and through the narrow streets beyond that lay between westminster and holborn in front tripped margaret beside her stately cavalier with whom she was soon talking fast enough in spanish a tongue which for reasons that shall be explained she knew well while behind the scotchmans sword still in his hand and the handsome betty on his arm came peter brome in the worst of humours  john castell lived in a large rambling manygabled house just off the main thoroughfare of holborn that had at the back of it a garden surrounded by a high wall of this ancient place the front part served as a shop a store for merchandise and an office for castell was a very wealthy traderhow wealthy none quite knewwho exported woollen and other goods to spain under the royal licence bringing thence in his own ships fine raw spanish wool to be manufactured in england and with it velvet silks and wine from granada also beautiful inlaid armour of toledo steel sometimes too he dealt in silver and copper from the mountain mines for castell was a banker as well as a merchant or rather what answered to that description in those days  it was said that beneath his shop were dungeonlike storevaults built of thick cemented stone with iron doors through which no thief could break and filled with precious things however this might be certainly in that great house which in the time of the plantagenets had been the fortified palace of a noble existed chambers whereof he alone knew the secret since no one else not even his daughter or peter ever crossed their threshold also there slept in it a number of menservants very stout fellows who wore knives or swords beneath their cloaks and watched at night to see that all was well for the rest the livingrooms of this house where castell margaret his daughter and peter dwelt were large and comfortable being new panelled with oak after the tudor fashion and having deep windows that looked out upon the garden  when peter and betty reached the door not that which led into the shop but another it was to find that margaret and daguilar who were walking very quickly must have already passed it since it was shut and they had vanished at his knocka hard onea servingman opened and peter strode through the vestibule or antechamber into the hall where for the most part they ate and sat for thence he heard the sound of voices it was a fine room lit by hanging lamps of olive oil and having a large open hearth where a fire burned pleasantly while the oaken table in front of it was set for supper margaret who had thrown off her cloak stood warming herself at the fire and the señor daguilar comfortably seated in a big chair which he seemed to have known for years leaned back his bonnet in his hand and watched her idly  facing them stood john castell a stout darkbearded man of between fifty and sixty years of age with a clever cleancut face and piercing black eyes now in the privacy of his home he was very richly attired in a robe trimmed with the costliest fur and fastened with a gold chain that had a jewel on its clasp when castell served in his shop or sat in his countinghouse no merchant in london was more plainly dressed but at night loving magnificence at heart it was his custom thus to indulge in it even when there were none to see him from the way in which he stood and the look upon his face peter knew at once that he was much disturbed hearing his step castell wheeled round and addressed him at once in the clear decided voice which was his characteristic  what is this i am told peter a man killed by you before the palace gates a broil a public riot in which things went near to great bloodshed between the english with you at the head of them and the bodyguard of his excellency de ayala you arrested by the king and bailed out by this señor is all this true  quite answered peter calmly  then i am ruined we are all ruined oh it was an evil hour when i took one of your bloodthirsty trade into my house what have you to say  only that i want my supper said peter those who began the story can finish it for i think their tongues are nimbler than my own and he glanced wrathfully at margaret who laughed outright while even the solemn daguilar smiled  father broke in margaret do not be angry with cousin peter whose only fault is that he hits too hard it is i who am to blame for i wished to stop to see the king against his will and bettys and thenthen that brute and her eyes filled with tears of shame and anger caught hold of me and peter threw him down and afterwards when he attacked him with a sword peter killed him with his staff andall the rest happened  it was beautifully done said daguilar in his soft voice and foreign accent i saw it all and made sure that you were dead the parry i understood but the way you got your smashing blow in before he could thrust againah that  well well said castell let us eat first and talk afterwards señor daguilar you will honour my poor board will you not though it is hard to come from a kings feast to a merchants fare  it is i who am honoured answered daguilar and as for the feast his grace is sparing in this lenten season at least i could get little to eat and therefore like the señor peter i am starved  castell rang a silver bell which stood near by whereon servants brought in the meal which was excellent and plentiful while they were setting it on the table the merchant went to a cupboard in the wainscoting and took thence two flasks which he uncorked himself with care saying that he would give the señor some wine of his own country this done he said a latin grace and crossed himself an example which daguilar followed remarking that he was glad to find that he was in the house of a good christian  what else did you think that i should be asked castell glancing at him shrewdly  i did not think at all señor he answered but alas every one is not a christian in spain for instance we have many moors andjews  i know said castell for i trade with them both  then you have never visited spain  no i am an english merchant but try that wine señor it came from granada and they say that it is good  daguilar tasted it then drank off his glass  it is good indeed he said i have not its equal in my own cellars there  do you then live in granada señor daguilar asked castell  sometimes when i am not travelling i have a house there which my mother left me she loved the town and bought an old palace from the moors would you not like to see granada señora he asked turning to margaret as though to change the subject there is a wonderful building there called the alhambra it overlooks my house  my daughter is never likely to see it broke in castell i do not purpose that she should visit spain  ah you do not purpose but who knows god and his saints alone and again he crossed himself then fell to describing the beauties of granada  he was a fine and ready talker and his voice was very pleasant so margaret listened attentively enough watching his face and forgetting to eat while her father and peter watched them both at length the meal came to an end and when the servingmen had cleared away the dishes and they were alone castell said  now kinsman peter tell me your story  so peter told him in few words yet omitting nothing  i find no blame in you said the merchant when he had done nor do i see how you could have acted otherwise than you did it is margaret whom i blame for i only gave her leave to walk with you and betty by the river and bade her beware of crowds  yes father the fault is mine and for it i pray your pardon said margaret so meekly that her father could not find the heart to scold her as he had meant to do  you should ask peters pardon he muttered seeing that he is like to be laid by the heels in a dungeon over this business yes and put upon his trial for causing the mans death remember he was in the service of de ayala with whom our liege wishes to stand well and de ayala it seems is very angry  now margaret grew frightened for the thought that harm might come to peter cut her heart the colour left her cheek and once again her eyes swam with tears  oh say not so she exclaimed peter will you not fly at once  by no means he answered decidedly did i not say it to the king and is not this foreign lord bond for me  what can be done she went on then as a thought struck her turned to daguilar and clasping her slender hands looked pleadingly into his face and asked señor you who are so powerful and the friend of great people will you not help us  am i not here to do so señora although i think that a man who can call half london to his back as i saw your cousin do needs little help from me but listen my country has two ambassadors at this courtde ayala whom he has offended and doctor de puebla the friend of the king and strangely enough de puebla does not love de ayala yet he does love money which perhaps will be forthcoming now if a charge is to be laid over this brawl it will probably be done not by the churchman de ayala but through de puebla who knows your laws and court anddo you understand me señor castell  yes answered the merchant but how am i to get at de puebla if i were to offer him money he would only ask more  i see that you know his excellency remarked daguilar drily you are right no money should be offered a present must be made after the pardon is deliverednot before oh de puebla knows that john castells word is as good in london as it is among the jews and infidels of granada and the merchants of seville at both of which places i have heard it spoken  at this speech castells eyes flickered but he only answered  may be but how shall i approach him señor  if you will permit me that is my task now to what amount will you go to save our friend here from inconvenience fifty gold angels  it is too much said castell a knave like that is not worth ten indeed he was the assailant and nothing should be paid at all  ah señor the merchant is coming out in you also the dangerous man who thinks that right should rule the world not kingsi mean might the knave is worth nothing but de pueblas word in henrys ear is worth much  fifty angels be it then said castell and i thank you señor for your good offices will you take the money now  by no means not till i bring the debt discharged señor i will come again and let you know how matters stand farewell fair maiden may the saints intercede for that dead rogue who brought me into your company and that of your father and your cousin of the quick eye and the stalwart arm till we meet again and still murmuring compliments he bowed himself out of the room in charge of a manservant  thomas said castell to this servant when he returned you are a discreet fellow put on your cap and cloak follow that spaniard see where he lodges and find out all you can about him go now swiftly  the man bowed and went and presently castell listening heard a side door shut behind him then he turned and said to the other two  i do not like this business i smell trouble in it and i do not like the spaniard either  he seems a very gallant gentleman and highborn said margaret  aye very gallanttoo gallant and highborntoo highborn unless i am mistaken so gallant and so highborn and he checked himself then added daughter in your wilfulness you have stirred a great rock go to your bed and pray god that it may not fall upon your house and crush it and us  so margaret crept away frightened a little indignant also for after all what wrong had she done and why should her father mistrust this splendidlooking spanish cavalier  when she was gone peter who all this while had said little looked up and asked straight out  what are you afraid of sir  many things peter first that use will be made of this matter to extort much money from me who am known to be rich which is a sin best absolved by angels secondly that if i make trouble about paying other questions will be set afoot  what questions  have you ever heard of the new christians peter whom the spaniards call maranos  he nodded  then you know that a marano is a converted jew now as it chancesi tell you who do not break secretsmy father was a marano his name does not matterit is best forgotten but he fled from spain to england for reasons of his own and took that of the country whence he camecastile or castell also as it is not lawful for jews to live in england he became converted to the christian faithseek not to know his motives they are buried with him moreover he converted me his only child who was but ten years old and cared little whether i swore by father abraham or by the blessed mary the paper of my baptism lies in my strong box still well he was clever and built up this business and died unharmed fiveandtwenty years ago leaving me already rich that same year i married an englishwoman your mothers second cousin and loved her and lived happily with her and gave her all her heart could wish but after margarets birth threeandtwenty years gone by she never had her health and eight years ago she died you remember her since she brought you here when you were a stout lad and made me promise afterwards that i would always be your friend for except your father sir peter none other of your wellborn and ancient family were left so when sir peteragainst my counsel staking his all upon that usurping rogue richard who had promised to advance him and meanwhile took his moneywas killed at bosworth leaving you landless penniless and out of favour i offered you a home and you being a wise man put off your mail and put on woollen and became a merchants partner though your share of profit was but small now again you have changed staff for steel and he glanced at the scotchmans sword that still lay upon a side table and margaret has loosed that rock of which i spoke to her  what is the rock sir  that spaniard whom she brought home and found so fine  what of the spaniard  wait a while and i will tell you and taking a lamp he left the room returning presently with a letter which was written in cipher and translated upon another sheet in john castells own hand  this he said is from my partner and connection juan bernaldez a marano who lives at seville where ferdinand and isabella have their court among other matters he writes this i warn all brethren in england to be careful i have it that a certain one whose name i will not mention even in cipher a very powerful and highborn man and although he appears to be a pleasureseeker only and is certainly of a dissolute life among the greatest bigots in all spain has been sent or is shortly to be sent from granada where he is stationed to watch the moors as an envoy to the court of england to conclude a secret treaty with its king under this treaty the names of rich maranos that are already well known here are to be recorded so that when the time comes and the active persecution of jews and maranos begins they may be given up and brought to spain for trial before the inquisition also he is to arrange that no jew or marano may be allowed to take refuge in england this is for your information that you may warn any whom it concerns  you think that daguilar is this man asked peter while castell folded up the letter and hid it in the pocket of his robe  i do indeed i have heard already that a fox was on the prowl and that men should look to their henhouses moreover did you note how he crossed himself like a priest and what he said about being among good christians also it is lent and a fastday and by illfortune although none of us ate of it there was meat upon the table for as you know he added hurriedly i am not strict in such matters who give little weight to forms and ceremonies well he observed it and touched fish only although he drank enough of the sweet wine doubtless a report of that meat will go to spain by the next courier  and if it does what matter we are in england and englishmen will not suffer their spanish laws and ways perhaps the señor daguilar learned as much as that tonight outside the banquetinghall there is something to be feared from this brawl at home but while we are safe in london no more from spain  i am no coward but i think there is much more to be feared peter the arm of the pope is long and the arm of the crafty ferdinand is longer and both of them grope for the throats and moneybags of heretics  well sir we are not heretics  no perhaps not heretics but we are rich and the father of one of us was a jew and there is something else in this house which even a true son of holy church might desire and he looked at the door through which margaret had passed to her chamber  peter understood for his long arms moved uneasily and his grey eyes flashed  i will go to bed he said i wish to think  nay lad answered castell fill your glass and stay awhile i have words to say to you and there is no time like the present who knows what may happen tomorrow    chapter iii  peter gathers violets  peter obeyed sat down in a big oak chair by the dying fire and waited in his silent fashion  listen said castell fifteen months ago you told me something did you not  peter nodded  what was it then  that i loved my cousin margaret and asked your leave to tell her so  and what did i answer  that you forbade me because you had not proved me enough and she had not proved herself enough because moreover she would be very wealthy and with her beauty might look high in marriage although but a merchants daughter  well and then  and thennothing and peter sipped his wine deliberately and put it down upon the table  you are a very silent man even where your courting is concerned said castell searching him with his sharp eyes  i am silent because there is no more to say you bade me be silent and i have remained so  what even when you saw those gay lords making their addresses to margaret and when she grew angry because you gave no sign and was minded to yield to one or the other of them  yes even thenit was hard but even then do i not eat your bread and shall i take advantage of you when you have forbid me  castell looked at him again and this time there were respect and affection in his glance  silent and stern but honest he said as though to himself then added a hard trial but i saw it and helped you in the best way by sending those suitorswho were worthless fellowsabout their business now say are you still of the same mind towards margaret  i seldom change my mind sir and on such a business never  good then i give you my leave to find out what her mind may be  in the joy which he could not control peters face flushed then as though he were ashamed of showing emotion even at such a moment he took up his glass and drank a little of the wine before he answered  i thank you it is more than i dared to hope but it is right that i should say sir that i am no match for my cousin margaret the lands which should have been mine are gone and i have nothing save what you pay me for my poor help in this trade whereas she has or will have much  castells eyes twinkled the answer amused him  at least you have an upright heart he said for what other man in such a case would argue against himself also you are of good blood and not ill to look on or so some maids might think whilst as for wealth what said the wise king of my peoplethat ofttimes riches make themselves wings and fly away moreover man i have learned to love and honour you and sooner would i leave my only child in your hands than in those of any lord in england  i know not what to say broke in peter  then say nothing it is your custom and a good oneonly listen just now you spoke of your essex lands in the fair vale of dedham as gone well they have come back for last month i bought them all and more at a price larger than i wished to give because others sought them and but this day i have paid in gold and taken delivery of the title it is made out in your name peter brome and whether you marry my daughter or whether you marry her not yours they shall be when i am gone since i promised my dead wife to befriend you and as a child she lived there in your hall  now moved out of his calm the young man sprang from his seat and after the pious fashion of the time addressed his patron saint on whose feastday he was born  saint peter i thank thee  i asked you to be silent interrupted castell breaking him short moreover after god it is one john who should be thanked not st peter who has no more to do with these lands than father abraham or the patient job well thanks or no thanks those estates are yours though i had not meant to tell you of them yet but now i have something to propose to you say first does margaret think aught of that wooden face and those shut lips of yours  how can i know i have never asked her you forbade me  pshaw living in one house as you do at your age i would have known all there was to know on such a matter and yet kept my word but there the blood is different and you are somewhat overhonest for a lover was she frightened for you now when that knave made at you with the sword  peter considered the question then answered  i know not i did not look to see i looked at the scotchman with his sword for if i had not i should have been dead not he but she was certainly frightened when the fellow caught hold of her for then she called for me loud enough  and what is that what woman in london would not call for such a one as peter brome in her trouble well you must ask her and that soon if you can find the words take a lesson from that spanish don and scrape and bow and flatter and tell stories of the war and turn verses to her eyes and hair oh peter are you a fool that i at my age should have to teach you how to court a woman  mayhap sir at least i can do none of these things and poesy wearies me to read much more to write but i can ask a question and take an answer  castell shook his head impatiently  ask the question man if you will but never take the answer if it is against you wait rather and ask it again  and went on peter without noticing his grey eyes lighting with a sudden fire if need be i can break that fine spaniards bones as though he were a twig  ah said castell perhaps you will be called upon to make your words good before all is done for my part i think his bones will take some breaking well ask in your own wayonly ask and let me hear the answer before tomorrow night now it grows late and i have still something to say i am in danger here my wealth is noised abroad and many covet it some in high places i think peter it is in my mind to have done with all this trading and to withdraw me to spend my old age where none will take any notice of me down at that hall of yours in dedham if you will give me lodging indeed for a year and more ever since you spoke to me on the subject of margaret i have been calling in my moneys from spain and england and placing them out at safe interest in small sums or buying jewels with them or lending them to other merchants whom i trust and who will not rob me or mine peter you have worked well for me but you are no chapman it is not in your blood therefore since there is enough for all of us and more i shall pass this business and its goodwill over to others to be managed in their name but on shares and if it please god we will keep next yule at dedham  as he spoke the door at the far end of the hall opened and through it came that servingman who had been bidden to follow the spaniard  well said castell what tidings  the man bowed and said  i followed the don as you bade me to his lodging which i reached without his seeing me though from time to time he stopped to look about him he rests near the palace of westminster in the same big house where dwells the ambassador de ayala and those who stood round lifted their bonnets to him  watching i saw some of these go to a tavern a low place that is open all night and following them there called for a drink and listened to their talk who know the spanish tongue well having worked for five years in your worships house at seville they spoke of the fray tonight and said that if they could catch that longlegged fellow meaning master brome yonder they would put a knife into him since he had shamed them by killing the scotch knave who was their officer and the best swordsman in their company with a staff and then setting his british bulldogs on them i fell into talk with them saying that i was an english sailor from spain which they were too drunk to question and asked who might be the tall don who had interfered in the fray before the king came they told me he is a rich señor named daguilar but ill to serve in lent because he is so strict a churchman although not strict in other matters i answered that to me he looked like a great noble whereon one of them said that i was right that there was no blood in spain higher than his but unfortunately there was a bend in its stream also an inkpot had been upset into it  what does that mean asked peter  it is a spanish saying answered castell which signifies that a man is born illegitimate and has moorish blood in his veins  then i asked what he was doing here and the man answered that i had best put that question to the holy father and to the queen of spain lastly after i had given the soldier another cup i asked where the don lived and whether he had any other name he replied that he lived at granada for the most part and that if i called on him there i should see some pretty ladies and other nice things as for his name it was the marquis of nichel i said that meant marquis of nothing whereon the soldier answered that i seemed very curious and that was just what he meant to tell menothing also he called to his comrades that he believed i was a spy so i thought it time to be going as they were drunk enough to do me a mischief  good said castell you are watchman tonight thomas are you not see that all doors are barred so that we may sleep without fear of spanish thieves rest you well peter nay i do not come yet i have letters to send to spain by the ship which sails tomorrow night  when peter had gone john castell extinguished all the lamps save one this he took in his hand and passed from the hall into an apartment that in old days when this was a nobles house had been the private chapel there was an altar in it and over the altar a crucifix for a few moments castell knelt before the altar for even now at dead of night how knew he what eyes might watch him then he rose and lamp in hand glided behind it lifted some tapestry and pressed a spring in the panelling beneath it opened revealing a small secret chamber built in the thickness of the wall and without windows a mere cupboard that once perhaps had been a place where a priest might robe or keep the sacred vessels  in this chamber was a plain oak table on which stood candles and an ark of wood also some rolls of parchment before this table he knelt down and put up earnest prayers to the god of abraham for although his father had caused him to be baptized into the christian church as a child john castell remained a jew for this good reason then he was so much afraid knowing that although his daughter and peter knew nothing of his secret there were others who did and that were it revealed ruin and perhaps death would be his portion and that of his house since in those days there was no greater crime than to adore god otherwise than holy church allowed yet for many years he had taken the risk and worshipped on as his fathers did before him  his prayer finished he left the place closing the springdoor behind him and passed to his office where he sat till the morning light first writing a letter to his correspondent at seville and then painfully translating it into cipher by aid of a secret key his task done and the cipher letter sealed and directed he burned the draft extinguished his lamp and going to the window watched the rising of the sun in the garden beneath blackbirds sang and the pale primroses were abloom  i wonder he said aloud whether when those flowers come again i shall live to see them almost i feel as though the rope were tightening about my throat at last it came upon me while that accursed spaniard crossed himself at my table well so be it i will hide the truth while i can but if they catch me ill not deny it the money is safe most of it my wealth they shall never get and now i will make my daughter safe also as with peter she must be i would i had not put it off so long but i hankered after a great marriage for her which being a christian she well might make ill mend that fault before tomorrows morn she shall be plighted to him and before mayday his wife god of my fathers give us one month more of peace and safety and then because i have denied thee openly take my life in payment if thou wilt  before john castell went to bed peter was already awakeindeed he had slept but little that night how could he sleep whose fortunes had changed thus wondrously between sun set and rise yesterday he was but a merchants assistanta poor trade for one who had been trained to arms and borne them bravely today he was a gentleman again owner of the broad lands where he was bred and that had been his forefathers for many a generation yesterday he was a lover without hope for in himself he had never believed that the rich john castell would suffer him a landless man to pay court to his daughter one of the loveliest and wealthiest maids in london he had asked his leave in past days and been refused as he had expected that he would be refused and thenceforward being on his honour as it were he had said no tender word to margaret nor pressed her hand nor even looked into her eyes and sighed yet at times it had seemed to him that she would not have been illpleased if he had done one of these things or all that she wondered indeed that he did not and thought none the better of him for his abstinence moreover now he learned that her father wondered also and this was a strange reward of virtue  for peter loved margaret with heart and soul and body since he a lad had played with her a child he loved her and no other woman she was his thought by day and his dream by night his hope his eternal star heaven he pictured as a place where for ever he would be with margaret earth without her could be nothing but a hell that was why he had stayed on in castells shop bending his proud neck to this tradesmans yoke doing the bidding and taking the rough words of chapmen and of lordly customers filling in bills of exchange and cheapening bargains all without a sign or murmur though oftentimes he felt as though his gorge would burst with loathing of the life indeed that was why he had come there at all who otherwise would have been far away hewing a road to fame and fortune or digging out a grave with his broadsword for here at least he could be near to margaret could touch her hand at morn and evening could watch the light shine in her beauteous eyes and sometimes as she bent over him feel her breath upon his hair and now his purgatory was at an end and of a sudden the gates of joy were open  but what if margaret should prove the angel with the flaming sword who forbade him entrance to his paradise he trembled at the thought well if so so it must be he was not the man to force her fancy or call her father to his aid he would do his best to win her and if he failed why then he would bless her and let her go  peter could lie abed no longer but rose and dressed himself although the dawn was not fully come by his open window he said his prayers thanking god for mercies past and praying that he would bless him in his great emprise presently the sun rose and there came a great longing on him to be alone in the countryside he who was countryborn and hated towns with only the sky and the birds and the trees for company  but here in london was no country wherever he went he would meet men moreover he remembered that it might be best that just now he should not wander through the streets unguarded lest he should find spaniards watching to take him unawares well there was the garden he would go thither and walk a while so he descended the broad oak stairs and unbolting a door entered this garden which though not too well kept was large for london covering an acre of ground perhaps surrounded by a high wall and having walks and at the end of it a group of ancient elms beneath which was a seat hidden from the house in summer this was margarets favourite bower for she too loved nature and the land and all the things it bore indeed this garden was her joy and the flowers that grew there were for the most part of her own plantingprimroses snowdrops violets and in the shadow of the trees long hartstongue ferns  for a while peter walked up and down the central path and as it chanced margaret who also had risen early and not slept too well looking through her window curtains saw him wandering there and wondered what he did at this hour also why he was dressed in the clothes he wore on sundays and holidays perhaps she thought his weekday garments had been torn or muddied in last nights fray then she fell to thinking how bravely he had borne him in that fray she saw it all again the great redheaded rascal tossed up and whirled to the earth by his strong arms saw peter face that gleaming steel with nothing but a staff saw the straight blows fall and the fellow go reeling to the earth slain with a single stroke  ah her cousin peter brome was a man indeed though a strange one and remembering certain things that did not please her she shrugged her ivory shoulders turned red and pouted why that spaniard had said more civil words to her in an hour than had peter in two years and he was handsome and noblelooking also but then the spaniard wasa spaniard and other men wereother men whereas peter waspeter a creature apart one who cared as little for women as he did for trade  why then if he cared for neither women nor trade did he stop here she wondered to gather wealth she did not think it he seemed to have no leanings that way either it was a mystery still she could wish to get to the bottom of peters heart just to see what was hid there since no man has a right to be a riddle to his loving cousin yes and one day she would do it cost what it might  meanwhile she remembered that she had never thanked peter for the brave part which he had played and indeed had left him to walk home with betty a journey that as she gathered from her sprightly cousins talk while she undressed her neither of them had much enjoyed for betty be it said here was angry with peter who it seemed once had told her that she was a handsome silly fool who thought too much of men and too little of her business well since after the days work had begun she would find no opportunity she would go down and thank peter now and see if she could make him talk for once  so margaret threw her furtrimmed cloak about her drawing its hood over her head for the april air was cold and followed peter into the garden when she reached it however there was no peter to be seen whereon she reproached herself for having come to that damp place so early and meditated return then thinking that it would look foolish if any had chanced to see her she walked down the path pretending to seek for violets and found none thus she came to the group of great elms at the end and glancing between their ancient boles saw peter standing there now too she understood why she could find no violets for peter had gathered them all and was engaged awkwardly enough in trying to tie them and some leaves into a little posy by the help of a stem of grass with his left hand he held the violets with his right one end of the grass and since he lacked fingers to clasp the other this he attempted with his teeth now he drew it tight and now the brittle grass stem broke the violets were scattered and peter used words that he should not have uttered even when alone  i knew you would break it but i never thought you could lose your temper over so small a thing peter said margaret and he in the shadow looked up to see her standing there in the sunlight fresh and lovely as the spring itself  solemnly in severe reproof she shook her head from which the hood had fallen back but there was a smile upon her lips and laughter in her eyes oh she was beautiful and at the sight of her peters heart stood still then remembering what he had just said and certain other things that master castell had said he blushed so deeply that her own cheeks went red in sympathy it was foolish but she could not help it for about peter this morning there was something strange something that bred blushes  for whom are you gathering violets so early she asked when you ought to be praying for that scotchmans soul  i care nothing for his soul answered peter testily if the brute had one he can look after it himself and i was gathering the violetsfor you  she stared peter was not in the habit of making her presents of flowers no wonder he had looked strange  then i will help you to tie them do you know why i am up so early it is for your sake i behaved badly to you last night for i was cross because you wanted to thwart me about seeing the king i never thanked you for all you did you brave peter though i thanked you enough in my heart do you know that when you stood there with that sword in the middle of those englishmen you looked quite noble come out into the sunlight and i will thank you properly  in his agitation peter let the remainder of the flowers fall then an idea struck him and he answered  look i cant if you are really grateful for nothing at all come in here and help me to pick up these violetsa pest on their short stalks  she hesitated a little then by degrees drew nearer and bending down began to find the flowers one by one peter had scattered them wide so that at first the pair were some way apart but when only a few remained they drew close now there was but one violet left and both stretching for it their hands met margaret held the violet and peter held margarets fingers thus linked they straightened themselves and as they rose their faces were very near together and oh most sweet were margarets wonderful eyes while in the eyes of peter there shone a flame for a second they looked at each other and then of a sudden he kissed her on the lips    chapter iv  lovers dear  peter gasped margaretpeter  but peter made no answer only he who had been red of face went white so that the mark of the swordcut across his cheek showed like a scarlet line upon a cloth  peter repeated margaret pulling at her hand which he still held do you know what you have done  it seems that you do so what need is there for me to tell you he muttered  then it was not an accident you really meant it and you are not ashamed  if it was i hope that i may meet with more such accidents  peter leave go of me i am going to tell my father at once  his face brightened  tell him by all means he said he wont mind he told me  peter how dare you add falsehood totoyou know what do you mean to say that my father told you to kiss me and at six oclock in the morning too  he said nothing about kissing but i suppose he meant it he said that i might ask you to marry me  that replied margaret is a very different thing if you had asked me to marry you and after thinking it over for a long while i had answered yes which of course i should not have done then perhaps before we were married you might havewell peter you have begun at the wrong end which is very shameless and wicked of you and i shall never speak to you again  i daresay said peter resignedly all the more reason why i should speak to you while i have the chance no you shant go till you have heard me listen i have been in love with you since you were twelve years old  that must be another falsehood peter or you have gone mad if you had been in love with me for eleven years you would have said so  i wanted to always but your father refused me leave i asked him fifteen months ago but he put me on my word to say nothing  to say nothingyes but he could not make you promise to show nothing  i thought that the one thing meant the other i see now that i have been a fool and i suppose have overstayed my market and he looked so depressed that margaret relented a little  well she said at any rate it was honest and of course i am glad that you were honest  you said just now that i told falsehoodstwice if i am honest how can i tell falsehoods  i dont know why do you ask me riddles let me go and try to forget all this  not till you have answered me outright will you marry me margaret if you wont there will be no need for you to go for i shall go and trouble you no more you know what i am and all about me and i have nothing more to say except that although you may find many finer husbands you wont find one who would love and care for you better i know that you are very beautiful and very rich while i am neither one nor the other and often i have wished to heaven that you were not so beautiful for sometimes that brings trouble on women who are honest and only have one heart to give or so rich either but thus things are and i cannot change them and however poor my chance of hitting the dove i determined to shoot my bolt and make way for the next archer is there any chance at all margaret tell me and put me out of pain for i am not good at so much talking  now margaret began to grow disturbed her wayward assurance departed from her  it is not fitting she murmured and i do not wishi will speak to my father he shall give you your answer  no need to trouble him margaret he has given it already his great desire is that we should marry for he seeks to leave this trade and to live with us in the vale of dedham in essex where he has bought back my fathers land  you are full of strange tidings this morning peter  yes margaret our wheel of life that went so slow turns fast enough today for god above has laid his whip upon the horses of our fate and they begin to gallop whither i know not must they run side by side or separate it is for you to say  peter she said will you not give me a little time  aye margaret ten whole minutes by the clock and then if it is nay all your life for i pack my chest and go it will be said that i feared to be taken for that soldiers death  you are unkind to press me so  nay it is kindest to both of us do you then love some other man  i must confess i do she murmured looking at him out of the corners of her eyes  now peter strong as he was turned faint and in his agitation let go her hand which she lifted the violets still between her fingers considering it as though it were a new thing to her  i have no right to ask you who he is he muttered striving to control himself  nay but peter i will tell you it is my fatherwhat other man should i love  margaret he said in wrath you are fooling me  how so what other man should i loveunless indeed it were yourself  i can bear no more of this play he said mistress margaret i bid you farewell god go with you and he brushed past her  peter she said when he had gone a few yards would you have these violets as a farewell gift  he turned and hesitated  come then and take them  so back he came and with little trembling fingers she began to fasten the flowers to his doublet bending ever nearer as she fastened until her breath played upon his face and her hair brushed his bonnet then it matters not how once more the violets fell to earth and she sighed and her hands fell also and he put his strong arms round her and drew her to him and kissed her again and yet again on the hair and eyes and lips nor did margaret forbid him  at length she thrust him from her and taking him by the hand led him to the seat beneath the elms and bade him sit at one end of it while she sat at the other  peter she whispered i wish to speak with you when i can get my breath peter you think poorly of me do you not nobe silent it is my turn to talk you think that i am heartless and have been playing with you well i only did it to make sure that you really do love me since after thataccident of a while ago when we were picking up the violets i mean you would have been in honour bound to say it would you not well now i am quite sure so i will tell you something i love you many times as well as you love me and have done so for quite as long otherwise should i not have married some other suitor of whom there have been plenty aye and i will tell you this to my sin and shame that once i grew so angry with you because you would not speak or give some little sign that i went near to it but at the last i could not and sent him about his business also peter when i saw you last night facing that swordsman with but a staff and thought that you must die oh then i knew all the truth and my heart was nigh to bursting as had you died it would have burst but now it is all done with and we know each others secret and nothing shall ever part us more till death comes to one or both  thus margaret spoke while he drank in her words as desert sands parched by years of drought drink in the rainand watched her face out of which all mischief and mockery had departed leaving it that of a most beauteous and most earnest woman to whom a sense of the weight of life with its mingled joys and sorrows had come home suddenly when she had finished this silent man to whom even his great happiness brought few words said only  god has been very good to us let us thank god  so they did then even there seated side by side upon the bench because the grass was too wet for them to kneel on praying in their simple childlike faith that the power which had brought them together and taught them to love each other would bless them in that love and protect them from all harms enemies and evils through many a long year of life  their prayer finished they sat together on the seat now talking and now silent in their joy while all too fast the time wore on at lengthit was after one of these spells of blissful silencea change came over them such a change as falls upon some peaceful scene when unexpected and complete a black stormcloud sweeps across the sun and in place of its warm light pours down gloom full of the promise of tempest and of rain apprehension got a hold of them they were both afraid of what they could not guess  come she said it is time to go in my father will miss us  so without more words or endearments they rose and walked side by side out of the shelter of the elms into the open garden their heads were bent for they were lost in thought and thus it came about that margaret saw her feet pass suddenly into the shadow of a man and looking up perceived standing in front of her grave alert amused none other than the señor daguilar she uttered a little stifled scream while peter with the impulse that causes a brave and startled hound to rush at that which frightens it gave a leap forward towards the spaniard  mother of god do you take me for a thief he asked in a laughing voice as he stepped to one side to avoid him  your pardon said peter shaking himself together but you surprised us appearing so suddenly where we never thought to see you  any more than i thought to see you here for this seems a strange place to linger on so cold a morning and he looked at them again with his curious mocking eyes that appeared to read the secret of their souls while they grew red as roses beneath his scrutiny permit me to explain he went on i came here thus early on your service to warn you master peter not to go abroad today since a writ is out for your arrest and as yet i have had no time to quash it by friendly settlement well as it chanced i met that handsome lady who was with you yesterday returning from her marketinga friendly soulshe says she is your cousin she brought me to the house and having learned that your father whom i wished to see was at his prayers good man in the old chapel led me to its door and left me to seek him i entered but could not find him so having waited a while strayed into this garden through the open door purposing to walk here till some one should appear and you see i have been fortunate beyond my expectations or deserts  so said peter shortly for the mans manner and elaborated explanations filled him with disgust let us seek master castell that he may hear the story  and we thank you much for coming to warn us murmured margaret i will go find my father and she slipped past him towards the door  daguilar watched her enter it then turned to peter and said  you english are a hardy folk who take the spring air so early well in such company i would do the same truly she is a beauteous maiden i have some experience of the sex but never do i remember one so fair  my cousin is well enough answered peter coldly for this spaniards very evident admiration of margaret did not please him  yes answered daguilar taking no notice of his tone she is well enough to fill the place not of a merchants daughter but of a great ladya countess reigning over towns and lands or a queen even the royal robes and ornaments would become that carriage and that brow  my cousin seeks no such state who is happy in her quiet lot answered peter again then added quickly see here comes master castell seeking you  daguilar advanced and greeted the merchant courteously noticing as he did so that notwithstanding his efforts to appear unconcerned castell seemed ill at ease  i am an early visitor he said but i knew that you business folk rise with the lark and i wished to catch our friend here before he went out and he repeated to him the reason of his coming  i thank you señor answered castell you are very good to me and mine i am sorry that you have been kept waiting they tell me that you looked for me in the chapel but i was not there who had already left it for my office  so i found it is a quaint place that old chapel of yours and while i waited i went to the altar and told my beads there which i had no time to do before i left my lodgings  castell started almost imperceptibly and glanced at daguilar with his quick eyes then turned the subject and asked if he would not breakfast with them he declined however saying that he must be about their business and his own then promptly proposed that he should come to supper on the following night that wassundayand make report how things had gone a suggestion that castell could not but accept  so he bowed and smiled himself out of the house and walked thoughtfully into holborn for it had pleased him to pay this visit on foot and unattended at the corner whom should he meet again but the tall fairhaired betty returning from some errand which she had found it convenient to fulfil just then  what he said you once more the saints are very kind to me this morning come señora walk a little way with me for i would ask you a few questions  betty hesitated then gave way it was seldom that she found the chance of walking through holborn with such a noblelooking cavalier  never look at your workingdress he said  with such a shape what matters the robe that covers ita compliment at which betty blushed for she was proud of her fine figure  would you like a mantilla of real spanish lace for your head and shoulders well you shall have one that i brought from spain with me for i know no other lady in the land whom it would become better but mistress betty you told me wrong about your master i went to the chapel and he was not there  he was there señor she answered eager to set herself right with this most agreeable and discriminating foreigner for i saw him go in a moment before and he did not come out again  then señora where could he have hidden himself has the place a crypt  none that i have heard of but she added there is a kind of little room behind the altar  indeed how do you know that i saw no room  because one day i heard a voice behind the tapestry señor and lifting it saw a sliding door left open and master castell kneeling before a table and saying his prayers aloud  how strange and what was there on the table  only a queershaped box of wood like a little house and two candlesticks and some rolls of parchment but i forgot señor i promised master castell to say nothing about that place for he turned and saw me and came at me like a watchdog out of its kennel you wont say that i told you will you señor  not i your good masters private cupboard does not interest me now i want to know something more why is that beautiful cousin of yours not married has she no suitors  suitors señor yes plenty of them but she sends them all about their business and seems to have no mind that way  perhaps she is in love with her cousin that longlegged strongarmed woodenheaded master brome  oh no señor i dont think so no lady could be in love with himhe is too stern and silent  i agree with you señora then perhaps he is in love with her  betty shook her head and replied  peter brome doesnt think anything of women señor at least he never speaks to or of them  which shows that probably he thinks about them all the more well well it is no affair of ours is it only i am glad to hear that there is nothing between them since your mistress ought to marry high and be a great lady not a mere merchants wife  yes señor though peter brome is not a merchant at least by birth he is highborn and should be sir peter brome if his father had not fought on the wrong side and sold his land he is a soldier and a very brave one they say as all might see last night  no doubt and perhaps would make a great captain if he had the chance with his stern face and silent tongue but señora betty say how comes it that being so handsome and he bowed you are not married either i am sure it can be from no lack of suitors  again betty foolish girl flushed with pleasure at the compliment  you are right señor she answered i have plenty of them but i am like my cousinthey do not please me although my father lost his fortune i come of good blood and i suppose that is why i do not care for these lowborn men and would rather remain as i am than marry one of them  you are quite right said daguilar in his sympathetic voice do not stain your blood marry in your own class or not at all which indeed should not be difficult for one so beautiful and charming and he looked into her large eyes with tender admiration  this quality indeed soon began to demonstrate itself so actively for they were now in the fields where few people wandered that betty who although vain was proud and upright thought it wise to recollect that she must be turning homewards so in spite of his protests she left him and departed walking upon air  how splendid and handsome this foreign gentleman was she thought to herself really a great cavalier and surely he admired her truly why should he not such things had often been many a rich lady whom she knew was not half so handsome or so well born as herself and would make him a worse wifethat is and the thought chilled her somewhatif he were not already married  from all of which it will be seen that daguilar had quickly succeeded in the plan which only presented itself to him a few hours before betty was already half in love with him not that he had any desire to possess this beautiful but foolish womans heart who saw in her only a useful tool a steppingstone by means of which he might draw near to margaret  for with margaret it may be said at once he was quite in love at the sight of her sweet yet imperial beauty as he saw her first dishevelled angry frightened in the crowd outside the kings banquetinghall his southern blood had taken sudden fire finished voluptuary though he was the sensation he experienced then was quite new to him he longed for this woman as he had never longed for any other and what is more he desired to make her his wife why not although there was a flaw in it his rank was high and therefore she was beneath him but for this her loveliness would atone and she had wit and learning enough to fill any place that he could give her also great as was his wealth his wanton spendthrift way of life had brought him many debts and she was the only child of one of the richest merchants in england whose dower doubtless would be a fortune that many a royal princess might envy why not again he would turn inez and those others adriftat any rate for a whileand make her mistress of his palace there in granada instantly as is often the fashion of those who have eastern blood in their veins daguilar had made up his mind yes before he left her fathers table on the previous night he would marry margaret and no other woman  yet at once he had seen many difficulties in his path to begin with he mistrusted him of peter that strong quiet man who could kill a great armed knave with his stick and at a word call half london to his side peter he was sure being human must be in love with margaret and he was a rival to be feared well if margaret had no thoughts of peter this mattered nothing and if she hadand what were they doing together in the garden that morningpeter must be got rid of that was all it was easy enough if he chose to adopt certain means there were many of those spanish fellows who would not mind sticking a knife into his back in the dark  but sinful as he was at such steps his conscience halted whatever daguilar had done he had never caused a man to be actually murdered he who was a bigot who atoned for his misdoings by periods of remorse and prayer in which he placed his purse and talents at the service of the church as he was doing at this moment no murder must not be thought of for how could any absolution wash him clean of that stain but there were other ways for instance had not this peter in selfdefence it is true killed one of the servants of an ambassador of spain perhaps however it would not be necessary to make use of them it had seemed to him that the lady was not ill pleased with him and after all he had much to offer he would court her fairly and if he were rejected by her or by her father then it would be time enough to act meanwhile he would keep the sword hanging over the head of peter pretending that it was he alone who had prevented it from falling and learn all that he could as to castell and his history  here indeed fortune in the shape of the foolish betty had favoured him without a doubt as he had heard in spain and been sure from the moment that he first saw him castell was still secretly a jew mistress bettys story of the room behind the altar with the ark and the candles and the rolls of the law proved as much at least here was evidence enough to send him to the fires of the inquisition in spain and perhaps to drive him out of england now if john castell the spanish jew should not wish for any reason to give him his daughter in marriage would not a hint and an extract from the commissions of their majesties of spain and the holy father suffice to make him change his mind  thus pondering daguilar regained his lodgings where his first task was to enter in a book all that betty had told him and all that he had observed in the house of john castell    chapter v  castells secret  in john castells house it was the habit as in most others in those days for his dependents clerks and shopmen to eat their morning and midday meals with him in the hall seated at two lower tables all of them save betty his daughters cousin and companion who sat with them at the upper board this morning bettys place was empty and presently castell lifting his eyes for he was lost in thought noted it and asked where she might bea question that neither margaret nor peter could answer  one of the servants at the lower table howeverit was that man who had been sent to follow daguilar on the previous nightsaid that as he came down holborn a while before he had seen her walking with the spanish don a saying at which his master looked grave  just as they were finishing their meal a very silent one for none of them seemed to have anything to say and after the servants had left the hall betty arrived flushed as though with running  where have you been that you are so late asked castell  to seek the linen for the new sheets but it was not ready she answered glibly the mercer kept you waiting long remarked castell quietly did you meet any one  only the folk in the street  i will ask you no more questions lest i should cause you to lie and bring you into sin said castell sternly girl how far did you walk with the señor daguilar and what was your business with him  now betty knew that she had been seen and that it was useless to deny the truth  only a little way she answered and that because he prayed me to show him his path  listen betty went on castell taking no notice of her words you are old enough to guard yourself therefore as to your walking abroad with gallants who can mean you no good i say nothing but know thisno one who has knowledge of the matters of my house and he looked at her keenly shall mix with any spaniard if you are found alone with this señor any more that hour i have done with you and you never pass my door again nay no words take your food and eat it elsewhere  so she departed half weeping but very angry for betty was strong and obstinate by nature when she had gone margaret who was fond of her cousin tried to say some words on her behalf but her father stopped her  pshaw he said i know the girl she is vain as a peacock and remembering her gentle birth and good looks seeks to marry above her station while for some purpose of his ownan ill one ill warrant that spaniard plays upon her weakness which if it be not curbed may bring trouble on us all now enough of betty dene i must to my work  sir said peter speaking for the first time we would have a private word with you  a private word he said looking up anxiously well speak on no this place is not private i think its walls have ears follow me and he led the way into the old chapel whereof when they had all passed it he bolted the door now he said what is it  sir answered peter standing before him having your leave at last i asked your daughter in marriage this morning  at least you lose no time friend peter unless you had called her from her bed and made your offer through the door you could not have done it quicker well well you ever were a man of deeds not words and what says my margaret  an hour ago she said she was content answered peter  a cautious man also went on castell with a twinkle in his eye who remembers that women have been known to change their minds within an hour after such long thought what say you now margaret  that i am angry with peter she answered stamping her small foot for if he does not trust me for an hour how can he trust me for his life and mine  nay margaret you do not understand me said peter i wished not to bind you that is all in case  now you are saying it again she broke in vexed and yet amused do so a third time and i will you at your word  it seems best that i should remain silent speak you said peter humbly  aye for truly you are a master of silence as i should know if any do replied margaret bethinking her of the weary months and years of waiting well i will answer for youfather peter was right i am content to marry him though to do so will be to enter the order of the silent brothers yes i am content not for himself indeed who has so many faults but for myself who chance to love him and she smiled sweetly enough  do not jest on such matters margaret  why not father peter is solemn enough for both of uslook at him let us laugh while we may for who knows when tears may come  a good saying answered castell with a sigh so you two have plighted your troth and my children i am glad of it for who knows when those tears of which margaret spoke may come and then you can wipe away each others take now her hand peter and swear by the rood that symbol which you worshiphere peter glanced at him but he went onswear both of you that come what may together or separate through good report or evil report through poverty or wealth through peace or persecutions through temptation or through blood through every good or ill that can befall you in this world of bittersweet you will remain faithful to your troth until you be wed and after you are wed faithful to each other till death do part you  these words he spoke to them in a voice that was earnest almost to passion searching their faces the while with his quick eyes as though he would read their very hearts his mood crept from him to them once again they felt something of that fear which had fallen on them in the garden when they passed into the shadow of the spaniard very solemnly then and with little of true lovers joy did they take each others hands and swear by the cross and him who hung on it that through these things and all others they could not foretell they would if need were be faithful to the death  and beyond it also added peter while margaret bowed her stately head in sweet assent  children said castell you will be richfew richer in this landthough mayhap it would be wise that you should not show all your wealth at once or ape the place of a great house lest envy should fall upon your heads and crush you be content to wait and rank will find you in its season or if not you your children peter i tell you now lest i should forget it that the list of all my moneys and other possessions in chattels or lands or ships or merchandise is buried beneath the floor of my office just under where my chair stands lift the boards and dig away a foot of rubbish and you will find a stone trap and below an iron box with the deeds inventories and some very precious jewels also if by any mischance that box should be lost duplicates of nearly all these papers are in the hands of my good friend and partner in our inland british trade simon levett whom you know remember my words both of you  father broke in margaret in an anxious voice why do you speak of the future thusi mean as though you had no share in it do you fear aught  yes daughter much or rather i expect i do not fear who am prepared and desire to meet all things as they come you have sworn that oath have you not and you will keep it will you not  aye they answered with one breath  then prepare you to feel the weight of the first of those trials whereof it speaks for i will no longer hold back the truth from you children i whom for all these years you have thought of your own faith am a jew as my forefathers were before me back to the days of abraham  the effect of this declaration upon its hearers was remarkable peters jaw dropped and for the second time that day his face went white while margaret sank down into a chair that stood near by and stared at him helplessly in those times it was a very terrible thing to be a jew castell looked from one to the other and feeling the insult of their silence grew angry  what he exclaimed in a bitter voice are you like all the others do you scorn me also because i am of a race more ancient and honourable than those of any of your mushroom lords and kings you know my life say what have i done wrong have i caught christian children and crucified them to death have i defrauded my neighbour or oppressed the poor have i mocked your symbol of the host have i conspired against the rulers of this land have i been a false friend or a cruel father you shake your heads then why do you stare at me as though i were a thing accursed and unclean have i not a right to the faith of my fathers may i not worship god in my own fashion and he looked at peter a challenge in his eyes sir answered peter without a doubt you may or so it seems to me but then why for all these years have you appeared to worship him in ours  at this blunt question so characteristic of the speaker castell seemed to shrink like a pinpricked bladder or some bold fighter who has suddenly received a swordthrust in his vitals all courage went out of the man his fiery eyes grew tame he appeared to become visibly smaller and to put on something of the air of those mendicants of his own race who whine out their woes and beg alms of the passerby when next he spoke it was as a suppliant for merciful judgment at the hands of his own child and her lover  judge me not harshly he said think what it is to be a jewan outcast a thing that the lowest may spurn and spit at one beyond the law one who can be hunted from land to land like a mad wolf and tortured to death when caught for the sport of gentle christians who first have stripped him of his gains and very garments and then think what it means to escape all these woes and terrors and by the doffing of a bonnet and the mumbling of certain prayers with the lips in public to find sanctuary peace and protection within the walls of mother church and thus fostered to grow rich and great  he paused as though for a reply but as they did not speak went on  moreover as a child i was baptized into your church but my heart like that of my father remained with the jews and where the heart goes the feet follow  that makes it worse said peter as though speaking to himself  my father taught me thus castell went on as though pleading his case before a court of law  we must answer for our own sins said peter again  then at length castell took fire  you young folk who as yet know little of the terrors of the world reproach me with cold looks and colder words he said but i wonder should you ever come to such a pass as mine whether you will find the heart to meet it half as bravely why do you think that i have told you this secret that i might have kept from you as i kept it from your mother margaret i say because it is a part of my penance for the sin which i have sinned aye i know well that my god is a jealous god and that this sin will fall back on my head and that i shall pay its price to the last groat though when and how the blow will strike me i know not go you peter or you margaret and denounce me if you will your priests will speak well of you for the deed and open to you a shorter road to heaven and i shall not blame you nor lessen your wealth by a single golden noble  do not speak so madly sir said peter these matters are between you and god what have we to do with them and who made us judges over you we only pray that your fears may come to nothing and that you may reach your grave in peace and honour  i thank you for your generous words which are such as befit your nature said castell gently but what says margaret  i father she answered wildly oh i have nothing to say he is right it is between you and god but it is hard that i must lose my love so soon peter looked up and castell answered  lose him why what did he swear but now  i care not what he swore but how can i ask him who is of noble christian birth to marry the daughter of a jew who all his life has passed himself off as a worshipper of that jesus whom he denies  now peter held up his hand  have done with such talk he said were your father judas himself what is that to you and me you are mine and i am yours till death part us nor shall the faith of another man stand between us for an hour sir we thank you for your confidence and of this be sure that although it makes us sorrowful we do not love or honour you the less because now we know the truth  margaret rose from her chair looked a while at her father then with a sob threw herself suddenly upon his breast  forgive me if i spoke bitterly she said who not knowing that i was half a jewess have been taught to hate their race what is it to me of what faith you are who think of you only as my dearest father  why weep then asked castell stroking her hair tenderly  because you are in danger or so you say and if anything happened to youoh what shall i do then  accept it as the will of god and bear the blow bravely as i hope to do should it fall he answered and kissing her left the chapel  it seems that joy and trouble go hand in hand said margaret looking up presently  yes sweet they were ever twins but provided we have our share of the first do not let us quarrel with the second a pest on the priests and all their bigotry say i christ sought to convert the jews not to kill them and for my part i can honour the man who clings to his own faith aye and forgive him because they forced him to feign to belong to ours pray then that neither of us may live to commit a greater sin and that we may soon be wed and dwell in peace away from london where we can shelter him  i doi do she answered drawing close to peter and soon they forgot their fears and doubts in each others arms  on the following morning that of sunday peter margaret and betty went together to mass at st pauls church but castell said that he was ill and did not come indeed now that his conscience was stirred as to the double life he had led so long he purposed if he could avoid it to worship in a christian church no more therefore he said that he was sick and they knowing that this sickness was of the heart answered nothing but privately they wondered what he would do who could not always remain sick since not to go to church and partake of its sacraments was to be published as a heretic  but if he did not accompany them himself castell without their knowledge sent two of his stoutest servants bidding these keep near to them and see that they came home safe  now when they left the church peter saw two spaniards whose faces he thought he knew who seemed to be watching them but as he lost sight of them presently in the throng said nothing their shortest way home ran across some fields and gardens where there were few houses this lane then they followed talking earnestly to each other and noting nothing till betty behind called out to them to beware then peter looked up and saw the two spaniards scrambling through a gap in the fence not six paces ahead of them saw also that they laid their hands upon their swordhilts  let us pass them boldly he muttered to margaret ill not turn my back on a brace of spaniards but he also laid his hand upon the hilt of the sword he wore beneath his cloak and bade her get behind him  thus then they came face to face now the spaniards who were evillooking fellows bowed courteously enough and asked if he were not master peter brome they spoke in spanish but like margaret peter knew this tongue if not too well having been taught it as a child and practised it much since he came into the service of john castell who used it largely in his trade  yes he answered what is your business with me  we have a message for you señor from a certain comrade of ours one andrew a scotchman whom you met a few nights ago replied the spokesman of the pair he is dead but still he sends his message and it is that we should ask you to join him at once now all of us brothers have sworn to deliver that message and to see that you keep the tryst if some of us should chance to fail then others will meet you with the message until you keep that tryst  you mean that you wish to murder me said peter setting his mouth and drawing the sword from beneath his cloak well come on cowards and we will see whom andrew gets for company in hell today run back margaret and bettyrun and he tore off his cloak and threw it over his left arm  so for a moment they stood for he looked fierce and ill to deal with then just as they began to feint in front of him there came a rush of feet and on either side of peter appeared the two stout servingmen also sword in hand  i am glad of your company he said catching sight of them out of the corners of his eyes now señors cutthroats do you still wish to deliver that message  the answer of the spaniards who saw themselves thus unexpectedly outmatched was to turn and run whereon one of the servingmen picking up a big stone that lay in the path hurled it after them with all his force it struck the hindmost spaniard full in the back and so heavy was the blow that he fell on to his face in the mud whence he rose and limped away cursing them with strange spanish oaths and vowing vengeance  now said peter i think that we may go home in safety for no more messengers will come from andrew today  no gasped margaret not today but tomorrow or the next day they will come and oh how will it end  that god knows alone answered peter gravely as he sheathed his sword  when the story of this attempt was told to castell he seemed much disturbed  it is clear that they have a bloodfeud against you on account of that scotchman whom you killed in selfdefence he said anxiously also these spaniards are very revengeful nor have they forgiven you for calling the english to your aid against them peter i fear that if you go abroad they will murder you  well i cannot stay indoors always like a rat in a drain said peter crossly so what is to be done appeal to the law  no for you have just broken the law by killing a man i think you had best go away for a while till this storm blows over  go away peter go away broke in margaret dismayed  yes answered her father listen daughter you cannot be married at once it is not seemly moreover notice must be given and arrangement made a month hence will be soon enough and that is not long for you to wait who only became affianced yesterday also until you are wed no word must be said to any one of this betrothal of yours lest those spaniards should lay their feud at your door also and work you some mischief let none know of it i charge you and in company be distant to each other as though there were nothing between you  as you will sir replied peter but for my part i do not like all these hidings of the truth which ever lead to future trouble i say let me bide here and take my chance and let us be wed as soon as may be  that your wife may be made a widow before the week is out or the house burnt about our ears by these rascals and their following no no peter walk softly that you may walk safely we will hear the report of the spaniard daguilar and afterwards take counsel    chapter vi  farewell  daguilar came to supper that night as he had promised and this time not on foot and unattended but with pomp and circumstance as befitted a great lord first appeared two running footmen to clear the way then followed daguilar mounted on a fine white horse and splendidly apparelled in a velvet cloak and a hat with nodding ostrich plumes while after him rode four menatarms in his livery  we asked one guest or rather he asked himself and we have got seven to say nothing of their horses grumbled castell watching their approach from an upper window well we must make the best of it peter go see that man and beast are fed and fully that they may not grumble at our hospitality the guard can eat in the little hall with our own folk margaret put on your richest robe and your jewels those which you wore when i took you to that city feast last summer we will show these fine foreign birds that we london merchants have brave feathers also  peter hesitated misdoubting him of the wisdom of this display who if he could have his will would have sent the spaniards following to the tavern and received him in sober garments to a simple meal  but castell who seemed somewhat disturbed that night who loved moreover to show his wealth at times after the fashion of a jew began to fume and ask if he must go himself so the end of it was that peter went shaking his head while urged to it by her father margaret departed also to array herself  a few minutes later castell in his costliest feastday robe greeted daguilar in the antehall and the two of them being alone asked him how matters went as regarded de ayala and the man who had been killed  well and ill answered daguilar doctor de puebla with whom i hoped to deal has left london in a huff for he says that there is not room for two spanish ambassadors at court so i had to fall back upon de ayala after all indeed twice have i seen that exalted priest upon the subject of the welldeserved death of his villainous servant and after much difficulty for having lost several men in such brawls he thought his honour touched he took the fifty gold angelsto be transmitted to the fellows family of course or so he saidand gave a receipt here it is and he handed a paper to castell who read it carefully  it was to the effect that peter brome having paid a sum of fifty angels to the relatives of andrew pherson a servant of the spanish ambassador which andrew the said peter had killed in a brawl the said ambassador undertook not to prosecute or otherwise molest the said peter on account of the manslaughter which he had committed  but no money has been paid said castell  indeed yes i paid it de ayala gives no receipts against promises  i thank you for your courtesy señor you shall have the gold before you leave this house few would have trusted a stranger thus far  daguilar waved his hand  make no mention of such a trifle i would ask you to accept it as a token of my regard for your family only that would be to affront so wealthy a man but listen i have more to say you are or rather your kinsman peter is still in the wood de ayala has pardoned him but there remains the king of england whose law he has broken well this day i have seen the king who by the way talked of you as a worthy man saying that he had always thought only a jew could be so wealthy and that he knew you were not since you had been reported to him as a good son of the church and he paused looking at castell  i fear his grace magnifies my wealth which is but small answered castell coolly leaving the rest of his speech unnoticed but what said his grace  i showed him de ayalas receipt and he answered that if his excellency was satisfied he was satisfied and for his part would not order any process to issue but he bade me tell you and peter brome that if he caused more tumult in his streets whatever the provocation and especially if that tumult were between english and spaniards he would hang him at once with trial or without it all of which he said very angrily for the last thing which his highness desires just now is any noise between spain and england  that is bad answered castell for this very morning there was near to being such a tumult and he told the story of how the two spaniards had waylaid peter and one of them been knocked down by the servingman with a stone at this news daguilar shook his head  then that is just where the trouble lies he exclaimed i know it from my people who keep me well informed that all those servants of de ayala and there are more than twenty of them have sworn an oath by the virgin of seville that before they leave this land they will have your kinsmans blood in payment for that of andrew pherson who although a scotchman was their officer and a brave man whom they loved much now if they attack him as they will there must be a brawl for peter fights well and if there is a brawl though peter and the english get the best of it as very likely they may peter will certainly be hanged for so the king has promised  before they leave the land when do they leave it  de ayala sails within a month and his folk with him for his coambassador the doctor de puebla will bear with him no more and has written from the country house where he is sulking that one of them must go  then i think it is best señor that peter should travel for a month  friend castell you are wise i think so too and i counsel you arrange it at once hush here comes the lady your daughter  as he spoke margaret appeared descending the broad oak stairs which led into the anteroom holding a lamp in her hand she was in full light whereas the two men stood in the shadow she wore a lowcut dress of crimson velvet embroidered about the bodice with dead gold which enhanced the dazzling whiteness of her shapely neck and bosom round her throat hung a string of great pearls and on her head was a net of gold studded with smaller pearls from beneath which her glorious chestnutblack hair flowed down in rippling waves almost to her knees having her fathers bidding so to do she had adorned herself thus that she might look her fairest not in the eyes of their guest but in those of her newaffianced husband so fair was she seen thus that daguilar the artist the adorer of loveliness caught his breath and shivered at the sight of her  by the eleven thousand virgins he said your daughter is more beautiful than all of them put together she should be crowned a queen and bewitch the world  nay nay señor answered castell hurriedly let her remain humble and honest and bewitch her husband  so i should say if i were the husband he muttered then stepped forward bowing to meet her  now the light of the silver lamp she held on high flowed over the two of them daguilar and margaret and certainly they seemed a wellmatched pair both were tall and cast by nature in a rich and splendid mould both had that high air of breeding which comes with ancient bloodfor what bloods are more ancient than those of the jew and the easternboth were slow and stately of movement lowvoiced and dignified of speech castell noted it and was afraid he knew not of what  peter entering the room by another door clad only in his grey clothes for he would not put on gay garments for the spaniard noted it also and with the quick instinct of love knew this magnificent foreigner for a rival and an enemy but he was not afraid only jealous and angry indeed nothing would have pleased him better then than that the spaniard should have struck him in the face so that within five minutes it might be shown which of them was the better man it must come to this he felt and very glad would he have been if it could come at the beginning and not at the end so that one or the other of them might be saved much trouble then he remembered that he had promised to say or show nothing of how things stood between him and margaret and coming forward he greeted daguilar quietly but coldly telling him that his horses had been stabled and his retinue accommodated  the spaniard thanked him very heartily and they passed in to supper it was a strange meal for all four of them yet outwardly pleasant enough forgetting his cares castell drank gaily and began to talk of the many changes which he had seen in his life and of the rise and fall of kings daguilar talked also of the spanish wars and policy for in the first he had seen much service and of the other he knew every turn it was easy to see that he was one of those who mixed with courts and had the ear of ministers and majesty margaret also being keenwitted and anxious to learn of the great world that lay beyond holborn and london town asked questions seeking to know amongst other things what were the true characters of ferdinand king of aragon and isabella his wife the famous queen  i will tell you in few words señora ferdinand is the most ambitious man in europe false also if it serves his purpose he lives for self and gainthat money and power these are his gods for he has no true religion he is not clever but being very cunning he will succeed and leave a famous name behind him  an ugly picture said margaret and what of his queen  she answered daguilar is a great woman who knows how to use the temper of her time and so attain her ends to the world she shows a tender heart but beneath it lies hid an iron resolution  what are those ends asked margaret again  to bring all spain under her rule utterly to crush the moors and take their territories to make the church of christ triumphant upon earth to stamp out heresy to convert or destroy the jews he added slowly and as he spoke the words peter watching saw his eyes open and glitter like a snakesto bring their bodies to the purifying flames and their vast wealth into her treasury and thus earn the praise of the faithful upon earth and for herself a throne in heaven  for a while there was silence after this speech then margaret said boldly  if heavenly thrones are built of human blood and tears what stone and mortar do they use in hell i wonder then without pausing for an answer she rose saying that she was weary curtseyed to daguilar her father and peter each in turn and left the hall  when she had gone the talk flagged and presently daguilar asked for his men and horses and departed also saying as he went  friend castell you will repeat my news to your good kinsman here i pray for all your sakes that he may bow his head to what cannot be helped and thus keep it safe upon his shoulders  what meant the man asked peter when the sound of the horses hoofs had died away  castell told him of what had passed between him and daguilar before supper and showed him de ayalas receipt adding in a vexed voice  i have forgotten to repay him the gold it shall be sent tomorrow  have no fear he will come for it answered peter coldly now if i have my way i will take the risk of these spaniards swords and king henrys rope and bide here  that you must not do said castell earnestly for my sake and margarets if not for yours would you make her a widow before she is a wife listen it is my wish that you travel down to essex to take delivery of your fathers land in the vale of dedham and see to the repairing of the mansion house which i am told needs it much then when these spaniards are gone you can return and at once be married say one short month hence  will not you and margaret come with me to dedham  castell shook his head  it is not possible i must wind up my affairs and margaret cannot go with you alone moreover there is no place for her to lodge i will keep her here till you return  yes sir but will you keep her safe the cozening words of spaniards are sometimes more deadly than their swords  i think that margaret has a medicine against all such arts answered her father with a little smile and left him  on the morrow when castell told margaret that her lover must leave her for a while that nightfor this peter would not do himselfshe prayed him even with tears that he would not send him so far from her or that they might all go together but he reasoned with her kindly showing her that the latter was impossible and that if peter did not go at once it was probable that peter would soon be dead whereas if he went there would be but one short month of waiting till the spaniards had sailed after which they might be married and live in peace and safety  so she came to see that this was best and wisest and gave way but oh heavy were those hours and sore was their parting essex was no far journey and to enter into lands which only two days before peter believed he had lost for ever no sad errand while the promise that at the end of a single month he should return to claim his bride hung before them like a star yet they were sadhearted both of them and that star seemed very far away  margaret was afraid lest peter might be waylaid upon the road but he laughed at her saying that her father was sending six stout men with him as an escort and thus companioned he feared no spaniards peter for his part was afraid lest daguilar might make love to her while he was away but now she laughed at him saying that all her heart was his and that she had none to give to daguilar or any other man moreover that england was a free land in which women who were no kings wards could not be led whither they did not wish to go so it seemed that they had naught to fear save the daily chance of life and death and yet they were afraid  dear love said margaret to him after she had thought a while our road looks straight and easy and yet there may be pitfalls in it that we cannot guess therefore you must swear one thing to me that whatever you shall hear or whatever may happen you will never doubt me as i shall never doubt you if for instance you should be told that i have discarded you and given myself to some other husband if even you should believe that you see it signed by my hand or if you think that you hear it told to you by my voicestill i say believe it not  how could such a thing be asked peter anxiously  i do not suppose that it could be i only paint the worst that might happen as a lesson for us both heretofore my life has been calm as a summers day but who knows when winter storms may rise and often i have thought that i was born to know wind and rain and lightning as well as peace and sunshine remember that my father is a jew and that to the jews and their children terrible things chance at times why all this wealth might vanish in an hour and you might find me in a prison or clad in rags begging my bread now do you swear and she held towards him the gold crucifix that hung upon her bosom  aye he said i swear it by this holy token and by your lips and he kissed first the cross and then her mouth adding shall i ask the same oath of you  she laughed  if you will but it is not needful peter i think that i know you too well i think that your heart will never stir even if i be dead and you married to another and yet men are men and women have wiles so i will swear this that should you slip perchance and i live to learn it i will try not to judge you harshly and again she laughed she who was so certain of her empire over this mans heart and body  thank you said peter but for my part i will try to stand straight upon my feet so should any tales be brought to you of me sift them well i pray you  then forgetting their doubts and dreads they talked of their marriage which they fixed for that day month and of how they would dwell happily in dedham vale also margaret who well knew the house named the old hall where they should live for she had stayed there as a child gave him many commands as to the new arrangement of its chambers and its furnishing which as there was money and to spare could be as costly as they willed saying that she would send him down all things by wain so soon as he was ready for them  thus then the hours wore away until at length night came and they took their last meal together the three of them for it was arranged that peter should start at moonrise when none were about to see him go it was not a very happy meal and though they made a brave show of eating but little food passed their lips now the horses were ready and margaret buckled on peters sword and threw his cloak about his shoulders and he having shaken castell by the hand and bade him guard their jewel safely without more words kissed her in farewell and went  taking the silver lamp in her hand she followed him to the anteroom at the door he turned and saw her standing there gazing after him with wide eyes and a strained white face at the sight of her silent pain almost his heart failed him almost he refused to go then he remembered and went  for a while margaret still stood thus until the sound of the horses hoofs had died away indeed then she turned and said  father i know not how it is but it seems to me that when peter and i meet again it will be far off yes far off upon the stormy seabut what sea i know not and without waiting for an answer she climbed the stairs to her chamber and there wept herself to sleep  castell watched her depart then muttered to himself  pray god she is not foresighted like so many of our race and yet why is my own heart so heavy well according to my judgment i have done my best for him and her and for myself i care nothing    chapter vii  news from spain  peter brome was a very quiet man whose voice was not often heard about the place and yet it was strange how dull and different the big old house in holborn seemed without him even the handsome betty with whom he was never on the best of terms since there was much about her of which he disapproved missed him and said so to her cousin who only answered with a sigh for in the bottom of her heart betty both feared and respected peter the fear was of his observant eyes and caustic words which she knew were always words of truth and the respect for the general uprightness of his character especially where her own sex was concerned  in fact as has been hinted some little time before when peter had first come to live with the castells betty thinking him a proper man of gentle birth such a one indeed as she would wish to marry had made advances to him which as he did not seem to notice them became by degrees more and more marked what happened at last they two knew alone but it was something that caused betty to become very angry and to speak of peter to her friends as a coldblooded lout who thought only of work and gain the episode was passing and soon forgotten by the lady in the press of other affairs but the respect remained moreover on one or two occasions when the love of admiration had led her into griefs peter had proved a good friend and what was better a friend who did not talk therefore she wished him back again especially now when something that was more than mere vanity and desire for excitement had taken hold of her and betty found herself being swept off her feet into very deep and doubtful waters  the shopmen and the servants missed him also for to him all disputes were brought for settlement nor provided it had not come about through lack of honesty were any pains too great for him to take to help them in a trouble most of all castell missed him since until peter had gone he did not know how much he had learned to rely upon him both in his business and as a friend as for margaret her life without him was one long empty night  thus it chanced that in such a house any change was welcome and though she liked him little enough margaret was not even displeased when one morning betty told her that the lord daguilar was coming to call on her that day and purposed to bring her a present  i do not seek his presents said margaret indifferently then added but how do you know that betty  the young woman coloured and tossed her head as she answered  i know it cousin because as i was going to visit my old aunt yesterday who lives on the wharf at westminster i met him riding and he called out to me saying that he had a gift for you and one for me also  be careful you do not meet him too often betty when you chance to be visiting your aunt these spaniards are not always overhonest as you may learn to your sorrow  i thank you for your good counsel said betty shortly but i who am older than you know enough of men to be able to guard myself and can keep them at a distance  i am glad of it betty only sometimes i have thought that the distance was scarcely wide enough answered margaret and left the subject for she was thinking of other things  that afternoon when margaret was walking in the garden betty whose face seemed somewhat flushed ran up to her and said that the lord daguilar was waiting in the hall  very good answered margaret i will come go tell my father that he may join us but why are you so disturbed and hurried she added wonderingly  oh answered betty he has brought me a present so fine a presenta mantle of the most wonderful lace that ever i saw and a comb of mottled shell mounted in gold to keep it off the hair he made me wait while he showed me how to put it on and that was why i ran  margaret did not quite see the connection but she answered slowly  perhaps it would have been wiser if you had run first i do not understand why this fine lord brings you presents  but he has brought one for you also cousin although he would not say what it was  that i understand still less go tell my father that the señor daguilar awaits him  then she went into the hall and found daguilar looking at an illuminated book of hours in which she had been reading that was written in spanish in one column and in latin in that opposite he greeted her in his usual graceful way that where margaret was concerned was easy and wellbred without being bold and said at once  so you read spanish señora  a little not very well i fear  and latin also  a little again i have been taught that tongue by studying them thus i try to improve myself in both  i perceive that you are learned as you are beautiful and he bowed courteously  i thank you señor but i lay claim to neither grace  what need is there to claim that which is evident replied daguilar then added but i forgot i have brought you a present if you will be pleased to accept it or rather i bring you what is your own or at the least your fathers i bargained with his excellency don de ayala pointing out that fifty gold angels were too much to pay for that dead rogue of his but he would give me nothing back in money since with gold he never parts yet i won some change from him and it stands without your door it is a spanish jennet of the true moorish blood which hundreds of years ago that people brought with them from the east he needs it no longer as he returns to spain and it is trained to bear a lady margaret did not know what to answer but fortunately at that moment her father appeared and to him daguilar repeated his tale adding that he had heard his daughter say that the horse she rode had fallen with her so that she could use it no more   now castell did not wish to accept this gift for such he felt it to be but daguilar assured him that if he did not he must sell it and return him the price in money as it did not belong to him so there being no help for it he thanked him in his daughters name and his own and they went into the stableyard whither it had been taken to look at this horse  the moment that castell saw it he knew that it was a creature of great value pure white in colour with a long low body small head gentle eyes round hoofs and flowing mane and tail such a horse indeed as a queen might have ridden now again he was confused being sure that this beast had never been given back as a luckpenny since it would have fetched more than the fifty angels on the market moreover it was harnessed with a womans saddle and bridle of the most beautifully worked red cordova leather to which were attached a silver bit and stirrup but daguilar smiled and vowed that things were as he had told them so there was nothing more to be said margaret too was so pleased with the mare which she longed to ride that she forgot her scruples and tried to believe that this was so noting her delight which she could not conceal as she patted the beautiful beast daguilar said  now i will ask one thing in return for the bargain that i have madethat i may see you mount this horse for the first time you told me that you and your father were wont to go out together in the morning have i your leave sir and he turned to castell to ride with you before breakfast say at seven of the clock for i would show the lady your daughter how she should manage a horse of this blood which is something of a trick  if you will answered castellthat is if the weather is fine for the offer was made so courteously that it could scarcely be refused  daguilar bowed and they reentered the house talking of other matters when they were in the hall again he asked whether their kinsman peter had reached his destination safely adding  i pray you do not tell me where it is for i wish to be able to put my hand upon my heart and swear to all concerned and especially to certain fellows who are still seeking for him that i know nothing of his hidingplace  castell answered that he had since but a few minutes before a letter had come from him announcing his safe arrival tidings at which margaret looked up then remembering her promise said that she was glad to hear of it as the roads were none too safe and spoke indifferently of something else daguilar added that he also was glad then rising took his leave till seven on the morrow  when he had gone castell gave margaret a letter addressed to her in peters stiff upright hand which she read eagerly it began and ended with sweet words but like his speech was brief and to the point saying only that he had accomplished his journey without adventure and was very glad to find himself again in the old house where he was born and amongst familiar fields and faces on the morrow he was to see the tradesmen as to alterations and repairs which were much needed even the moat being choked with mud and weeds his last sentence was i much mistrust me of that fine spaniard and i am jealous to think that he should be near to you while i am far away beware of him i saybeware of him may the mother of god and all the saints have you in their keeping your most true affianced lover  this letter margaret answered before she slept for the messenger was to return at dawn telling peter amongst other things of the gift which daguilar had brought her and how she and her father were forced to accept it but bidding him not be jealous since although the gift was welcome she liked the giver little who did but count the hours till her true lover should come back again and take her to himself  next morning she was up early clothed in her ridingdress for the day was very fine and by seven oclock daguilar appeared mounted on a great horse then the spanish jennet was brought out and deftly he lifted her to the saddle showing her how she must pull but lightly on the reins and urge or check her steed with her voice alone using no whip or spur  a perfect beast it proved to be indeed gentle as a lamb and easy yet very spirited and swift  daguilar was a pleasant cavalier also talking of many things grave and gay until at length even castell forgot his thoughts and grew cheerful as they cantered forward through the fresh spring morning by heath and hill and woodland listening to the singing of the birds and watching the husbandmen at their labour this ride was but the first of several that they took since daguilar knew their hours of exercise even when they changed them and whether they asked him or not joined or met them in such a natural fashion that they could not refuse his company indeed they were much puzzled to know how he came to be so well acquainted with their movements and even with the direction in which they proposed to ride but supposed that he must have it from the grooms although these were commanded to say nothing and always denied having spoken with him that betty should speak of such matters or even find opportunity of doing so never chanced to cross their minds who did not guess that if they rode with daguilar in the morning betty often walked with him in the evening when she was supposed to be at church or sewing or visiting her aunt upon the wharf at westminster but of these walks the foolish girl said nothing for her own reasons  now as they rode together although he remained very courteous and respectful the manner of daguilar towards margaret grew ever more close and intimate thus he began to tell her stories true or false of his past life which seemed to have been strange and eventful enough to hint too of a certain hidden greatness that pertained to him which he did not dare to show and of high ambitions which he had he spoke also of his loneliness and his desire to lose it in the companionship of a kindred heart if he could find one to share his wealth his station and his hopes while all the time his dark eyes fixed on margaret seemed to say the heart i seek is such a one as yours at length at some murmured word or touch she took affright and since she could not avoid him abroad determined to stay at home and much as she loved the sport to ride no more till peter should return so she gave out that she had hurt her knee which made the saddle painful to her and the beautiful spanish mare was left idle in the stable or mounted only by the groom  thus for some days she was rid of daguilar and employed herself in reading and working or in writing long letters to peter who was busy enough at dedham and sent her thence many commissions to fulfil  one afternoon castell was seated in his office deciphering letters which had just reached him the night before his best ship of over two hundred tons burden which was named the margaret after his daughter had come safely into the mouth of the thames from spain that evening she was to reach her berth at gravesend with the tide when castell proposed to go aboard of her to see to the unloading of her cargo this was the last of his ships which remained unsold and it was his plan to reload and victual her at once with goods that were waiting and send her back to the port of seville where his spanish partners in whose name she was already registered had agreed to take her over at a fixed price this done it was only left for him to hand over his business to the merchants who had purchased it in london after which he would be free to depart a very wealthy man and spend the evening of his days at peace in essex with his daughter and her husband as now he so greatly longed to do so soon as they were within the river banks the captain of this ship smith by name had landed the cargomaster with letters and a manifest of cargo bidding him hire a horse and bring them to master castells house in holborn this the man had done safely and it was these letters that castell read  one of them was from his partner bernaldez in seville not in answer to that which he had written on the night of the opening of this historyfor this there had been no timeyet dealing with matters whereof it treated in it was this passage  you will remember what i wrote to you of a certain envoy who has been sent to the court of london who is called daguilar for as our cipher is so secret and it is important that you should be warned i take the risk of writing his name since that letter i have learned more concerning this grandee for such he is although he calls himself plain don daguilar in truth he is the marquis of morella and on one side it is said of royal blood if not on both since he is reported to be the son born out of wedlock of prince carlos of viana the halfbrother of the king the tale runs that carlos the learned and gentle fell in love with a moorish lady of aguilar of high birth and great wealth for she had rich estates at granada and elsewhere and as he might not marry her because of the difference of their rank and faiths lived with her without marriage of which union one son was born before prince carlos died or was poisoned and while he was still a prisoner at morella he gave to or procured for this boy the title of marquis choosing from some fancy the name of morella that place where he had suffered so much also he settled some private lands upon him after the prince died the moorish lady his lover who had secretly become a christian took her son to live at her palace in granada where she died also some ten years ago leaving all her great wealth to him for she never married at this time it is said that his life was in danger for the reason that although he was half a moor too much of the bloodroyal ran in his veins but the marquis was clever and persuaded the king and queen that he had no ambition beyond his pleasures also the church interceded for him since to it he proved himself a faithful son persecuting all heretics especially the jews and even moors although they are of his own blood so in the end he was confirmed in his possessions and left alone although he refused to become a priest  since then he has been made an agent of the crown at granada and employed upon various embassies to london rome and elsewhere on matters connected with the faith and the establishment of the holy inquisition that is why he is again in england at this moment being charged to obtain the names and particulars concerning all maranos settled there especially if they trade with spain i have seen the names of those of whom he must inquire most closely and that is why i write to you so fully since yours is first upon the list i think therefore that you do wisely to wind up your business with this country and especially to sell your ships to us outright and quickly since otherwise they might be seizedlike yourself if you came here my counsel to you ishide your wealth which will be great when we have paid you all we owe and go to some place where you will be forgotten for a while since that bloodhound daguilar for so he calls himself after his mothers birthplace has not tracked you to london for nothing as yet thanks be to god no suspicion has fallen on any of us perhaps because we have many in our pay  when castell had finished transcribing all this passage he read it through carefully then he went into the hall where a fire burned for the day was cold and threw the translation on to it watching until it was consumed after which he returned to his office and hid away the letter in a secret cupboard behind the panelling of the wall this done he sat himself in his chair to think  my good friend juan bernaldez is right he said to himself daguilar or the marquis morella does not nose me and the others out for nothing well i shall not trust myself in spain and the money most of it except what is still to come from spain is put out where it will never be found by him at good interest too all seems safe enoughand yet i would to god that peter and margaret were fast married and that we three sat together out of sight and mind in the old hall at dedham i have carried on this game too long i should have closed my books a year ago but the trade was so good that i could not i was wise also who in this one lucky year have nearly doubled my fortune and yet it would have been safer before they guessed that i was so rich greedmere greedfor i do not need this money which may destroy us all greed the ancient pitfall of my race  as he thought thus there came a knock upon his door snatching up a pen he dipped it in the inkhorn and calling enter began to add a column of figures on a paper before him  the door opened but he seemed to take no heed so diligently did he count his figures yet although his eyes were fixed upon the paper in some way that he could not understand he was well aware that daguilar and no other stood in the room behind him the truth being no doubt that unconsciously he had recognised his footstep for a moment the knowledge turned him coldhe who had just been reading of the mission of this manand feared what was to come yet he acted well  why do you disturb me daughter he said testily and without looking round have not things gone ill enough with half the cargo destroyed by seawater and the rest that you must trouble me while i sum up my losses and casting the pen down he turned his stool round impatiently  yes there sure enough stood daguilar very handsomely arrayed and smiling and bowing as was his custom    chapter viii  daguilar speaks  losses said daguilar do i hear the wealthy john castell who holds half the trade with spain in the hollow of his hand talk of losses  yes señor you do things have gone ill with this ship of mine that has barely lived through the spring gales but be seated  indeed is that so said daguilar as he sat down what a lying jade is rumour for i was told that they had gone very well doubtless however what is loss to you would be priceless gain to one like me  castell made no answer but waited feeling that his visitor had not come to speak with him of his trading ventures  señor castell said daguilar with a note of nervousness in his voice i am here to ask you for something  if it be a loan señor i fear that the time is not opportune and he nodded towards the sheet of figures  it is not a loan it is a gift  anything in my poor house is yours answered castell courteously and in oriental form  i rejoice to hear it señor for i seek something from your house  castell looked a question at him with his quick black eyes  i seek your daughter the señora margaret in marriage  castell stared at him then a single word broke from his lips  impossible  why impossible asked daguilar slowly yet as one who expected some such answer in age we are not unsuited nor perhaps in fortune while of rank i have enough more than you guess perhaps i vaunt not myself yet women have thought me not uncomely i should be a good friend to the house whence i took a wife where perchance a day may come when friends will be needed and lastly i desire her not for what she may bring with her though wealth is always welcome buti pray you to believe itbecause i love her  i have heard that the señor daguilar loves many women yonder in granada  as i have heard that the margaret had a prosperous voyage señor castell rumour as i said but now is a lying jade yet i will not copy her i have been no saint now i would become one for margarets sake i will be true to your daughter señor what say you now  castell only shook his head  listen went on daguilar i am more than i seem to be she who weds me will not lack for rank and titles  yes you are the marquis de morella the reputed son of prince carlos of viana by a moorish mother and therefore nephew to his majesty of spain  daguilar looked at him then bowed and said  your information is goodas good as mine almost doubtless you do not like that bar in the blood well if it were not there i should be where ferdinand is should i not so i do not like it either though it is good blood and ancientthat of those highbred moors now may not the nephew of a king and the son of a princess of granada be fit to mate with the daughter ofa jew yes a marano and of a christian english lady of good family but no more  castell lifted his hand as though to speak but daguilar went on  deny it not friend it is not worth while here in private was there not a certain isaac of toledo who hard on fifty years ago left spain for his own reasons with a little son and in london became known as joseph castell having with his son been baptized into the holy church ah you see you are not the only one who studies genealogies  well señor if so what of it  what of it nothing at all friend castell it is an old story is it not and as that isaac is long dead and his son has been a good christian for nearly fifty years and had a christian wife and child who will trouble himself about such a matter if he were openly a hebrew now or worse still if pretending to be a christian he in secret practised the rites of the accursed jews why then  then what  then of course he would be expelled this land where no jew may live his wealth would be forfeit to its king whose ward his daughter would become to be given in marriage where he willed while he himself being spanish born might perhaps be handed over to the power of spain there to make answer to these charges but we wander to strange matters is that alliance still impossible señor  castell looked him straight in the eyes and answered  yes  there was something so bold and direct in his utterance of the word that for a moment daguilar seemed to be taken aback he had not expected this sharp denial  it would be courteous to give a reason he said presently  the reason is simple marquis my daughter is already betrothed and will ere long be wedded  daguilar did not seem surprised at this intelligence  to that brawler your kinsman peter brome i suppose he said interrogatively i guessed as much and by the saints i am sorry for her for he must be a dull lover to one so fair and bright while as a husband and he shrugged his shoulders friend castell for her sake you will break off this match  and if i will not marquis  then i must break it off for you in the interest of all of us including of course myself who love her and wish to lift her to a great place and of yourself whom i desire should pass your old age in peace and wealth and not be hunted to your death like a mad dog  how will you break it marquis by  oh no señor answered daguilar not by other mens swordsif that is what you mean the worthy peter is safe from them so far as i am concerned though if he should come face to face with mine then let the best man win have no fear friend i do not practise murder who value my own soul too much to soak it in blood nor would i marry a woman except of her own free will still peter may die and the fair margaret may still place her hand in mine and say i choose you as my husband  all these things and many others may happen marquis but i do not think it likely that they will happen and for my part whilst thanking you for it i decline your honourable offer believing that my daughter will be more happy in her present humble state with the man she has chosen have i your leave to return to my accounts and he rose  yes señor answered daguilar rising also but add an item to those losses of which you spoke that of the friendship of carlos marquis de morella and on the other side enter again that of his hate man he added and his dark handsome face turned very evil as he spoke are you mad think of the little tabernacle behind the altar in your chapel and what it contains  castell stared at him then said  come let us see nay fear no trick like you i remember my soul and do not stain my hands with blood follow me so you will be safe  curiosity or some other reason prompted daguilar to obey and presently they stood behind the altar  now said castell as he drew the tapestry and opened the secret door look daguilar peered into the place but where should have been the table the ark the candlesticks and the roll of the law of which betty had told him were only old dusty boxes filled with parchments and some broken furniture  what do you see asked castell  i see friend that you are even a cleverer jew than i thought but this is a matter that you must explain to others in due season believe me i am no inquisitor then without more words he turned and left him  when castell having shut the secret door and drawn the tapestry hurried from the chapel it was to find that the marquis had departed  he went back to his office much disturbed and sat himself down there to think truly fate that had so long been his friend was turning its face against him things could not have gone worse daguilar had discovered the secret of his faith through his spies and having by some accursed mischance fallen in love with his daughters beauty was become his bitter enemy because he must refuse her to him why must he refuse her the man was of great position and noble blood she would become the wife of one of the first grandees of spain one who stood nearest to the throne perhapssuch a thing was possibleshe might live herself to be queen or the mother of kings moreover that marriage meant safety for himself it meant a quiet age a peaceable death in his own bedfor were he fifty times a marano who would touch the fatherinlaw of the marquis de morella why just because he had promised her in marriage to peter brome and through all his life as a merchant he had never yet broken with a bargain because it went against himself that was the answer yet almost he could find it in his heart to wish that he had never made that bargain that he had kept peter who had waited so long waiting for another month well it was too late now he had passed his word and he would keep it whatever the cost might be  rising he called one of the servants and bade her summon margaret presently she returned saying that her mistress had gone out walking with betty adding also that his horse was at the door for him to ride to the river where he was to pass the night on board his ship  taking paper he bethought him that he would write to margaret warning her against the spaniard then remembering that she had nothing to fear from him at any rate at present and that it was not wise to set down such matters he told her only to take good care of herself and that he would be back in the morning  that evening when margaret was in her own little sittingchamber which adjoined the great hall the door opened and she looked up from the work upon which she was engaged to see daguilar standing before her  señor she said amazed how came you here  señora he answered closing the door and bowing my feet brought me had i any other means of coming i think that i should not often be absent from our side  spare me your fine words i pray you señor answered margaret frowning it is not fitting that i should receive you thus alone at night my father being absent from the house and she made as though she would pass him and reach the door  daguilar who stood in front of it did not move so perforce she stopped half way  i found that he was absent he said courteously and that is why i venture to address you upon a matter of some importance give me a few minutes of your time therefore i beseech you  now at once the thought entered margarets mind that he had some news of peter to communicate to herbad news perhaps  be seated and speak on señor she said sinking into a chair while he too sat down but still in front of the door  señora he said my business in this country is finished and in a few days i sail hence for spain and he hesitated a moment  i trust that your voyage will be pleasant said margaret not knowing what else to answer  i trust so also señora since i have come to ask you if you will share it listen before you refuse today i saw your father and begged your hand of him he would give me no answer neither yea nor nay saying that you were your own mistress and that i must seek it from your lips  my father said that gasped margaret astonished then bethought her that he might have had reasons for speaking so and went on rapidly well it is short and simple i thank you señor but stay in england  even that i would be willing to do for your sake señora though in truth i find it a cold and barbarous country  if so señor daguilar i think that i should go to spain i pray you let me pass  not till you have heard me out señora when i trust that your words will be more gentle see now i am a great man in my own country although it suits me to pass here incognito as plain señor daguilar i am the marquis of morella the nephew of ferdinand the king with some wealth and station official and private if you disbelieve me i can prove it to you  i do not disbelieve answered margaret indifferently it may well be so but what is that to me  then is it not something lady that i who have bloodroyal in my veins should seek the daughter of a merchant to be my wife  nothing at allto me who am satisfied with my humble lot  is it nothing to you that i should love as i do with all my heart and soul marry me and i tell you that i will lift you high yes perhaps even to the throne  she thought a moment then asked  the bribe is great but how would you do that many a maid has been deceived with false jewels señor  how has it been done before not every one loves ferdinand i have many friends who remember that my father was poisoned by his father and ferdinands he being the elder son also my mother was a princess of the moors and if i who dwell among them as the envoy of their majesties threw in my sword with theirsor there are other ways but i am speaking things that have never passed my lips before which were they known would cost me my headlet it serve to show how much i trust you  i thank you señor for your trust but this crown seems to me set upon a peak that it is dangerous to climb and i had sooner sit in safety on the plain  you reject the pomp went on daguilar in his passionate pleading voice then will not the love move you oh you shall be worshipped as never woman was i swear to you that in your eyes there is a light which has set my heart on fire so that it burns night and day and will not be quenched your voice is my sweetest music your hair is a cord that binds me to you faster than the prisoners chain and when you pass for me venus walks the earth more your mind is pure and noble as your beauty and by the aid of it i shall be lifted up through the high places of the earth to some white throne in heaven i love you my lady my fair margaret because of you all other women are become coarse and hateful in my sight see how much i love you that i one of the first grandees of spain do this for your sweet sake and suddenly he cast himself upon his knees before her and lifting the hem of her dress pressed it to his lips  margaret looked down at him and the anger that was rising in her breast melted while with it went her fear this man was much in earnest she could not doubt it the hand that held her robe trembled like shaken water his face was ashen and in his dark eyes swam tears what cause had she to be afraid of one who was so much her slave  señor she said very gently rise i pray you do not waste all this love upon one who chances to have caught your fancy but who is quite unworthy of it and far beneath you one moreover by whom it may not be returned señor i am already affianced therefore put me out of your mind and find some other love  he rose and stood in front of her  affianced he said i knew it nay i will say no ill of the man to revile one more fortunate is poor argument but what is it to me if you are affianced what to me if you were wed i should seek you all the same who have no choice beneath me you are as far above me as a star and it would seem as hard to reach seek some other love i tell you lady that i have sought many for not all are so hard to win and i hate them every one you i desire alone and shall desire till i be dead aye and you i will win or die no i will not die till you are my own have no fear i will not kill your lover save perhaps in fair fight i will not force you to give yourself to me should i find the chance but with your own lips i will yet listen to you asking me to be your husband i swear it by him who died for us i swear that laying aside all other ends to that sole purpose i will devote my days yes and should you chance to pass from earth before me then i will follow you to the very gates of death and clasp you there  now again margarets fear returned to her this mans passion was terrible yet there was a grandeur in it peter had never spoken to her in so high a fashion  señor she said almost pleadingly corpses are poor brides have done with such sick fancies which surely must be born of your eastern blood  it is your blood also who are half a jew and therefore at least you should understand them  mayhap i do understand mayhap i think them great in their own fashion yes noble even and admire if it can be noble to seek to win away another mans betrothed but señor i am that mans betrothed and all of me my body and my soul is his nor would i go back upon my word and so break his heart to win the empire of the earth señor once more i implore you to leave this poor maid to the humble life that she has chosen and to forget her  lady answered daguilar your words are wise and gentle and i thank you for them but i cannot forget you and that oath i swore just now i swear again thus and before she could prevent him or even guess what he was about to do he lifted the gold crucifix that hung by a chain about her neck kissed it and let it fall gently back upon her breast saying see i might have kissed your lips before you could have stayed me but that i will never do until you give me leave so in place of them i kiss the cross which till then we both must carry lady my lady margaret within a day or two i sail for spain but your image shall sail with me and i believe that ere long our paths must cross again how can it be otherwise since the threads of your life and mine were intertwined on that night outside the palace of westminster intertwined never to be separated till one of us has ceased to be and then only for a little while lady for the present farewell   then swiftly and silently as he had come daguilar went  it was betty who let him out at the side door as she had let him in more glancing round to see that she was not observedfor it chanced now that peter was away with some of the best men and the master was out with others no one was on watch this nightleaving the door ajar that she might reenter she followed him a little way till they came to an old arch which in some bygone time had led to a house now pulled down into this dark place betty slipped touching daguilar on the arm as she did so for a moment he hesitated then muttering some spanish oath between his teeth followed her  well most fair betty he said what word have you for me now  the question is señor carlos answered betty with scarcely suppressed indignation what word you have for me who dared so much for you tonight that you have plenty for my cousin i know since standing in the cold garden i could hear you talk talk talk through the shutters as though for your very life  i pray that those shutters had no hole in them reflected daguilar to himself no there was a curtain also she can have seen nothing but aloud he answered mistress betty you should not stand about in this bitter wind you might fall ill and then what should i suffer  i dont know nothing perhaps that would be left to me what i want to understand is why you plan to come to see me and then spend an hour with margaret  to avert suspicion most dear betty also i had to talk to her of this peter in whom she seems so greatly interested you are very shrewd bettytell me is that to be a match  i think so i have been told nothing but i have noticed many things and almost every day she is writing to him though why she should care for that owl of a man i cannot guess  doubtless because she appreciates solid worth betty as i do in you who can account for the impulses of the heart which come say some of the learned from heaven and others from hell at least it is no affair of ours so let us wish them happiness and after they are married a large and healthy family meanwhile dear betty are you making ready for your voyage to spain  i dont know answered betty gloomily i am not sure that i trust you and your fine words if you want to marry me as you swear and be sure i look for nothing less why cannot it be before we start and how am i to know that you will do so when we get there  you ask many questions betty all of which i have answered before i have told you that i cannot marry you here because of that permission which is necessary on account of the difference in our ranks here where your place is known it is not to be had there where you will pass as a great english ladyas of course you are by birthi can obtain it in an hour but if you have any doubts although it cuts me to the heart to say it it would be best that we should part at once i will take no wife who does not trust me fully and alone say then cruel betty do you wish to leave me  you know i dont you know it would kill me she answered in a voice that was thick with passion you know i worship the ground you tread on and hate every woman you go near yes even my cousin who has been so good to me and whom i love i will take the risk and come with you believing you to be an honest gentleman who would not deceive a girl who trusts him and if you do may god deal with you as i shall for i am no toy to be broken and thrown away as you would find out yes i will take the risk because you have made me love you so that i cannot live without you  betty your words fill me with rapture showing me that i have not misread your noble mind but speak a little lowerthere are echoes in this hole now for the plans for time is short and you may be missed when i am about to sail i will invite mistress margaret and yourself to come aboard my ship  why not invite me without my cousin margaret asked betty  because it would excite suspicion which we must avoiddo not interrupt me i will invite you both or get you there upon some other pretext and then i will arrange that she shall be brought ashore again and you taken on leave it all to me only swear that you will obey any instructions i may send you for if you do not i tell you that we have enemies in high places who may part us for ever betty i will be frank there is a great lady who is jealous and watches you very closely do you swear  yes yes i swear but about the great lady  not a word about heron your lifeand mine you shall hear from me shortly and now sweetheartgoodnight  goodnight said betty but still she did not stir  then understanding that she expected something more daguilar nerved himself to the task and touched her hair with his lips  next moment he regretted it for even that tempered salute fanned her passion into flame  throwing her arms about his neck betty drew his face to hers and kissed him many times till at length he broke half choking from her embrace and escaped into the street  mother of heaven he muttered to himself the woman is a volcano in eruption i shall feel her kisses for a week and he rubbed his face ruefully with his hand i wish i had made some other plan but it is too late to change it nowshe would betray everything well i will be rid of her somehow if i have to drown her a hard fate to love the mistress and be loved of the maid    chapter ix  the snare  on the following morning when castell returned margaret told him of the visit of daguilar and of all that had passed between them told him also that he was acquainted with their secret since he had spoken of her as half a jew  i know it i know it answered her father who was much disturbed and very angry for yesterday he threatened me also but let that go i can take my chance now i would learn who brought this man into my house when i was absent and without my leave  i fear that it was betty said margaret who swears that she thought she did no wrong  send for her said castell presently betty came and being questioned told a long story  she said she was standing by the side door taking the air when señor daguilar appeared and having greeted her without more words walked into the house saying that he had an appointment with the master  with me broke in castell i was absent  i did not know that you were absent for i was out when you rode away in the afternoon and no one had spoken of it to me so thinking that he was your friend i let him in and let him out again afterwards that is all i have to say  then i have to say that you are a hussy and a liar and that in one way or the other this spaniard has bribed you answered castell fiercely now girl although you are my wifes cousin and therefore my daughters kin i am minded to turn you out on to the street to starve  at this betty first grew angry then began to weep while margaret pleaded with her father saying that it would mean the girls ruin and that he must not take such a sin upon him so the end of it was that being a kindhearted man remembering also that betty dene was of his wifes blood and that she had favoured her as her daughter did he relented taking measures to see that she went abroad no more save in the company of margaret and that the doors were opened only by menservants  so this matter ended  that day margaret wrote to peter telling him of all that had happened and how the spaniard had asked her in marriage though the words that he used she did not tell at the end of her letter also she bade him have no fear of the señor daguilar or of any other man as he knew where her heart was  when peter received this writing he was much vexed to learn that both master castell and margaret had incurred the enmity of daguilar for so he guessed it must be also that margaret should have been troubled with his lovemaking but for the rest he thought little of the matter who trusted her as he trusted heaven still it made him anxious to return to london as soon as might he even though he must take the risk of the spaniards daggers within three days however he received other letters both from castell and from margaret which set his fears at rest  these told him that daguilar had sailed for spain indeed castell said that he had seen him standing on the poop of the ambassador de ayalas vessel as it dropped down the thames towards the sea moreover margaret had a note of farewell from his hand which ran  adieu sweet lady till that predestined hour when we meet again i go as i must but as i told you your image goes with me      your worshipper till death      morella  he may take her image so long as i keep herself and if he comes back with his worship i promise him that death and he shall not be far apart was peters grim comment as he laid the paper down then he went on with his letters which told that now when the spaniards had gone and there was nothing more to fear he was awaited in london indeed castell fixed a day when he should arrivemay 31stthat was within a week adding that on its morrownamely june 1st for margaret would not be wed in may the virgin marys month since she held it to be unluckytheir marriage might take place as quietly as they would  margaret wrote the same news and in such sweet words that he kissed her letter then hastened to answer it shortly after his custom for peter was no great scribe saying that if the saints willed it he would be with them by nightfall on the last day of may and that in all england there was no happier man than he                                       now all that week margaret was very busy preparing her marriage robe and other garments also for it was settled that on the next day they should ride together down to dedham in essex whither her father would follow them shortly the old hall was not ready indeed nor would it be for some time but peter had furnished certain rooms in it which might serve them for the summer season and by winter time the house would be finished and open  castell was busy also for now having worked very hard at the task his ship the margaret was almost refitted and laden so that he hoped to get her to sea on this same may 31st and thus be clear of the last of his business except the handing over of his warehouses and stock to those who had bought them these great affairs kept him much at gravesend where the ship lay but as he had no dread of further trouble now that daguilar and the other spaniards among them that band of de ayalas servants who had vowed to take peters life were gone this did not disturb him  oh happy happy was margaret during those sweet spring days when her heart was bright and clear as the skies from which all winter storms had passed so happy was she indeed and so full of a hundred joyful cares that she found no time to take note of her cousin betty who worked with her at her wedding broideries and helped to make preparations for the journey which should follow after had she done so she might have seen that betty was anxious and distressed like one who waited for some tidings that did not come and from hour to hour fought against anguish and despair but she took no note whose heart was too full of her own matters and who did but count the hours till she should see her lover back and pass to his arms a wife  thus the time went on until the appointed day of peters return the morrow of her marriage for which all things were now prepared down to peters wedding garments that were finer than any she had yet seen him wear and the decking of the neighbouring church with flowers in the early morning her father rode away to gravesend with the most of his menservants for the ship margaret was to sail at the following dawn and there was yet much to be done before she could lift anchor still he had promised to be back by nightfall in time to meet peter who leaving dedham that morning could not reach them before then  at length it was past four of the afternoon and everything being finished margaret went to her room to dress herself anew that she might look fine in peters eyes when he should come betty she did not take with her for there were things to which her cousin must attend moreover her heart was so full that she wished to be alone a while  bettys heart was full also but not with joy she had been deceived the fine spanish don who had made her love him so desperately had sailed away and left her without a word she could not doubt it he had been seen standing on the shipand not one word it was cruel cruel and now she must help another woman to be made a happy wife she who was beggared of hope and love moodily full of bitterness she went about her tasks biting her lips and wiping her fine eyes with the sleeve of her robe when suddenly the door opened and a servant not one of their own but a strange man who had been brought in to help at the morrows feast called out that a sailor wished to speak with her  then let him enter here i have no time to go out to listen to his talk snapped betty  presently the sailor was shown in the man who brought him leaving the room at once he was a dark fellow with sly black eyes who had he not spoken english so well might have been taken for a spaniard  who are you and what is your business asked betty sharply  i am the carpenter of the ship margaret he answered and i am here to say that our master castell has met with an accident there and desires that mistress margaret his daughter should come to him at once  what accident asked betty  in seeing to the stowage of cargo he slipped and fell down the hold hurting his back and breaking his right arm and that is why he cannot write he is in great pain but the physician whom we summoned bade me tell mistress margaret that at present he has no fear for his life are you mistress margaret  no answered betty but i will go to her at once do you bide here  then are you her cousin mistress betty dene for if so i have something for you  i am what is it  this said the man drawing out a letter which he handed to her  who gave you this asked betty suspiciously i do not know his name but he was a noblelooking spanish don and a liberal one too he had heard of the accident on the margaret and knowing my errand asked me if i would deliver this letter to you for the fee of a gold ducat and promise to say nothing of it to any one else  some rude gallant doubtless said betty tossing her head they are ever writing to me bide here i go to mistress margaret  once she was outside the door betty broke the seal of the letter eagerly enough for she had been taught with margaret and could read well it ran      beloved      you thought me faithless and gone but     it is not so i was silent only because i knew you     could not come alone who are watched but now     the god of love gives us our chance doubtless     your cousin will bring you with her to visit her father     who lies on his ship sadly hurt while she is with     him i have made a plan to rescue you and then we     can be wed and sail at onceyes tonight or tomorrow     for with much trouble knowing that you     wished it i have even succeeded in bringing that     about and a priest will be waiting to marry us be     silent and show no doubt or fear whatever happens     lest we should be parted for always be sure then     that your cousin comes that you may accompany her     remember that your true love waits you      c da  when betty had mastered the contents of this amorous effusion she went pale with joy and turned so faint that she was like to fall then a doubt struck her that it might be some trick no she knew the writingit was daguilars and he was true to her and would marry her as he had promised and take her to be a great lady in spain if she hesitated now she might lose him for everhim whom she would follow to the end of the world in an instant her mind was made up for betty had plenty of courage she would go even though she must desert the cousin whom she loved  thrusting the letter into her bosom she ran to margarets room and bursting into it told her of the man and his sad message but of that letter she said nothing margaret turned white at the news then recovering herself said  i will come and speak with him at once and together they went down the stairs  to margaret the sailor repeated his story nor could all her questions shake it he told her how the mischance had happened for he had seen it so he said and where her fathers hurts were adding that although the physician held that as yet he was in no danger of his life master castell thought otherwise and did nothing but cry that his daughter should be brought to him at once  still margaret doubted and hesitated for she feared she knew not what  peter should be here within two hours at most she said to betty would it not be best to wait for him  oh margaret and what if your father should die in the meanwhile perhaps he knows better how deep his hurts are than does this leech if so you would have a sore heart for all your life sure you had better go or at the least i will  still margaret wavered till the sailor said  lady if it is your will to come i can guide you to where a boat waits to take you across the river if not i must be gone for the ship sails with the moonrise and they only wait your coming to carry the master your father to the warehouse on shore thinking it best that you should be present if you do not come this will be done as gently as possible and there you must seek him tomorrow alive or dead and the man took up his cap as though to leave  i will come with you said margaret betty you are right order the two horses to be saddled mine and the grooms with a pillion on which you can ride for i will not send you or go alone understand that this sailor has his own horse  the man nodded and accompanied betty to the stable then margaret took pen and wrote hastily to peter telling him of their evil chance and bidding him follow her at once to the ship or if it had sailed to the warehouse i am loth to go she added alone with a girl and a strange man yet i must since my heart is torn with fear for my beloved father sweetheart follow me quickly  this done she gave the letter to that servant who had shown in the sailor bidding him hand it without fail to master peter brome when he came which the man promised to do  then she fetched plain dark cloaks for herself and betty with hoods to them that their faces might not be seen and presently they were mounted  stay said margaret to the sailor as they were about to start how comes it that my father did not send one of his own men instead of you and why did none write to me  the man looked surprised he was a very good actor  his people were tending him he said and he bade me to go because i knew the way and had a good hired horse ashore which i have used when riding with messages to london about new timbers and other matters as for writing the physician began a letter but he was so slow and long that master castell ordered me to be off without it it seems the man added addressing betty with some irritation that mistress margaret misdoubts me if so let her find some other guide or bide at home it is naught to me who have only done as i was bidden  thus did this cunning fellow persuade margaret that her fears were nothing though remembering the letter from daguilar betty was somewhat troubled the thing had a strange look but poor vain fool she thought to herself that even if there were some trick it was certainly arranged only that she might seem to be taken who could not come alone in truth she was blind and mad and cared not what she did though let this be said for her she never dreamed that any harm was meant towards her cousin margaret or that a lie had been told as to master castell and his hurts  soon they were out of london and riding swiftly by the road that followed the north bank of the river for their guide did not take them over the bridge as he said the ship was lying in midstream and that the boat would be waiting on the tilbury shore but there was more than twenty miles to travel and push on as they would night had fallen ere ever they came there at length when they were weary of the dark and the rough road the sailor pulled up at a spot upon the rivers brinkwhere there was a little wharf but no houses that they could seesaying that this was the place dismounting he gave his horse to the groom to hold and going to the wharf asked in a loud voice if the boat from the margaret was there to which a voice answered aye then he talked for a minute to those in the boat though what he said they could not hear and ran back again bidding them dismount and adding that they had done well to come as master castell was much worse and did nothing but cry for his daughter  the groom he told to lead the horses a little way along the bank till he found an inn that stood there where he must await their return or further orders and to betty he suggested that she should go with him as there was but little place left in the boat this she was willing enough to do thinking it all part of the plan for her carrying off but margaret would have none of it saying that unless her cousin came with her she would not stir another step so grumbling a little the sailor gave way and hurried them both to some wooden steps and down these into a boat of which they could but dimly see the outline  so soon as ever they were seated side by side in the stern it was pushed off and rowed away rapidly into the darkness while one of the sailors lit a lantern which he fastened to the bow and far out on the river as though in answer to the signal another star of light appeared towards which they headed now margaret speaking through the gloom asked the rowers of her fathers state but the sailor their guide prayed her not to trouble them as the tide ran very swiftly and they must give all their mind to their business lest they should overset so she was silent and racked with doubts and fears watched that star of light growing ever nearer till at length it hung above them  is that the ship margaret cried their guide and again a voice answered aye  then tell master castell that his daughter has come at last he shouted again and in another minute a rope had been thrown to them and they were fast alongside a ladder on to which betty who was nearest to it was pushed the first except for their guide who had run up the wooden steps very swiftly  betty who was active and strong followed him margaret coming next as she reached the deck betty thought she heard a voice say in spanish of which she understood something fool why have you brought both but the answer she could not catch then she turned and gave her hand to margaret and together they walked forward to the foot of the mast  lead me to my father said margaret  whereon the guide answered  yes this way mistress but come alone for the sight of two of you at once may disturb him  nay she answered my cousin comes with me and she took bettys hand and clung to it  shrugging his shoulders the sailor led them forwards and as they went she noted that men were hauling on a sail while other men who sang a strange wild song worked on what seemed to be a windlass now they reached a cabin and entered it the door being shut behind them in the cabin a man sat at a table with a lamp hanging over his head he rose and turned towards them bowing and margaret saw that it wasdaguilar  betty stood silent she had expected to meet him though not here and thus her foolish heart bounded so at the sight of him that she seemed to choke and could only wonder dimly what mistake had been made and how he would explain to margaret and get her away leaving herself and him together to be married indeed she searched the cabin with her eyes to see where the priest was waiting then noting a door beyond thought that doubtless he must be hidden there as for margaret she uttered a little stifled cry then being a brave woman one of that high nature which grows strong in the face of trouble straightened herself to her full height and said in a low fierce voice  what do you here where is my father  señora he answered humbly i am on board my ship the san antonio and as for your father he is either on his ship the margaret or more likely by now at his house in holborn  at these words margaret reeled back till the wall of the cabin stayed her and there she rested  spare me your reproaches went on daguilar hurriedly i will tell you all the truth first be not anxious as to your father no accident has happened to him he is sound and well forgive me if you have suffered pain and doubt but there was no other way that tale was only one of loves snares and tricks he paused overcome fascinated by margarets face which of a sudden had grown awfulthat of a goddess of vengeance of a medusa which seemed to chill his blood to ice  a snare a trick she muttered hoarsely while her eyes flamed on him like burning stars thus then i pay you for your tricks and in an instant he became aware that she had snatched a dagger from her bosom and was springing on him  he could not move those fearful eyes held him fast in another moment that steel would have pierced his heart but betty had seen also and thrusting her strong arms about margaret held her back crying  listen you do not understand it is i he wantsnot you i whom he loves and who love him and am about to marry him you he will send back home  loose me said margaret in such a voice that bettys arms fell from her and she stood there the dagger still in her hand now she said to daguilar the truth and be swift with it what means this woman  she knows best answered daguilar uneasily it has pleased her to wrap herself in this web of conceits  which it has pleased you to spin perchance speak girl  he made love to me gasped betty and i love him he promised to marry me he sent me a letter but todayhere it is and she drew it out  read said margaret and betty read  so you have betrayed me said margaret you my cousin whom i have sheltered and cherished  no cried betty i never thought to betray you sooner would i have died i believed that your father was hurt and that while you were visiting him that man would take me  what have you to say asked margaret of daguilar in the same dreadful voice you offered your accursed love to meand to her and you have snared us both man what have you to say  only this he answered trying to look brave that woman is a fool whose vanity i played on that i might make use of her to keep near to you  do you hear betty do you hear cried margaret with a terrible little laugh but betty only groaned as though she were dying  i love you and you only went on daguilar as for your cousin i will send her ashore i have committed this sin because i could not help myself the thought that you were to be married to another man tomorrow drove me mad and i dared all to take you from his arms even though you should never come to mine did i not swear to you he said with an attempt at his old gallantry that your image should accompany me to spain whither we are sailing now and as he spoke the words the ship lurched a little in the wind  margaret made no answer only toyed with the dagger blade and watched him with eyes that glittered more coldly than its steel  kill me if you will and have done he went on in a voice that was desperate with love and shame so shall i be rid of all this torment  then margaret seemed to awake for she spoke to him in a new voicea measured frozen voice no she answered i will not stain my hands even with your blood for why should i rob god of his own vengeance if you attempt to touch me or even to separate me from this poor woman whom you have fooled then i will killnot you but myself and i swear to you that my ghost shall accompany you to spain and from spain down to the hell that awaits you listen carlos daguilar marquis of morella this i know about you that you believe in god and hear his anger well i call down upon you the vengeance of almighty god i see it hang above your head i say that it shall fall upon you waking and sleeping loving and hating in life and in death to all eternity do your worst for you shall do it all in vain whether i die or whether i live every pang that you cause me to suffer every misery that you have brought or shall bring upon the head of my betrothed my father and this woman shall be repaid to you a millionfold in this world and the next now do you still wish that i should accompany you to spain or will you let me go  i cannot he answered hoarsely it is too late  so be it i will accompany you to spain i and betty dene and the vengeance of almighty god that hovers over you of this at least be surei hate you i despise you but i fear you not at all go then daguilar stumbled from that cabin and the two women heard the door bolted behind him    chapter x  the chase  about the time that margaret and betty were being rowed aboard the san antonio peter brome and his servants who had been delayed an hour or more by the muddy state of the roads pulled rein at the door of the house in holborn for over a month he had been dreaming of this moment of return as a man does who expects such a welcome as he knew awaited him and who on the morrow was to be wed to a lovely and beloved bride he had thought how margaret would be watching at the window how spying him advancing down the street she would speed to the door how he would leap from his horse and take her to his arms in front of every one if need befor why should they be ashamed who were to be wed upon the morrow  but there was no margaret at the window or at any rate he could not see her for it was dark there was not even a light indeed the whole face of the old house seemed to frown at him through the gloom still peter played his part according to the plan that is he leapt from his horse ran to the door and tried to enter but could not for it was locked so he hammered on it with the handle of his sword till at length some one came and unbolted it was the hired man with whom margaret had left the letter and he held a lantern in his hand  the sight of him frightened peter striking a chill to his heart  who are you he asked then without waiting for an answer went on where are master castell and mistress margaret  the man answered that the master was not yet back from his ship and that the lady margaret had gone out nearly three hours before with her cousin betty and a sailorall of them on horseback  she must have ridden to meet me and missed us in the dark said peter aloud whereon the man asked whether he spoke to master brome since if so he had a letter for him  yes answered peter and snatched it from his hand bidding him close the door and hold up the lantern while he read for he could see that the writing was that of margaret  a strange story he muttered as he finished it well i must away and he turned to the door again  as he stretched out his hand to the key it opened and through it came castell as sound as ever he had been  welcome peter he cried in a jolly voice i knew you were here for i saw the horses but why are you not with margaret  because margaret has gone to be with you who should be hurt almost to death or so says this letter  to be with mehurt to the death give it menay read it i cannot see  so peter read  i scent a plot said castell in a strained voice as he finished and i think that hound of a spaniard is at the bottom of it or betty or both here you fellow tell us what you know and be swift if you would keep a sound skin  that would i why not answered the man and told all the tale of the coming of the sailor  go bid the men bring back the horses all of them said castell almost before he had done and peter look not so dazed but come drink a cup of wine we shall need it both of us before this night is over what is there never a fellow of all my servants in the house so he shouted till his folk who had returned with him from the ship came running from the kitchen  he bade them bring food and liquor and while they gulped down the wine for they could not eat castell told how their mistress margaret had been tricked away and must be followed then hearing the horses being led back from the stables they ran to the door and mounted and followed by their men a dozen or more of them in all galloped off into the darkness taking another road for tilbury that by which margaret went not because they were sure of this but because it was the shortest  but the horses were tired and the night was dark and rainy so it came about that the clock of some church struck three of the morning before ever they drew near to tilbury now they were passing the little quay where margaret and betty had entered the boat castell and peter riding side by side ahead of the others in stern silence for they had nothing to say when a familiar voice hailed themthat of thomas the groom  i saw your horses heads against the sky he explained and knew them  where is your mistress they asked both in a breath  gone gone with betty dene in a boat from this quay to be rowed to the margaret or so i thought having stabled the horses as i was bidden i came back here to await them but that was hours ago and i have seen no soul and heard nothing except the wind and the water till i heard the galloping of your horses  on to tilbury and get boats said castell we must catch the margaret ere she sails at dawn perhaps the women are aboard of her  if so i think spaniards took them there for i am sure they were not english in that craft said thomas as he ran by the side of castells horse holding to the stirrup leather  his master made no answer only peter groaned aloud for he too was sure that they were spaniards  an hour later just as the dawn broke they with their men climbed to the deck of the margaret while she was hauling up her anchor a few words with her captain jacob smith told them the worst no boat had left the ship no margaret had come aboard her but some six hours before they had watched the spanish vessel san antonio that had been berthed above them pass down the river moreover two watermen in a skiff who brought them fresh meat had told them that while they were delivering three sheep and some fowls to the san antonio just before she sailed they had seen two tall women helped up her ladder and heard one of them say in english lead me to my father  now they knew all the awful truth and stared at each other like dumb men  it was peter who found his tongue the first and said slowly  i must away to spain to find my bride if she still lives and to kill that fox get you home master castell  my home is where my daughter is answered castell fiercely i go asailing also  there is danger for you in that land of spaniards if ever we get yonder said peter meaningly  if it were the mouth of hell still i would go replied castell why should i not who seek a devil  that we do both said peter and stretching out his hand he took that of castell it was the pledge of the father and the lover to follow her who was all to them till death stayed their quest  castell thought a little while then gave orders that all the crew should be called together on deck in the waist of the ship which was a carack of about two hundred tons burden round fashioned and sitting deep in the water but very strongly built of oak and a swift sailer when they were gathered and with them the officers and their own servants accompanied by peter he went and addressed them just as the sun was rising in few and earnest words he told them of the great outrage that had been done and how it was his purpose and that of peter brome who had been wickedly robbed of the maid who this day should have become his wife to follow the thieves across the sea to spain in the hope that by the help of god they might rescue margaret and betty he added that he knew well this was a service of danger since it might chance that there would be fighting and he was loth to ask any man to risk life or limb against his will especially as they came out to trade and not to fight still to those who chose to accompany them should they win through safely he promised double wage and a present charged upon his estate and would give them writings to that effect as for those who did not they could leave the ship now before she sailed  when he had finished the sailormen of whom there were about thirty with the stouthearted captain jacob smith a sturdybuilt man of fifty years of age at the head of them conferred together and at last with one exceptionthat of a young newmarried man whose heart failed himthey accepted the offer swearing that they would see the thing through to the end were it good or ill for they were all englishmen and no lovers of the spaniards moreover so bitter a wrong stirred their blood indeed although for the most part they were not sailors six of the twelve men who had ridden with them from london prayed that they might come too for the love they had to margaret their master and peter and they took them the other six they sent ashore again bearing letters to castells friends agents and reeves as to the transfer of his business and the care of his lands houses and other properties during his absence also they took a short will duly signed by castell and witnessed wherein he left all his goods of whatever sort that remained unsettled or undevised to margaret and peter or the survivor of them or their heirs or failing these for the purpose of founding a hospital for the poor then these men bade them farewell and departed very heavy at heart just as the anchor was hauled home and the sails began to draw in the stiff morning breeze  about ten oclock they rounded the nore bank safely and here spoke a fishingboat who told them that more than six hours before they had seen the san antonio sail past them down channel and noted two women standing on her deck holding each others hands and gazing shorewards then knowing that there was no mistake there being nothing more that they could do worn out with grief and journeying they ate some food and went to their cabin to sleep  as he laid him down peter remembered that at this very hour he should have been in church taking margaret as his bridemargaret who was now in the power of the spaniardand swore a great and bitter oath that daguilar should pay him back for all this shame and agony indeed could his enemy have seen the look on peters face he might well have been afraid for this peter was an ill man to cross and had no forgiving heart also his wrong was deep  for four days the wind held and they ran down channel before it hoping to catch sight of the spaniard but the san antonio was a swift caravel of 250 tons with much canvas for she carried four masts and although the margaret was also a good sailer she had but two masts and could not come up with her or for anything they knew they might have missed her on the seas on the afternoon of the fourth day when they were off the lizard and creeping along very slowly under a light breeze the lookout man reported a ship lying becalmed ahead peter who had the eyes of a hawk climbed up the mast to look at her and presently called down that he believed from her shape and rig she must be the caravel though of this he could not be sure as he had never seen her then the captain smith went up also and a few minutes later returned saying that without doubt it was the san antonio  now there was a great and joyful stir on board the margaret every man seeing to his sword and their long or cross bows of which there were plenty although they had no bombards or cannon that as yet were rare on merchant ships their plan was to run alongside the san antonio and board her for thus they hoped to recover margaret as for the anger of the king which might well fall on them for this deed since he would think little of the stealing of a pair of englishwomen of that they must take their chance  within half an hour everything was ready and peter pacing to and fro looked happier than he had done since he rode away to dedham the light breeze still held although if it reached the san antonio it did not seem to move her and with the help of it by degrees they came to within half a mile of the caravel then the wind dropped altogether and there the two ships lay still the set of the tide or some current seemed to be drawing them towards each other so that when the night closed in they were not more than four hundred paces apart and the englishmen had great hopes that before morning they would close and be able to board by the light of the moon  but this was not to be since about nine oclock thick clouds rose up which covered the heavens while with the clouds came strong winds blowing off the land and when at length the dawn broke all they could see of the san antonio was her topmasts as she rose upon the seas flying southwards swiftly this indeed was the last sight they had of her for two long weeks  from ushant all across the bay the airs were very light and variable but when at length they came off finisterre a gale sprang up from the northeast which drove them forward very fast it was on the second night of this gale as the sun set that running out of some mist and rain suddenly they saw the san antonio not a mile away and rejoiced for now they knew that she had not made for any port in the north of spain as although she was bound for cadiz they feared she might have done to trick them then the rain came on again and they saw her no more  all down the coast of portugal the weather grew more heavy day by day and when they reached st vincents cape and bore round for cadiz it blew a great gale now it was that for the third time they viewed the san antonio labouring ahead of them nor except at night did they lose sight of her any more until the end of that voyage indeed on the next day they nearly came up with her for she tried to beat in to cadiz but losing one of her masts in a fierce squall and seeing that the margaret which sailed better in this tempest would soon be aboard of her abandoned her plan and ran for the straits of gibraltar  past tarifa point they went having the coast of africa on their right past the bay of algegiras where the san antonio did not try to harbour past gibraltars grey old rock where the signal fires were burning and so at nightfall with not a mile between them out into the mediterranean sea  here the gale was furious so that they could scarcely carry a rag of canvas and before morning lost one of their topmasts it was an anxious night for they knew not if they would live through it moreover the hearts of castell and of peter were torn with fear lest the spaniard should founder and take margaret with her to the bottom of the sea when at length the wild stormy dawn broke however they saw her apparently in an evil case labouring away upon their starboard bow and by noon came to within a furlong of her so that they could see the sailors crawling about on her high poop and stern yes and they saw more than this for presently two women ran from some cabin waving a white cloth to them then were hustled back whereby they learned that margaret and betty still lived and knew that they followed and thanked god presently also there was a flash and before ever they heard the report a great iron bullet fell upon their decks and rebounding struck a sailor who stood by peter on the breast and dashed him away into the sea the san antonio had fired the bombard which she carried but as no more shots came they judged that the cannon had broke its lashings or burst  a while after the san antonio two of whose masts were gone tried to put about and run for malaga which they could see far away beneath the snowcapped mountains of the sierra but this the spaniard could not do for while she hung in the wind the margaret came right atop of her and as her men laboured at the sails every one of the englishmen who could be spared under the command of peter let loose on them with their long shafts and crossbows and though the heaving deck of the margaret was no good platform and the wind bent the arrows from their line they killed and wounded eight or ten of them causing them to loose the ropes so that the san antonio swung round into the gale again on the high tower of the caravel his arm round the sternmost mast stood daguilar shouting commands to his crew peter fitted an arrow to his string and waiting until the margaret was poised for a moment on the crest of a great sea aimed and loosed making allowance for the wind  true to line sped that shaft of his yet alas a span too high for when a moment later daguilar leapt from the mast the arrow quivered in its wood and pinned to it was the velvet cap he wore peter ground his teeth in rage and disappointment almost he could have wept for the vessels swung apart again and his chance was gone  five times out of seven he said bitterly can i send a shaft through a bulls ring at fifty paces to win a village badge and now i cannot hit a man to save my love from shame surely god has forsaken me  through all that afternoon they held on shooting with their bows whenever a spaniard showed himself and being shot at in return though little damage was done to either side but this they notedthat the san antonio had sprung a leak in the gale for she was sinking deeper in the water the spaniards knew it also and being aware that they must either run ashore or founder for the second time put about and under the rain of english arrows came right across the bows of the margaret heading for the little bay of calahonda that is the port of motril for here the shore was not much more than a league away  now said jacob smith the captain of the margaret who stood under the shelter of the bulwarks with castell and peter up that bay lies a spanish town i know it for i have anchored there and if once the san antonio reaches it goodbye to our lady for they will take her to granada not thirty miles away across the mountains where this marquis of morella is a mighty man for there is his palace say then master what shall we do in five more minutes the spaniard will be across our bows again shall we run her down which will be easy and take our chance of picking up the women or shall we let them be taken captive to granada and give up the chase  never said peter there is another thing that we can dofollow them into the bay and attack them there on shore  to find ourselves among hundreds of the spaniards and have our throats cut answered smith the captain coolly  if we ran them down asked castell who had been thinking deeply all this while should we not sink also  it might be so answered smith but we are built of english oak and very stout forward and i think not but she would sink at once being near to it already and the odds are that the women are locked in the cabin or between decks out of reach of the arrows and must go with her  there is another plan said peter sternly and that is to grapple with her and board her and this i will do  the captain a stout man with a flat face that never changed lifted his eyebrows which was his only way of showing surprise  what he said in this sea i have fought in some wars but never have i known such a thing  then friend you shall know it now if i can but find a dozen men to follow me answered peter with a savage laugh what shall i see my mistress carried off before my eyes and strike no blow to save her rather will i trust in god and do it and if i die then die i must as a man should there is no other way  then he turned and called in a loud voice to those who stood around or loosed arrows at the spaniard  who will come with me aboard yonder ship those who live shall spend their days in ease thereafter that i promise and those who fall will win great fame and heavens glory  the crew looked at the waves running hill high and the waterlogged spaniard labouring in the trough of them as she came round slowly in a wide circle very doubtfully as well they might and made no answer then peter spoke again  there is no choice he said if we give that ship our stem we can sink her but then how will the women be saved if we leave her alone mayhap she will founder and then how will the women be saved or she may win ashore and they will be carried away to granada and how can we snatch them out of the hand of the moors or of the power of spain but if we can take the ship we may rescue them before they go down or reach land will none back me at this inch  aye son said old castell i will  peter stared at him in surprise youat your years he said  yes at my years why not i have the fewer to risk  then as though he were ashamed of his doubts one brawny sailorman stepped forward and said that he was ready for a cut at the spanish thieves in foul weather as in fair next all castells household servants came out in a body for love of him and peter and their lady and after them more sailors till nearly half of those aboard something over twenty in all declared that they were ready for the venture wherein peter cried enough smith would have come also but castell said no he must stop with the ship  then while the caracks head was laid so as to cut the path of the san antonio circling round them slowly like a wounded swan and the boarders made ready their swords and knives for here archery would not avail them castell gave some orders to the captain he bade him if they were cut down or taken to put about and run for seville and there deliver over the ship and her cargo to his partners and correspondents praying them in his name to do their best by means of gold for which the sale value of the vessel and her goods should be chargeable or otherwise to procure the release of margaret and betty if they still lived and to bring daguilar the marquis of morella to account for his crime this done he called to one of his servants to buckle on him a light steel breastplate from the ships stores but peter would wear no iron because it was too heavy only an archers jerkin of bullhide stout enough to turn a swordcut such as the other boarders put on also with steel caps of both of which they had a plenty in the cabin  now the san antonio having come round was steering for the mouth of the bay in such fashion that she would pass them within fifty yards hoisting a small sail to give his ship way the captain smith took the helm of the margaret and steered straight at her so as to cut her path while the boarders headed by peter and castell gathered near the bowsprit lay down there under shelter of the bulwarks and waited    chapter xi  the meeting on the sea  for another minute or more the san antonio held on until she divined the desperate purpose of her foe then seeing that soon the caracks prow must crash into her frail side she shifted her helm and came round several points so that in the end the margaret ran not into her but alongside of her grinding against her planking and shearing away a great length of her bulwark for a few seconds they hung together thus and before the seas bore them apart grapnels were thrown from the margaret whereof one forward got hold and brought them bow to bow thus the end of the bowsprit of the margaret projected over the high deck of the san antonio  now for it said peter follow me all and springing up he ran to the bowsprit and began to swarm along it  it was a fearful task one moment the great seas lifted him high into the air and the next down he came again till the massive spar crashed on to the deck of the san antonio with such a shock that he nearly flew from it like a stone from a sling yet he hung on and biding his chance seized a broken stayrope that dangled from the end of the bowsprit like a lash from a whip and began to slide down it the gale caught him and blew him to and fro the vessel pitching wildly jerked him into the air the deck of the san antonio rose up and receded like a thing alive it was nearnot a dozen feet beneath himand loosing his hold he fell upon the forward tower without being hurt then gaining his feet ran to the broken mast and flinging his left arm about it with the other drew his sword  next instanthow he never knewcastell was at his side and after him came two more men but one of these rolled from the deck into the sea and was lost as he vanished the chain of the grappling iron parted and the margaret swung away from them leaving those three alone in the power of their foes nor do what she would could she make fast again as yet however there were no spaniards to be seen for the reason that none had dared to stand upon this high tower whereof the bulwarks were all gone while the bowsprit of the margaret crashed down upon it like a giants club and as she rolled swept it with its point  so there they stood clinging to the mast and waiting for the end for now their friends were a hundred yards away and they knew that their case was desperate a shower of arrows came loosed from other parts of the ship and one of these struck the man with them through the throat so that he fell to the deck clasping at it and presently rolled into the sea also another pierced castell through his right forearm causing his sword to drop and slide away from him peter seized the arrow snapped it in two and drew it out but castells right arm was now helpless and with his left he could do no more than cling to the broken mast  we have done our best son he said and failed margaret will learn that we would have saved her if we could but we shall not meet her here  peter ground his teeth and looked about him desperately for he had no words to say what should he do leave castell and rush for the waist of the ship and so perish or stay and die there nay he would not be butchered like a bird on a bough he would fall fighting  farewell he called through the gale god rest our souls then waiting till the ship steadied herself he ran aft and reaching the ladder that led to her tower staggered down it to the waist of the vessel and at its foot halted holding to the rail  the scene before him was strange enough for there ranged round the bulwarks were the spanish men who watched him curiously whilst a few paces away resting against the mast stood daguilar who lifted his hand in which there was no weapon and addressed him  señor brome he shouted do not move another step or you are a dead man listen to me first and then do what you will am i safe from your sword while i speak  peter nodded his head in assent and daguilar drew nearer for even in that more sheltered place it was hard to hear because of the howling of the tempest  señor he said to peter you are a very brave man and have done a deed such as none of us have seen before therefore i wish to spare you if i may also i have worked you bitter wrong driven to it by the might of love and jealousy for which reason also i wish to spare you to set upon you now would be but murder and whatever else i do i will not murder first let me ease your mind your lady and mine is aboard here but fear not she has come and will come to no harm from me or from any man while i live if for no other reason i do not desire to affront one who i hope will be my wife by her own free will and whom i have brought to spain that she might not make this impossible by becoming yours señor believe me i would no more force a womans will than i would do murder on her lover  what did you then when you snatched her from her home by some foul trick asked peter fiercely  señor i did wrong to her and all of you for which i would make amends  what amends will you give her back to me  no that i cannot do even if she should wish it of which i am not sure nonever while i live  bring her forth and let us hear whether she wishes it or no shouted peter hoping that his words would reach margaret  but daguilar only smiled and shook his head then went on  that i cannot either for it would give her pain still señor i will repay the heavy debt that i owe to you and to you also señor and he bowed towards castell who unseen by peter had crept down the ladder and now stood behind him staring at daguilar with cold rage and indignation you have wrought us much damage have you not hunting us across the seas and killing sundry of us with your arrows and now you have striven to board our ship and put us to the sword a design in which god has frustrated you therefore your lives are justly forfeit and none would blame us if we slew you yet i spare you both if it is possible i will put you back aboard the margaret and if it is not possible you shall be set free ashore to go unmolested whither you will thus i will wipe out my debt and be free of all reproach  do you take me for such a man as yourself asked peter with a bitter laugh i do not leave this ship alive unless my affianced wife mistress margaret goes with me  then señor brome i fear that you will leave it dead as indeed we may all of us unless we make land soon for the vessel is filling fast with water still knowing your metal i looked for some such words from you and am prepared with another offer which i am sure you will not refuse señor our swords are much of the same length shall we measure them against each other i am a grandee of spain the marquis of morella and it will therefore be no dishonour for you to fight with me  i am not so sure said peter for i am more than thatan honest man of england who never practised womanstealing still i will fight you gladly at sea or on shore wherever and whenever we meet till one or both are dead but what is the stake and how do i know that some of these and he pointed to the crew who were listening intently will not stab me from behind  señor i have told you that i do not murder and that would be the foulest murder as for the stake it is margaret to the victor if you kill me on behalf of all my company i swear by our saviours blood that you shall depart with her and her father unharmed and if i kill you then you both shall swear that she shall be left with me and no suit or question raised but to her woman i give liberty who have seen more than enough of her  nay broke in castell speaking for the first time i demand the right to fight with you also when my arm is healed  i refuse it answered daguilar haughtily i cannot lift my sword against an old man who is the father of the maid who shall be my wife and moreover a merchant and a jew nay answer me not lest all these should remember your ill words i will be generous and leave you out of the oath do your worst against me master castell and then leave me to do my worst against you señor brome the light grows bad and the water gains upon us say are you ready  peter nodded his head and they stepped forward  one more word said daguilar dropping his swordpoint my friends you have heard our compact do you swear to abide by it and if i fall to set these two men and the two ladies free on their own ship or on the land for the honour of chivalry and of spain  the captain of the san antonio and his lieutenants answered that they swore on behalf of all the crew  you hear señor brome now these are the conditionsthat we fight to the death but if both of us should be hurt or wounded so that we cannot despatch each other then no further harm shall be done to either of us who shall be tended till we recover or die by the will of god  you mean that we must die on each others swords or not at all and if any foul chance should overtake either other than by his adversarys hand that adversary shall not dispatch him  yes señor for in our case such things may happen and he pointed to the huge seas that towered over them threatening to engulf the waterlogged caravel we will take no advantage of each other who wish to fight this quarrel out with our own right arms  so be it said peter and master castell here is the witness to our bargain  daguilar nodded kissed the crosshilt of his sword in confirmation of the pact bowed courteously and put himself on his defence  for a moment they stood facing each other a wellmatched pairpeter lean fiercefaced longarmed a terrible man to see in the fiery light that broke upon him from beneath the edge of a black cloud the spaniard tall also and agile but to all appearance as unconcerned as though this were but a pleasure bout and not a duel to the death with a womans fate hanging on the hazard daguilar wore a breastplate of goldinlaid black steel and a helmet while peter had but his tunic of bulls hide and ironlined cap though his straight cutandthrust sword was heavier and mayhap half an inch longer than that of his foe  thus then they stood while castell and all the ships company save the helmsman who steered her to the harbours mouth clung to the bulwarks and the cordage of the mainmast and forgetful of their own peril watched in utter silence  it was peter who thrust the first straight at the throat but daguilar parried deftly so that the sword point went past his neck and before it could be drawn back again struck at peter the blow fell upon the side of his steel cap and glanced thence to his left shoulder but being light did him no harm swiftly came the answer which was not light for it fell so heavily upon daguilars breastplate that he staggered back after him sprang peter thinking that the game was his but at that moment the ship which had entered the breakers of the harbour bar rolled terribly and sent them both reeling to the bulwarks nor did she cease her rolling so that smiting and thrusting wildly they staggered backwards and forwards across the deck gripping with their left hands at anything they could find to steady them till at length bruised and breathless they fell apart unwounded and rested awhile  an ill field this to fight on señor gasped daguilar  i think that it will serve our turn said peter grimly and rushed at him like a bull it was just then that a great sea came aboard the ship a mass of green water which struck them both and washed them like straws into the scuppers where they rolled half drowned peter rose the first coughing out salt water and rubbing it from his eyes to see daguilar still upon the deck his sword lying beside him and holding his right wrist with his left hand  who gave you the hurt he asked i or your fall  the fall señor answered daguilar i think that it has broken my wrist but i have still my left hand suffer me to arise and we will finish this fray  as the words passed his lips a gust of wind more furious than any that had gone before concentrated as it was through a gorge in the mountains struck the caravel at the very mouth of the harbour and laid her over on her beam ends for a while it seemed as though she must capsize and sink till suddenly her mainmast snapped like a stick and went overboard when relieved of its weight by slow degrees she righted herself down upon the deck came the cross yard one end of it crashing through the roof of the cabin in which margaret and betty were confined splitting it in two while a block attached to the other fell upon the side of peters head and glancing from the steel cap struck him on the neck and shoulder hurling him senseless to the deck where still grasping his sword he lay with arms outstretched  out of the ruin of the cabin appeared margaret and betty the former very pale and frightened and the latter muttering prayers but as it chanced both uninjured clinging to the tangled ropes they crept forward seeking refuge in the waist of the ship for the heavy spar still worked and rolled above them resting on the wreck of the cabin and the bulwarks whence presently it slid into the sea by the stump of the broken mainmast they halted their long locks streaming in the gale and here it was that margaret caught sight of peter lying upon his back his face red with blood and sliding to and fro as the vessel rolled  she could not speak but in mute appeal pointed first to him and then to daguilar who stood near remembering as she did so her vision in the house at holborn which was thus terribly fulfilled holding to a rope daguilar drew near to her and spoke into her ear lady he said this is no deed of mine we were fighting a fair fight for he had boarded the ship when the mast fell and killed him blame me not for his death but seek comfort from god  she heard and looking round her wildly perceived her father struggling towards her then with a bitter cry fell senseless on his breast    chapter xii  father henriques  the night came down swiftly for a great stormcloud in which jagged lightning played blotted out the last rays of the sunk sun then with rolling thunder and torrents of rain the tempest burst over the sinking ship the mariners could no longer see to steer they knew not whither they were going only the lessened seas told them that they had entered the harbour mouth presently the san antonio struck upon a rock and the shock of it threw castell who was bending over the senseless shape of margaret against the bulwarks and dazed him  there arose a great cry of the vessel founders and water seemed to be pouring on the deck though whether this were from the sea or from the deluge of the falling rain he did not know then came another cry of get out the boat or we perish and a sound of men working in the darkness the ship swung round and round and settled down there was a flash of lightning and by it castell saw betty holding the unconscious margaret in her strong arms she saw him also and screamed to him to come to the boat he started to obey then remembered peter peter might not be dead what should he say to margaret if he left him there to drown he crept to where he lay upon the deck and called to a sailor who rushed by to help him the man answered with a curse and vanished into the deep gloom so unaided castell essayed the task of lifting this heavy body but his right arm being almost useless could do no more than drag it into a sitting posture and thus by slow degrees across the deck to where he imagined the boat to be  but here there was no boat and now the sound of voices came from the other side of the ship so he must drag it back again by the time he reached the starboard bulwarks all was silent and another flash of lightning showed him the boat crowded with people upon the crest of a wave fifty yards or more from him whilst others who had not been able to enter clung to its stern and gunwale he shouted aloud but no answer came either because none were left living on the ship or because in all that turmoil they could not hear him  then castell knowing that he had done everything that he could dragged peter under the overhanging deck of the forward tower which gave some little shelter from the rain and laying his bleeding head upon his knees so that it might be lifted above the wash of the waters sat himself down and began to say prayers after the jewish fashion whilst awaiting his end  that he was about to die he had no doubt for the waist of the ship as he could perceive by the lightning was almost level with the sea which however here in the harbour was now much calmer than it had been this he knew for although the rain still fell steadily and the wind howled above no spray broke over them deeper and deeper sank the caravel as she drifted onwards till at length the water washed over her deck from side to side so that castell was obliged to seat himself on the second step of the ladder down which peter had charged up on the spaniards a while passed and he became aware that the san antonio had ceased to move and wondered what this might mean the storm had rolled away now and he could see the stars also with it went the wind the night grew warmer too which was well for him for otherwise wet as he was he must have perished still it was a long night the longest that ever he had spent nor did any sleep come to relieve his misery or make his end easier for the pain from the arrow wound in his arm kept him awake  so there he sat wondering if margaret was dead as peter seemed to be dead and if so whether their spirits were watching him now watching and waiting till he joined them he thought too of the days of his prosperity until he had seen the accursed face of daguilar and of all the worthless wealth that was his and what would become of it he hoped even that margaret was gone better that she should be dead than live on in shame and misery if there were a god how came it that he could allow such things to happen in the world then he remembered how when job sat in just such an evil case his wife had invited him to curse god and die and how the patriarch had answered to her what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil remembered too after all his troubles what had been the end of that just man and therefrom took some little comfort after this a stupor crept over him and his last thought was that the vessel had sunk and he was departing into the deeps of death                                       listen a voice called and castell awoke to see that it was growing light and that before him supporting himself on the rail of the ladder stood the tall form of peterpeter with a ghastly bloodstained countenance chattering teeth and glazed unnatural eyes  do you live john castell said that hollow voice or are we both dead and in hell  nay he answered i live yet we are still this side of doom  what has chanced asked peter i have been lost in a great blackness  castell told him briefly  peter listened till he had done then staggered to the bulwark rail and looked about him making no comment  i can see nothing he said presentlythe mist is too deep but i think we must lie near the shore come help me let us try to find victuals i am faint  castell rose stretched his cramped limbs and going to him placed his uninjured arm round peters middle and thus supported him towards the stern of the ship where he guessed that the main cabin would be they found and entered it a small place but richly furnished with a carved crucifix screwed to its sternmost wall a piece of pickled meat and some of the hard wheaten cakes such as sailors use lay upon the floor where they had been cast from the table while in a swinging rack above stood flagons of wine and of water castell found a horn mug and filling it with wine gave it to peter who drank greedily then handed it back to him who also drank afterwards they cut off portions of the meat with their knives and swallowed them though peter did this with great difficulty because of the hurt to his head and neck then they drank more wine and somewhat refreshed left the place  the mist was still so thick that they could see nothing and therefore they went into the wreck of that cabin which had been occupied by margaret and betty sat themselves down upon the bed wherein they had slept and waited resting thus peter noted that this cabin had been fitted sumptuously as though for the occupation of a great lady for even the vessels were of silver and in a wardrobe whereof the doors were open hung beautiful gowns also there were a few written books on the outer leaves of one of which margaret had set down some notes and a prayer of her own making petitioning that heaven would protect her that peter and her father might be living and learn the truth of what had befallen and that it would please the saints to deliver her and to bring them together again this book peter thrust away within his jerkin to study at his leisure  now the sun rose suddenly above the eastern range of the mountains wherewith they were surrounded leaving the cabin they climbed to the forecastle tower and gazed about them to find that they were in a landlocked harbour and stranded not more than a hundred yards from the shore by tying a piece of iron to a rope and letting it down into the sea they discovered that they lay upon a ridge and that there were but four feet of water beneath their bow and having learned this determined to wade to the beach first however they went back to the cabin and filled a leather bag they found with food and wine then by an afterthought they searched for the place where daguilar slept and discovered it between decks also a strongbox which they made shift to break open with an iron bar  in it was a great store of gold placed there no doubt for the payment of the crew and with it some jewels the jewels they left but the money they divided and stowed it about them to serve their needs should they come safe ashore then they washed each others wounds and bound them up and descending the ladder which had been thrown over the ships side when the spaniards escaped in the boat let themselves down into the sea and bade farewell to the san antonio  by now the wind had fallen and the sun shone brightly warming their chilled blood also the water which was quite calm did not rise much above their middles so that they were ablethe bottom being smooth and sandyto wade without trouble to the shore as they drew near to it they saw people gathering there and guessed that they came from the little town of motril which lay up the river that here ran into the bay also they saw other thingsnamely the boat of the san antonio upon the shore and rejoiced to know that it had come safe to land for it rested upon its keel with but little water in its bottom lying here and there also were the corpses of drowned men five or six of them no doubt those sailors who had swum after the boat or clung to its gunwale but among these bodies none were those of women  when at length they reached the shore very few people were left there for of the rest some had begun to wade out towards the ship to plunder her whilst others had gone to fetch boats for the same purpose therefore the company who awaited them consisted only of women children three old men and a priest the last a hungryeyed smoothfaced slylooking man advanced to greet them courteously bidding them thank god for their escape  that we do indeed said castell but tell us father where are our companions  there are some of them answered the priest pointing to the dead bodies the rest with the two señoras started two hours ago for granada the marquis of morella from whom i hold this cure told us that his ship had sunk and that no one else was left alive and as the mist hid everything we believed him that is why we were not here before for he added significantly we are poor folk to whom the saints send few wrecks  how did they go to granada father asked castell on foot  nay señor they took all the horses and mules in the village by force though the marquis promised that he would return them and pay for their hire later and we trusted him because we must the ladies wept much and prayed us to take them in and keep them but this the marquis would not allow although they seemed so sad and weary god send that we see our good beasts back again he added piously  have you any left for us we have a little money and can pay for them if they be not too dear  not one señornot one the place has been cleared even down to the mares in foal but indeed you seem scarcely fit to ride at present who have undergone so much and he pointed to peters wounded head and castells bandaged arm why do you not stay and rest awhile  because i am the father of one of the señoras and doubtless she thinks me drowned and this señor is her affianced husband answered castell briefly  ah said the priest looking at them with interest then what relation to her is the marquis well perhaps i had better not ask for this is no confessional is it i understand that you are anxious for that great grandee has the reputation of being gayan excellent son of the church but without doubt very gay and he shook his shaven head and smiled but come up to the village señors where you can rest and have your hurts attended to afterwards we will talk  we had best go said castell in english to peter there are no horses on this beach and we cannot walk to granada in our state  peter nodded and led by the priest whose name they discovered to be henriques they started  on the crest of the hill a few hundred paces away they turned and looked back to see that every ablebodied inhabitant of the village seemed by now to be engaged in plundering the stranded vessel  they are paying themselves for the mules and horses said fray henriques with a shrug so i see answered castell but you and he stopped  oh do not be afraid for me replied the priest with a cunning little smile the church does not loot but in the end the church gets her share these are a pious folk only when he learns that the caravel did not sink after all i fear the marquis will demand an account of us  then they limped on over the hill and presently saw the whitewalled and redroofed village beneath them on the banks of the river  five minutes later their guide stopped at a door in a roughly paved street which he opened with a key  my humble dwelling when i am in residence here and not at granada he said in which i shall be honoured to receive you look near by is the church  then they entered a patio or courtyard where some orangetrees grew round a fountain of water and a lifesized crucifix stood against the wall as he passed this sacred emblem peter bowed and crossed himself an example that castell did not follow the priest looked at him sharply  surely señor he said you should do reverence to the symbol of our saviour who by his mercy have just been saved from the death which the marquis told me had overtaken both of you  my right arm is hurt answered castell readily so i must do that reverence in my heart  i understand señor but if you are a stranger to this country which you do not seem to be who speak its tongue so well with your permission i will warn you that here it is wise not to confine your reverences to the heart of late the directors of the inquisition have become somewhat strict and expect that the outward forms should be observed as well indeed when i was a familiar of the holy office at seville i have seen men burned for the neglect of them you have two arms and a head señor also a knee that can be bent  pardon me answered castell to this lecture i was thinking of other matters the carrying off of my daughter at the hands of your patron the marquis of morella for instance  then making no reply the priest led them through his sittingroom to a bedchamber with high barred windows that although it was large and lofty reminded them somehow of a prison cell here he left them saying that he would go to find the local surgeon who it seemed was a barber also if indeed he were not engaged in lightening the ship recommending them meanwhile to take off their wet clothes and lie down to rest  a woman having brought hot water and some loose garments in which to wrap themselves while their own were drying they undressed and washed and afterwards utterly worn out threw themselves down and fell asleep upon the beds having first hidden away their gold in the food bag which peter placed beneath his pillow two hours later or more they were awakened by the arrival of father henriques and the barbersurgeon accompanied by the womanservant and who brought them back their clothes cleaned and dried  when the surgeon saw peters hurt to the left side of his neck and shoulder which now were black swollen and very stiff he shook his head and said that time and rest alone could cure it and that he must have been born under a fortunate star to have escaped with his life which save for his steel cap and leather jerkin he would never have done as no bones were broken however all that he could do was to dress the parts with some soothing ointment and cover them with clean cloths this finished he turned to castells wound that was through the fleshy part of the right forearm and having syringed it out with warm water and oil bound it up saying that he would be well in a week he added drily that the gale must have been fiercer even than he thought since it could blow an arrow through a mans arma saying at which the priest pricked up his ears  to this castell made no answer but producing a piece of morellas gold offered it to him for his services asking him at the same time to procure them mules or horses if he could the barber promised to try to do so and being well pleased with his fee which was a great one for motril said that he would see them again in the evening and if he could hear of any beasts would tell them of it then also he promised to bring them some clothes and cloaks of spanish make since those they had were not fit to travel in through that country being soiled and bloodstained  after he had gone and the priest with him who was busy seeing to the division of the spoils from the ship and making sure of his own share the servant a good soul brought them soup which they drank then they lay down again upon the beds and talked together as to what they should do  castell was downhearted pointing out that they were still as far from margaret as ever who was now once more lost to them and in the hand of morella whence they could scarcely hope to snatch her it would seem also that she was being taken to the moorish city of granada if she were not already there where christian law and justice had no power  when he had heard him out peter whose heart was always stout answered  god has as much power in granada as in london or on the seas whence he has saved us i think sir that we have great reason to be thankful to god seeing that we are both alive today who might so well have been dead and that margaret is alive also and as we believe unharmed further this spanish thief of women is it would seem a strange man that is if there be any truth in his words for although he could steal her it appears that he cannot find it in his heart to do her violence but is determined to win her only with her own consent which i think will not be had readily also he shrinks from murder who when he could have butchered us did not do so  i have known such men before said castell who hold some sins venial but others deadly to their souls it is a fruit of superstition  then sir let us pray that morellas superstitions may remain strong and get us to granada as quickly as we can for there remember you have friends both among the jews and moors who have traded with the place for many years and these may give us shelter therefore though things are bad still they might be worse  that is so answered castell more cheerfully if indeed she has been taken to granada and as to this we will try to learn something from the barber or the father henriques  i put no faith in that priest a sly fellow who is in the pay of morella answered peter  then they were silent being still very weary and having nothing more to say but much to think about  about sundown the doctor came back and dressed their wounds he brought with him a stock of clothes of spanish make hats and two heavy cloaks fit to travel in which they bought from him at a good price also he said that he had two fine mules in the courtyard and castell went out to look at them they were sorry beasts enough being poor and wayworn but as no others were to be had they returned to the room to talk as to the price of them and their saddles the chaffering was long for he asked twice their value which castell said poor shipwrecked men could not pay but in the end they struck a bargain under which the barber was to keep and feed the mules for the night and bring them round next morning with a guide who would show them the road to granada meanwhile they paid him for the clothes but not for the beasts  also they tried to learn something from him about the marquis of morella but like the fray henriques the man was cunning and kept his mouth shut saying that it was ill for poor men like himself to chatter of the great and that at granada they could hear everything so he went away leaving some medicine for them to drink and shortly afterwards the priest appeared  he was in high goodhumour having secured those jewels which they had left behind in the iron coffer as his share of the spoil of the ship taking note of him as he showed and fondled them castell added up the man and concluded that he was very avaricious one who hated the poverty in which he had been reared and would do much for money indeed when he spoke bitterly of the thieves who had been at the ships strongbox and taken nearly all the gold castell determined that he must never know who those thieves were lest they should meet with some accident on their journey  at length the trinkets were put away and the priest said that they must sup with him but lamented that he had no wine to give them who was forced to drink water whereon castell prayed him to procure a few flasks of the best at their charges which nothing loth he sent his servant out to do  so dressed in their new spanish clothes and having all the gold hidden about them in two moneybelts that they had bought from the barber at the same time they went in to supper which consisted of a spanish dish called olla podridaa kind of rich stewbread cheese and fruit also the wine that they had bought was there very good and strong and whilst taking but little of it themselves for fear they should fever their wounds they persuaded father henriques to drink heartily so that in the end he forgot his cunning and spoke with freedom then seeing that he was in a ripe humour castell asked him about the marquis of morella and how it happened that he had a house in the moorish capital of granada  because he is half a moor answered the priest his father it is said was the prince of viana and his mother a lady of royal moorish blood from whom he inherited great wealth and his lands and palace in granada there too he loves to dwell who although he is so good a christian by faith has many heathen tastes and like the moors surrounds himself with a seraglio of beautiful women as i know for often i act as his chaplain as in granada there are no priests moreover there is a purpose in all this for being partly of their blood he is accredited to the court of their sultan boabdil by ferdinand and isabella in whose interests he works in secret for strangers you should know if you do not know it already that their majesties have for long been at war against the moor and purpose to take what remains of his kingdom from him and make it christian as they have already taken malaga and purified it by blood and fire from the accursed stain of infidelity  yes said castell we heard that in england for i am a merchant who have dealings with granada whither i am going on my affairs  on what affairs then goes the señora who you say is your daughter and what is that story that the sailors told of about a fight between the san antonio and an english ship which indeed we saw in the offing yesterday and why did the wind blow an arrow through your arm friend merchant and how came it that you two were left aboard the caravel when the marquis and his people escaped  you ask many questions holy father peter fill the glass of his reverence he drinks nothing who thinks that it is always lent your health father ah well emptied fill it again peter and pass me the flask now i will begin to answer you with the story of the shipwreck and he commenced an endless tale of the winds and sails and rocks and masts carried away and of the english ship that tried to help the spanish ship and so forth till at length the priest whose glass peter filled whenever his head was turned fell back in his chair asleep  now whispered peter in english across the table to castellnow i think that we had best go to bed for we have learned much from this holy spyas i take him to beand told little  so they crept away quietly to their chamber and having swallowed the draught that the doctor had given them said their prayers each in his own fashion locked the door and lay down to rest as well as their wounds and sore anxieties would allow them    chapter xiii  the adventure of the inn  peter did not sleep well for notwithstanding all the barbers dressing his hurt pained him much moreover he was troubled by the thought that margaret must be sure that both he and her father were dead and of the sufferings of her sore heart whenever he dozed off he seemed to see her awake and weeping yes and to hear her sobs and murmurings of his name when the first light of dawn crept through the highbarred windows he arose and called castell for they could not dress without each others help then they waited until they heard the sound of men talking and of beasts stamping in the courtyard without guessing that this was the barber with the mules they unlocked their door and finding the servant yawning in the passage persuaded her to let them out of the house  the barber it was sure enough and with him a oneeyed youth mounted on a pony who he said would guide them to granada so they returned with him into the house where he looked at their wounds shaking his head over that of peter who he said ought not to travel so soon after this came more haggling as to the price of the mules saddlery saddlebags in which they packed their few spare clothes hire of the guide and his horse and so forth since anxious as they were to get away they did not dare to seem to have money to spare  at length everything was settled and as their host father henriques had not yet appeared they determined to depart without bidding him farewell leaving some money in acknowledgment of his hospitality and as a gift to his church whilst they were handing it over to the servant however together with a fee for herself the priest joined them unshaven and holding his hand to his tonsured head whilst he explained what was not true that he had been celebrating some early mass in the church then asked whither they were going  they told him and pressed their gift upon him which he accepted nothing loth though its liberality seemed to make him more urgent to delay their departure they were not fit to travel the roads were most unsafe they would be taken captive by the moors and thrown into a dungeon with the christian prisoners no one could enter granada without a passport he declared and so forth to all of which they answered that they must go  now he appeared to be much disturbed and said finally that they would bring him into trouble with the marquis of morellahow or why he would not explain though peter guessed that it might be lest the marquis should learn from them that this priest his chaplain had been plundering the ship which he thought sunk and possessing himself of his jewels at length seeing that the man meant mischief and would stop them in some fashion if they delayed they bade him farewell hastily and pushing past him mounted the mules that stood outside and rode away with their guide  as they went they heard the priest who now was in a rage abusing the barber who had sold them the beasts and caught the words spies english señoras and commands of the marquis so that they were glad when at length they found themselves outside the town where as yet few were stirring and riding unmolested on the road to granada  this road proved to be no good one and very hilly moreover the mules were even worse than they had thought that which peter rode stumbling continually now they asked the youth their guide how long it would take them to reach granada but all he answered them was  quien sabe who knows it depends upon the will of god  an hour later they asked him again whereon he replied  perhaps tonight perhaps tomorrow perhaps never as there were many thieves about and if they escaped the thieves they would probably be captured by the moors  i think there is one thief very near to us said peter in english looking at this illfavoured young man then added in his broken spanish friend if we fall in with robbers or moors the first one who dies will be yourself and he tapped the hilt of his sword  the lad uttered a spanish curse and turned the head of his pony round as though he would ride back to motril then changed his mind and pushed on a long way in front of them nor could they come near him again for hours so hard was the road and so feeble were the mules that notwithstanding a midday halt to rest them it was nightfall before they reached the top of the sierra and in the last sunset glow separated from them by the rich vega or plain saw the minarets and palaces of granada now they wished to push on but their guide swore that it was impossible as in the dark they would fall over precipices while descending to the plain there was a venta or inn near by he said where they could sleep starting again at dawn  when castell said that they did not wish to go to an inn he answered that they must since they had eaten what food they had and here on the road there was no fodder for the beasts so reluctantly enough they consented knowing that unless they were fed the mules would never carry them to granada whereon the guide pointing out the house to them a lonely place in a valley about a hundred yards from the road said that he would go on to make arrangements and galloped off  as they approached this hostelry which was surrounded by a rough wall for purposes of defence they saw the oneeyed youth engaged in earnest conversation with a fat illfavoured man who had a great knife stuck in his girdle advancing to them bowing this man said that he was the host and in reply to their request for food and a room told them that they could have both  they rode into the courtyard whereon the innkeeper locked the door in the wall behind them explaining that it was to keep out robbers and adding that they were fortunate to be where they could sleep quite safely then a moor came and led away their mule to the stable and they accompanied the landlord into the sittingroom a long low apartment furnished with tables and benches on which sat several roughlooking fellows drinking wine here the host suddenly demanded payment in advance saying that he did not trust strangers peter would have argued with him but castell thinking it best to comply unbuttoned his garments to get at his money for he had no loose coin in his pocket having paid away the last at motril  his right hand being still helpless this he did with his left and so awkwardly that the small doubloon he took hold of slipped from his fingers and fell on to the floor forgetting that he had not refastened the belt he bent down to pick it up whereon a number of gold pieces of various sorts perhaps twenty of them fell out and rolled hither and thither on the ground peter watching saw the landlord and the other men in the room exchange a quick and significant glance they rose however and assisted to find the money which the host returned to castell remarking with an unpleasant smile that if he had known that his guests were so rich he would have charged them more for their accommodation  of your good heart i pray you not answered castell for that is all our worldly goods and even as he spoke another gold piece this time a large doubloon which had remained in his clothing slipped to the floor  of course señor the host replied as he picked this up also and handed it back politely but shake yourself there may still be a coin or two in your doublet castell did so whereon the gold in his belt loosened by what had fallen out rattled audibly and the audience smiled again while the host congratulated him on the fact that he was in an honest house and not wandering on the mountains which were the home of so many bad men  having pocketed his money with the best grace he could and buckled his belt beneath his robe castell and peter sat down at a table a little apart and asked if they could have some supper the host assented and called to the moorish servant to bring food then sat down also and began to put questions to them of a sort which showed that their guide had already told all their story  how did you learn of our shipwreck asked castell by way of answer  how why from the people of the marquis who stopped here to drink a cup of wine when he passed to granada yesterday with his company and two señoras he said that the san antonio had sunk but told us nothing of your being left aboard of her  then forgive us friend if we whose business is of no interest to you copy his discretion as we are weary and would rest  certainly señorscertainly replied the man i go to hasten your supper and to fetch you a flask of the wine of granada worthy of your degree and he left them  a while later their food camegood meat enough of its sortand with it the wine in an earthenware jug which as he filled their horn mugs the host said he had poured out of the flask himself that the crust of it might not slip castell thanked him and asked him to drink a cup to their good journey but he declined answering that it was a fast day with him on which he was sworn to touch only water now peter who had said nothing all this time but noted much just touched the wine with his lips and smacked them as though in approbation while he whispered in english to castell  drink it not it is drugged  what says your son asked the host  he says that it is delicious but suddenly he has remembered what i too forgot that the doctor at motril forbade us to touch wine for fear lest we should worsen the hurts that we had in the shipwreck well let it not be wasted give it to your friends we must be content with thinner stuff and taking up a jug of water that stood upon the table he filled an empty cup with it and drank then passed it to peter while the host looked at them sourly  then as though by an afterthought castell rose and politely presented the jug of wine and the two filled mugs to the men who were sitting at a table close by saying that it was a pity that they should not have the benefit of such fine liquor one of these fellows as it chanced was their own guide who had come in from tending the mules they took the mugs readily enough and two of them tossed off their contents whereon with a smothered oath the landlord snatched away the jug and vanished with it  castell and peter went on with their meal for they saw their neighbours eating of the same dish as did the landlord also who had returned and it seemed to peter was watching the two men who had drunk the wine with an anxious eye presently one of these rose from the table and going to a bench on the other side of the room flung himself down upon it and became quite silent while their oneeyed guide stretched out his arms and fell face forward so that his head rested on an empty plate where he remained apparently insensible the host sprang up and stood irresolute and castell rising said that evidently the poor lad was sleepy after his long ride and as they were the same would he be so courteous as to show them to their room  he assented readily indeed it was clear that he wished to be rid of them for the other men were staring at the guide and their companion and muttering amongst themselves  this way señors he said and led them to the end of the place where a broad stepladder stood going up it a lamp in his hand he opened a trapdoor and called to them to follow him which castell did peter however first turned and said goodnight to the company who were watching them at the same moment as though by accident or thoughtlessly half drawing his sword from its scabbard then he too went up the ladder and found himself with the others in an attic  it was a bare place the only furniture in it being two chairs and two rough wooden bedsteads without heads to them mere trestles indeed that stood about three feet apart against a boarded partition which appeared to divide this room from some other attic beyond also there was a hole in the wall immediately beneath the eaves of the house that served the purpose of a window over which a sack was nailed we are poor folk said the landlord as they glanced round this comfortless garret but many great people have slept well here as doubtless you will also and he turned to descend the ladder  it will serve answered castell but friend tell your men to leave the stable open as we start at dawn and be so good as to give me that lamp  i cannot spare the lamp he grunted sulkily with his foot already on the first step  peter strode to him and grasped his arm with one hand while with the other he seized the lamp the man cursed and began to fumble at his belt as though for a knife whereon peter putting out his strength twisted his arm so fiercely that in his pain he loosed the lamp which remained in peters hand the innkeeper made a grab at it missed his footing and rolled down the ladder falling heavily on the floor below  watching from above to their relief they saw him pick himself up and heard him begin to revile them shaking his fist and vowing vengeance then peter shut down the trapdoor it was ill fitted so that the edge of it stood up above the flooring also the bolt that fastened it had been removed although the staples in which it used to work remained peter looked round for some stick or piece of wood to pass through these staples but could find nothing then he bethought him of a short length of cord that he had in his pocket which served to tie one of the saddlebags in its place on his mule this he fastened from one staple to the other so that the trapdoor could not be lifted more than an inch or two  reflecting that this might be done and the cord cut with a knife passed through the opening he took one of the chairs and stood it so that two of its legs rested on the edge of the trapdoor and the other two upon the boarding of the floor then he said to castell  we are snared birds but they must get into the cage before they wring our necks that wine was poisoned and if they can they will murder us for our moneyor because they have been told to do so by the guide we had best keep awake tonight  i think so answered castell anxiously listen they are talking down below  talking they were as though they debated something but after a while the sound of voices died away when all was silent they hunted round the attic but could find nothing that was unusual to such places peter looked at the windowhole and as it was large enough for a man to pass through tried to drag one of the beds beneath it thinking that if any such attempt were made he who lay thereon would have the thief at his mercy only to find however that these were screwed to the floor and immovable as there was nothing more that they could do they went and sat upon these beds their bare swords in their hands and waited a long while but nothing happened  at length the lamp which had been flickering feebly for some time went out lacking oil and except for the light which crept through the windowplace for now they had torn away the sacking that hung over it they were in darkness  a little while later they heard the sound of a horses hoofs and the door of the house open and shut after which there was more talking below and mingling with it a new voice which peter seemed to remember  i have it he whispered to castell here is our late host father henriques come to see how his guests are faring  another halfhour and the waning moon rose throwing a beam of light into their chamber also they heard horses hoofs again going to the window peter looked out of it and saw the horse a fine beast being held by the landlord then a man came and mounted it and at some remark of his turned his face upwards towards their window it was that of father henriques  the two whispered together for a while till the priest blessed the landlord in latin words and rode away and again they heard the door of the house close  he is off to granada to warn morella his master of our coming said castell as they reseated themselves upon the beds  to warn morella that we shall never come perhaps but we will beat him yet replied peter  the night wore on and castell who was very weary sank back upon the bolster and began to doze when suddenly the chair that was set upon the trapdoor fell over with a great clatter and he sprang up asking what that noise might be  only a rat answered peter who saw no good in telling him the truthnamely that thieves or murderers had tried to open the trapdoor  then he crept down the room felt the cord to find that it was still uncut and replaced the chair where it had been this done peter came back to the bed and threw himself down upon it as though he would slumber though never was he more wide awake the weariness of castell had overcome him again however for he snored at his side  for a long while nothing further happened although once the ray of moonlight was cut off and for an instant peter thought that he saw a face at the window if so it vanished and returned no more now from behind their heads came faint sounds like those of stifled breathing like those of naked feet then a slight creaking and scratching in the walla mouses tooth might have caused itand suddenly right in that ray of moonlight a cruellooking knife and a naked arm projected through the panelling  the knife flickered for a second over the breast of the sleeping castell as though it were a living thing that chose the spot where it would strike one secondonly onefor the next peter had drawn himself up and with a sweep of the sword which lay unscabbarded at his side had shorn that arm off above the elbow just where it projected from the panelling  what was that asked castell again as something fell upon him  a snake answered peter a poisonous snake wake up now and look  castell obeyed staring in silence at the horrible arm which still clasped the great knife while from beyond the panelling there came a stifled groan then a sound as of a heavy body stumbling away  come said peter let us be going unless we would stop here for ever that fellow will soon be back to seek his arm  going how asked castell  there seems to be but one road and that a rough one through the window and over the wall answered peter ah there they come i thought so and as he spoke they heard the sound of men scrambling up the ladder  they ran to the windowplace and looked out but there seemed to be no one below and it was not more than twelve feet from the ground peter helped castell through it then holding his sound arm with both his own lowered him as far as he could and let go he dropped on to his feet fell to the ground then rose again unhurt peter was about to follow him when he heard the chair tumble over again and looking round saw the trapdoor open to fall back with a crash they had cut the cord  the figure of a man holding a knife appeared in the faint light followed by the head of another man now it was too late for him to get through the windowplace safely if he attempted it he would be stabbed in the back so grasping his sword with both hands peter leapt at that man aiming a great stroke at his shadowy mass it fell upon him somewhere for down he went and lay quite still by now the second man had his knee upon the edge of flooring peter thrust him through and he sank backwards on to the heads of others who were following him sweeping the ladder with his weight so that all of them tumbled in a heap at its foot save one who hung to the edge of the trap frame by his hands peter slammed its door to crushing them so that he loosed his grip with a howl then as he had nothing else he dragged the body of the dead man on to it and left him there  next he rushed to the window sheathing his sword as he ran scrambled through it and hanging by his arms let himself drop coming to the ground safely for he was very agile and in the excitement of the fray forgot the hurt to his head and shoulder  where now asked castell as he stood by him panting  to the stable for the mules no it is useless we have no time to saddle them and the outer gate is locked the wallthe wallwe must climb it they will be after us in a minute  they ran thither and found that though ten feet high fortunately this wall was built of rough stone which gave an easy foothold peter scrambled up first then lying across its top stretched down his hand to castell and with difficultyfor the man was heavy and crippleddragged him to his side just then they heard a voice from their garret shout  the english devils have gone get to the door and cut them off  come on said peter so together they climbed or rather fell down the wall on to a mass of pricklypear bush which broke the shock but tore them so sorely in a score of places that they could have shrieked with the pain somehow they freed themselves and bleeding all over broke from that accursed bush struggling up the bank of the ditch in which it grew ran for the road and along it towards granada  before they had gone a hundred yards they heard shoutings and guessed that they were being followed just here the road crossed a ravine full of boulders and rough scrubby growth whereas beyond it was bare and open peter seized castell and dragged him up this ravine till they came to a place where behind a great stone there was a kind of hole filled with bushes and tall dead grass into which they plunged and hid themselves  draw your sword he said to castell if they find us we will die as well as we can  he obeyed holding it in his left hand  they heard the robbers run along the road then seeing that they had missed their victims these returned again five or six of them and fell to searching the ravine but the light was very bad for here the rays of the moon did not penetrate and they could find nothing presently two of them halted within five paces of them and began to talk saying that the swine must still be hidden in the yard or perhaps had doubled back for motril  i dont know where they are hidden answered the other man but this is a poor business fat pedros arm is cut clean off and i expect he will bleed to death while two of the other fellows are dead or dying for that longlegged englishman hits hard to say nothing of those who drank the drugged wine and look as though they would never wake yes a poor business to get a few doubloons and please a priest but oh if i had the hogs here i and he hissed out a horrible threat meanwhile we had best lie up at the mouth of this place in case they should still be hidden here  peter heard him and listened all the other men had gone running back along the road his blood was up and the thorn pricks stung him sorely saying no word out of his lair he came with that terrible sword of his aloft  the men caught sight of him and gave a gasp of fear it was the last sound that one of them ever made then the other turned and ran like a hare this was he who had uttered the threat  stop whispered peter as he overtook himstop and do what you promised  the brute turned and asked for mercy but got none  it was needful said peter to castell presently you heardthey were going to wait for us  i do not think that they will try to murder any more englishmen at that inn panted castell as he ran along beside him    chapter xiv  inez and her garden  for two hours or more john castell and peter travelled on the granada road running when it was smooth walking when it was rough and stopping from time to time to get their breath and listen but the night was quite silent no one seemed to be pursuing them evidently the remaining cutthroats had either taken another way or having their fill of this adventure wanted to see no more of peter and his sword  at length the dawn broke over the great misty plain for now they were crossing the vega then the sun rose and dispelled the vapours and a dozen miles or more away they saw granada on its hill they saw each other also and a sorry sight they were torn by the sharp thorns and stained with blood from their scratches peter was bareheaded too for he had lost his cap and almost beside himself now that the excitement had left him from lack of sleep pain and weariness moreover as the sun rose it grew fearfully hot upon that plain and its fierce rays striking full upon his head seemed to stupefy him so that at last they were obliged to halt and weave a kind of hat out of corn and grasses which gave him so strange an appearance that some moors whom they met going to their toil thought that he must be a madman and ran away  still they crawled forward refreshing themselves with water whenever they could find any in the irrigation ditches that these people used for their crops but covering little more than a mile an hour towards noon the heat grew so dreadful that they were obliged to lie down to rest under the shade of some palmlike trees and here absolutely outworn they sank into a kind of sleep  they were awakened by a sound of voices and staggered to their feet drawing their swords for they thought that the thieves from the inn had overtaken them instead of these ruffianly murderers however they saw before them a body of eight moors beautifully mounted upon white horses and clad in turbans and flowing robes the like of which peter had never yet beheld who sat there regarding them gravely with their quiet eyes and as it seemed not without pity  put up your swords señors said the leader of these moors in excellent spanishindeed he seemed to be a spaniard dressed in eastern garmentsfor we are many and fresh and you are but two and wounded  they obeyed who could do nothing else  now tell us though there is little need to ask went on the captain you are those men of england who boarded the san antonio and escaped when she was sinking are you not  castell nodded then answered  we boarded her to seek  never mind what you sought the captain answered the names of exalted ladies should not be mentioned before strange men but you have been in trouble again since then at the inn yonder where this tall señor bore himself very bravely oh we have heard all the story and give him honour who can wield a sword so well in the dark  we thank you said castell but what is your business with us  señor we are sent by our master his excellency the high lord and marquis of morella to find you and bring you to be his guests at granada  so the priest has told i thought as much muttered peter  we pray you to come without trouble as we do not wish to do any violence to such gallant men went on the captain be pleased to mount two of these horses and ride with us  i am a merchant with friends of my own at granada answered castell cannot we go to them who do not seek the hospitality of the marquis  señor our orders are otherwise and here the word of our master the marquis is a law that may not be broken  i thought that boabdil was king of granada said castell  without doubt he is king señor and by the grace of allah will remain so but the marquis is allied to him in blood also while the truce lasts he is a representative of their majesties of spain in our city and at a sign two of the moors dismounted and led forward their horses holding the stirrups and offering to help them to the saddle  there is nothing for it said peter we must go so awkwardly enough for they were very stiff they climbed on to the beasts and rode away with their captors  the sun was sinking now for they had slept long and by the time they reached the gates of granada the muezzins were calling to the sunset prayer from the minarets of the mosques  it was but a very dim and confused idea that peter gathered of the great city of the moors as surrounded by their whiterobed escort he rode he knew not whither narrow winding streets white houses shuttered windows crowds of courteous somewhat silent people all men and all clad in those same strange flowing dresses who looked at them curiously and murmured words which afterwards he came to learn meant christian prisoners or sometimes christian dogs fretted and pointed arches and a vast fairylike building set upon a hill he was dazed with pain and fatigue as a longlegged bloodstained figure crowned with his quaint hat of grasses he rode through that wondrous and imperial place  yet no man laughed at him absurd as he must have seemed but perhaps this was because under the grotesqueness of his appearance they recognised something of his quality or they might have heard rumours of his swordplay at the inn and on the ship at any rate their attitude was that of courteous dislike of the christian mingled with respect for the brave man in misfortune  at length after mounting a long rise they came to a palace on a mount facing the vast redwalled fortress which seemed to dominate the place which he afterwards knew as the alhambra but separated from it by a valley this palace was a very great building set on three sides of a square and surrounded by gardens wherein tall cypresstrees pointed to the tender sky they rode through the gardens and sundry gateways till they came to a courtyard where servants with torches in their hands ran out to meet them somebody helped him off his horse somebody supported him up a flight of marble steps beneath which a fountain splashed into a great cool room with an ornamented roof then peter remembered no more                                       a time went by a long long timein fact it was nearly a monthbefore peter really opened his eyes to the world again not that he had been insensible for all this whilethat is quitefor at intervals he had become aware of that large cool room and of people talking about himespecially of a darkeyed lightfooted and pretty woman with a white wimple round her face who appeared to be in charge of him occasionally he thought that this must be margaret and yet knew that it could not for she was different also he remembered that once or twice he had seemed to see the haughty handsome face of morella bending over him as though he watched curiously to learn whether he would live or not and then had striven to rise to fight him and been pressed back by the soft white hands of the woman that yet were so terribly strong  now when he awoke at last it was to see her sitting there with a ray of sunlight from some upper window falling on her face sitting with her chin resting on her hand and her elbow on her knee and contemplating him with a pretty puzzled look she made a sweet picture thus he thought then he spoke to her in his slow spanish for somehow he knew that she would not understand his own tongue  you are not margaret he said  at once the dream went out of the womans soft eyes she became intensely interested and rising advanced towards him a very gracious figure who seemed to sway as she walked  no no she said bending over him and touching his forehead with her taper fingers my name is inez you wander still señor  inez what he asked  inez only she answered inez a woman of granada the rest is lost inez the nurse of sick men señor  where then is margaretthe english margaret  a veil of secrecy seemed to fall over the womans face and her voice changed as she answered no longer ringing true or so it struck his senses made quick and subtle by the fires of fever  i know no english margaret do you then love herthis english margaret  aye he answered she was stolen from me i have followed her from far and suffered much is she dead or living  i have told you señor i know nothing althoughand again the voice became naturalit is true that i thought you loved somebody from your talk in your illness  peter pondered a while then he began to remember and asked again  where is castell  castell was he your companion the man with a hurt arm who looked like a jew i do not know where he is in another part of the city perhaps i think that he was sent to his friends question me not of such matters who am but your sicknurse you have been very ill señor look and she handed him a little mirror made of polished silver then seeing that he was too weak to take it held it before him  peter saw his face and groaned for except the red scar upon his cheek it was ivory white and wasted to nothing  i am glad margaret did not see me like this he said with an attempt at a smile bearded too and what a beard lady how could you have nursed one so hideous  i have not found you hideous she answered softly besides that is my trade but you must not talk you must rest drink this and rest and she gave him soup in a silver bowl which he swallowed readily enough and went to sleep again  some days afterwards when peter was well on the road to convalescence his beautiful nurse came and sat by him a look of pity in her tender eastern eyes  what is it now inez he asked noting her changed face  señor pedro you spoke to me a while ago when you woke up from your long sleep of a certain margaret did you not well i have been inquiring of this dona margaret and have no good news to tell of her  peter set his teeth and said  go on tell me the worst  this margaret was travelling with the marquis of morella was she not  she had been stolen by him answered peter  alas it may be so but here in spain and especially here in granada that will scarcely screen the name of one who has been known to travel with the marquis of morella  so much the worse for the marquis of morella when i meet him again answered peter sternly what is your story nurse inez  she looked with interest at his grim thin face but as it seemed to him with no displeasure  a sad one as i have told you a sad one it seems that the other day this señora was found dead at the foot of the tallest tower of the marquiss palace though whether she fell from it or was thrown from it none know  peter gasped and was silent for a while then asked  did you see her dead  no señor others saw her  and told you to tell me nurse inez i do not believe your tale if the dona margaret my betrothed were dead i should know it but my heart tells me that she is alive  you have great faith señor said the woman with a note of admiration in her voice which she could not suppress but as he observed without contradicting him  i have faith he answered nothing else is left but so far it has been a good crutch  peter made no further allusion to the subject only presently he asked  tell me where am i  in a prison señor  oh a prison with a beautiful woman for jailer and other beautiful womenand he pointed to a fair creature who had brought something into the roomas servants a very fine prison also and he looked about him at the marbles and arches and lovely carving  there are men without the gate not women she replied smiling  i daresay captives can be tied with ropes of silk can they not well whose is this prison  she shook her head  i do not know señor the moorish kings perhapsyou yourself have said that i am only the jailer  then who pays you  perhaps i am not paid señor perhaps i work for love and she glanced at him swiftly or hate and her face changed  not hate of me i think said peter  no señor not hate of you why should i hate you who have been so helpless and so courteous to me and she bent the knee to him a little  why indeed especially as i am also grateful to you who have nursed me back to life but then why hide the truth from a helpless man  inez glanced about her the room was empty now she bent over him and whispered  have you never been forced to hide the truth no i read it in your face and you are not a womanan erring woman  they looked into each others eyes a while then peter asked is the dona margaret really dead  i do not know she answered i was told so and as though she feared lest she should betray herself inez turned and left him quickly  the days went by and through the slow degrees of convalescence peter grew strong again but they brought him no added knowledge he did not know where he dwelt or why he was there all he knew was that he lived a prisoner in a sumptuous palace or as he suspected for of this he could not be sure since the arched windows of one side of the building were walled up in the wing of a palace nobody came near to him except the fair inez and a moor who either was deaf or could understand nothing that he said to him in spanish there were other women about it is true very pretty women all of them who acted as servants but none of these were allowed to approach him he only saw them at a distance  therefore inez was his sole companion and with her he grew very intimate to a certain extent but no further on the occasion that has been described she had lifted a corner of her veil which hid her true self but a long while passed before she enlarged her confidence the veil was kept down very close indeed day by day he questioned her and day by day without the slightest show of irritation or even annoyance she parried his questions they knew perfectly well that they were matching their wits against each other but as yet inez had the best of the game which indeed she seemed to enjoy he would talk to her also of all sorts of thingsthe state of spain the moorish court the danger that threatened granada whereof the great siege now drew near and so forthand of these matters she would discourse most intelligently with the result that he learned much of the state of politics in castile and granada and greatly improved his knowledge of the spanish tongue  but when of a sudden as he did again and again he sprang some question on her about morella or margaret or john castell that same subtle change would come over her face and the same silence would seal her lips  señor she said to him one day with a laugh you ask me of secrets which i might reveal to youperhapsif you were my husband or my love but which you cannot expect a nurse whose life hangs on it to answer not that i wish you to become my husband or my lover she added with a little nervous laugh  peter looked at her with his grave eyes  i know that you do not wish that he said for how could i attract one so gay and beautiful as you are  you seem to attract the english margaret she replied quickly in a nettled voice  to have attracted you mean as you tell me that she is dead he answered and seeing her mistake inez bit her lip but he went on i was going to add though it may have no value for you that you have attracted me as your true friend  friend she said opening her large eyes what talk is this can the woman inez find a friend in a man who is under sixty  it would appear so he answered and again with that graceful little curtsey of hers she went away leaving him very puzzled two days later she appeared in his room evidently much disturbed  i thought that you had left me altogether and i am glad to see you for i tire of that deaf moor and of this fine room i want fresh air  i know it she answered so i have come to take you to walk in a garden  he leapt for joy at her words and snatching at his sword which had been left to him buckled it on  you will not need that she said  i thought that i should not need it in yonder inn but i did he answered whereat she laughed then turned put her hand upon his shoulder and spoke to him earnestly  see friend she whispered you want to walk in the fresh airdo you notand to learn certain thingsand i wish to tell you them but i dare not do it here where we may at any moment be surrounded by spies for these walls have ears indeed well when we walk in that garden would it be too great a penance for you to put your arm about my waistyou who still need support  no penance at all i assure you answered peter with something like a smile for after all he was a man and young while the waist of inez was as pretty as all the rest of her but he added it might be misunderstood  quite so i wish it to be misunderstood not by me who know that you care nothing for me and would as soon place your arm round that marble column  peter opened his lips to speak but she stopped him at once  oh do not waste falsehoods on me in which of a truth you have no art she said with evident irritation why if you had the money you would offer to pay me for my nursing and who knows i might take it understand you must either do this seeming to play the lover to me or we cannot walk together in that garden  peter hesitated a little guessing a plot while she bent forward till her lips almost touched his ear and said in a still lower voice  and i cannot tell you how perhapsi say perhapsyou may come to see the remains of the dona margaret and certain other matters ah she added after a pause with a little bitter laugh now you will kiss me from one end of the garden to the other will you not foolish man doubt no more take your chance it may be the last  of what kissing you or the other things  that you will find out she said with a shrug of her shoulders come  then while he followed dubiously she led him down the length of the great room to a door with a spyhole in the top of it that was set in a moorish archway at the corner  this door she opened and there beyond it a drawn scimitar in his hand stood a tall moor on guard inez spoke a word to him whereon he saluted with his scimitar and let them pass across the landing to a turret stair that lay beyond which they descended at its foot was another door whereon she knocked four times bolts shot back keys turned and it was opened by a black porter beyond whom stood a second moor also with drawn sword they passed him as they had passed the first turned down a little passage to the right ending in some steps and came to a third door in front of which she halted  now she said nerve yourself for the trial  what trial he asked supporting himself against the wall for he found his legs still weak  this she answered pointing to her waist and these and she touched her rich red lips with her taper fingerpoints would you like to practise a little my innocent english knight before we go out you look as though you might seem awkward and unconvincing  i think answered peter drily for the humour of the situation moved him that such practice is somewhat dangerous for me it might annoy you before i had done i will postpone my happiness until we are in the garden  i thought so she answered but look now you must play the part or i shall suffer who am bearing much for you  i think that i may suffer also he murmured but not so low that she did not catch his words  no friend pedro she said turning on him it is the woman who suffers in this kind of farce she pays the man rides away to play another and without more ado she opened the door which proved to be unlocked and unguarded  beyond the foot of some steps lay a most lovely garden great tapering cypresses grew about it with many orangetrees and flowering shrubs that filled the soft southern air with odours also there were marble fountains into which water splashed from the mouths of carven lions and here and there arbours with stone seats whereon were laid soft cushions of many colours it was a veritable place of eastern delight and dreams such as peter had never known before he looked upon it on that languorous evehe who had not seen the sky or flowers for so many weary weeks of sickness it was secluded also being surrounded by a high wall but at one place the tall windowless tower of some other building of red stone soared up between and beyond two lofty cypresstrees  this is the harem garden inez whispered where many a painted favourite has flitted for a few happy summer hours till winter came and the butterfly was broken and as she spoke she dropped her veil over her face and began to descend the stairs    chapter xv  peter plays a part  stop said peter from the shadow of the doorway i fear this business inez and i do not understand why it is needful why cannot you say what you have to say here  are you mad she answered almost fiercely through her veil do you think that it can be any pleasure for me to seem to make love to a stone shaped like a man for whom i care nothing at allexcept as a friend she added quickly i tell you señor peter that if you do not do as i tell you you will never hear what i have to say for i shall be held to have failed in my business and within a few minutes shall vanish from you for everto my death perhaps but what does that matter to you choose now and quickly for i cannot stand thus for long  i obey you god forgive me said the distraught peter from the darkness of the doorway but must i really  yes you must she answered with energy and some would not think that so great a penance  then she lifted the corner of her veil coyly and peeping out beneath it called in a soft clear voice oh forgive me dear friend if i have run too fast for you forgetting that you are still so very weak here lean upon me i am frail but it may serve and she passed up the steps again to reappear in another moment with peters hand resting on her shoulder  be careful of these steps she said they are so slipperya statement to which peter whose pale face had grown suddenly red murmured a hearty assent do not be afraid she went on in her flutelike voice this is the secret garden where none can hear words however sweet and none can see even a caress no not the most jealous woman that is why in old days it was called the sultanas chamber for there at the end of it was where she bathed in the summer season what say you of spies oh yes in the palace there are many but to look towards this place even for the guardian of the women was always death here there are no witnesses save the flowers and the birds  as she spoke thus they reached the central path and passed up it slowly peters hand still upon the shoulder of inez and her white arm about him while she looked up into his eyes  bend closer over me she whispered for truly your face is like that of a wooden saint and he bent now she went on listen your lady lives and is wellkiss me on the lips please that news is worth it if you shut your eyes you can imagine that i am she  again peter obeyed and with a better grace than might have been expected  she is a prisoner in this same palace she went on and the marquis who is mad for love of her seeks by all means fair or foul to make her his wife  curse him exclaimed peter with another embrace  till a few days ago she thought you dead but now she knows that you are alive and recovering her father castell escaped from the place where he was put and is in hiding among his friends the jews where even morella cannot find him indeed he believes him fled from the city but he is not fled and having much gold has opened a door between himself and his daughter  here she stopped to return the embrace with much warmth then they passed under some trees and came to the marble baths where the sultanas were supposed to have bathed in summer for this place had been one of the palaces of the kings of granada before they lived in the alhambra here inez sat down upon a seat and loosened some garment about her throat for the evening was very hot  what are you doing peter asked doubtfully for he was filled with many fears  cooling myself she answered your arm was warm and we may sit here for a few minutes  well go on with your tale he said  i have little more to say friend except that if you wish to send any message i might perhaps be able to take it  you are an angel he exclaimed  that is another word for messenger is it not continue  tell herthat if she hears anything of all this business it isnt true  on that point she may form her own opinion replied inez demurely if i were in her place i know what mine would be dont waste time we must soon begin to walk again  peter stared at her for he could understand nothing of all this play apparently she read his look for she answered it in a quiet serious voice  you are wondering what everything means and why i am doing what i do i will tell you señor and you can believe me or not as you like perhaps you think that i am in love with you it would not be wonderful would it besides in the old tales that always happensthe lady who nurses the christian knight and worships him and so forth  i dont think anything of the sort i am not so vain  i know it señor you are too good a man to be vain well i do all these things not for love of you or any one but for hatefor hate yes for hate of morella and she clenched her little hand hissing the words out between her teeth  i understand the feeling said peter butbut what has he done to you  do not ask me señor enough that once i loved himthat accursed priest henriques sold me into his poweroh a long while ago and he ruined me making me what i am andi bore his child andand it is dead oh mother of god my boy is dead and since then i have been an outcast and his slavethey have slaves here in granada señor dependent on him for my bread forced to do his bidding forced to wait upon his other loves i who once was the sultana i of whom he has wearied only todaybut why should i tell you of it well he has driven me even to this that i must kiss an unwilling stranger in a garden and she sobbed aloud  poor girlpoor girl said peter patting her hand kindly with his thin fingers henceforth i have another score against morella and i will pay it too  will you she asked quickly ah if so i would die for you who now live only to be revenged upon him and it shall be my first vengeance to rob him of that noblelooking mistress of yours whom he has stolen away and has set his heart upon wholly because she is the first woman who ever resisted himhim who thinks that he is invincible  have you any plan asked peter  as yet none the thing is very difficult i go in danger of my life for if he thought that i betrayed him he would kill me like a rat and think no harm of it such things can be done in granada without sin señor and no questions askedat least if the victim be a woman of the murderers household i have told you already that if i had refused to do what i have done this evening i should certainly have been got rid of in this way or that and another set on at the work no i have no plan yet only it is i through whom the señor castell communicates with his daughter and i will see him again and see her and we will make some plan no do not thank me he pays me for my services and i am glad to take his money who hope to escape from this hell and live on it elsewhere yet not for all the money in the world would i risk what i am risking though in truth it matters not to me whether i live or die señor i will not disguise it from you all this scene will come to the dona margarets ears but i will explain it to her  i pray you do said peter earnestlyexplain it fully  i willi will i will work for you and her and her father and if i cease to work know that i am dead or in a dungeon and fend for yourselves as best you may one thing i can tell you for your comfortno harm has been done to this lady of yours morella loves her too well for that he wishes to make her his wife or perhaps he has sworn some oath as i know that he has sworn that he will not murder youwhich he might have done a score of times while you have lain a prisoner in his power why once when you were senseless he came and stood over you a dagger in his hand and reasoned out the case with me i said why do you not kill him knowing that thus i could best help to save your life he answered because i will not take my wife with her lovers blood upon my hands unless i slay him in fair fight i swore it yonder in london it was the offering which i made to god and to my patron saint that so i might win her fairly and if i break that oath god will be avenged upon me here and hereafter do my bidding inez nurse him well so that if he dies he dies without sin of mine no he will not murder you or harm her friend pedro he dare not  can you think of nothing asked peter  nothingas yet nothing these walls are high guards watch them day and night and outside is the great city of granada where morella has much power and whence no christian may escape but he would marry her and there is that handsome foolwoman her servant who is in love with himoh she told me all about it in the worst spanish i ever heard but the story is too long to repeat and the priest father henriqueshe who wished that you might be killed at the inn and who loves money so much ah now i think i see some light but we have no more time to talk and i must have time to think friend pedro make ready your kisses we must go on with our game and in truth you play but badly come now your arm there is a seat prepared for us yonder smile and look loving i have not art enough for both comecome and together they walked out of the dense shadow of the trees and past the marble bath of the sultanas to a certain seat beneath a bower on which were cushions and lying among them a lute  seat yourself at my feet she said as she sank on to the bench can you sing  no more than a crow he answered  then i must sing to you well it will be better than the lovemaking then in a very sweet voice she began to warble amorous moorish ditties that she accompanied upon the lute whilst peter who was weary in body and disturbed in mind played a lovers part to the best of his ability and by degrees the darkness gathered  at length when they could no longer see across the garden inez ceased singing and rose with a sigh  the play is finished and the curtain down she said also it is time that you went in out of this damp señor pedro you are a very bad actor but let us pray that the audience was compassionate and took the will for the deed  i did not see any audience answered peter  but it saw you as i dare say you will find out byandby follow me now back to your room for i must be going about your businessand my own have you any message for the señor castell  none save my love and duty tell him that thanks to you although still somewhat feeble i am recovered of my hurt upon the ship and the fever which i took from the sun and that if he can make any plan to get us all out of this accursed city and the grip of morella i will bless his name and yours  good i will not forget now be silent tomorrow we will walk here again but be not afraid then there will be no more need for lovemaking  margaret sat by the open windowplace of her beautiful chamber in morellas palace she was splendidly arrayed in a rich spanish dress whereof the collar was stiff with pearls she who must wear what it pleased her captor to give her her long tresses fastened with a jewelled band flowed down about her shoulders and her hand resting on her knee from her high tower prison she gazed out across the valley at the dim and mighty mass of the alhambra and the ten thousand lights of granada which sparkled far below near to her seated beneath a silver hanginglamp and also clad in rich array was betty  what is it cousin asked the girl looking at her anxiously at least you should be happier than you were for now you know that peter is not dead but almost recovered from his sickness and in this very palace also that your father is well and hidden away plotting for our escape why then are you so sad who should be more joyful than you were  would you learn betty then i will tell you i am betrayed peter brome the man whom i looked upon almost as my husband is false to me  master peter false exclaimed betty staring at her openmouthed no it is not possible i know him he could not be who will not even look at another woman if that is what you mean  you say so then betty listen and judge you remember this afternoon when the marquis took us to see the wonders of this palace and i went thinking that perhaps i might find some path by which afterwards we could escape  of course i remember margaret we do not leave this cage so often that i am likely to forget  then you will remember also that highwalled garden in which we walked where the great tower is and how the marquis and that hateful priest father henriques and i went up the tower to study the prospect from its roof i thinking that you were following me  the waitingwomen would not let me said betty so soon as you had passed in they shut the door and told me to bide where i was till you returned i went near to pulling the hair out of the head of one of them over it since i was afraid for you alone with those two men but she drew her knife the cat and i had none  you must be careful betty said margaret lest some of these heathen folk should do you a mischief  not they she answered they are afraid of me why the other day i bundled one of them whom i found listening at the door head first down the stairs she complained to the marquis but he only laughed at her and now she lies abed with a plaster on her nose but tell me your tale  we climbed the tower said margaret and from its topmost room looked out through the windows that face south at all the mountains and the plain over which they dragged us from motril presently the priest who had gone to the north wall in which there are no windows and entered some recess there came out with an evil smile upon his face and whispered something to the marquis who turned to me and said  the father tells me of an even prettier scene which we can view yonder come señora and look  so i went who wished to learn all that i could of the building they led me into a little chamber cut in the thickness of the stonework in the wall of which are slits like loopholes for the shooting of arrows wide within but very narrow without so that i think they cannot be seen from below hidden as they are between the rough stones of the tower  this is the place said the marquis where in the old days the kings of granada who were always jealous used to sit to watch their women in the secret garden it is told that thus one of them discovered his sultana making love to an astrologer and drowned them both in the marble bath at the end of the garden look now beneath us walk a couple who do not guess that we are the witnesses of their vows  so i looked idly enough to pass the time and there i saw a tall man in a moorish dress and with him for their arms were about each other a woman as i was turning my head away who did not wish to spy upon them thus the woman lifted her face to kiss the man and i knew her for that beautiful inez who has visited us here at times as a spy i think presently too the man after paying her back her embrace glanced about him guiltily and i saw his face also and knew it  who was it asked betty for this gossip of lovers interested her  peter brome no other margaret answered calmly but with a note of despair in her voice peter brome pale with recent sickness but no other man  the saints save us i did not think he had it in him gasped betty with astonishment  they would not let me go went on margaret they forced me to see it all the pair tarried for a while beneath some trees by the bath and were hidden there then they came out again and sat them down upon a marble seat while the woman sang songs and the man leaned against her lovingly so it went on until the darkness fell and we went leaving them there now she added with a little sob what say you  i say answered betty that it was not master peter who has no liking for strange ladies and secret gardens  it was he and no other man betty  then cousin he was drugged or drunk or bewitched not the peter whom we know  bewitched perchance by that bad woman which is no excuse for him  betty thought a while she could not doubt the evidence but from her face it was clear that she took no severe view of the offence  well at the worst she said men as i have known them are men he has been shut up for a long while with that minx who is very fair and witching and it was scarcely right to watch him through a slit in a tower if he were my lover i should say nothing about it  i will say nothing to him about that or any other matter replied margaret sternly i have done with peter brome  again betty thought and spoke  i seem to see a trick cousin margaret they told you he was dead did they not and then that news came to us that he was not dead only sick and here so the lie failed now they tell you and seem to show you that he is faithless may not all this have been some part played for a purpose by the woman  it takes two to play such parts betty if you had seen  if i had seen i should have known whether it was but a part or love made in good earnest but you are too innocent to judge what said the marquis all this while and the priest  little or nothing only smiled at each other and at length when it grew dark and we could see no more asked me if i did not think that it was time to gome whom they had kept there all that while to be the witness of my own shame  yes they kept you theredid they notand brought you there just at the right timedid they notand shut me out of the tower so that i might not be with youoh and all the rest now if you have any justice in you cousin you will hear peters side of this story before you judge him  i have judged him answered margaret coldly and oh i wish that i were dead  margaret rose from her seat and stepping to the windowplace in the tower which was built upon the edge of a hill searched the giddy depth beneath with her eyes where two hundred feet below the white line of a roadway showed faintly in the moonlight  it would be easy would it not she said with a strained laugh just to lean out a little too far upon this stone and then one swift rush and darknessor lightfor everwhich i wonder  light i think said betty jerking her back from the windowthe light of hell fire and plenty of it for that would be selfmurder nothing else and besides what would one look like on that road cousin dont be a fool if you are right it isnt you who ought to go out of that window and if you are wrong then you would only make a bad business worse time enough to die when one must say iwhich perhaps will be soon enough meanwhile if i were you i would try to speak to master peter first if only to let him know what i thought of him  mayhap answered margaret sinking back into a chair but i sufferhow can you know what i suffer  why should i not know asked betty are you the only woman in the world who has been fool enough to fall in love can i not be as much in love as you are you smile and think to yourself that the poor relation betty cannot feel like her rich cousin but i doi do i know that he is a villain but i love this marquis as much as you hate him or as much as you love peter because i cant help myself it is my luck thats all but i am not going to throw myself out of a window i would rather throw him out and square our reckoning and that i swear ill do in this way or the other even if it should cost me what i dont want to losemy life and betty drew herself up beneath the silver lamp with a look upon her handsome determined face which was so like margarets and yet so different that could he have seen it might well have made morella regret that he had chosen this woman for a tool  while margaret studied her wonderingly she heard a sound and glanced up to see standing before them none other than the beautiful spaniard or moor for she knew not which she was inez that same woman whom from her hidingplace in the tower she had watched with peter in the garden  how did you come here she asked coldly  through the door señora that was left unlocked which is not wise of those who wish to talk privately in such a place as this she answered with a humble curtsey  the door is still unlocked said margaret pointing towards it  nay señora you are mistaken here is its key in my hand i pray you do not tell your lady to put me out which being so strong she well can do for i have words to say to you and if you are wise you will listen to them  margaret thought a moment then answered  say on and be brief    chapter xvi  betty shows her teeth  señora said inez you think that you have something against me  no answered margaret you arewhat you are why should i blame you  well against the señor brome then  perhaps but that is between me and him i will not discuss it with you  señora went on inez with a slow smile we are both innocent of what you thought you saw  indeed then who is guilty  the marquis of morella  margaret made no answer but her eyes said much  señora you do not believe me nor is it wonderful yet i speak the truth what you saw from the tower was a play in which the señor brome took his part badly enough as you may have noticed because i told him that my life hung on it i have nursed him through a sore sickness señora and he is not ungrateful  so i judged but i do not understand you  señora i am a slave in this house a discarded slave perhaps you can guess the rest it is a common story here i was offered my freedom at a price that i should weave myself into this mans heart i who am held fair and make him my lover if i failed then perhaps i should be sold as a slaveperhaps worse i acceptedwhy should i not it was a small thing to me on the one hand life freedom and wealth an hidalgo of good blood and a gallant friend for a little while and on the other the last shame or blackness which doubtless await me nowif i am found out señora i failed who in truth did not try hard to succeed the man looked on me as his nurse no more and to me he was one very sick no more also we grew to be true friends and in this way or in that i learned all his story learned also why the trap was baited thusthat you might be deceived and fall into a deeper trap señora i could not explain it all to him indeed in that chamber where we were spied on i had but little chance still it was necessary that he should seem to be what he is not so i took him into the garden and knowing well who watched us made him act his part well enough to deceive you it would seem  still i do not understand said margaret more softly you say that your life or welfare hung on this shameful business then why do you reveal it to me now  to save you from yourself señora to save my friend the señor brome and to pay back morella in his own coin  how will you do these things  the first two are done i think but the third is difficult it is of that i come to speak with you at great risk indeed had not my master been summoned to the court of the moorish king i could not have come and he may return at any time  have you some plan asked margaret leaning towards her eagerly  no plan as yet only an idea she turned and looked at betty adding  this lady is your cousin is she not though of a different station and somewhat far away  margaret nodded  you are not unlike went on inez of much the same height and shape although the señora betty is stronger built and her eyes are blue and her hair golden whereas your eyes are black and your hair chestnut beneath a veil or at night it would not be easy to tell you apart if your hands were gloved and neither of you spoke above a whisper  yes said margaret what then  now the señora betty comes into the play replied inez señora betty have you understood our talk  something not quite all answered betty  then what you do not understand your lady must interpret and be not angry with me i pray you if i seem to know more of you and your affairs than you have ever told me render my words now dona margaret  then after this was done and she had thought awhile inez continued slowly margaret translating from spanish into english whenever betty could not understand  morella made love to you in england señora bettydid he notand won your heart as he has won that of many another woman so that you came to believe that he was carrying you off to marry you and not your cousin  what affair is that of yours woman asked betty flushing angrily  none at all save that i could tell much such another story if you cared to listen but hear me out and then answer me a question or rather answer the question first would you like to be avenged upon this highborn knave  avenged answered betty clenching her hands and hissing the words through her firm white teeth i would risk my life for it  as i do it seems that we are of one mind there then i think that perhaps i can show you a way look now your cousin has seen certain things which women placed as she is do not like to see she is jealous she is angryor was until i told her the truth well tonight or tomorrow morella will come to her and say are you satisfied do you still refuse me in favour of a man who yields his heart to the first lightoflove who tempts him will you not be my wife what if she answer yes i will nay be silent both of you and hear me out what if then there should be a secret marriage and the señora betty should chance to wear the brides veil while the dona margaret in the robe of betty was let go with the señor brome and her father  inez paused watching them both and playing with the fan she held while the rendering of her words finished margaret and betty stared at her and at each other for the audacity and fearfulness of this plot took their breath away it was margaret who spoke the first  you must not do it betty she said why when the man found you out he would kill you but betty took no heed of her and thought on at length she looked up and answered  cousin it was my vain folly that brought you all into this trouble therefore i owe something to you do i not i am not afraid of the manhe is afraid of me and if it came to killingwhy let inez lend me that knife of hers and i think that perhaps i should give the first blow andwell i think i love him rascal though he is and afterwards perhaps we might make it up who can saywhile if not but tell me you inez should i be his legal wife according to the law of this land  assuredly answered inez if a priest married you and he placed the ring upon your hand and named you wife then when once the words of blessing have been said the pope alone can loose that knot which may be risked for there would be much to explain and is this a tale that morella a good servant of the church would care to take to rome  it would be a trick broke in margareta very ugly trick  and what was it he played on me and you asked betty nay ill chance it and his rage if only i can be sure that you and peter will go free and your father with you  but what of this inez asked margaret bewildered  she will look after herself answered inez perchance if all goes well you will let me ride with you and now i dare stop no longer i go to see your father the señor castell and if anything can be arranged we will talk again meanwhile dona margaret your affianced is nearly well again at last and sends his hearts love to you and i counsel you when morella speaks turn a gentle ear to him  then with another deep curtsey she glided to the door unlocked it and left the room                                       an hour later inez was being led by an old jew dressed in a moslem robe and turban through one of the most tortuous and crowded parts of granada it would seem that this jew was known there for his appearance accompanied by a veiled woman apparently caused no surprise to those followers of the prophet that he met some of whom indeed saluted him with humility  these children of mahomet seem to love you father israel said inez  yes yes my dear answered the old fellow with a chuckle they owe me money that is why and i am getting it in before the great war comes with the spaniards so they would sweep the streets for me with their beardsall of which is very good for the plans of our friend yonder ah he who has crowns in his pocket can put a crown upon his head there is nothing that money will not do in granada give me enough of it and i will buy his sultana from the king  this castell has plenty asked inez shortly  plenty and more credit he is one of the richest men in england but why do you ask he would not think of you who is too troubled about other things  inez only laughed bitterly but did not resent the words why should she it was not worth while  i know she answered but i mean to earn some of it all the same and i want to be sure that there is enough for all of us  there is enough i have told you there is enough and to spare answered the hebrew israel as he tapped on a door in a dirtylooking wall  it opened as though by magic and they crossed a paved patio or courtyard to a house beyond a tumbledown place of moorish architecture  our friend castell being in seclusion just now has hired the cellar floor said israel with a chuckle to inez so be pleased to follow me and take care of the rats and beetles  then he led her down a rickety stair which opened out of the courtyard into vaults filled with vats of wine and having lit a taper through these shutting and locking sundry doors behind him to what appeared to be a very damp wall covered with cobwebs and situated in a dark corner of a winecave here he stopped and tapped again in his peculiar fashion whereon a portion of the wall turned outwards on a pivot leaving an opening through which they could pass  well managed isnt it chuckled israel who would think of looking for an entrance here especially if he owed the old jew money come in my pretty come in  inez followed him into this darksome hole and the wall closed behind them then taking her by the arm he turned first to the right next to the left opened a door with a key which he carried and behold they stood in a beautifully furnished room well lighted with lamps for it seemed to have no windows wait here he said to inez pointing to a couch on which she sat herself down while i fetch my lodger and he vanished through some curtains at the end of the room  presently these opened again and israel reappeared through them with castell dressed now in moorish robes and looking somewhat pale from his confinement underground but otherwise well enough inez rose and stood before him throwing back her veil that he might see her face castell searched her for a while with his keen eyes that noted everything then said  you are the lady with whom i have been in communication through our friend here are you not prove it to me now by repeating my messages  inez obeyed telling him everything  that is right he said but how do i know that i can trust you i understand you are or have been the lover of this man morella and such an one he might well employ as a spy to bring us all to ruin  is it not too late to ask such questions señor if i am not to be trusted already you and your people are in the hollow of my hand  not at all not at all my dear said israel if we see the slightest cause to doubt you why there are many great vats in this place one of which at a pinch would serve you as a coffin though it would be a pity to spoil the good wine  inez laughed as she answered  save your wine and your time too morella has cast me off and i hate him and wish to escape from him and rob him of his prize also i desire money to live on afterwards and this you must give to me or i do not stir or rather the promise of it for you jews keep your word and i do not ask a maravedi from you until i have played my part  and then how many maravedis do you ask young woman  inez named a sum at the mention of which both of them opened their eyes and old israel exclaimed drily  surelysurely you must be one of us  no she answered but i try to follow your example and if i am to live at all it shall be in comfort  quite so said castell we understand but now tell us what do you propose to do for this money  i propose to set you your daughter the dona margaret and her lover the señor brome safe and free outside the walls of granada and to leave the marquis of morella married to another woman  what other woman yourself asked castell fixing on this last point in the programme  no señor not for all the wealth of both of you to your dependent and your daughters relative the handsome betty  how will you manage that exclaimed castell amazed  these cousins are not unlike señor although the link of blood between them is so thin listen now i will tell you and she explained the outlines of her plan  a bold scheme enough said castell when she had finished but even if it can be done would that marriage hold  i think so answered inez if the priest knewand he could be bribedand the bride knows but if not what would it matter since rome alone can decide the question and long before that is done the fates of all of us will be settled  romeor death said castell and inez read what he was afraid of in his eyes  your betty takes her chance she replied slowly as many a one has done before her with less cause she is a woman with a mind as strong as her body morella made her love him and promised to marry her then he used her to steal your daughter and she learned that she had been no more than a stalkingheifer from behind which he would net the white swan do you not think therefore that she has something to pay him back she through whom her beloved mistress and cousin has been brought into all this trouble if she wins she becomes the wife of a grandee of spain a marchioness and if she loses well she has had her fling for a high stake and perhaps her revenge at least she is willing to take her chance and meanwhile all of you can be gone  castell looked doubtfully at the jew israel who stroked his white beard and said  let the woman set out her scheme at any rate she is no fool and it is worth our hearing though i fear that at the best it must be costly  i can pay said castell and motioned to inez to proceed  as yet however she had not much more to say save that they must have good horses at hand and send a messenger to seville whither the margaret had been ordered to proceed bidding her captain hold his ship ready to sail at any hour should they succeed in reaching him  these things then they arranged and a while later inez and israel departed the former carrying with her a bag of gold  that same night inez sought the priest henriques of motril in that hall of morellas palace which was used as a private chapel saying that she desired to speak with him under pretence of making confession for they were old friendsor rather enemies  as it chanced she found the holy father in a very ill humour it appeared that morella also was in a bad humour with henriques having heard that it was he who had possessed himself of the jewels in his strongbox on the san antonio now he insisted upon his surrendering everything and swore moreover that he would hold him responsible for all that his people had stolen from the ship and this because he said that it was his fault that peter brome had escaped the sea and come on to granada  so father said inez you who thought yourself rich are poor again  yes my daughter and that is what chances to those who put their faith in princes i have served this marquis well for many yearsto my souls hurt i fear mehoping that he who stands so high in the favour of the church would advance me to some great preferment but instead what does he do he robs me of a few trinkets that had i not found them the sea would have swallowed or some thief would have taken and declares me his debtor for the rest of which i know nothing  what preferment did you want father i see that you have one in your mind  daughter a friend had written to me from seville that if i have a hundred gold doubloons to pay for it he can secure me the place of a secretary in the holy office where i served before as a familiar until the marquis made me his chaplain and gave the benefice of motril which proved worth nothing and many promises that are worth less now those trinkets would fetch thirty and i have saved twenty and came here to borrow the other fifty from the marquis to whom i have done so many good turnsas you know well inez you see the end of that quest and he groaned angrily  it is a pity said inez thoughtfully since those who serve the inquisition save many souls do they not including their own for instance she added and the priest winced at the words i remember that they saved the soul of my own sister and would have saved mine had i beenwhat shall i saymoremore prejudiced also they get a percentage of the goods of wicked heretics and so become rich and able to advance themselves  that is so inez it was the chance of a lifetime especially to one who like myself hates heretics but why speak of it now when that cursed dissolute marquis and he checked himself  inez looked at him  father she asked if i happen to be able to find you those hundred gold doubloons would you do something for me  the priests foxy face lit up  i wonder what there is that i would not do my daughter  even if it brought you into a quarrel with the marquis  once i was a secretary to the inquisition of seville he would have more reason to fear me than i him aye and fear me he should who bear him no love answered the priest with a snarl  then listen father i have not made my confession yet i have not told you for instance that i also hate this marquis and with good causethough perhaps you know that already but remember that if you betray me you will never see those hundred gold doubloons and some other holy priest will be appointed secretary at seville also worse things may happen to you  proceed my daughter he said unctuously are we not in the confessionalor near it  so she told him all the plot trusting to the mans avarice and other matters to protect her for inez hated fray henriques bitterly and knew him from the crown of his shaven head to the soles of his erring feet as she had good cause to do only she did not tell him whence the money was to come  that does not seem a very difficult matter he said when she had finished if a man and a woman unwed and outside the prohibited degrees appear before me to be married i marry them and once the ring has passed and the office is said married they are till death or the pope part them  and suppose that the man thinks he is marrying another woman father  the priest shrugged his shoulders  he should know whom he is marrying that is his affair not the churchs or mine the names need not be spoken too loudly my daughter  but you would give me a writing of the marriage with them set out plain  certainly to you or to anybody else why should i notthat is if i were sure of this wedding fee  inez lifted her hand and showed beneath it a little pile of ten doubloons  take them father she said they will not be counted in the contract there are others where they came from whereof twenty will be paid before the marriage and eighty when i have that writing at seville  he swept up the coins and pocketed them saying  i will trust you inez  yes she answered as she left him we must trust each other nowmust we notseeing that you have the money and both our necks are in the same noose be here father tomorrow at the same time in case i have more confessions to make for alas this is a sinful world as you should know very well    chapter xvii  the plot  on the morning following these conversations just after margaret and betty had breakfasted inez appeared and as before locked the door behind her  señoras she said calmly i have arranged that little business of which i spoke to you yesterday or at least the first act of the play since it remains for you to write the rest now i am sent to say that the noble marquis of morella craves leave to see you dona margaret and within an hour so there is no time to lose  tell us what you have done inez said margaret  i have seen your worshipful father dona margaret here is the token of it which you will do well to destroy when you have read and she handed her a slip of paper whereon was written in her fathers writing and in english  beloved daughter  this messenger who i think may be trusted by you has made arrangements with me which she will explain i approve though the risk is great your cousin is a brave girl but understand i do not force her to this dangerous enterprise she must choose her own road only i promise that if she escapes and we live i will not forget her deed the messenger will bring me your answer god be with us all and farewell  jc  margaret read this letter first to herself and then aloud to betty and having read tore it into tiny fragments and threw them from the turret window  speak now she said and inez told her everything  can you trust the priest asked margaret when she had finished  he is a great villain as i have reason to know still i think i can she answered while the cabbage is in front of the donkeys nosei mean until he has got all the money also he has committed himself by taking some on account but before we go further the question isdoes this lady play and she pointed to betty  yes i play said betty when she understood everything i wont go back upon my word there is too much at stake it is an ugly business for me i know well enough but she added slowly setting her firm mouth i have debts to pay all round and i am no spanish putty to be squeezed flatlike some people and she glanced at the humblelooking inez so before all is done it may be uglier for him  when she had mastered the meaning of this speech the softvoiced inez lifted her gentle eyes in admiration and murmured a spanish proverb as to what is supposed to occur when satan encounters beelzebub in a highwalled lane then being a lady of resource and experience the plot having been finally decided upon not altogether with margarets approval who feared for bettys fate when it should be discovered inez began to instruct them both in various practical expedients by means of which the undoubted general resemblance of these cousins might be heightened and their differences toned down to this end she promised to furnish them with certain hairwashes pigments and articles of apparel  it is of small use said betty glancing first at herself and then at the lovely margaret for even if they change skins who can make the calf look like the fawn though they chance to feed in the same meadow still bring your stuffs and i will do my best but i think that a thick veil and a shut mouth will help me more than any of them also a long gown to hide my feet  surely they are charming feet said inez politely adding to herself to carry you whither you wish to go then she turned to margaret and reminded her that the marquis desired to see her and waited for her answer  i will not meet him alone said margaret decidedly  that is awkward answered inez as i think he has words to say to you which he does not wish others to hear especially the señora yonder and she nodded towards betty  i will not meet him alone repeated margaret  yet if things are to go forward as we have arranged you must meet him dona margaret and give him that answer which he desires well i think it can be arranged the court below is large now while you and the marquis talk at one end of it the señora betty and i might walk out of earshot at the other she needs more instruction in our spanish tongue it would be a good opportunity to begin our lessons  but what am i to say to him asked margaret nervously  i think answered inez that you must copy the example of that wonderful actor the señor peter and play a part as well as you saw him do or even better if possible  it must be a very different part then replied margaret stiffening visibly at certain recollections  the gentle inez smiled as she said  yes but surely you can seem jealous for that is natural to us all and you can yield by degrees and you can make a bargain as the price of yourself in marriage  what exact bargain should i make  i think that you shall be securely wed by a priest of your own church and that letters signed by that priest and announcing the marriage shall be delivered to the archbishop of seville and to their majesties king ferdinand and queen isabella also of course you must arrange that the señor brome and your father the señor castell and your cousin betty here shall be escorted safe out of granada before your marriage and that you shall see them pass through the gate beneath your turret window swearing that thereafter at nightfall of the same day you will suffer the priest to do his office and make you morellas wife by that time they should be well upon their road and after the rite is celebrated i will receive the signed papers from the priest and follow them leaving the false bride to play her part as best she can  again margaret hesitated the thing seemed too complicated and full of danger but while she thought a knock came on the door  that is to tell me that morella awaits your answer in the court said inez now which is it to be remember that there is no other chance of escape for you or the others from this guarded townat least i can see none  i accept said margaret hurriedly and god help us all for we shall need him  and you señora betty  oh i made up my mind long ago answered betty coolly we can only fail when we shall be no worse off than before  good then play your parts well both of you after all they should not be so difficult for the priest is safe and the marquis will never scent such a trick as this fix the marriage for this day week as i have much to think of and make ready and she went                                       half an hour later margaret sat under the cool arcade of the marble court and with her morella while upon the further side of its splashing fountain and out of earshot betty and inez walked to and fro in the shadow  you sent for me marquis said margaret presently and being your prisoner i have come because i must what is your pleasure with me  dona margaret he answered gravely can you not guess well i will tell you lest you should guess wrong first it is to ask your forgiveness as i have done before for the many crimes to which my love my true love for you has driven me this time yesterday i knew well that i could expect none today i dare to hope that it may be otherwise  why so marquis  last evening you looked into a certain garden and saw two people walking thereyonder is one of them and he nodded towards inez shall i go on  no she answered in a low voice and passing her hands before her face only tell me who and what is that woman and in her turn she looked towards inez  is it necessary he asked well if you wish to know she is a spaniard of good blood who with her sister was taken captive by the moors a certain priest who took an interest in the sister brought her to my notice and i bought her from them so as her parents were dead and she had nowhere else to go she elected to stay in my house you must not judge such things too harshly they are common here also she has been very useful to me being clever for through her i have intelligence of many things of late however she has grown tired of this life and wishes to earn her freedom which i have promised her in return for certain services and to leave granada  was the nursing of my betrothed one of those services marquis  he shrugged his shoulders  as you will señora certainly i forgive her this indiscretion if at last she has shown you the truth about that man for whose sake you have endured so much margaret now that you know him for what he is say do you still cling to him  she rose and walked a few steps down the arcade then came back and asked  are you any better than this fallen man  i think so margaret for since i knew you i am a risen man all my old self is left behind me i am a new creature and my sins have been for you not against you hear me i beseech you i stole you away it is true but i have done you no harm and will do you none for your sake also i have spared your father when i had but to make a sign to remove him from my path i suffered him to escape from the prison where he was confined and i know the place where he thinks himself hidden today among the jews of granada also i nursed peter brome back to life when at any hour i could have let him die lest afterwards i might have it on my conscience that but for my love for you he might perhaps still be living well you have seen him as he is and what say you now will you still reject me look on me and he drew up his tall and stately shape and tell me am i such a man as a woman should be ashamed to own as husband remember too that i have much to give you in this land of spain whereof you shall become one of the greatest ladies or perhaps in the future he added significantly even more war draws near margaret this city and all its rich territories will fall into the hands of spain and afterwards i shall be their governor almost their king  and if i refuse asked margaret  then he answered sternly you bide here and that false lover of yours bides here and your father bides here to take the chance of war as christian captives with a thousand others who languish in the dungeons of the alhambra while my mission ended i go hence to play my part in battle amongst my peers as one of the first captains of their most catholic majesties yet it is not to your fears that i would appeal but to your heart for i seek your love and your dear companionship through life and if i can help it desire to work you and yours no harm  you desire to work them no harm then if i were to fall in with your humour would you let them go in safetyi mean my father and the señor brome and my cousin betty whom if you were as honest as you pretend to be you should ask to bide with you as your wife and not myself  the last i cannot do he answered flushing god knows i meant her no hurt and only used her to keep near to and win news of you thinking her to tell truth somewhat other than she is  are no women honest here in spain then my lord marquis  a few a very few dona margaret but i erred about betty whom i took for a simple servinggirl and to whom if need be i am ready to make all amends  except that which is due to a woman you have asked to be your wife and who in our country could claim the fulfilment of your promise or declare you shamed but you have not answered would they go free  as free as airespecially the señora betty he added with a little smile for to speak truth there is something in that womans eyes which frightens me at times i think that she has a long memory within an hour of our marriage you shall look down from your window and see them depart under escort every one to go whither they will  nay answered margaret it is not enough i should need to see them go before and then if i consented not till the sun had set would i pay the price of their ransom  then do you consent he asked eagerly  my lord marquis it would seem that i must my betrothed has played me false for a month or more i have been prisoner in your palace which i understand has no good name and if i refuse you tell me that all of us will be cast into yonder dungeons to be sold as slaves or die prisoners of the moors my lord marquis fate and you leave me but little choice on this day week i will marry you but blame me not if you find me other than you think as you have found my cousin whom you befooled till then also i pray you that you will leave me quite untroubled if you have arrangements to make or commands to send the woman inez yonder will serve as messenger for of her i know the worst  i will obey you in all things dona margaret he answered humbly do you desire to see your father or and he paused  neither of them she answered i will write to them and send my letters by this inez why should i see them she added passionately who have done with the old days when i was free and happy and am about to become the wife of the most noble marquis of morella that honourable grandee of spain who tricked a poor girl by a false promise of marriage and used her blind and loving folly to trap and steal me from my home my lord till this day week i bid you farewell and walking from the arcade to the fountain she called aloud to betty to accompany her to their rooms  the week for which margaret had bargained had gone by all was prepared inez had shown to morella the letters that his bride to be wrote to her father and to peter brome also the answers imploring and passionate to the same but there were other letters and other answers which she had not shown it was afternoon swift horses were ready in the courtyard and with them an escort while disguised as moors castell and peter waited under guard in a chamber close at hand betty dressed in the robes of a moorish woman and thickly veiled stood before morella to whom inez had led her  i come to tell you she said that at sundown three hours after we have passed beneath her window my cousin and mistress will wait to be made your wife but if you try to disturb her before then she will be no wife of yours or any mans  i obey answered morella and señora betty i pray your pardon and that you will accept this gift from me in token of your forgiveness and with a low bow he handed to her a beautiful necklace of pearls  i take them said betty with a bitter laugh as they may serve to buy me a passage back to england but forgive you i do not marquis of morella and i warn you that there is a score between us which i may yet live to settle you seem to have won but god in heaven takes note of the wickedness of men and in this way or in that he always pays his debts now i go to bid farewell to my cousin margaret but to you i do not bid farewell for i think that we shall meet again and with a sob she let fall the veil which she had lifted above her lips to speak and departed with inez to whom she whispered as they went he will not linger for any more goodbyes with betty dene  they entered margarets room and locked the door behind them she was seated on a low divan wrapped in a loose robe and by her side glittering with silver and with gems lay her bridal veil and garments  be swift said inez to betty who stripped off her moorish dress and the long flowing veil that was wrapped about her head whereon it was seen that her hair had changed greatly in colour from yellow to dark chestnut indeed while her eyes ringed about with pigments and made lustrous by drugs dropped into them looked no longer blue but black like margarets yes and wonder of wonders on the right side of the chin and on the back of the neck were moles or beautyspots just such as margaret had borne there from her birth in short their stature being much the same though betty was more thickly built except in the strongest light it would not have been easy to distinguish them apart even unveiled for at all such arts of the altering of the looks of women inez was an adept and she had done her best  now margaret clothed herself in the white robes and the thick headdress that hid her face all except a little crack left for the eyes to peep through whilst betty with the help of inez arrayed herself in the wondrous wedding robe beset with jewels that was morellas bridal gift and hid her dyed tresses beneath the pearlsewn veil within ten minutes all was finished even to the dagger that betty had tied about her beneath her robe and the two transformed women stood staring at each other  it is time to go said inez  then margaret broke out  i do not like this business i never did when he discovers all that mans rage will be terrible and he will kill her i repent that i have consented to the plot  it is too late to repent now señora said inez  cannot betty be got away also asked margaret desperately  it is just possible answered inez thus before the marriage according to the old custom here i hand the cups of wine to the bridegroom and the bride that for the marquis will be drugged since he must not see too clear tonight well i might brew it stronger so that within half an hour he would not know whether he were married or single and then perhaps she might escape with me and come to join you but it is very risky and of course if we were discoveredthe stitch would be out of the wineskin and the cellar floor might be stained  now betty interrupted  keep your stitches whole cousin if any skins are to be pricked it cant be helped and at least you wont have to wipe up the mess i am not going to run away from the man more likely he will run away from me i look well in this fine dress of yours and i mean to wear it out now begonebegone before some of them come to seek me dont you grieve for me ill lie in the bed that i have made and if the worst comes to the worst i have money in my pocketor its worthand we will meet again in england come give my love and duty to master peter and your father and if i should see them no more bid them think kindly of betty dene who was such a plague to them  then taking margaret in her strong arms she kissed her again and again and fairly thrust her from the room  but when they were gone poor betty sat down and cried a little till she remembered that hot tears might melt the paint upon her face and drying them went to the window and watched  a while later from her lofty niche she saw six moorish horsemen riding along the white road to the embattled gate after them came two men and a woman all splendidly mounted also dressed as moors and then six other horsemen they passed the gate which was opened for them and began to mount the slope beyond at the crest of it the woman halted and turning waved a handkerchief betty answered the signal and in another minute they had vanished and she was alone  never did she spend a more weary afternoon two hours later still watching at her window she saw the moorish escort return and knew that all was well and that by now margaret her lover and her father were safely started on their journey so she had not risked her life in vain    chapter xviii  the holy hermandad  down the long passages through the great fretted halls across the cool marble courts flitted inez and margaret it was like a dream they went through a room where women idling or working at tapestries looked at them curiously margaret heard one of them say to another  why does the dona margarets cousin leave her and the answer because she is in love with the marquis herself and cannot bear to stay  what a fool said the first woman she is good looking and would only have had to wait a few weeks  they passed an open door that of morellas own chambers within it he stood and watched them go by when they were opposite to him some doubt or idea seemed to strike his mind for he looked at them keenly stepped forward then thinking better of it or perhaps remembering bettys bitter tongue halted and turned aside that danger had gone by  at length none hindering them they reached the yard where the escort and the horses waited here standing under an archway were castell and peter castell greeted margaret in english and kissed her through her veil while peter who had not seen her close since months before he rode away to dedham stared at her with all his eyes and began to draw near to her designing to find out as he was sure he could do if once he touched her whether indeed this were margaret or only betty after all guessing what was in his mind and that he might reveal everything inez who held a long pin in her hand with which she was fastening her veil that had come loose pretended to knock against him and ran the point deep into his arm muttering fool as she did so he sprang back with an oath the guard smiled and she began to pray his pardon  castell helped margaret on to her horse then mounted his own as did peter still rubbing his arm but not daring to look towards margaret whose hand inez shook familiarly in farewell as though she were her equal addressing her the while in terms of endearment such as spanish women use to each other an officer of morellas household came and counted them saying  two men and a woman that is right though i cannot see the womans face  for a moment he seemed to be about to order her to unveil but inez called to him that it was not decent before all these moors whereon he nodded and ordered the captain to proceed  they rode through the arch of the castle along the roadway through the great gate of the wall also where the guard questioned their escort stared at them and after receiving a present from castell let them go telling them they were lucky christians to get alive out of granada as indeed they were  at the brow of the rise margaret turned and waved her handkerchief towards that high window which she knew so well another handkerchief was waved in answer and thinking of the lonely betty watching them there while she awaited the issue of her desperate venture margaret went on weeping beneath her veil for an hour they rode forward speaking few words to each other till at length they came to the crossroads one of which ran to malaga and the other towards seville  here the escort halted saying that their orders were to leave them at this point and asking which road they intended to take castell answered that to malaga whereon the captain replied that they were wise as they were less likely to meet bands of marauding thieves who called themselves christian soldiers and murdered or robbed all travellers who fell into their hands then castell offered him a present which he accepted gravely as though he did him a great favour and after bows and salutations they departed  as soon as the moors were gone the three rode a little way towards malaga then when there was nobody in sight they turned across country and gained the seville road at last they were alone and halting beneath the walls of a house that had been burnt in some christian raid they spoke together freely for the first time and oh what a moment was that for all of them  peter pushed his horse alongside that of margaret crying  speak beloved is it truly you  but margaret taking no heed of him leant over and throwing her arm around her fathers neck kissed him again and again through her veil blessing god that they had lived to meet in safety peter tried to kiss her also but she caused her horse to move so that he nearly fell from his saddle  have a care peter she said to him or your love of kissing will lead you into more trouble whereon guessing of what she spoke he coloured furiously and began to explain at length  cease she saidcease i know all that story for i saw you then relenting with some brief sweet words of greeting and gratitude gave him her hand which he kissed often enough  come said castell we must push on who have twenty miles to cover before we reach that inn where israel has arranged that we should sleep tonight we will talk as we go and talk they did as well as the roughness of the road and the speed at which they must travel would allow  riding as hard as they were able at length they came to the venta or rough hostelry just as the darkness closed in at the sight of it they thanked god aloud for this place was across the moorish border and now they had little to fear from granada the host a halfbred spaniard and a christian expected them having received a message from israel with whom he had had dealings and gave them two rooms rude enough but sufficient and good food and wine also stabling and barley for their horses bidding them sleep well and have no fear as he and his people would watch and warn them of any danger  yet it was late before they slept who had so much to say to each otherespecially peter and margaretand were so happy at their escape if only for a little while yet across their joy like the sound of a funeral bell at a merry feast came the thought of betty and that fateful marriage in which ere now she must have played her part indeed at last margaret knelt down and offered up prayers to heaven that the saints might protect her cousin in the great peril which she had incurred for them nor was peter ashamed to join her in that prayer then they embracedespecially peter and margaretand laid them down castell and his daughter in one room and peter in the other and slept as best they could  half an hour before dawn peter was up seeing to the horses while the others breakfasted and packed the food that the landlord had made ready for their journey then he also swallowed some meat and wine and at the first break of day having discharged their reckoning and taken a letter from their host to those of other inns upon the road they pressed on towards seville very thankful to find that as yet there were no signs of their being pursued  all that day with short pauses to rest themselves and their horses they rode on without accident for the most part over a fertile plain watered by several rivers which they crossed at fords or over bridges as night fell they reached the old town of oxuna which for many hours they had seen set upon its hill before them and notwithstanding their moorish dress made their way almost unobserved in the darkness to that inn to which they had been recommended here although he stared at their garments on finding that they had plenty of money the landlord received them well enough and again they were fortunate in securing rooms to themselves it had been their purpose to buy spanish clothes in this town but as it happened it was a feast day and at night every shop in the place was closed so they could get none now as they greatly desired to reach seville by the following nightfall hoping under cover of the darkness to find and come aboard of their ship the margaret which they knew lay safely in the river and had been advised by messenger of their intended journey it was necessary for them to leave oxuna before the dawn so unfortunately enough as it proved it was impossible for them to put off their moorish robes and clothe themselves as christians  they had hoped too that here at oxuna inez might overtake them as she had promised to do if she could and give them tidings of what had happened since they left granada but no inez came so comforting themselves with the thought that however hard she rode it would be difficult for her to reach them who had some hours start they left oxuna in the darkness before any one was astir  having crossed some miles of plain they passed up through olive groves into hills where corktrees grew and here stopped to eat and let the horses feed just as they were starting on again peter looking round saw mounted mena dozen or more of them of very wild aspectcantering through the trees evidently with the object of cutting them off  thieves he said shortly ride for it  so they began to gallop and their horses although somewhat jaded being very swift passed in front of these men before they could regain the road the band shouted to them to surrender and as they did not stop loosed a few arrows and pursued them while they galloped down the hillside on to a plain which separated them from more hills also clothed with corktrees this plain was about three miles wide and boggy in places still they kept well ahead of the brigands as they took them to be hoping that they would give up the pursuit or lose sight of them amongst the trees as they entered these however to their dismay they saw drawn up in front of them and right across the road another band of roughlooking men perhaps twelve in all  trap said peter we must ride through themit is our only chance at the same time spurring his horse to the front and drawing his sword  choosing the spot where their line was weakest he dashed through it easily enough but next second heard a cry from margaret and pulled his horse round to see that her mare had fallen and that she and castell were in the hands of the thieves indeed already rough men had hold of her and one of them was trying to tear the veil from her face with a shout of rage peter charged them and struck so fierce a blow that his sword cut through the fellows helmet into his skull so that he fell down dying or dead margarets veil still in his hand  then they rushed at him five or six of them and although he wounded another man dragged him from his horse and as he lay upon his back sprang at him to finish him before he could rise already their knives and swords were over him and he was making his farewells to life when he heard a voice command them to desist and bind his arms this was quickly done and he was suffered to rise from the ground to see before him not morella as he half expected but a man clad in fine armour beneath his rough cloak evidently an officer of rank what kind of a moor are you he asked who dare to kill the soldiers of the holy hermandad in the heart of the kings country and he pointed to the dead man  i am not a moor answered peter in his rough spanish i am a christian escaped from granada and i cut down that man because he was trying to insult my betrothed as you would have done señor i did not know that he was a soldier of the hermandad i thought him a common thief of the hills  this speech or as much as he could understand of it seemed to please the officer but before he could answer castell said  sir officer the señor is an englishman and does not speak your language well  he uses his sword well anyhow interrupted the captain glancing at the dead soldiers cloven helm and head  yes sir he is of your trade and as the scar upon his face shows has fought in many wars sir what he tells you is true we are christian captives escaped from granada and flying to seville with my daughter to whom i pray you to do no harm to ask for the protection of their gracious majesties and to find a passage back to england  you do not look like an englishman answered the captain you look like a marano  sir i cannot help my looks i am a merchant of london castell by name it is one well known in seville and throughout this land where i have large dealings as if i can but see him your king himself will acknowledge be not deceived by our dress which we had to put on in order to escape from granada but i beseech you let us go on to seville  señor castell answered the officer i am the captain arrano of puebla and since you would not stop when we called to you and have killed one of my best soldiers to seville you must certainly go but with me not by yourselves you are my prisoners but have no fear no violence shall be done to you or the lady who must take your trials for your deeds before the kings court and there tell your story true or false  so having been disarmed of their swords they were allowed to remount their horses and taken on towards seville as prisoners  at least said margaret to peter we have nothing more to fear from highwaymen and have escaped these soldiers swords unhurt  yes answered peter with a groan but i hoped that tonight we should have slept upon the margaret while she slipped down the river towards the open sea and not in a spanish jail now as fate will have it for the second time i have killed a man on your behalf and all the business will begin again truly our luck is bad  i think it might be worse and i cannot blame you for that deed answered margaret remembering the rough hands of the dead soldier whom some of his comrades had stopped behind to bury  during all the remainder of that long day they rode on through the burning heat across the rich cultivated plain towards the great city of seville whereof the giralda which once had been the minaret of a moorish mosque towered hundreds of feet into the air before them at length towards evening they entered the eastern suburbs of the vast city and passing through them and a great gate beyond began to thread its tortuous streets  whither go we captain arrano asked castell presently  to the prison of the holy hermandad to await your trial for the slaying of one of its soldiers answered the officer  i pray that we may get there soon then said peter looking at margaret who overcome with fatigue swayed upon her saddle like a flower in the wind  so do i muttered castell glancing round at the dark faces of the people who having discovered that they had killed a spanish soldier and taking them to be moors were marching alongside of them in great numbers staring sullenly or cursing them for infidels indeed once when they passed a square a priest in the mob cried out kill them whereon a number of rough fellows made a rush to pull them off their horses and were with difficulty beaten back by the soldiers  foiled in this attempt they began to pelt them with garbage so that soon their white robes were stained and filthy one fellow too threw a stone which struck margaret on the wrist causing her to cry out and drop her rein this was too much for the hotblooded peter who spurring his horse alongside of him before the soldiers could interfere hit him such a buffet in the face that the man rolled upon the ground now castell thought that they would certainly be killed but to his surprise the mob only laughed and shouted such things as well hit moor that infidel has a strong arm and so forth  nor was the officer angry for when the man rose a knife in his hand he drew his sword and struck him down again with the flat of it saying to peter  do not sully your hand with such street swine señor  then he turned and commanded his men to charge the crowd ahead of them  so they got through these people and after many twists and turns down side streets to avoid the main avenues came to a great and gloomy building and into a courtyard through barred gates that were opened at their approach and shut after them here they were ordered to dismount and their horses led away while the officer arrano entered into conversation with the governor of the prison a man with a stern but not unkindly face who surveyed them with much curiosity presently he approached and asked them if they could pay for good rooms as if not he must put them in the common cells  castell answered yes and by way of earnest of it produced five pieces of gold and giving them to the captain arrano begged him to distribute them among his soldiers as a thankoffering for their protection of them through the streets also he said loudly enough for every one to hear that he would be willing to compensate the relatives of the man whom peter had killed by accidentan announcement that evidently impressed his comrades very favourably indeed one of them said he would bear the message to his widow and on behalf of the rest thanked him for his gift then having bade farewell to the officer who told them that they would meet again before the judges they were led through the various passages of the prison to two rooms one small and one of a fair size with heavily barred windows given water to wash in and told that food would be brought to them  in due course it came carried by jailersmeat eggs and wine and glad enough were they to see it while they ate also the governor appeared with a notary and having waited till their meal was finished began to question them  our story is long said castell but with your leave i will tell it you only i pray you suffer my daughter the dona margaret to go to rest for she is quite outworn and if you will you can question her tomorrow  the governor assenting margaret threw off her veil to embrace her father thus showing her beauty for the first time whereat the governor and the notary stared amazed then having given peter her hand to kiss and curtseyed to the governor and the notary she went to her bed in the next room which opened out of that in which they were  when she had gone castell told his story of how his daughter had been kidnapped by the marquis of morella a name that caused the governor to open his eyes very wide and brought from london to granada whither they her father and her betrothed had followed her and escaped but of betty and all the business of the changed bride he said nothing also knowing that these must come out in any case he told them his name and business and those of his partners and correspondents in seville the firm of bernaldez which was one that the governor knew well enough and prayed that the head of that firm the señor juan bernaldez might be communicated with and allowed to visit them on the next morning lastly he explained that they were no thieves or adventurers but english subjects in misfortune and again hinted that they were both able and willing to pay for any kindness or consideration that was shown to them of all of which sayings the governor took note  also this officer said that he would communicate with his superiors and if no objection were made send a messenger to ask the señor bernaldez to attend at the prison on the following day then at length he and the notary departed and the jailers having cleared away the food and locked the door castell and peter lay down on the beds that they had made ready for them thankful enough to find themselves at seville even though in a prison where indeed they slept very well that night  on the following morning they woke much refreshed and after they had breakfasted the governor appeared and with him none other than the señor juan bernaldez castells secret correspondent and spanish partner whom he had last seen some years before in england a stout man with a quiet clever face not over given to words  greeting them with a deference that was not lost upon the governor he asked whether he had leave to speak with them alone the governor assented and went saying he would return within an hour as soon as the door was closed behind him bernaldez said  this is a strange place to meet you in john castell yet i am not altogether surprised since some of your messages reached me through our friends the jews also your ship the margaret lies refitted in the river and to avoid suspicion i have been lading her slowly with a cargo for england though how you will come aboard that ship is more than i can say but we have no time to waste tell me all your story keeping nothing back  so they told him everything as quickly as they could while he listened silently when they had done he said addressing peter  it is a thousand pities young sir that you could not keep your hands off that soldier for now the trouble that was nearly done with has begun anew and in a worse shape the marquis of morella is a very powerful man in this kingdom as you may know from the fact that he was sent to london by their majesties to negotiate a treaty with your english king henry as to the jews and their treatment should any of them escape thither after they have been expelled from spain for nothing less is in the wind and i would have you know that their majesties hate the jews and especially the maranos whom already they burn by dozens here in seville and he glanced meaningly at castell  i am very sorry said peter but the fellow handled her roughly and i was maddened at the sight and could not help myself this is the second time that i have come into trouble from the same cause also i thought that he was but a bandit  love is a bad diplomatist replied bernaldez with a little smile and who can count last years clouds what is done is done now i will try to arrange that the three of you shall be brought straight before their majesties when they sit to hear cases on the day after tomorrow with the queen you will have a better chance than at the hands of any alcalde she has a heart if only one can get at itthat is except where jews and maranos are concerned and again he glanced at castell meanwhile there is money in plenty and in spain we ride to heaven on gold angels he added alluding to that coin and the national corruption  before they could say more the governor returned saying that the señor bernaldez time was up and asking if they had finished their talk  not altogether said margaret noble governor is it permitted that the señor bernaldez should send me some christian clothes to wear for i would not appear before your judges in this soiled heathen garb nor i think would my father or the señor brome  the governor laughed and said he thought that might be arranged and even allowed them another five minutes while they talked of what these clothes should be then he departed with bernaldez leaving them alone  it was not until the latter had gone however that they remembered that they had forgotten to ask him whether he had heard anything of the woman inez who had been furnished with his address but as he had said nothing of her they felt sure that she could not have arrived in seville and once more were much afraid as to what might have happened after they had left granada  that night to their grief and alarm a new trouble fell on them just as they finished their supper the governor appeared and said that by order of the court before which they must be tried the señor brome who was accused of murder must be separated from them so in spite of all they could say or do peter was led away to a separate cell leaving margaret weeping    chapter xix  betty pays her debts  betty dene was not a woman afflicted with fears or apprehensions born of good parents but in poverty for sixandtwenty years she had fought her own way in a rough world and made the best of circumstances healthy fullblooded tough affectionate romantic but honest in her way she was well fitted to meet the ups and downs of life to keep her head above the waters of a turbulent age and to pay back as much as she received from man or woman  yet those long hours which she passed alone in the high turret chamber waiting till they summoned her to play the part of a false bride were the worst that she had ever spent she knew that her position was in a sense shameful and like to end in tragedy and now that she faced it in cold blood began to wonder why she had chosen so to do she had fallen in love with the spaniard almost at first sight though it is true that something like this had happened to her before with other men then he had played his part with her till quite deceived she gave all her heart to him in good earnest believing in her infatuation that notwithstanding the difference of their place and rank he desired to make her his wife for her own sake  afterwards came that bitter day of disillusion when she learned as inez had said to castell that she was but a stalking heifer used for the taking of the white swan her cousin and mistressthat day when she had been beguiled by the letter which was still hid in her garments and for her pains heard herself called a fool to her face in her heart she had sworn to be avenged upon morella then and now the hour had come in which to fulfil her oath and play him back trick for cruel trick  did she still love the man she could not say he was pleasing to her as he had always been and when that is so women forgive much this was certain howeverlove was not her guide tonight was it vengeance then that led her on perhaps at least she longed to be able to say to him see what craft lies hid even in the bosom of an outwitted fool  yet she would not have done it for vengeance sake alone or rather she would have paid herself in some other fashion no her real reason was that she must discharge the debt due to margaret and peter and to castell who had sheltered her for years she it was who had brought them into all this woe and it seemed but just that she should bring them out again even at the cost of her own life and womanly dignity or perchance all three of these powers drove her onlove for the man if it still lingered the desire to be avenged upon him and the desire to snatch his prey from out his maw at least she had set the game and she would play it out to its end however awful that might be  the sun sank the darkness closed about her and she wondered whether ever again she would see the dawn her brave heart quailed a little and she gripped the dagger hilt beneath her splendid borrowed robe thinking to herself that perhaps it might be wisest to drive it into her own breast and not wait until a balked madman did that office for her yet not so for it is always time to die when one must  a knock came at the door and her courage which had sunk so low burned up again within her oh she would teach this spaniard that the englishwoman whom he had made believe was his desired mistress could be his master at any rate he should hear the truth before the end  she unlocked the door and inez entered bearing a lamp by the light of which she scanned her with her quiet eyes  the bridegroom is ready she said slowly that betty might understand and sends me to lead you to him are you afraid  not i answered betty but tell me how will the thing be done  the marquis meets us in the anteroom to that hall which is used as a chapel and there on behalf of the household i as the first of the women give you both the cups of wine be sure that you drink of that which i hold in my left hand passing the cup up beneath your veil so as not to show your face and speak no word lest he should recognise your voice then we shall go into the chapel where the priest henriques waits also all the household but that hall is great and the lamps are feeble so none will know you there by this time also the drugged wine will have begun to work upon morellas brain wherefore provided that you use a low voice you may safely say i betty wed thee carlos not i margaret wed thee then when it is over he will lead you away to the chambers prepared for you where if there is any virtue in my wine he will sleep sound tonight that is as soon as the priest has given me the marriagelines whereof i will hand you one copy and keep the others afterwards and she shrugged her shoulders  what becomes of you asked betty when she had fully mastered these instructions  oh i and the priest start tonight for a ride together to seville where his money awaits him ill company for a woman who means henceforth to be honest and rich but better than none perhaps we shall meet again there or perhaps we shall not at least you know where to seek me and the others at the house of the señor bernaldez now it is time are you ready to be made a marchioness of spain  of course answered betty coolly and they started  through the empty halls and corridors they went and oh surely no eastern plot that had been conceived in them was quite so bold and desperate as theirs they reached the antechamber to the chapel and took their stand outside of the circle of light that fell from its hanging lamps presently a door opened and through it came morella attended by two of his secretaries he was splendidly arrayed in his usual garb of black velvet and about his neck hung chains of gold and jewels and to his breast were fastened the glittering stars and orders pertaining to his rank never or so thought betty had morella seemed more magnificent and handsome he was happy also who was about to drink of that cup of joy which he so earnestly desired yes his face showed that he was happy and betty noting it felt remorse stirring in her breast low he bowed before her while she curtseyed to him bending her tall and graceful form till her knee almost touched the ground then he came to her and whispered in her ear  most sweet most beloved he said i thank heaven that has led me to this joyous hour by many a rough and dangerous path most dear again i beseech you to forgive all the sorrow and the ill that i have brought upon you remembering that it was done for your adored sake that i love you as woman has been seldom loved you and you only and that to you and you only will i cling until my deaths day oh do not tremble and shrink for i swear that no woman in spain shall have a better or a more loyal lord you i will cherish alone for you i will strive by night and day to lift you to great honour and satisfy your every wish many and pleasant may the years be that we shall spend side by side and peaceful our ends when at last we lay us down side by side to sleep awhile and wake again in heaven whereof the shadow lies on me tonight remembering the past i do not ask much of youas yet still if you are minded to give me a bridal gift that i shall prize above crowns or empires say that you forgive me all that i have done amiss and in token lift that veil of yours and kiss me on the lips  betty heard this speech whereof she only fully understood the end and trembled this was a trial that she had not foreseen yet it must be faced for speak she dared not therefore gathering up her courage and remembering that the light was at her back after a little pause as though of modesty and reluctance she raised the pearlembroidered veil and bending forward beneath its shadow suffered morella to kiss her on the lips  it was over the veil had fallen again and the man suspected nothing  i am a good artist thought inez to herself and that woman acts better than the wooden peter scarcely could i have done it so well myself  then the jealousy and hate that she could not control glittering in her soft eyes for she too had loved this man and well inez lifted the golden cups that had been prepared and gliding forward beautiful in her broidered eastern robe fell upon her knee and held them to the bridegroom and the bride morella took that from her right hand and betty that from her left nor intoxicated as he was already with that first kiss of love did he pause to note the evil purpose which was written on the face of his discarded slave betty passing the cup beneath her veil touched it with her lips and returned it to inez but morella exclaiming i drink to you sweet bride most fair and adored of women drained his to the dregs and cast it back to inez as a gift in such fashion that the red wine which clung to its rim stained her white robes like a splash of blood  humbly she bowed humbly she gathered the precious vessel from the floor but when she rose again there was triumph in her eyesnot hate  now morella took his brides hand and followed by his gentlemen and inez walked to the curtains that were drawn as they came into the great hall beyond where had mustered all his household perhaps a hundred of them between their bowing ranks they passed a stately pair and whilst sweet voices sang behind some hidden screen walked onward to the altar where stood the waiting priest they kneeled down upon the goldembroidered cushions while the office of the church was read over them the ring was set upon bettys handscarce it would seem could he find her fingerthe man took the woman to wife the woman took the man for husband his voice was thick and hers was very low of all that listening crowd none could hear the names they spoke  it was over the priest bowed and blessed them they signed some papers there by the light of the altar candles father henriques filled in certain names and signed them also then casting sand upon them placed them in the outstretched hand of inez who although morella never seemed to notice gave one to the bride and thrust the other two into the bosom of her robe then both she and the priest kissed the hands of the marquis and his wife and asked his leave to be gone he bowed his head vaguely andif any had been there to listenwithin ten short minutes they might have heard two horses galloping hard towards the seville gate  now escorted by pages and torchbearers the newwed pair repassed those dim and stately halls the bride veiled mysterious fateful the bridegroom emptyeyed like one who wanders in his sleep thus they reached their chamber and its carved doors shut behind them                                       it was early morning and the servingwomen who waited without that room were summoned to it by the sound of a silver gong two of them entered and were met by betty no longer veiled but wrapped in a loose robe who said to them  my lord the marquis still sleeps come help me dress and make ready his bath and food  the women stared at her for now that she had washed the paint from her face they knew well that this was the señora betty and not the dona margaret whom they had understood the marquis was to marry but she chid them sharply in her bad spanish bidding them be swift as she would be robed before her husband should awake so they obeyed her and when she was ready she went with them into the great hall where many of the household were gathered waiting to do homage to the newwed pair and greeted them all blushing and smiling saying that doubtless the marquis would be among them soon and commanding them meanwhile to go about their several tasks  so well did betty play her part indeed that although they also were bewildered none questioned her place or authority who remembered that after all they had not been told by their lord himself which of these two english ladies he meant to marry also she distributed among the meaner of them a present of money on her husbands behalf and her own and then ate food and drank some wine before them all pledging them and receiving their salutations and good wishes  when all this was done still smiling betty returned to the marriagechamber closing its door behind her sat her down on a chair near the bed and waited for the worst struggle of allthat struggle on which hung her life see morella stirred he sat up gazing about him and rubbing his brow presently his eyes lit upon betty seated stern and upright in her high chair she rose and coming to him kissed him and called him husband and still halfasleep he kissed her back then she sat down again in her chair and watched his face  it changed and changed again wonder fear amaze bewilderment flitted over it till at last he said in english  betty where is my wife  here answered betty  he stared at her nay i mean the dona margaret your cousin and my lady whom i wed last night and how come you here i thought that you had left granada  betty looked astonished  i do not understand you she answered it was my cousin margaret who left granada i stayed here to be married to you as you arranged with me through inez  his jaw dropped  arranged with you through inez mother of heaven what do you mean  mean she answeredi mean what i say surelyand she rose in indignationyou have never dared to try to play some new trick upon me  trick muttered morella what says the woman is all this a dream or am i mad  a dream i think yes it must be a dream since certainly it was to no madman that i was wed last night look and she held before him that writing of marriage signed by the priest by him and by herself which stated that carlos marquis of morella was on such a date at granada duly married to the señora elizabeth dene of london in england  he read it twice then sank back gasping while betty hid away the parchment in her bosom  then presently he seemed to go mad indeed he raved he cursed he ground his teeth he looked round for a sword to kill her or himself but could find none and all the while betty sat still and gazed at him like some living fate  at length he was weary and her turn came  listen she said yonder in london you promised to marry me i have it hidden away and in your own writing by agreement i fled with you to spain by the mouth of your messenger and former love this marriage was arranged between us i receiving your messages to me and sending back mine to you since you explained that for reasons of your own you did not wish to speak of these matters before my cousin margaret and could not wed me until she and her father and her lover were gone from granada so i bade them farewell and stayed here alone for love of you as i fled from london for love of you and last night we were united as all your household know for but now i have eaten with them and received their good wishes and now you dareyou dare to tell me that i your wifei who have sacrificed everything for you i the marchioness of morella am not your wife well go say it outside this chamber and hear your very slaves cry shame upon you go say it to your king and your bishops aye and to his holiness the pope himself and listen to their answer why great as you are and rich as you are they will hale you to a madhouse or a prison  morella listened rocking himself to and fro upon the bed then with an oath sprang towards her to be met by a daggerpoint glinting in his eyes  hear me again she said as he shrank back from that cold steel i am no slave and no weakling you shall not murder me or thrust me away i am your wife and your equal aye and stronger than you in body and in mind and i will have my rights in the face of god and man  certainly he said with a kind of unwilling admirationcertainly you are no weakling certainly also you have paid back all you owe me with a jews interest or mayhap you are not so clever as i think but just a strongminded fool and it is that accursed inez who has settled her debts oh to think of it and he shook his fist in the air to think that i believed myself married to the dona margaret and find you in her placeyou  be silent she said you man without shame who first fly at the throat of your newwedded wife and then insult her by saying that you wish you were wedded to another woman be silent or i will unlock the door and call your own people and repeat your monstrous talk to them and she drew herself to her full height and stood over him on the bed  morella his first rage spent looked at her reflectively and not without a certain measure of homage  i think he remarked that if he did not happen to be in love with another woman and to believe that he had married her you my good betty would make a useful wife to any man who wished to get on in the world i understood you to say that the door is locked and if i might hazard a guess you have the key as also you happen to have a dagger well i find the air in this place close and i want to go out  where to asked betty  let us say to join inez  what she asked would you already be running after that woman again do you already forget that you are married  it seems that i am not to be allowed to forget it now let us bargain i wish to leave granada for a while and without scandal what are your terms remember that there are two to which i will not consent i will not stop here with you and you shall not accompany me remember also that although you hold the dagger at present it is not wise of you to try to push this jest too far  as you did when you decoyed me on board the san antonio said betty well our honeymoon has not begun too sweetly and i do not mind if you go away for a whileto look for inez swear now that you mean me no harm and that you will not plot my death or disgrace or in any way interfere with my liberty or position here in granada swear it on the rood and she took down a silver crucifix that hung upon the wall over the bed and handed it to him for she knew morellas superstitions and that if once he swore upon this symbol he dare not break his oath  and if i will not swear he asked sullenly  then she answered you stop here until you do you who are anxious to be gone i have eaten food this morning you have not i have a dagger you have none and being as we are i am sure that no one will venture to disturb us until inez and your friend the priest have gone further than you can follow  very well i will swear he said and he kissed the crucifix and threw it down you can stop here and rule my house in granada and i will do you no mischief nor trouble you in any way but if you come out of granada then we cross swords  you mean that you intend to leave this city then here is paper and ink be so good as to sign an order to the stewards of your estates within the territories of the moorish king to pay all their revenue to me during your absence and to your servants to obey me in everything  it is easy to see that you were brought up in the house of a jew merchant said morella biting the pen and considering this woman who whether she were hawk or pigeon knew so well how to feather her nest well if i grant you this position and these revenues will you leave me alone and cease to press other claims upon me  now betty bethinking her of those papers that inez had carried away with her and that castell and margaret would know well how to use them if there were need bethinking her also that if she pushed him too far at the beginning she might die suddenly as folk sometimes did in granada answered  it is much to ask of a deluded woman but i still have some pride and will not thrust myself in where it seems i am not wanted therefore so be it till you seek me or send for me i will not seek you so long as you keep your bargain now write the paper sign it and call in your secretaries to witness the signature  in whose favour must i word it he asked  in that of the marquessa of morella she answered and he seeing a loophole in the words obeyed her since if she were not his wife this writing would have no value  somehow he must be rid of this woman of course he might cause her to be killed but even in granada people could not kill one to whom they had seemed to be just married without questions being asked moreover betty had friends and he had enemies who would certainly ask them if she vanished away no he would sign the paper and fight the case afterwards for he had no time to lose margaret had slipped away from him and if once she escaped from spain he knew that he would never see her more for aught he knew she might already have escaped or be married to peter brome the very thought of it filled him with madness there had been a conspiracy against him he was outwitted robbed befooled well hope still remainedand vengeance he could still fight peter and perhaps kill him he could hand over castell the jew to the inquisition he could find a way to deal with the priest henriques and the woman inez and perhaps if fortune favoured him he could get margaret back into his power  oh yes he would sign anything if only thereby he was set at liberty and freed for a while from this servant who called herself his wife this strongminded strongbodied clever englishwoman of whom he had thought to make a tool and who had made a tool of him  so betty dictated and he wrote yes it had come to thisshe dictated and he wrote and signed too the order was comprehensive it gave power to the most honourable marquessa of morella to act for him her husband in all things during his absence from granada it commanded that all rents and profits due to him should be paid to her and that all his servants and dependants should obey her as though she were himself and that her receipt should be as good as his receipt  when the paper was written and betty had spelt it over carefully to see that there was no omission or mistake she unlocked the door struck upon the gong and summoned the secretaries to witness their lords signature to a settlement presently they came bowing and offering many felicitations which to himself morella vowed he would remember against them  i have to go a journey he said witness my signature to this document which provides for the carrying on of my household and the disposal of my property during my absence  they stared and bowed  read it aloud first said betty so that my lord and husband may be sure that there is no mistake  one of them obeyed but before ever he had finished the furious morella shouted to them from the bed  have done and witness then go order me horses and an escort for i ride at once  so they witnessed in a great hurry and left the room betty left with them holding the paper in her hand and when she reached the large hall where the household were gathered waiting to greet their lord she commanded one of the secretaries to read it out to all of them also to translate it into the moorish tongue that every one might understand then she hid it away with the marriage lines and seating herself in the midst of the household ordered them to prepare to receive the most noble marquis  they had not long to wait for presently he came out of the room like a bull into the arena whereon betty rose and curtseyed to him and at her word all his servants bowed themselves down in the eastern fashion for a moment he paused again like the bull when he sees the picadors and is about to charge then he thought better of it and with a muttered curse strode past them  ten minutes later for the third time within twentyfour hours horses galloped from the palace and through the seville gate  friends said betty in her awkward spanish when she knew that he had gone a sad thing has happened to my husband the marquis the woman inez whom it seems he trusted very much has departed stealing a treasure that he valued above everything on earth and so i his newmade wife am left desolate while he tries to find her    chapter xx  isabella of spain  on the afternoon following his first visit castells agent bernaldez arrived again at the prison of the hermandad at seville accompanied by a tailor a woman and a chest full of clothes the governor ordered these two persons to wait while the garments were searched under his own eye but bernaldez he permitted to be led at once to the prisoners as soon as he was with them he said  your marquis has been married fast enough  how do you know that asked castell  from the woman inez who arrived with the priest last night and gave me the certificates of his union with betty dene signed by himself i have not brought them with me lest i should be searched when they might have been taken away but inez has come disguised as a sempstress so show no surprise when you see her if she is admitted perhaps she will be able to tell the dona margaret something of what passed if she is allowed to fit her robes alone after that she must lie hidden for fear of the vengeance of morella but i shall know where to put my hand upon her if she is wanted you will all of you be brought before the queen tomorrow and then i who shall be there will produce the writings scarcely were the words out of his mouth when the governor appeared and with him the tailor and inez who curtseyed and glanced at margaret out of the corners of her soft eyes looking at them all as though with curiosity like one who had never seen or heard of them before  when the dresses had been produced margaret asked whether she might be allowed to try them on with the woman in her own chamber as she had not been measured for them  the governor answered that as both the sempstress and the robes had been searched there was no objection so the two of them retiredinez with her arms full of garments  tell me all about it whispered margaret as soon as the door was closed i die to hear your story  so while she fitted the clothes since in that place they could never be sure but that they were watched through some secret loophole inez with her mouth full of aloe thorns which those of the trade used as pins told her everything down to the time of her escape from granada when she came to that part of the tale where the false bride had lifted her veil and kissed the bridegroom margaret gasped in her amaze  oh how could she do it she said i should have fainted first  she has a good courage that bettyturn to the light please señorai could not have acted better myselfi think it is a little high on the left shoulder he never guessed a thing the besotted fool and that was before i gave him the wine for he wasnt likely to guess much afterwards did the señora say it was tight under the arm well perhaps a little but this stuff stretches what i want to know is what happened afterwards your cousin is the bull that i put my money on i believe she will clear the ring a woman with a nerve of steel had i as much i should have been the marchioness of morella long ago or there would be another marquis by now there the sit of the skirt is perfect the señoras beautiful figure looks more beautiful in it than ever well whoever lives will learn all about it and it is no use worrying meanwhile bernaldez has paid me the moneyand a handsome sum tooso you neednt thank me i only worked for hireand hate now i am going to lie low as i dont want to get my throat cut but he can find me if i am really needed  the priest oh he is safe enough we made him sign a receipt for his cash also i believe that he has got his post as a secretary to the inquisition and began his duties at once as they were shorthanded torturing jews and heretics you know and stealing their goods both of which occupations will exactly suit him i rode with him all the way to seville and he tried to make love to me the slimy knave but i paid him out and inez smiled at some pleasant recollection still i did not quarrel with him outright as he may come in useful who knows theres the governor calling me one moment excellency only one moment  yes señora with those few alterations the dress will be perfect you shall have it back tonight without fail and i can cut the others that you have been pleased to order from the same pattern oh i thank you señora you are too good to a poor girl and in a whisper the mother of god have you in her guard and send that peter has improved in his love making and half hidden in garments inez bowed herself out of the room through the door which the governor had already opened  about nine oclock on the following morning one of the jailers came to summon margaret and her father to be led before the court margaret asked anxiously if the señor brome was coming too but the man replied that he knew nothing of the señor brome as he was in one of the cells for dangerous criminals which he did not serve  so forth they went dressed in their new clothes which were as fine as money could buy and in the latest seville fashion and were conducted to the courtyard here to her joy margaret saw peter waiting for them under guard and dressed also in the christian garments which they had begged might be supplied to him at their cost she sprang to his side none hindering her and forgetting her bashfulness suffered him to embrace her before them all asking him how he had fared since they were parted  none too well answered peter gloomily who did not know if we should ever meet again also my prison is underground where but little light comes through a grating and there are rats in it which will not let a man sleep so i must lie awake the most of the night thinking of you but where go we now  to be put upon our trial before the queen i think hold my hand and walk close beside me but do not stare at me so hard is aught wrong with my dress  nothing answered peter i stare because you look so beautiful in it could you not have worn a veil doubtless there are more marquises about this court  only the moors wear veils peter and now we are christians again listeni think that none of them understand english i have seen inez who asked after you very tenderlynay do not blush it is unseemly in a man have you seen her also nowell she escaped from granada as she planned and betty is married to the marquis  it will never hold good answered peter shaking his head being but a trick and i fear that she will pay for it poor woman still she gave us a start though so far as prisons go i was better off in granada than in that rattrap  yes answered margaret innocently you had a garden to walk in there had you not no dont be angry with me do you know what betty did and she told him of how she had lifted her veil and kissed morella without being discovered  that isnt so wonderful said peter since if they are painted up young women look very much alike in a halflit room  or garden suggested margaret  what is wonderful went on peter scorning to take note of this interruption is that she could consent to kiss the man at all the doubledealing scoundrel has inez told you how he treated her the very thought of it makes me ill  well peter he didnt ask you to kiss him did he and as for the wrongs of inez though doubtless you know more about them than i do i think she has given him an orange for his pomegranate but look there is the alcazar in front of us is it not a splendid castle you know it was built by the moors  i dont care who it was built by said peter and it looks to me like any other castle only larger all i know about it is that i am to be tried there for knocking that ruffian on the headand that perhaps this is the last we shall see of each other as probably they will send me to the galleys if they dont do worse  oh say no such thing i never thought of it it is not possible answered margaret her dark eyes filling with tears  wait till your marquis appears pleading the case against us and you will see what is or is not possible replied peter with conviction still we have come through some storms so let us hope for the best  at that moment they reached the gate of the alcazar which they had approached from their prison through gardens of orangetrees and soldiers came up and separated them next they were led across a court where many people hurried to and fro into a great marblecolumned room glittering with gold which was called the hall of justice at the far end of this place seated on a throne set upon a richly carpeted dais and surrounded by lords and counsellors sat a magnificently attired lady of middle age she was blueeyed and redhaired with a fairskinned open countenance but very reserved and quiet in her demeanour  the queen muttered the guard saluting as did castell and peter while margaret curtseyed  a case had just been tried and the queen isabella after consultation with her assessors was delivering judgment in few words and a gentle voice as she spoke her mild blue eyes fell upon margaret and held it would seem by her beauty rested on her till they wandered off to the tall form of peter and the dark jewishlooking castell by him at the sight of whom she frowned a little  that case was finished and other suitors stood up in their turn but the queen waving her hand and still looking at margaret bent down and asked a question of one of the officers of the court then gave an order whereon the officer rising summoned john castell margaret castell and peter brome all of england to appear at the bar and answer to the charge of murder of one luiz of basa a soldier of the holy hermandad  at once they were brought forward and stood in a line in front of the dais while the officer began to read the charge against them  stay friend interposed the queen these accused are the subjects of our good brother henry of england and may not understand our language though one of them i thinkand she glanced at castellwas not born in england or at any rate of english blood ask them if they need an interpreter  the question was put and all of them answered that they could speak spanish though peter added that he did so but indifferently  you are the knight i think who is charged with the commission of this crime said isabella looking at him  your majesty i am not a knight only a plain esquire peter brome of dedham in england my father was a knight sir peter brome but he fell at my side fighting for richard on bosworth field where i had this wound and he pointed to the scar upon his face but was not knighted for my pains  isabella smiled a little then asked  and how came you to spain señor peter brome  your majesty answered peter margaret helping from time to time when he did not know the spanish words this lady at my side the daughter of the merchant john castell who stands by her is my affianced  then you have won the love of a very beautiful maiden señor interrupted the queen but proceed  she and her cousin the señora dene were kidnapped in london by one who i understand is the nephew of the king ferdinand and an envoy to the english court who passed there as the señor daguilar but who in spain is the marquis of morella  kidnapped and by morella exclaimed the queen  yes your majesty cozened on board his ship and kidnapped the señor castell and i followed them and boarding their vessel tried to rescue them but were shipwrecked at motril the marquis carried them away to granada whither we followed also i being sorely hurt in the shipwreck there in the palace of the marquis we have lain prisoners many weeks but at length escaped purposing to come to seville and seek the protection of your majesties on the road while we were dressed as moors in which garb we compassed our escape we were attacked by men that we thought were bandits for we had been warned against such evil people one of them rudely molested the dona margaret and i cut him down and by misfortune killed him for which manslaughter i am here before you today your majesty i did not know that he was a soldier of the holy hermandad and i pray you pardon my offence which was done in ignorance fear and anger for we are willing to pay compensation for this unhappy death  now some in the court exclaimed  well spoken englishman  then the queen said  if all this tale be true i am not sure that we should blame you over much señor brome but how know we that it is true for instance you said that the noble marquis stole two ladies a deed of which i can scarcely think him capable where then is the other  i believe answered peter that she is now the wife of the marquis of morella  the wife who bears witness that she is the wife he has not advised us that he was about to marry as is usual  then bernaldez stood forward stating his name and occupation and that he was a correspondent of the english merchant john castell and producing the certificate of marriage signed by morella betty and the priest henriques handed it up to the queen saying that he had received them in duplicate by a messenger from granada and had delivered the other to the archbishop of seville  the queen having looked at the paper passed it to her assessors who examined it very carefully one of them saying that the form was not usual and that it might be forged  the queen thought a little while then said  that is so and in one way only can we know the truth let our warrant issue summoning before us our cousin the noble marquis of morella the señora dene who is said to be his wife and the priest henriques of motril who is said to have married them when they have arrived all of them the king my husband and i will examine into the matter and until then we will not suffer our minds to be prejudiced by hearing any more of this cause  now the governor of the prison stood forward and asked what was to be done with the captives until the witnesses could be brought from granada the queen answered that they must remain in his charge and be well treated whereon peter prayed that he might be given a better cell with fewer rats and more light the queen smiled and said that it should be so but added that it would be proper that he should still be kept apart from the lady to whom he was affianced who could dwell with her father then noting the sadness on their faces she added  yet i think they may meet daily in the garden of the prison  margaret curtseyed and thanked her whereon she said very graciously  come here señora and sit by me a little and she pointed to a footstool at her side when i have done this business i desire a few words with you  so margaret was brought up upon the dais and sat down at her majestys left hand upon the broidered footstool and very fair indeed she looked placed thus above the crowd she whose beauty and whose bearing were so royal but castell and peter were led away back to the prison though seeing so many gay lords about the latter went unwillingly enough a while later when the cases were finished the queen dismissed the court save for certain officers who stood at a distance and turning to margaret said  now fair maiden tell me your story as one woman to another and do not fear that anything you say will be made use of at the trial of your lover since against you at any rate at present no charge is laid say first are you really the affianced of that tall gentleman and has he really your heart  all of it your majesty answered margaret and we have suffered much for each others sake then in as few words as she could she told their tale while the queen listened earnestly  a strange story indeed and if it be all true a shameful she said when margaret had finished but how comes it that if morella desired to force you into marriage he is now wed to your companion and cousin what are you keeping back from me and she glanced at her shrewdly  your majesty answered margaret i was ashamed to speak the rest yet i will trust you and do so praying your royal forgiveness if you hold that we who were in desperate straits have done what is wrong my cousin betty dene has paid back morella in his own false gold he won her heart and promised to marry her and at the risk of her own life she took my place at the altar thereby securing our escape  a brave deed if a doubtful said the queen though i question whether such a marriage will be upheld but that is a matter for the church to judge of and i must speak of it no more certainly it is hard to be angry with any of you what did you say that morella promised you when he asked you to marry him in london  your majesty he promised that he would lift me high perhaps evenand she hesitatedto that seat in which you sit  isabella frowned then laughed and said as she looked her up and down  you would fit it well better than i do in truth but what else did he say  your majesty he said that not every one loves the king his uncle that he had many friends who remembered that his father was poisoned by the father of the king who was morellas grandfather also that his mother was a princess of the moors and that he might throw in his lot with theirs or that there were other ways in which he could gain his end  so so said the queen well though he is such a good son of the church and my lord is so fond of him i never loved morella and i thank you for your warning but i must not speak to you of such high matters though it seems that some have thought otherwise fair margaret have you aught to ask of me  yes your majestythat you will deal gently with my true love when he comes before you for trial remembering that he is hot of head and strong of arm and that such knights as hefor knightly is his blood cannot brook to see their ladies mishandled by rough men and the wrappings that shield them torn from off their bosoms also i pray that i may be protected from morella that he may not be allowed to touch or even to speak to me who for all his rank and splendour hate him as though he were some poisoned snake  i have said that i must not prejudge your case you beautiful english margaret the queen answered with a smile yet i think that neither of those things you ask will cause justice to slip the bandage that is about her eyes go and be at peace if you have spoken truth to me as i am sure you have and isabella of spain can prevent it the señor bromes punishment shall not be heavy nor shall the shadow of the marquis of morella the baseborn son of a prince and of some royal infidelthese words she spoke with much bitternessso much as fall upon you though i warn you that my lord the king loves the man as is but natural and will not condemn him lightly tell me one thing this lover of yours is brave is he not  very brave answered margaret smiling  and he can ride a horse and hold a lance can he not at any rate in your quarrel  aye your majesty and wield a sword too as well as most knights though he has been but lately sick some learned that on bosworth field  good now farewell and she gave margaret her hand to kiss then calling two of her officers she bade them conduct her back to the prison and say that she should have liberty to send messages or to write to her the queen if she should so desire  on the night of that same day morella galloped into seville indeed he should have been there long before but misled by the story of the moors who had escorted peter margaret and her father out of granada and seen them take the malaga road he travelled thither first only to find no trace of them in that city then he returned and tracked them to seville where he was soon made acquainted with all that had happened amongst other things he discovered that ten hours before swift messengers had been despatched to granada commanding his attendance and that of betty with whom he had gone through the form of marriage  on the following morning he asked an audience with the queen but it was refused to him and the king his uncle was away next he tried to win admission into the prison and see margaret only to find that neither his high rank and authority nor any bribe would suffice to unlock its doors the queen had commanded otherwise he was informed and knew therefrom that in this matter he must reckon with isabella as an enemy then he bethought him of revenge and began a search for inez and the priest henriques of motril only to find that the former had vanished none knew whither and the holy father was safe within the walls of the inquisition whence he was careful not to emerge and where no layman however highly placed could enter to lay a hand upon one of its officers so full of rage and disappointment he took counsel of lawyers and friends and prepared to defend the suit which he saw would be brought against him hoping that chance might yet deliver margaret into his hands one good card he held which now he determined to play castell as he knew was a jew who for years had posed as a christian and for such there was no mercy in seville perhaps for her fathers sake he might yet be able to work upon margaret whom now he desired to win more fiercely than ever before  at least it was certain that he would try this or any other means however base rather than see her married to his rival peter brome also there was the chance that this peter might be condemned to imprisonment or even to death for the killing of a soldier of the hermandad  so morella made him ready for the great struggle as best he could and since he could not stop her coming awaited the arrival of betty in seville    chapter xxi  betty states her case  seven days had passed during which time margaret and her father had rested quietly in the prison where indeed they dwelt more as guests than as captives thus they were allowed to receive what visitors they would and among them juan bernaldez castells connection and agent who told them of all that passed without through him they sent messengers to meet betty on her road and apprise her of how things stood and of the trial in which her cause would be judged  soon the messengers returned stating that the marchioness of morella was travelling in state accompanied by a great retinue that she thanked them for their tidings and hoped to be able to defend herself at all points  at this news castell stared and margaret laughed for although she did not know all the story she was sure that in some way betty had the mastery of morella and would not be easily defeated though how she came to be travelling with a great retinue she could not imagine still fearing lest she should be attacked or otherwise injured she wrote a humble letter to the queen praying that her cousin might be defended from all danger at the hands of any one whomsoever until she had an opportunity of giving evidence before their majesties  within an hour came the answer that the lady was under the royal protection and that a guard had been sent to escort her and her party and to keep her safe from interference of any sort also that for her greater comfort quarters had been prepared for her in a fortress outside of seville which would be watched night and day and whence she would be brought to the court  peter was still kept apart from them but each day at noon they were allowed to meet him in the walled garden of the prison where they talked together to their hearts content here too he exercised himself daily at all manly games and especially at swordplay with some of the other prisoners using sticks for swords further he was allowed the use of his horse that he had ridden from granada on which he jousted in the yard of the castle with the governor and certain other gentlemen proving himself better at that play than any of them these things he did vigorously and with ardour for margaret had told him of the hint which the queen gave her and he desired to get back his full strength and to perfect himself in the handling of every arm which was used in spain  so the time went by until one afternoon the governor informed them that peters trial was fixed for the morrow and that they must accompany him to the court to be examined also upon all these matters a little later came bernaldez who said that the king had returned and would sit with the queen and that already this affair had made much stir in seville where there was much curiosity as to the story of morellas marriage of which many different tales were told that margaret and her father would be discharged he had little doubt in which case their ship was ready for them but of peters chances he could say nothing for they depended upon what view the king took of his offence and though unacknowledged morella was the kings nephew and had his ear  afterwards they went down into the garden and there found peter who had just returned from his jousting flushed with exercise and looking very manly and handsome margaret took his hand and walking aside told him the news  i am glad he answered for the sooner this business is begun the sooner it will be done but sweet and here his face grew very earnest morella has much power in this land and i have broken its law so none know what the end will be i may be condemned to death or imprisoned or perhaps if i am given the chance with better luck i may fall fighting in any of which cases we shall be separated for a while or altogether should this be so i pray that you will not stay here either in the hope of rescuing me or for other reasons since while you are in spain morella will not cease from his attempts to get hold of you whereas in england you will be safe from him  when margaret heard these words she sobbed aloud for the thought that harm might come to peter seemed to choke her  in all things i will do your bidding she said yet how can i leave you dear while you are alive and if perchance you should die which may god prevent how can i live on without you rather shall i seek to follow you very swiftly  i do not desire that said peter i desire that you should endure your days till the end and come to meet me where i am in due season and not before i will add this that if in afteryears you should meet any worthy man and have a mind to marry him you should do so for i know well that you will never forget me your first love and that beyond this world lie others where there are no marryings or giving in marriage let not my dead hand lie heavy upon you margaret  yet she replied in gentle indignation heavy must it always lie since it is about my heart be sure of this peter that if such dreadful ill should fall upon us as you left me so shall you find me here or hereafter  so be it he said with a sigh of relief for he could not bear to think of margaret as the wife of some other man even after he was gone although his honest simple nature and fear lest her life might be made empty of all joy caused him to say what he had said  then behind the shelter of a flowering bush they embraced each other as do those who know not whether they will ever kiss again and the hour of sunset having come parted as they must  on the following morning once more castell and margaret were led to the hall of justice in the alcazar but this time peter did not go with them the great court was already full of counsellors officers gentlemen and ladies who had come from curiosity and other folk connected with or interested in the case as yet however margaret could not see morella or betty nor had the king and queen taken their seats upon the throne peter was already there standing before the bar with guards on either side of him and greeted them with a smile and a nod as they were ushered to their chairs near by just as they reached them also trumpets were blown and from the back of the hall walking hand in hand appeared their majesties of spain ferdinand and isabella whereat all the audience rose and bowed remaining standing till they were seated on the thrones  the king whom they now saw for the first time was a thickset active man with pleasant eyes a fair skin and a broad forehead but as margaret thought somewhat slyfacedthe face of a man who never forgot his own interests in those of another like the queen he was magnificently attired in garments broidered with gold and the arms of aragon while in his hand he held a golden sceptre surmounted by a jewel and about his waist to show that he was a warlike king he wore his long crosshandled sword smilingly he acknowledged the homage of his subjects by lifting his hand to his cap and bowing then his eye fell upon the beautiful margaret and turning he put a question to the queen in a light sharp voice asking if that were the lady whom morella had married and if so why in the name of heaven he wished to be rid of her  isabella answered that she understood that this was the señora whom he had desired to marry when he married some one else as he alleged by mistake but who was in fact affianced to the prisoner before them a reply at which all who heard it laughed  at this moment the marquis of morella accompanied by his gentlemen and some longgowned lawyers appeared walking up the court dressed in the black velvet that he always wore and glittering with orders upon his head was a cap also of black velvet from which hung a great pearl and this cap he did not remove even when he bowed to the king and queen for he was one of the few grandees of spain who had the right to remain covered before their majesties they acknowledged his salutation ferdinand with a friendly nod and isabella with a cold bow and he too took the seat that had been prepared for him just then there was a disturbance at the far end of the court where one of its officers could be heard calling  way make way for the marchioness of morella at the sound of this name the marquis whose eyes were fixed on margaret frowned fiercely rising from his seat as though to protest then at some whispered word from a lawyer behind him sat down again  now the crowd of spectators separated and margaret turning to look down the long hall saw a procession advancing up the lane between them some clad in armour and some in white moorish robes blazoned with the scarlet eagle the cognisance of morella in the midst of them her train supported by two moorish women walked a tall and beautiful lady a coronet upon her brow her fair hair outspread a purple cloak hanging from her shoulders half hiding that same splendid robe sewn with pearls which had been morellas gift to margaret and about her white bosom the chain of pearls which he had presented to betty in compensation for her injuries  margaret stared and stared again and her father at her side murmured  it is our betty truly fine feathers make fine birds yes betty it was without a doubt though remembering her in her humble woollen dress at the old house in holborn it was hard to recognise the poor companion in this proud and magnificent lady who looked as though all her life she had trodden the marble floors of courts and consorted with nobles and with queens up the great hall she came stately imperturbable looking neither to the right nor to the left taking no note of the whisperings about her no nor even of morella or of margaret till she reached the open space in front of the bar where peter and his guards gazing with all their eyes hastened to make place for her there she curtseyed thrice twice to the queen and once to the king her consort then turning bowed to the marquis who fixed his eyes upon the ground and took no note bowed to castell and peter and lastly advancing to margaret gave her her cheek to kiss this margaret did with becoming humility whispering in her ear  how fares your grace  better than you would in my shoes whispered betty back with ever so slight a trembling of her left eyelid while margaret heard the king mutter to the queen  a fine peacock of a woman look at her figure and those big eyes morella must be hard to please  perhaps he prefers swans to peacocks answered the queen in the same voice with a glance at margaret whose quieter and more refined beauty seemed to gain by contrast with that of her nobly built and dazzlingskinned cousin then she motioned to betty to take the seat prepared for her which she did with her suite standing behind her and an interpreter at her side  i am somewhat bewildered said the king glancing from morella to betty and from margaret to peter for evidently the humour of the situation did not escape him what is the exact case that we have to try  then one of the legal assessors or alcaldes rose and said that the matter before their majesties was a charge against the englishman at the bar of killing a certain soldier of the holy hermandad but that there seemed to be other matters mixed up with it  so i gather answered the king for instance an accusation of the carrying off of subjects of a friendly power out of the territory of that power a suit for nullity of a marriage and a crosssuit for the declaration of the validity of the said marriageand the holy saints know what besides well one thing at a time let us try this tall englishman  so the case was opened against peter by a public prosecutor who restated it as it had been laid before the queen the captain arrano gave his evidence as to the killing of the soldier but in crossexamination by peters advocate admitted for evidently he bore no malice against the prisoner that the said soldier had roughly handled the dona margaret and that the said peter being a stranger to the country might very well have taken them for a troop of bandits or even moors also he added that he could not say that the englishman had intended to kill the soldier  then castell and margaret gave their evidence the latter with much modest sweetness indeed when she explained that peter was her affianced husband to whom she was to have been wed on the day after she had been stolen away from england and that she had cried out to him for help when the dead soldier caught hold of her and rent away her veil there was a murmur of sympathy and the king and queen began to talk with each other without paying much heed to her further words  next they spoke to two of the judges who sat with them after which the king held up his hand and announced that they had come to a decision on the case it was that under the circumstances the englishman was justified in cutting down the soldier especially as there was nothing to show that he meant to kill him or that he knew that he belonged to the holy hermandad he would therefore be discharged on the condition that he paid a sum of money which indeed it appeared had already been paid to the mans widow in compensation for the mans death and a further small sum for masses to be said for the welfare of his soul  peter began to give thanks for this judgment but while he was still speaking the king asked if any of those present wished to proceed in further suits instantly betty rose and said that she did then through her interpreter she stated that she had received the royal commands to attend before their majesties and was now prepared to answer any questions or charges that might be laid against her  what is your name señora asked the king  elizabeth marchioness of morella born elizabeth dene of the ancient and gentle family of dene a native of england answered betty in a clear and decided voice  the king bowed then asked  does any one dispute this title and description  i do answered the marquis of morella speaking for the first time  on what grounds marquis  on every ground he answered she is not the marchioness of morella inasmuch as i went through the ceremony of marriage with her believing her to be another woman she is not of ancient and gentle family since she was a servant in the house of the merchant castell yonder in london  that proves nothing marquis interrupted the king my family may i think be called ancient and gentle which you will be the last to deny yet i have played the part of a servant on an occasion which i think the queen here will rememberan allusion at which the audience who knew well enough to what it referred laughed audibly as did her majesty1 the marriage and rank are matters for proof went on the king if they are questioned but is it alleged that this lady has committed any crime which prevents her from pleading  none answered betty quickly except that of being poor and the crime if it is one as it may be of having married that man the marquis of morella whereat the audience laughed again  well madam you do not seem to be poor now remarked the king looking at her gorgeous and bejewelled apparel and here we are more apt to think marriage a folly than a crime a light saying at which the queen frowned a little but he added quickly set out your case madam and forgive me if until you have done so i do not call you marchioness  footnote 1 when travelling from saragossa to valladolid to be married to isabella ferdinand was obliged to pass himself off as a valet prescott says the greatest circumspection therefore was necessary the party journeyed chiefly in the night ferdinand assumed the disguise of a servant and when they halted on the road took care of the mules and served his companions at table  here is my case sire said betty producing the certificate of marriage and handing it up for inspection  the judges and their majesties inspected it the queen remarking that a duplicate of this document had already been submitted to her and passed on to the proper authorities  is the priest who solemnised the marriage present asked the king whereon bernaldez castells agent rose and said that he was though he neglected to add that his presence had been secured for no mean sum  one of the judges ordered that he should be called and presently the foxyfaced father henriques at whom the marquis glared angrily appeared bowing and was sworn in the usual form and on being questioned stated that he had been priest at motril and chaplain to the marquis of morella but was now a secretary of the holy office at seville in answer to further questions he said that apparently by the bridegrooms own wish and with his full consent on a certain date at granada he had married the marquis to the lady who stood before them and whom he knew to be named betty dene also that at her request since she was anxious that proper record should be kept of her marriage he had written the certificates which the court had seen which certificates the marquis and others had signed immediately after the ceremony in his private chapel at granada subsequently he had left granada to take up his appointment as a secretary to the inquisition at seville which had been conferred on him by the ecclesiastical authorities in reward of a treatise which he had written upon heresy that was all he knew about the affair  now morellas advocate rose to crossexamine asking him who had made the arrangements for the marriage he answered that the marquis had never spoken to him directly on the subjectat least he had never mentioned to him the name of the lady the señora inez arranged everything  now the queen broke in asking where was the señora inez and who she was the priest replied that the señora inez was a spanish woman one of the marquiss household at granada whom he made use of in all confidential affairs she was young and beautiful but he could say no more about her as to where she was now he did not know although they had ridden together to seville perhaps the marquis knew  now the priest was ordered to stand down and betty tendered herself as a witness and through her interpreter told the court the story of her connection with morella she said that she had met him in london when she was a member of the household of the señor castell and that at once he began to make love to her and won her heart subsequently he suggested that she should elope with him to spain promising to marry her at once in proof of which she produced the letter he had written which was translated and handed up for the inspection of the courta very awkward letter as they evidently thought although it was not signed with the writers real name next betty explained the trick by which she and her cousin margaret were brought on board his ship and that when they arrived there the marquis refused to marry her alleging that he was in love with her cousin and not with hera statement which she took to be an excuse to avoid the fulfilment of his promise she could not say why he had carried off her cousin margaret also but supposed that it was because having once brought her upon the ship he did not know how to be rid of her  then she described the voyage to spain saying that during that voyage she kept the marquis at a distance since there was no priest to marry them also she was sick and much ashamed who had involved her cousin and mistress in this trouble she told how the señors castell and brome had followed in another vessel and boarded the caravel in a storm also of the shipwreck and their journey to granada as prisoners and of their subsequent life there finally she described how inez came to her with proposals of marriage and how she bargained that if she consented her cousin the señor castell and the señor brome should go free they went accordingly and the marriage took place as arranged the marquis first embracing her publicly in the presence of various peoplenamely inez and his two secretaries who except inez were present and could bear witness to the truth of what she said  after the marriage and the signing of the certificates she had accompanied him to his own apartments which she had never entered before and there to her astonishment in the morning he announced that he must go a journey upon their majesties business before he went however he gave her a written authority which she produced to receive his rents and manage his matters in granada during his absence which authority she read to the gathered household before he left she had obeyed him accordingly until she had received the royal command receiving moneys giving her receipt for the same and generally occupying the unquestioned position of mistress of his house  we can well believe it said the king drily and now marquis what have you to answer to all this  i will answer presently replied morella who trembled with rage first suffer that my advocate crossexamine this woman  so the advocate crossexamined though it cannot be said that he had the better of betty first he questioned her as to her statement that she was of ancient and gentle family whereon betty overwhelmed the court with a list of her ancestors the first of whom a certain sieur dene de dene had come to england with the norman duke william the conqueror after him so she still swore the said denes de dene had risen to great rank and power having been the favourites of the kings of england and fought for them generation after generation  by slow degrees she came down to the wars of the roses in which she said her grandfather had been attainted for his loyalty and lost his land and titles so that her father whose only child she wasbeing now the representative of the noble family dene de denefell into poverty and a humble place in life however he married a lady of even more distinguished race than his own a direct descendant of a noble saxon family far more ancient in blood than the upstart normans at this point while peter and margaret listened amazed at a hint from the queen the bewildered court interfered through the head alcalde praying her to cease from the history of her descent which they took for granted was as noble as any in england  next she was examined as to her relations with morella in london and told the tale of his wooing with so much detail and imaginative power that in the end that also was left unfinished so it was with everything clever as morellas advocate might be sometimes in english and sometimes in the spanish tongue betty overwhelmed him with words and apt answers until able to make nothing of her the poor man sat down wiping his brow and cursing her beneath his breath  then the secretaries were sworn and after them various members of morellas household who although somewhat unwillingly confirmed all that betty had said as to his embracing her with lifted veil and the rest so at length betty closed her case reserving the right to address the court after she had heard that of the marquis  now the king queen and their assessors consulted for a little while for evidently there was a division of opinion among them some thinking that the case should be stopped at once and referred to another tribunal and others that it should go on at length the queen was heard to say that at least the marquis of morella should be allowed to make his statement as he might be able to prove that all this story was a fabrication and that he was not even at granada at the time when the marriage was alleged to have taken place  the king and the alcaldes assenting the marquis was sworn and told his story admitting that it was not one which he was proud to repeat in public he narrated how he had first met margaret betty and peter at a public ceremony in london and had then and there fallen in love with margaret and accompanied her home to the house of her father the merchant john castell  subsequently he discovered that this castell who had fled from spain with his father in childhood was that lowest of mankind an unconverted jew who posed as a christian at this statement there was a great sensation in court and the queens face hardened although it is true that he had married a christian lady and that his daughter had been baptized and brought up as a christian of which faith she was a loyal member nor did she knowas he believedthat her father remained a jew since otherwise he would not have continued to seek her as his wife their majesties would be aware he went on that owing to reasons with which they were acquainted he had means of getting at the truth of these matters concerning the jews in england as to which indeed he had already written to them although owing to his shipwreck and to the pressure of his private affairs he had not yet made his report on his embassy in person  continuing he said that he admitted that he had made love to the servingwoman betty in order to gain access to margaret whose father mistrusted him knowing something of his mission she was a person of no character  here betty rose and said in a clear voice  i declare the marquis of morella to be a knave and a liar there is more good character in my little finger than in his whole body and she added than in that of his mother before himan allusion at which the marquis flushed while satisfied for the present with this homethrust betty sat down  he had proposed to margaret but she was not willing to marry him as he found that she was affianced to a distant cousin of hers the señor peter brome a swashbuckler who was in trouble for the killing of a man in london as he had killed the soldier of the holy hermandad in spain therefore in his despair being deeply enamoured of her and knowing that he could offer her great place and fortune he conceived the idea of carrying her off and to do so was obliged much against his will to abduct betty also  so after many adventures they came to granada where he was able to show the dona margaret that the señor peter brome was employing his imprisonment in making love to that member of his household inez who had been spoken of but now could not be found  here peter who could bear this no longer also rose and called him a liar to his face saying that if he had the opportunity he would prove it on his body but was ordered by the king to sit down and be silent  having been convinced of her lovers unfaithfulness the marquis went on the dona margaret had at length consented to become his wife on condition that her father the señor brome and her servant betty dene were allowed to escape from granada  where remarked the queen you had no right to detain them marquis except perhaps the father john castell she added significantly  where he admitted with sorrow he had no right to detain them  therefore went on the queen acutely there was no legal or moral consideration for this alleged promise of marriagea point at which the lawyers nodded approvingly  the marquis submitted that there was a consideration that at any rate the dona margaret wished it on the day arranged for the wedding the prisoners were let go disguised as moors but he now knew that through the trickery of the woman inez whom he believed had been bribed by castell and his fellowjews the dona margaret escaped in place of her servant betty with whom he subsequently went through the form of marriage believing her to be margaret  as regards the embrace before the ceremony it took place in a shadowed room and he thought that bettys face and hair must have been painted and dyed to resemble those of margaret for the rest he was certain that the ceremonial cup of wine that he drank before he led the woman to the altar was drugged since he only remembered the marriage itself very dimly and after that nothing at all until he woke upon the following morning with an aching brow to see betty sitting by him as for the power of administration which she produced being perfectly mad at the time with rage and disappointment and sure that if he stopped there any longer he should commit the crime of killing this woman who had deceived him so cruelly he gave it that he might escape from her their majesties would notice also that it was in favour of the marchioness of morella as this marriage was null and void there was no marchioness of morella therefore the document was null and void also that was the truth and all he had to say    chapter xxii  the doom of john castell  his evidence finished the marquis of morella sat down whereon the king and queen having whispered together the head alcalde asked betty if she had any questions to put to him she rose with much dignity and through her interpreter said in a quiet voice  yes a great many yet she would not debase herself by asking a single one until the stain which he had cast upon her was washed away which she thought could only be done in blood he had alleged that she was a woman of no character and he had further alleged that their marriage was null and void being of the sex she was she could not ask him to make good his assertions at the swords point therefore as she believed she had the right to do according to all the laws of honour she asked leave to seek a championif an unfriended woman could find one in a strange landto uphold her fair name against this base and cruel slander  now in the silence that followed her speech peter rose and said  i ask the permission of your majesties to be that champion your majesties will note that according to his own story i have suffered from this marquis the bitterest wrong that one man can receive at the hands of another also he has lied in saying that i am not true to my affianced lady the dona margaret and surely i have a right to avenge the lie upon him lastly i declare that i believe the señora betty to be a good and upright woman upon whom no shadow of shame has ever fallen and as her countryman and relative i desire to uphold her good name before all the world i am a foreigner here with few friends or none yet i cannot believe that your majesties will withhold from me the right of battle which all over the world in such a case one gentleman may demand of another i challenge the marquis of morella to mortal combat without mercy to the fallen and here is the proof of it  then stepping across the open space before the bar he drew the leathern gauntlet off his hand and threw it straight into morellas face thinking that after such an insult he could not choose but fight  with an oath morella snatched at his sword but before he could draw it officers of the court threw themselves on him and the kings stern voice was heard commanding them to cease their brawling in the royal presences  i ask your pardon sire gasped morella but you have seen what this englishman did to me a grandee of spain  yes broke in the queen but we have also heard what you a grandee of spain did to this gentleman of england and the charge you brought against him which it seems the dona margaret does not believe  in truth no your majesty said margaret let me be sworn also and i can explain much of what the marquis has told to you i never wished to marry him or any man save this one and she touched peter on the arm and anything that he or i may have done we did to escape the evil net in which we were snared  we believe it answered the queen with a smile then fell to consulting with the king and the alcaldes  for a long time they debated in voices so low that none could hear what they said looking now at one and now at another of the parties to this strange suit also some priest was called into their council which margaret thought a bad omen at length they made up their minds and in a low quiet voice and measured words her majesty as queen of castile gave the judgment of them all addressing herself first to morella she said  my lord marquis you have brought very grave charges against the lady who claims to be your wife and the englishman whose affianced bride you admit you snatched away by fraud and force this gentleman on his own behalf and on behalf of these ladies has challenged you to a combat to the death in a fashion that none can mistake do you accept his challenge  i would accept it readily enough your majesty answered morella in sullen tones since heretofore none have doubted my courage but i must remember that i amand he paused then addedwhat your majesties know me to be a grandee of spain and something more wherefore it is scarcely lawful for me to cross swords with a jewmerchants clerk for that was this mans high rank and office in england  you could cross them with me on your ship the san antonio exclaimed peter bitterly why then are you ashamed to finish what you were not ashamed to begin moreover i tell you that in love or war i hold myself the equal of any womanthief and bastard in this kingdom who am one of a name that has been honoured in my own  now again the king and queen spoke together of this question of rankno small one in that age and country then isabella said  it is true that a grandee of spain cannot be asked to meet a simple foreign gentleman in single combat therefore since he has thought fit to raise it we uphold the objection of the marquis of morella and declare that this challenge is not binding on his honour yet we note his willingness to accept the same and are prepared to do what we can to make the matter easy so that it may not be said that a spaniard who has wrought wrong to an englishman and been asked openly to make the amend of arms in the presence of his sovereigns was debarred from so doing by the accident of his rank señor peter brome if you will receive it at our hands as others of your nation have been proud to do we propose believing you to be a brave and loyal man of gentle birth to confer upon you the knighthood of the order of st james and thereby and therein the right to consort with as equal or to fight as equal any noble of spain unless he should be of the right bloodroyal to which place we think the most puissant and excellent marquis of morella lays no claim  i thank your majesties said peter astonished for the honour that you would do to me which had it not been for the fact that my father chose the wrong side on bosworth field being of a race somewhat obstinate in the matter of loyalty i should not have needed to accept from your majesties as it is i am very grateful since now the noble marquis need not feel debased in settling our long quarrel as he would desire to do  come hither and kneel down señor peter brome said the queen when he had finished speaking  he obeyed and isabella borrowing his sword from the king gave him the accolade by striking him thrice upon the right shoulder and saying  rise sir peter brome knight of the most noble order of saint iago and by creation a don of spain  he rose he bowed retreating backwards as was the custom and thereby nearly falling off the dais which some people thought a good omen for morella as he went the king said  our marshal sir peter will arrange the time and manner of your combat with the marquis as shall be most convenient to you both meanwhile we command you both that no unseemly word or deed should pass between you who must soon meet face to face to abide the judgment of god in battle à loutrance rather since one of you must die so shortly do we entreat you to prepare your souls to appear before his judgmentseat we have spoken  now the audience appeared to think that the court was ended for many of them began to rise but the queen held up her hand and said  there remain other matters on which we must give judgment the señora here and she pointed to betty asks that her marriage should be declared valid or so we understand and the marquis of morella asks that his marriage with the said señora should be declared void or so we understand now this is a question over which we claim no power it having to do with a sacrament of the church therefore we leave it to his holiness the pope in person or by his legate to decide according to his wisdom in such manner as may seem best to him if the parties concerned should choose to lay their suit before him meanwhile we declare and decree that the señora born elizabeth dene shall everywhere throughout our dominions until or unless his holiness the pope shall decide to the contrary be received and acknowledged as the marchioness of morella and that during his lifetime her reputed husband shall make due provision for her maintenance and that after his death should no decision have been come to by the court of rome upon her suit she shall inherit and enjoy that proportion of his lands and property which belongs to a wife under the laws of this realm  now while betty bowed her thanks to their majesties till the jewels on her bodice rattled and morella scowled till his face looked as black as a thundercloud above the mountains the audience whispering to each other once more rose to disperse again the queen held up her hand for the judgment was not yet finished  we have a question to ask of the gallant sir peter brome and the dona margaret his affianced is it still their desire to take each other in marriage  now peter looked at margaret and margaret looked at peter and there was that in their eyes which both of them understood for he answered in a clear voice  your majesty that is the dearest wish of both of us  the queen smiled a little then asked and do you señor john castell consent and allow your daughters marriage to this knight  i do indeed he answered gravely had it not been for this man here and he glanced with bitter hatred at morella they would have been united long ago and to that end he added with meaning such little property as i possessed has been made over to trustees in england for their benefit and that of their children therefore i am henceforward dependent upon their charity  good said the queen then one question remains to be put and only one is it your wish both of you that you should be wed before the single combat between the marquis of morella and sir peter brome remember dona margaret before you answer that in this event you may soon be made a widow and that if you postpone the ceremony you may never be a wife  now margaret and peter spoke a few words together then the former answered for them both  should my lord fall she said in her sweet voice that trembled as she uttered the words in either case my heart will be widowed and broken let me live out my days therefore bearing his name that knowing my deathless grief none may thenceforth trouble me with their love who desire to remain his bride in heaven  well spoken said the queen we decree that here in our cathedral of seville you twain shall be wed on the same day but before the marquis of morella and you sir peter brome meet in single combat further lest harm should be attempted against either of you and she looked sideways at morella you señora margaret shall be my guest until you leave my care to become a bride and you sir peter shall return to lodge in the prison whence you came but with liberty to see whom you will and to go when and where you will but under our protection lest some attempt should be made on you  she ceased whereon suddenly the king began speaking in his sharp thin voice  having settled these matters of chivalry and marriage he said there remains another which i will not leave to the gentle lips of our sovereign lady that has to do with something higher than either of themnamely the eternal welfare of mens souls and of the church of christ on earth it has been declared to us that the man yonder john castell merchant of london is that accursed thing a jew who for the sake of gain has all his life feigned to be a christian and as such deceived a christian woman into marriage that he is moreover of our subjects having been born in spain and therefore amenable to the civil and spiritual jurisdiction of this realm  he paused while margaret and peter stared at each other affrighted only castell stood silent and unmoved though he guessed what must follow better than either of them  we judge him not went on the king who claim no authority in such high matters but we do what we must dowe commit him to the holy inquisition there to take his trial  now margaret cried aloud peter stared about him as though for help which he knew could never come feeling more afraid than ever he had been in all his life and for the first time that day morella smiled at least he would be rid of one enemy but castell went to margaret and kissed her tenderly then he shook peter by the hand saying  kill that thief and he looked at morella as i know you will and would if there were ten as bad at his back and be a good husband to my girl as i know you will also for i shall ask an account of you of these matters when we meet where there is neither jew nor christian priest nor king now be silent and bear what must be borne as i do for i have a word to say before i leave you and the world  your majesties i make no plea for myself and when i am questioned before your inquisition the task will be easy for i desire to hide nothing and will tell the truth though not from fear or because i shrink from pain your majesties you have told us that these two who at least are good enough christians from their birth shall be wed i would ask you if any spiritual crime or supposed crime of mine will be allowed to work their separation or to their detriment in any way whatsoever  on that point answered the queen quickly as though she wished to get in her words before the king or any one else could speak you have our royal word john castell your case is apart from their case and nothing of which you may be convicted shall affect them in person or she added slowly in property  a large promise muttered the king  it is my promise she answered decidedly and it shall be kept at any cost these two shall marry and if sir peter lives through the fray they shall depart from spain unharmed nor shall any fresh charge be brought against them in any court of the realm nor shall they be persecuted or proceeded against in any other realm or on the high seas at our instance or that of our officers let my words be written down and one copy of them signed and filed and another copy given to the dona margaret  your majesty said castell i thank you and now if die i must i shall die happy yet i make bold to tell you that had you not spoken them it was my purpose to kill myself here before your eyes since that is a sin for which none can be asked to suffer save the sinner also i say that this inquisition which you have set up shall eat out the heart of spain and bring her greatness to the dust of death the torture and the misery of those jews than whom you have no better or more faithful subjects shall be avenged on the heads of your childrens children for so long as their blood endures  he finished speaking and while something that sounded like a gasp of fear rose from that crowded court as the meaning of castells bold words came home to his auditors the crowd behind him separated and there appeared walking two by two a file of masked and hooded monks and a guard of soldiers all of whom doubtless were in waiting they came to john castell they touched him on the shoulder they closed around him hiding him as it were from the world and in the midst of them he vanished away  peters memories of that strange day in the alcazar at seville always remained somewhat dim and blurred it was not wonderful within the space of a few hours he had been tried for his life and acquitted he had seen betty transformed from a humble companion into a magnificent and glittering marchioness as a chrysalis is transformed into a butterfly urge her strange suit against the husband who had tricked her and whom she had tricked and for the while at any rate more than hold her own thanks to her ready wit and native strength of character  as her champion and that of margaret he had challenged morella to a single combat and when his defiance was refused on the ground of his lack of rank by the favour of the great isabella who wished to use him as her instrument doubtless because of those secret ambitions of morellas which margaret had revealed to her he had been suddenly advanced to the high station of a knight of the order of st james of spain to which although he cared little for it otherwise he might vainly have striven to come  more and better far the desire of his heart would at length be attained for now it was granted to him to meet his enemy the man whom he hated with just cause upon a fair field without favour shown to one or the other and to fight him to the death he had been promised further that within some few days margaret should be given to him as wife although it well might be that she would keep that name but for a single hour and that until then they both should dwell safe from morellas violence and treachery also that whatever chanced no suit should lie against them in any land for aught that they did or had done in spain  lastly when all seemed safe save for that chance of war whereof having been bred to such things he took but little count when his cup emptied at length of mire and sand was brimming full with the good red wine of battle and of love when it was at his very lips indeed fate had turned it to poison and to gall castell his brides father and the man he loved had been haled to the vaults of the inquisition whence he knew well he would come forth but once more dressed in a yellow robe relaxed to the civil arm to perish slowly in the fires of the quemadero the place of burning of heretics  what would his conquest over morella avail if heaven should give him power to conquer what kind of a bridal would that be which was sealed and consecrated by the death of the brides father in the torturing fires of the inquisition how would they ever get the smell of the smoke of that sacrifice out of their nostrils castell was a brave man no torments would make him recant it was doubtful even if he would be at the pains to deny his faith he who had only been baptized a christian by his father for the sake of policy and suffered the fraud to continue for the purposes of his business and that he might win and keep a christian wife no castell was doomed and he could no more protect him from priest and king than a dove can protect its nest from a pair of hungry peregrines  oh that last scene never could peter forget it while he livedthe vast fretted hall with its painted arches and marble columns the rays of the afternoon sun piercing the windowplaces and streaming like blood on to the black robes of the monks as with their prey they vanished back into the arcade where they had lurked margarets wild cry and ashen face as her father was torn away from her and she sank fainting on to bettys bejewelled bosom the cruel sneer on morellas lips the kings hard smile the pity in the queens eye the excited murmurings of the crowd the quick brief comments of the lawyers the scratching of the clerks quill as careless of everything save his work he recorded the various decrees and above it all as it were upright defiant unmoved castell surrounded by the ministers of death vanishing into the blackness of the arcade vanishing into the jaws of the tomb    chapter xxiii  father henriques and the bakers oven  a week had gone by margaret was in the palace where peter had been to see her twice and found her brokenhearted even the fact that they were to be wed upon the following saturday the day fixed also for the combat between peter and morella brought her no joy or consolation for on the next day the sunday there was to be an act of faith an autodafé in seville when wicked heretics such as jews moors and persons who had spoken blasphemy were to suffer for their crimessome by fire on the quemadero or place of burning outside the city some by making public confession of their grievous sin before they were carried off to perpetual and solitary imprisonment some by being garotted before their bodies were given to the flames and so forth in this ceremony it was known that john castell had been doomed to play a leading part  on her knees with tears and beseechings margaret had prayed the queen for mercy but in this matter those tears produced no more effect upon the heart of isabella than does water dripping on a diamond gentle enough in other ways where questions of the faith were concerned she had the craft of a fox and the cruelty of a tiger she was even indignant with margaret had not enough been done for her she asked had she not even passed her royal word that no steps should be taken to deprive the accused of such property as he might own in spain if he were found guilty and that none of those penalties which according to law and custom fell upon the children of such infamous persons should attach to her margaret was she not to be publicly married to her lover and should he survive the combat allowed to depart with him in honour without even being asked to see her father expiate his iniquity surely as a good christian she should rejoice that he was given this opportunity of reconciling his soul with god and be made an example to others of his accursed faith was she then a heretic also  so she stormed on till margaret crept from her presence wondering whether this creed could be right that would force the child to inform against and bring the parent to torment where were such things written in the sayings of the saviour and his apostles and if they were not written who had invented them  save himsave him margaret had gasped to peter in despair save him or i swear to you however much i may love you however much we may seem to be married never shall you be a husband to me  that seems hard replied peter shaking his head mournfully since it was not i who gave him over to these devils and probably the end of it would be that i should share his fate still i will do what a man can  no no she cried in despair do nothing that will bring you into danger but he had gone without waiting for her answer  it was night and peter sat in a secret room in a certain bakers shop in seville there were present there besides himself the fray henriquesnow a secretary to the holy inquisition but disguised as a laymanthe woman inez the agent bernaldez and the old jew israel of granada  i have brought him here never mind how inez was saying pointing to henriques a risky and disagreeable business enough and now what is the use of it  no use at all answered the fray coolly except to me who pocket my ten gold pieces  a thousand doubloons if our friend escapes safe and sound put in the old jew israel god in heaven think of it a thousand doubloons  the secretarys eyes gleamed hungrily  i could do with them well enough he answered and hell could spare one filthy jew for ten years or so but i see no way what i do see is that probably all of you will join him it is a great crime to try to tamper with a servant of the holy office  bernaldez turned white and the old jew bit his nails but inez tapped the priest upon the shoulder  are you thinking of betraying us she asked in her gentle voice look here friend i have some knowledge of poisons and i swear to you that if you attempt it you shall die within a week tied in a double knot and never know whence the dose came or i can bewitch you i who have not lived a dozen years among the moors for nothing so that your head swells and your body wastes and you utter blasphemies not knowing what you say until for very shames sake they toast you among the faggots also  bewitch me answered henriques with a shiver you have done that already or i should not be here  then if you do not wish to be in another place before your time went on inez still tapping his shoulder gently think think and find a way worthy servant of the holy office  a thousand doubloonsa thousand gold doubloons croaked old israel or if you fail sooner or later this month or next this year or next deathdeath as slow and cruel as we can make it there are two inquisitions in spain holy father but one of them does its business in the dark and your name is on its ledger  now henriques was very frightened as well he might be with all those eyes glaring at him  you need fear nothing he said i know the devilish power of your league too well and that if i kill you all a hundred others i have never seen or heard of would dog me to my death who have taken your accursed money  i am glad that you understand at last dear friend said the soft mocking voice of inez who stood behind the monk like an evil genius and again tapped him affectionately on the shoulder this time with the bare blade of a poniard now be quick with that plan of yours it grows late and all holy people should be abed  i have none i defy you he answered furiously  very well friendvery well then i will say good night or rather farewell since i am not likely to meet you again in this world where are you going he asked anxiously  oh to the palace to meet the marquis of morella and a friend of his a relation indeed look you here i have had an offer of pardon for my part in that marriage if i can prove that a certain base priest knew that he was perpetrating a fraud well i can prove ityou may remember that you wrote me a noteand if i do what happens to such a priest who chances to have incurred the hatred of a grandee of spain and of his noble relation  i am an officer of the holy inquisition no one dare touch me he gasped  oh i think that there are some who would take the risk for instancethe king  fray henriques sank back in his chair now he understood whom inez meant by the noble relative of morella understood also that he had been trapped on sunday morning he began in a hollow whisper the procession will be formed and wind through the streets of the city to the theatre where the sermon will be preached before those who are relaxed proceed to the quemadero about eight oclock it turns on to the quay for a little way only and here will be but few spectators since the view of the pageant is bad nor is the road guarded there now if a dozen determined men were waiting disguised as peasants with a boat at hand perhaps they might and he paused  then peter who had been watching and listening to all this play spoke for the first time asking  in such an event reverend sir how would those determined men know which was the victim that they sought  the heretic john castell he answered will be seated on an ass clad in a zamarra of sheepskin painted with fiends and a likeness of his own head burningvery well done for i who can draw had a hand in it also he alone will have a rope round his neck by which he may be known  why will he be seated on an ass asked peter savagely because you have tortured him so that he cannot walk  not sonot so said the dominican shrinking from those fierce eyes he has never been questioned at all not a single turn of the mancuerda i swear to you sir knight what was the use since he openly avows himself an accursed jew  be more gentle in your talk friend broke in inez with her familiar tap upon the shoulder there are those here who do not think so ill of jews as you do in your holy house but who understand how to apply the mancuerda and can make a very serviceable rack out of a plank and a pulley or two such as lie in the next room cultivate courtesy most learned priest lest before you leave this place you should add a cubit to your stature  go on growled peter  moreover added fray henriques shakily orders came that it was not to be done the inquisitors thought otherwise as they believed doubtless in errorthat he might have accomplices whose names he would give up but the orders said that as he had lived so long in england and only recently travelled to spain he could have none therefore he is soundsound as a bell never before i am told has an impenitent jew gone to the stake in such good case however worthy and worshipful he might be  so much the better for you if you do not lie answered peter continue  there is nothing more to say except that i shall be walking near to him with the two guards and of course if he were snatched away from us and there were no boats handy in which to pursue we could not help it could we indeed we priests who are men of peace might even fly at the sight of cruel violence  i should advise you to fly fast and far said peter but inez what hold have you on this friend of yours he will trick everybody  a thousand doubloonsa thousand doubloons muttered old israel like a sleepy parrot  he may think to screw more than that out of the carcases of some of us old man come inez you are quick at this game how can we best hold him to his word  dead i think broke in bernaldez who knew his danger as the partner and relative of castell and the nominal owner of the ship margaret in which it was purposed that he should escape we know all that he can tell and if we let him go he will betray us soon or late kill him out of the way i say and burn his body in the oven  now henriques fell upon his knees and with groans and tears began to implore mercy  why do you complain so asked inez watching him with reflective eyes the end would be much gentler than that which you righteous folk mete out to many more honest men yes and women too for my part i think that the señor bernaldez gives good counsel better that you should die who are but one than all of us and others for you will understand that we cannot trust you has any one got a rope  now henriques grovelled on the ground before her kissing the hem of her robe and praying her in the name of all the saints to show pity on one who had been betrayed into this danger by love of her  of money you mean toad she answered kicking him with her slippered foot i had to listen to your talk of love while we journeyed together and before but here i need not and if you speak of it again you shall go living into that bakers oven oh you have forgotten it but i have a long score to settle with you you were a familiar of the holy office here at sevillewere you notbefore morella promoted you to motril for your zeal and made you one of his chaplains well i had a sister and she knelt down and whispered a name into his ear  he uttered a soundit was more of a scream than a gasp  i had nothing to do with her death he protested she was brought within the walls of the holy house by some one who had a grudge against her and bore false witness  yes i know it was you who had the grudge you snakesouled rogue and it was you who gave the false witness it was you also who but the other day volunteered the corroborative evidence that was necessary against castell saying that he had passed the rood at your house in motril without doing it reverence and other things it was you too who urged your superiors to put him to the question because you said he was rich and had rich friends and much money could be wrung out of him and them whereof you were to get your share oh yes my information is good is it not even what passes in the dungeons of the holy house comes to the ears of the woman inez well do you still think that bakers oven too hot for you  by this time henriques was speechless with terror there he knelt upon the floor glaring at this softvoiced remorseless woman who had made a tool and a fool of him who had beguiled him there that night and who hated him so bitterly and with so just a cause peter was speaking now  it would be better not to stain our hands with the creatures blood he said caged rats give little sport and he might be tracked for my part i would leave his judgment to god have you no other way inez  she thought a while then prodded the fray henriques with her foot saying  get up sainted secretary to the holy office and do a little writing which will be easy to you see here are pens and paper now ill dictate  most adorable inez  your dear message has reached me safely here in this accursed holy house where we lighten heretics of their sins to the benefit of their souls and of their goods to the benefit of our own bodies  i cannot write it groaned henriques it is rank heresy  no only the truth answered inez  heresy and the truthwell they are often the same thing they would burn me for it  that is just what many heretics have urged they have died gloriously for what they hold to be the truth why should not you listen she went on more sternly will you take your chance of burning on the quemadero which you will not do unless you betray us or will you certainly burn more privately but better in a bakers oven and within half an hour ah i thought you would not hesitate continue your letter most learned scribe are those words down yes now add these  i note all you tell me about the trial at the alcazar before their majesties i believe that the englishwoman will win her case that was a very pretty trick that i played on the most noble marquis at granada nothing neater was ever done even in this place well i owed him a long score and i have paid him off in full i should like to have seen his exalted countenance when he surveyed the features of his bride the waitingwoman and knew that the mistress was safe away with another man the nephew of the king who would like himself to be king some day married to an english waitingwoman good very good dear inez  now as regards the jew john castell i think that the matter may possibly be managed provided that the money is all right for as you know i do not work for nothing thus and inez dictated with admirable lucidity those suggestions as to the rescue of castell with which the reader is already acquainted ending the letter as follows  these inquisitors here are cruel beasts though fonder of money than of blood for all their talk about zeal for the faith is so much wind behind the mountains they care as much for the faith as the mountain cares for the wind or let us say as i do they wanted to torture the poor devil thinking that he would rain maravedis but i gave a hint in the right quarter and their fun was stopped carissima i must stop also it is my hour for duty but i hope to meet you as arranged and we will have a merry evening love to the newly married marquis if you meet him and to yourself you know how much  your  henriques  postscriptumthis position will scarcely be as remunerative as i hoped so i am glad to be able to earn a little outside enough to buy you a present that will make your pretty eyes shine  there said inez mildly i think that covers everything and would burn you three or four times over let me read it to see that it is plainly written and properly signed for in such matters a good deal turns on handwriting yes that will do now you understand dont you if anything goes wrong about the matter we have been talking ofthat is if the worthy john castell is not rescued or a smell of our little plot should get into the windthis letter goes at once to the right quarter and a certain secretary will wish that he had never been born man she added in a hissing whisper you shall die by inches as my sister did  a thousand doubloons if the thing succeeds and you live to claim them croaked old israel i do not go back upon my word death and shame and torture or a thousand doubloons now he knows our terms blindfold him again señor bernaldez and away with him for he poisons the air but first you inez be gone and lodge that letter where you know                                       that same night two cloaked figures peter and bernaldez were rowed in a little boat out to where the margaret lay in the river and making her fast slipped up the ships side into the cabin here the stout english captain smith was waiting for them and so glad was the honest fellow to see peter that he cast his arms about him and hugged him for they had not met since that desperate adventure of the boarding of the san antonio  is your ship fit for sea captain asked peter  she will never be fitter he answered when shall i get sailing orders  when the owner comes aboard answered peter  then we shall stop here until we rot they have trapped him in their inquisition what is in your mind peter bromewhat is in your mind is there a chance  aye captain i think so if you have a dozen fellows of the right english stuff between decks  we have got that number and one or two more but whats the plan  peter told him  not so bad said smith slapping his heavy hand upon his knee but riskyvery risky that inez must be a good girl i should like to marry her notwithstanding her bygones  peter laughed thinking what an odd couple they would make hear the rest then talk he said see now on saturday next mistress margaret and i are to be married in the cathedral then towards sunset the marquis of morella and i run our course in the great bullring yonder and you and half a dozen of your men will be present now i may conquer or i may fail  nevernever said the captain i wouldnt give a pair of old boots for that fine spaniards chance when you get at him why you will crimp him like a codfish  god knows answered peter if i win my wife and i make our adieux to their majesties and ride away to the quay where the boat will be waiting and you will row us on board the margaret if i fail you will take up my body and accompanied by my widow bring it in the same fashion on board the margaret for i shall give it out that in this case i wish to be embalmed in wine and taken back to england for burial in either event you will drop your ship a little way down the river round the bend so that folk may think that you have sailed in the darkness you must work her back with the tide and lay her behind those old hulks and if any ask you why say that three of your men have not yet come aboard and that you have dropped back for them and whatever else you like then in case i should not be alive to guide you you and ten or twelve of the best sailors will land at the spot that this gentleman will show you tomorrow wearing spanish cloaks so as not to attract attention but being well armed underneath them like idlers from some ship who had come ashore to see the show i have told you how you may know master castell when you see him make a rush for him cut down any that try to stop you tumble him into the boat and row for your lives to the ship which will slip her moorings and get up her canvas as soon as she sees you coming and begin to drop down the river with the tide and wind if there is one that is the plot but god alone knows the end of it which depends upon him and the sailors will you play this game for the love of a good man and the rest of us if you succeed you shall be rich for life all of you  aye answered the captain and theres my hand on it so sure as my name is smith we will hook him out of that hell if men can do it and not for the money either why peter we have sat here idle so long waiting for you and our lady that we shall be glad of the fun at any rate there will be some dead spaniards before they have done with us and if we are worsted ill leave the mate and enough hands upon the ship to bring her safe to tilbury but we wont bewe wont be by this day week we will all be rolling homewards across the bay with never a spaniard within three hundred miles you and your lady and master castell too i know it i tell you lad i know it  how do you know it asked peter curiously  because i dreamed it last night i saw you and mistress margaret sitting sweet as sugar with your arms around each others middles while i talked to the master and the sun went down with the wind blowing stiff from sousouwest and a gale threatening i tell you that i dreamed iti who am not given to dreams    chapter xxiv  the falcon stoops  it was the marriage day of margaret and peter clad in white armour that had been sent to him as a present from the queen a sign and a token of her good wishes for his success in his combat with morella wearing the insignia of a knight of st james hanging by a ribbon from his neck his shield emblazoned with his coat of the stooping falcon which appeared also upon the white cloak that hung from his shoulders behind him a squire of high degree who carried his plumed casque and lance and accompanied by an escort of the royal guards peter rode from his quarters in the prison to the palace gates and waited there as he had been bidden presently they opened and through them seated on a palfrey appeared margaret wonderfully attired in white and silver but with her veil lifted so that her face could be seen she was companioned by a troop of maidens mounted all of them on white horses and at her side almost outshining her in glory of apparel and attended by all her household rode betty marchioness of morellaat any rate for that present time  although she could never be less than beautiful it was a worn and pale margaret who bowed her greetings to the bridegroom without those palace gates what wonder since she knew that within a few hours his life must be set upon the hazard of a desperate fray what wonder since she knew that tomorrow her father was doomed to be burnt living upon the quemadero  they met they greeted then with silver trumpets blowing before them the glittering procession wound its way through the narrow streets of seville but few words passed between them whose hearts were too full for words who had said all they had to say and now abided the issue of events betty however whom many of the populace took for the bride because her air was so much the happier of the two would not be silent indeed she chid margaret for her lack of gaiety upon such an occasion  oh bettybetty answered margaret how can i be gay upon whose heart lies the burden of tomorrow  a pest upon the burden of tomorrow exclaimed betty the burden of today is enough for me and that is not so bad to bear never shall we have another such ride as this with all the world staring at us and every woman in seville envying us and our good looks and the favour of the queen  i think it is you they stare at and envy said margaret glancing at the splendid woman at her side whose beauty she knew well overshadowed her own rarer loveliness at any rate in a street pageant as in the sunshine the rose overshadows the lily  well answered betty if so it is because i put the better face on things and smile even if my heart bleeds at least your lot is more hopeful than mine if your husband has to fight to the death presently so has mine and between ourselves i favour peters chances he is a very stubborn fighter peter and wonderfully strongtoo stubborn and strong for any spaniard  well that is as it should be said margaret smiling faintly seeing that peter is your champion and if he loses you are stamped as a servinggirl and a woman of no character  a servinggirl i was or something not far different replied betty in a reflective voice and my character is a matter between me and heaven though after all it might scrape through where others fail to pass so these things do not trouble me over much what troubles me is that if my champion wins he kills my husband  you dont want him to be killed then asked margaret glancing at her  no i think not answered betty with a little shake in her voice and turning her head aside for a moment i know he is a scoundrel but you see i always liked this scoundrel just as you always hated him so i cannot help wishing that he was going to meet some one who hits a little less hard than peter also if he dies without doubt his heirs will raise suits against me  at any rate your father is not going to be burnt tomorrow said margaret to change the subject which to tell the truth was an awkward one  no cousin if my father had his deserts according to all accounts although the lineage that i gave of him is true enough doubtless he was burnt long ago and still goes on burningin purgatory i meanthough god knows i would never bring a faggot to his fire but master castell will not be burnt so why fret about it  what makes you say that asked margaret who had not confided the details of a certain plot to betty  i dont know but i am sure that peter will get him out somehow he is a very good stick to lean on peter although he seems so hard and stupid and silent which after all is in the nature of sticks but look there is the cathedralis it not a fine placeand a great crowd of people waiting round the gate now smile cousin bow and smile as i do  they rode up to the great doors where peter springing to the ground assisted his bride from her palfrey then the procession formed and they entered the wonderful place preceded by vergers with staves and by acolytes margaret had never visited it before and never saw it again but all her life the memory of it remained clear and vivid in her mind the cold chill of the air within the semidarkness after the glare of the sunshine the seven great naves or aisles stretching endlessly to right and left the dim and towering roof the pillars that sprang to it everywhere like huge forest trees aspiring to the skies the solemn shadows pierced by lines of light from the highcut windows the golden glory of the altars the sounds of chanting the sepulchres of the deada sense of all these things rushed in upon her overpowering her and stamping the picture of them for ever on her memory  slowly they passed onward to the choir and round it to the steps of the great altar of the chief chapel here between the choir and the chapel was gathered the congregationno small oneand here side by side to the right and without the rails in chairs of state sat their majesties of spain who had chosen to grace this ceremony with their presence more as the bride came the queen isabella as a special act of grace rose from her seat and bending forward kissed her on the cheek while the choir sang and the noble music rolled it was a splendid spectacle this marriage of hers celebrated in perhaps the most glorious fane in europe but even as margaret noted it and watched the bishops and priests decked with glittering embroideries summoned there to do her honour as they moved to and fro in the mysterious ceremonial of the mass she bethought her of other rites equally glorious that would take place on the morrow in the greatest square of seville where these same dignitaries would condemn fellow human beingsperhaps among them her own fatherto be married to the cruel flame  side by side they knelt before the wondrous altar while the incenseclouds from the censers floated up one by one till they were lost in the gloom above as the smoke of tomorrows sacrifice would lose itself in the heavens she and her husband won at last won after so many perils perhaps to be lost again for ever before night fell upon the world the priests chanted the gorgeous bishop bowed over them and muttered the marriage service of their faith the ring was set upon her hand the troths were plighted the benediction spoken and they were man and wife till death should them part that death which stood so near to them in this hour of life fulfilled then they two who already that morning had made confession of their sins kneeling alone before the altar ate of the holy bread sealing a mystery with a mystery  all was done and over and rising they turned and stayed a moment hand in hand while the sweetvoiced choir sang some wondrous chant margarets eyes wandered over the congregation till presently they lighted upon the dark face of morella who stood apart a little way surrounded by his squires and gentlemen and watched her more he came to her and bowing low whispered to her  we are players in a strange game my lady margaret and what will be its end i wonder shall i be dead tonight or you a widow aye and where was its beginning not here i think and where oh where shall this seed we sow bear fruit well think as kindly of me as you can since i loved you who love me not  and again bowing first to her then to peter he passed on taking no note of betty who stood near considering him with her large eyes as though she also wondered what would be the end of all this play  surrounded by their courtiers the king and queen left the cathedral and after them came the bridegroom and the bride they mounted their horses and in the glory of the southern sunlight rode through the cheering crowd back to the palace and to the marriage feast where their table was set but just below that of their majesties it was long and magnificent but little could they eat and save to pledge each other in the ceremonial cup no wine passed their lips at length some trumpets blew and their majesties rose the king saying in his thin clear voice that he would not bid his guests farewell since very shortly they would all meet again in another place where the gallant bridegroom a gentleman of england would champion the cause of his relative and countrywoman against one of the first grandees of spain whom she alleged had done her wrong that fray alas would be no pleasure joust but to the death for the feud between these knights was deep and bitter and such were the conditions of their combat he could not wish success to the one or to the other but of this he was sure that in all seville there was no heart that would not give equal honour to the conqueror and the conquered sure also that both would bear themselves as became brave knights of spain and england  then the trumpets blew again and the squires and gentlemen who were chosen to attend him came bowing to peter and saying that it was time for him to arm bride and bridegroom rose and while all the spectators fell back out of hearing but watching them with curious eyes spoke some few words together  we part said peter and i know not what to say  say nothing husband she answered him lest your words should weaken me go now and bear you bravely as you will for your own honour and that of england and for mine dead or living you are my darling and dead or living we shall meet once more and be at rest for aye my prayers be with you sir peter my prayers and my eternal love and may they bring strength to your arm and comfort to your heart  then she who would not embrace him before all those folk curtseyed till her knee almost touched the ground while low he bent before her a strange and stately parting or so thought that company and taking the hand of betty margaret left him                                       two hours had gone by the plaza de toros for the great square where tournaments were wont to be held was in the hands of those who prepared it for the autodafé of the morrow was crowded as it had seldom been before this place was a huge amphitheatreperchance the romans built itwhere all sorts of games were celebrated among them the baiting of bulls as it was practised in those days and other semisavage sports twelve thousand people could sit upon the benches that rose tier upon tier around the vast theatre and scarce a seat was empty the arena itself that was long enough for horses starting at either end of it to come to their full speed was strewn with white sand as it may have been in the days when gladiators fought there over the main entrance and opposite to the centre of the ring were placed the king and queen with their lords and ladies and between them but a little behind her face hid by her bridal veil sat margaret upright and silent as a statue exactly in front of them on the further side of the ring in a pavilion and attended by her household appeared betty glittering with gold and jewels since she was the lady in whose cause at least in name this combat was to be fought à loutrance quite unmoved she sat and her presence seemed to draw every eye in that vast assembly which talked of her while it waited with a sound like the sound of the sea as it murmurs on a beach at night  now the trumpets blew and silence fell and then preceded by heralds in golden tabards carlos marquis of morella followed by his squires rode into the ring through the great entrance he bestrode a splendid black horse and was arrayed in coalblack armour while from his casque rose black ostrich plumes on his shield however painted in scarlet appeared the eagle crowned with the coronet of his rank and beneath the proud mottowhat i seize i tear a splendid figure he pressed his horse into the centre of the arena then causing it to wheel round pawing the air with its forelegs saluted their majesties by raising his long steeltipped lance while the multitude greeted him with a shout this done he and his company rode away to their station at the north end of the ring  again the trumpets sounded and a herald appeared while after him mounted on a white horse and clad in his white armour that glistened in the sun with white plumes rising from his casque and on his shield the stooping falcon blazoned in gold with the motto of for love and honour beneath it appeared the tall grim shape of sir peter brome he too rode out into the centre of the arena and turning his horse quite soberly as though it were on a road lifted his lance in salute now there was no cheering for this knight was a foreigner yet soldiers who were there said to each other that he looked like one who would not easily be overthrown  a third time the trumpets sounded and the two champions advancing from their respective stations drew rein side by side in front of their majesties where the conditions of the combat were read aloud to them by the chief herald they were short that the fray should be to the death unless the king and queen willed otherwise and the victor consented that it should be on horse or on foot with lance or sword or dagger but that no broken weapon might be replaced and no horse or armour changed that the victor should be escorted from the place of combat with all honour and allowed to depart whither he would in the kingdom or out of it and no suit or bloodfeud raised against him and that the body of the fallen be handed over to his friends for burial also with all honour that the issue of this fray should in no way affect any cause pleaded in courts ecclesiastical or civil by the lady who asserted herself to be the marchioness of morella or by the most noble marquis of morella whom she claimed as her husband  these conditions having been read the champions were asked if they assented to them whereon each of them answered aye in a clear voice then the herald speaking on behalf of sir peter brome by creation a knight of st iago and a don of spain solemnly challenged the noble marquis of morella to single combat to the death in that he the said marquis had aspersed the name of his relative the english lady elizabeth dene who claimed to be his wife duly united to him in holy wedlock and for sundry other causes and injuries worked towards him the said sir peter brome and his wife dame margaret brome and in token thereof threw down a gauntlet which gauntlet the marquis of morella lifted upon the point of his lance and cast over his shoulder thus accepting the challenge  now the combatants dropped their visors which heretofore had been raised and their squires coming forward examined the fastenings of their armour their weapons and the girths and bridles of their horses these being pronounced sound and good pursuivants took the steeds by the bridles and led them to the far ends of the lists at a signal from the king a single clarion blew whereon the pursuivants loosed their hold of the bridles and sprang back another clarion blew and the knights gathered up their reins settled their shields and set their lances in rest bending forward over their horses necks  an intense silence fell upon all the watching multitude as that of night upon the sea and in the midst of it the third clarion blewto margaret it sounded like the trump of doom from twelve thousand throats one great sigh went up like the sigh of wind upon the sea and ere it died away from either end of the arena like arrows from the bow like levens from a cloud the champions started forth their stallions gathering speed at every stride look they met fair on each shield struck a lance and backward reeled their holders the keen points glanced aside or up and the knights recovering themselves rushed past each other shaken but unhurt at the ends of the lists the squires caught the horses by the bridles and turned them the first course was run  again the clarions blew and again they started forward and presently again they met in mid career as before the lances struck upon the shields but so fearful was the impact that peters shivered while that of morella sliding from the topmost rim of his foes buckler got hold in his visor bars back went peter beneath the blow back and still back till almost he lay upon his horses crupper then when it seemed that he must fall the lacings of his helm burst it was torn from his head and morella passed on bearing it transfixed upon his spear point  the falcon falls screamed the spectators he is unhorsed  but peter was not unhorsed freed from that awful pressure he let drop the shattered shaft and grasping at his saddle strap dragged himself back into the selle morella tried to stay his charger that he might come about and fall upon the englishman before he could recover himself but the brute was heady and would not be turned till he saw the wall of faces in front of him now they were round both of them but peter had no spear and no helm while the lance of morella was cumbered with his adversarys casque that he strove to shake free from it but in vain  draw your sword shouted voices to peterthe english voices of smith and his sailorsand he put his hand down to do so then bethought him of some other counsel for he let it lie within its scabbard and spurring the white horse came at morella like a storm  the falcon will be spiked they screamed the eagle winsthe eagle wins and indeed it seemed that it must be so straight at peters undefended face drove morellas lance but lo as it came he let fall his reins and with his shield he struck at the white plumes about its point the plumes torn from his own head he had judged well for up flew those plumes a little a very little yet far enough to give him space crouching on his saddlebow to pass beneath the deadly spear then as they swept past each other out shot that long right arm of his and gripping morella like a hook of steel tore him from his saddle so that the black horse rushed forward riderless and the white sped on bearing a double burden  grasping desperately morella threw his arms about his neck and intertwined black armour mixed with white they swayed to and fro while the frightened horse beneath rushed this way and that till swerving suddenly together they fell upon the sand and for a moment lay there stunned  who conquers gasped the crowd while others answered both are sped and leaning forward in her chair margaret tore off her veil and watched with a face like the face of death  see as they had fallen together so together they stirred and roserose unharmed now they sprang back out flashed the long swords and while the squires caught the horses and running in seized the broken spears they faced each other having no helm peter held his buckler above his head to shelter it and ever calm awaited the onslaught  at him came morella and with a light grating sound his sword fell upon the steel before he could recover himself peter struck back but morella bent his knees and the stroke only shore the black plumes from his casque quick as light he drove at peters face with his point but the englishman leapt to one side and the thrust went past him again morella came at him and struck so mighty a blow that although peter caught it on his buckler it sliced through the edge of it and fell upon his unprotected neck and shoulder wounding him for now red blood showed on the white armour and peter reeled back beneath the stroke  the eagle winsthe eagle wins spain and the eagle shouted ten thousand throats in the momentary silence that followed a single voice a clear womans voice which even then margaret knew for that of inez cried from among the crowd  nay the falcon stoops  before the sound of her words died away maddened it would seem by the pain of his wound or the fear of defeat peter shouted out his warcry of a brome a brome and gathering himself together sprang straight at morella as springs a starving wolf the blue steel flickered in the sunlight then down it fell and lo half the spaniards helm lay on the sand while it was morellas turn to reel backwardand more as he did so he let fall his shield  a strokea good stroke roared the crowd the falconthe falcon  peter saw that fallen shield and whether for chivalrys sake as thought the cheering multitude or to free his left arm he cast away his own and grasping the sword with both hands rushed on the spaniard from that moment helmless though he was the issue lay in doubt no longer betty had spoken of peter as a stubborn swordsman and a hard hitter and both of these he now showed himself to be as fresh to all appearance as when he ran the first course he rained blow after blow upon the hapless spaniard till the sound of his sword smiting on the good toledo steel was like the sound of a hammer falling continually on the smiths red iron they were fearful blows yet still the tough steel held and still morella doing what he might staggered back beneath them till at length he came in front of the tribune in which sat their majesties and margaret out of the corner of his eye peter saw the place and determined in his stout heart that then and there he would end the thing parrying a cut which the desperate spaniard made at his head he thrust at him so heavily that his blade bent like a bow and although he could not pierce the black mail almost lifted morella from his feet then as he reeled backwards peter whirled his sword on high and shouting margaret struck downwards with all his strength it fell as lightning falls swift keen dazzling the eyes of all who watched morella raised his arm to break the blow in vain the weapon that he held was shattered the casque beneath was cloven and throwing his arms wide he fell heavily to the ground and lay there moving feebly  for an instant there was silence and in it a shrill womans voice that cried  the falcon has stooped the english hawk has stooped  then there arose a tumult of shouting he is dead nay he stirs kill him spare him he fought well  peter leaned upon his sword looking at the fallen foe then he glanced upwards at their majesties but these sat silent making no sign only he saw margaret try to rise from her seat and speak to be pulled back to it again by the hands of women a deep hush fell upon the watching thousands who waited for the end peter looked at morella alas he still lived his sword and the stout helmet had broken the weight of that stroke mighty though it had been the man was but wounded in three places and stunned what must i do asked peter in a hollow voice to the royal pair above him  now the king who seemed moved was about to speak but the queen bent forward and whispered something to him and he remained silent they both were silent all the intent multitude was silent knowing what this dreadful silence meant peter cast down his sword and drew his dagger wherewith to cut the lashings of morellas gorget and give the coup de grâce  just then it was that for the first time he heard a sound far away upon the other side of the arena and looking thither saw the strangest sight that ever his eyes beheld over the railing of the pavilion opposite to him a woman climbed nimbly as a cat and from it like a cat dropped to the ground full ten feet below then gathering up her dress about her knees ran swiftly towards him it was betty betty without a doubt betty in her gorgeous garb with pearls and braided hair flying loose behind her he stared amazed all stared amazed and in half a minute she was on them and standing over the fallen morella gasped out  let him be i bid you let him be  peter knew not what to do or say so advanced to speak with her whereon with a swoop like that of a swallow she pounced upon his sword that lay in the sand and leaping back to morella shook it on high shouting  you will have to fight me first peter  indeed she did more striking at him so shrewdly with his own sword that he was forced to spring sideways to avoid the stroke now a great roar of laughter went up to heaven yes even peter laughed for no such thing as this had ever before been seen in spain it died away and again betty who had no low voice shouted in her villainous spanish  he shall kill me before he kills my husband give me my husband  take him for my part answered peter whereon letting fall the sword betty filled with the strength of despair lifted the senseless spaniard in her strong white arms as though he were a child and his bleeding head lying on her shoulder strove to carry him away but could not  then while all that audience cheered frantically peter with a gesture of despair threw down his dagger and once more appealed to their majesties the king rose and held up his hand at the same time motioning to morellas squires to take him from the woman which seeing their cognizance betty allowed them to do  marchioness of morella said the king for the first time giving her that title your honour is cleared your champion has conquered and this fierce fray was to the death what have you to say  nothing answered betty except that i love the man though he has treated me and others ill and as i knew he would if he crossed swords with peter has got his deserts for his deeds i say i love him and if peter wishes to kill him he must kill me first  sir peter brome said the king the judgment lies in your hand we give you the mans life to grant or to take  peter thought a while then answered  i grant him his life if he will acknowledge this lady to be his true and lawful wife and live with her as such now and for ever staying all suits against her  how can he do that you fool asked betty when you have knocked all his senses out of him with that great sword of yours  perhaps suggested peter humbly some one will do it for him  yes said isabella speaking for the first time i will on behalf of the marquis of morella i promise these things don peter brome before all these people here gathered i add this that if he should live and it pleases him to break this promise made on his behalf to save him from death then let his name be shamed yes let it become a byword and a scorn proclaim it heralds  so the heralds blew their trumpets and one of them called out the queens decree whereat the spectators cheered again shouting that it was good and they bore witness to that promise  then morella still senseless was borne away by his squires betty in her bloodstained robe marching at his side and his horse having been brought to him again peter wounded though he was mounted and galloped round the arena amidst plaudits such as that place had never heard till lifting his sword in salutation suddenly he and his gentlemen vanished by the gate through which he had appeared  thus strangely enough ended that combat which thereafter was always known as the fray of the eagle and the english hawk    chapter xxv  how the margaret won out to sea  it was night peter faint with loss of blood and stiff with bruises had bade his farewell to their majesties of spain who spoke many soft words to him calling him the flower of knighthood and offering him high place and rank if he would abide in their service but he thanked them and said no for in spain he had suffered too much to dwell there so they kissed his bride the fair margaret who clung to her wounded husband like ivy to an oak and would not be separated from him even for a moment that husband whom living she had scarcely hoped to clasp again yes they kissed her and the queen threw about her a chain from her own neck as a parting gift and wished her joy of so gallant a lord  alas your majesty said margaret her dark eyes filling with tears how can i be joyous who must think of tomorrow  thereon isabella set her face and answered  dona margaret brome be thankful for what today has brought you and forget tomorrow and that which it must justly take away go now and god be with you both  so they went the little knot of english sailormen who wrapped in spanish cloaks had sat together in the amphitheatre and groaned when the eagle struck and cheered when the falcon swooped leading or rather carrying peter under cover of the falling night to a boat not far from this place of bulls in this they embarked unobserved for the multitude and even peters own squires believed that he had returned with his wife to the palace as he had given out that he would do so they were rowed to the margaret which straightway made as though she were about to sail and indeed dropped a little way down stream here she anchored again just round a bend of the river and lay there for the night  it was a heavy night and in it there was no place for love or lovers tenderness how could there be between these two who for so long had been tormented by doubts and fears and on this day had endured such extremity of terror and such agony of joy peters wound also was deep and wide though his shield had broken the weight of morellas sword and its edge had caught upon his shoulderpiece so that by good chance it had not reached down to the arteries or shorn into the bone yet he had lost much blood and smith the captain who was a better surgeon than might have been guessed from his thick hands found it needful to wash out the cut with spirit that gave much pain and to stitch it up with silk also peter had great bruises on his arms and thighs and his back was hurt by that fall from the white charger with morella in his arms  so it came about that most of that night he lay outworn halfsleeping and halfwaking and when at sunrise he struggled from his berth it was but to kneel by the side of margaret and join her in her prayers that her father might be rescued from the hands of these cruel priests of spain  now during the night smith had brought his ship back with the tide and laid her under the shelter of those hulks whereof peter had spoken having first painted out her name of margaret and in its place set that of the santa maria a vessel of about the same build and tonnage which as they had heard was expected in port for this reason or because there were at that time many ships in the river it happened that none in authority noted her return or if they did neglected to report the matter as one of no moment therefore so far all went well  according to the tale of henriques confirmed by what they had learned otherwise the great procession of the act of faith would turn on to the quay at about eight oclock and pass along it for a hundred yards or so only before it wound away down a street leading to the plaza where the theatre was prepared the sermon would be preached the mass celebrated and the relaxed placed in cages to be carried to the quemadero  at six in the morning smith mustered those twelve men whom he had chosen to help him in the enterprise and peter with margaret at his side addressed them in the cabin telling them all the plan and praying them for the sake of their master and of the lady margaret his daughter to do what men might to save one whom they loved and honoured from so horrible a death  they swore that they would every one of them for their english blood was up nor did they so much as speak of the great rewards that had been promised to those who lived through this adventure and to the families of those who fell then they breakfasted girded their swords and knives about them and put on their spanish cloaks though to speak truth these lads of essex and of london made but poor spaniards now at length the boat was ready and peter although he could scarcely stand desired to be carried into it that he might accompany them but the captain smith to whom perhaps margaret had been speaking set down his flat foot on the deck and said that he who commanded there would suffer no such thing a wounded man he declared would but cumber them who had little room to spare in that small boat and could be of no service either on land or water moreover master peters face was known to thousands who had watched it yesterday and would certainly be recognised whereas none would take note at such a time of a dozen common sailors landed from some ship to see the show lastly he would do best to stop on board the vessel where if anything went wrong they must be shorthanded enough who if they could ought to get her away to sea and across it with all speed  still peter would have gone till margaret throwing her arms about him asked him if he thought that she would be the better if she lost both her father and her husband as if things miscarried well might happen then being in pain and very weak he yielded and smith having given his last directions to the mate and shaken peter and margaret by the hand asking their prayers for all of them descended with his twelve men into the boat and dropping down under shelter of the hulks rowed to the shore as though they came from some other vessel now the quay was not more than a bowshot from them and from a certain spot upon the margaret there was a good view of it between the stern of one hulk and the bow of another here then peter and margaret sat themselves down behind the bulwark and watched with fears such as cannot be told while a sharpeyed seaman climbed to the crowsnest on the mast whence he could see over much of the city and even the old moorish castle that was then the holy house of the inquisition presently this man reported that the procession had started for he saw its banners and the people crowding to the windows and to the rooftops also the cathedral bell began to toll slowly then came a long long wait during which their little knot of sailors wearing the spanish cloaks appeared upon the quay and mingled with the few folk that were gathered there since the most of the people were collected by thousands on the great plaza or in the adjacent streets  at length just as the cathedral clock struck eight the triumphant march as it was called began to appear upon the quay first came a body of soldiers with lances then a crucifix borne by a priest and veiled in black crape then a number of other priests clad in snowwhite robes to symbolise their perfect purity next followed men carrying wood or leather images of some man or woman who by flight to a foreign land or into the realms of death had escaped the clutches of the inquisition after these marched other men in fours each four of them bearing a coffin that contained the body or bones of some dead heretic which in the absence of his living person like the effigies were to be committed to the flames as a token of what the inquisition would have done to him if it couldto enable it also to seize his property  then came many penitents their heads shaven their feet bare and clad some in darkcoloured cloaks some in yellow robes called the sanbenito which were adorned with a red cross these were followed by a melancholy band of relaxed heretics doomed to the fire or strangulation at the stake and clothed in zamarras of sheepskin painted all over with devils and the portraits of their own faces surrounded by flames these poor creatures wore also flameadorned caps called corozas shaped like bishops mitres and were gagged with blocks of wood lest they should contaminate the populace by some declaration of their heresy while in their hands they bore tapers which the monks who accompanied them relighted from time to time if they became extinguished  now the hearts of peter and margaret leaped within them for at the end of this hideous troop rode a man mounted on an ass clothed in a zamarra and coroza but with a noose about his neck so the fray henriques had told the truth for without doubt this was john castell like people in a dream they saw him advance in his garb of shame and after him gorgeously attired civil officers inquisitors and familiars of noble rank members of the council of inquisition behind whom was borne a flaunting banner called the holy standard of the faith  now castell was opposite to the little group of seamen and or so it seemed something went wrong with the harness of the ass on which he sat for it stopped and a man in the garb of a secretary stepped to it apparently to attend to a strap thus bringing all the procession behind to a halt while that in front proceeded off the quay and round the corner of a street whatever it might be that had happened it necessitated the dismounting of the heretic who was pulled roughly off the brutes back which as though in joy at this riddance of its burden lifted its head and brayed loudly  men from the thin line of crowd that edged the quay came forward as though to help and among them were several in capes such as were worn by the sailors of the margaret the officers and grandees behind shouted forwardforward whereon those attending to the ass hustled it and its rider a little nearer to the waters edge while the guards ran back to explain what had happened then suddenly a confusion arose of which it was impossible to distinguish the cause and next instant margaret and peter still gripping each other saw the man who had been seated on the ass being dragged rapidly down the steps of the quay at the foot of which lay the boat of the margaret  the mate at the helm saw also for he blew his whistle a sign at which the anchor was slippedthere was no time to lift itand men who were waiting on the yards loosed the lashings of certain sails so that almost immediately the ship began to move  now they were fighting on the quay the heretic was in the boat and most of the sailors but others held back the crowd of priests and armed familiars who strove to get at him one a priest with a sword in his hand slipped past them and tumbled into the boat also at last all were in save a single man who was attacked by three adversariesjohn smith the captain the oars were out but his mates waited for him he struck with his sword and some one fell then he turned to run two masked familiars sprang at him one landing on his back one clinging to his neck with a desperate effort he cast himself into the water dragging them with him one they saw no more for smith had stabbed him the other floated up near the boat which already was some yards from the quay and a sailor battered him on the head with an oar so that he sank  smith had vanished also and they thought he must be drowned the sailors thought it too for they began to give way when suddenly a great brown hand appeared and clasped the sternsheets while a bullvoice roared  row on lads im right enough  row they did indeed till the ashen oars bent like bows only two of them seized the officer who had sprung into the boat and flung him screaming into the river where he struggled a while for he could not swim gripping at the air with his hands then disappeared the boat was in midstream now and shaping her course round the bow of the first hulk beyond which the prow of the margaret began to appear for the wind was fresh and she gathered way every moment  let down the ladder and make ready ropes shouted peter  it was done but not too soon for next instant the boat was bumping on their side the sailors in her caught the ropes and hung on while the captain smith halfdrowned clung to the sternsheets for the water washed over his head  save him first cried peter a man running down the ladder threw a noose to him which smith seized with one hand and by degrees worked beneath his arms then they tackled on to it and dragged him bodily from the river to the deck where he lay gasping and spitting out foam and water by now the ship was travelling swiftly so swiftly that margaret was in an agony of fear lest the boat should be towed under and sink  but these sailor men knew their trade by degrees they let the boat drop back till her bow was abreast of the ladder then they helped castell forward he gripped its rungs and eager hands gripped him up he staggered step by step till at length his hideous fiendpainted cap his white face whence the beard had been shaved and his open mouth in which still was fixed the wooden gag appeared above the bulwarks as the mate said afterwards like that of a devil escaped from hell they lifted him over and he sank fainting in his daughters arms then one by one the sailors came up after himnone were missing though two had been wounded and were covered with blood no none were missinggod had brought them every one safe back to the deck of the margaret  smith the captain spat up the last of his river water and called for a cup of wine which he drank while peter and margaret drew the accursed gag from her fathers mouth and poured spirit down his throat shaking the water from him like a great dog but saying never a word smith rolled to the helm and took it from the mate for the navigation of the river was difficult and none knew it so well as he now they were abreast the famous golden tower and a big gun was fired at them but the shot went wide look said margaret pointing to horsemen galloping southwards along the rivers bank  yes said peter they go to warn the ports god send that the wind holds for we must fight our way to sea  the wind did hold indeed it blew ever more strongly from the north but oh that was a long evil day hour after hour they sped forward down the widening river now past villages where knots of people waved weapons at them as they went now by desolate marshes plains and banks clothed with pine  when they reached bonanza the sun was low and when they were off san lucar it had begun to sink out into the wide river mouth where the white waters tumbled on the narrow bar rowed two great galleys to cut them off very swift galleys which it seemed impossible to escape  margaret and castell were sent below the crew went to quarters and peter crept stiffly aft to where the sturdy smith stood at the helm which he would suffer no other man to touch smith looked at the sky he looked at the shore and the safe open sea beyond then he bade them hoist more sail all that she could carry and looked grimly at the two galleys lurking like deerhounds in a pass that hung on their oars in the strait channel with the tumbling breakers on either side through which no ship could sail what will you do asked peter master peter he answered between his teeth when you fought the spaniard yesterday i did not ask you what you were going to do hold your tongue and leave me to my own trade  the margaret was a swift ship but never yet had she moved so swiftly behind her shrilled the gale for now it was no less her stout masts bent like fishing poles her rigging creaked and groaned beneath the weight of the bellying canvas her port bulwarks slipped along almost level with the water so that peter must lie down on the deck for stand he could not and watch it running by within three feet of him  the galleys drew up right across her path half a mile away they lay bow by bow knowing well that no ship could pass the foaming shallows lay bow by bow waiting to board and cut down this little english crew when the margaret shortened sail as shorten sail she must smith yelled an order to the mate and presently red in the setting sun out burst the flag of england upon the mainmast top a sight at which the sailors cheered he shouted another order and up ran the last jib so that now from time to time the port bulwarks dipped beneath the sea and peter felt salt water stinging his sore back  thus did the margaret shorten sail and thus did she yield her to the great galleys of spain  the captains of the galleys hung on was this foreigner mad or ignorant of the river channel they wondered that he would sink with every soul there upon the bar they hung on waiting for that leopard flag and those bursting sails to come down but they never stirred only straight at them rushed the margaret like a bull she was not two furlongs away and she held dead upon her course till at last those galleys saw that she would not sink alone like a bull with shut eyes she held dead upon her furious course  confusion arose upon the spanish ships whistles were blown men shouted overseers ran down the planks flogging the slaves lifted oars shone red in the light of the dying sun as they beat the water wildly the prows began to back and separate five feet ten feet a dozen feet perhaps then straight into that tiny streak of open water like a stone from the hand of the slinger like an arrow from a bow rushed the windflung margaret  what happened go ask it of the fishers of san lucar and the pirates of bonanza where the tale has been told for generations the great oars snapped like reeds the slaves were thrown in crushed and mangled heaps the tall deck of the port galley was ripped out of her like rent paper by the stout yards of the stooping margaret the side of the starboard galley rolled up like a shaving before a plane and the margaret rushed through  smith the captain looked aft to where ere they sank the two great ships like wounded swans rolled and fluttered on the foaming bar then he put his helm about called the carpenter and asked what water she made  none sir he answered but she will want new tarring it was oak against eggshells and we had the speed  good said smith shallows on either side life or death and i thought i could make room send the mate to the helm ill have a sleep  then the sun vanished beneath the roaring open sea and escaped from all the power of spain the margaret turned her scarred and splintered bow for ushant and for england    envoi  ten years had gone by since captain smith took the good ship margaret across the bar of the guadalquiver in a very notable fashion it was late may in essex and all the woods were green and all the birds sang and all the meadows were bright with flowers down in the lovely vale of dedham there was a long low house with many gablesa charming old house of red brick and timbers already black with age it stood upon a little hill backed with woods and from it a long avenue of ancient oaks ran across the park to the road which led to colchester and london down that avenue on this may afternoon an aged whitehaired man with quick black eyes was walking and with him three childrenvery beautiful childrena boy of about nine and two little girls who clung to his hand and garments and pestered him with questions  where are we going grandfather asked one little girl  to see captain smith my dear he answered  i dont like captain smith said the other little girl he is so fat and says nothing  i do broke in the boy he gave me a fine knife to use when i am a sailor and mother does and father yes and grandad too because he saved him when the cruel spaniards wanted to put him in the fire dont you grandad  yes my dear answered the old man look there is a squirrel running over the grass see if you can catch it before it reaches that tree  off went the children at full pelt and the tree being a low one began to climb it after the squirrel meanwhile john castell for it was he turned through the park gate and walked to a little house by the roadside where a stout man sat upon a bench contemplating nothing in particular evidently he expected his visitor for he pointed to the place beside him and as castell sat down said  why didnt you come yesterday master  because of my rheumatism friend he answered i got it first in the vaults of that accursed holy house at seville and it grows on me year by year they were very damp and cold those vaults he added reflectively  many people found them hot enough grunted smith also there was generally a good fire at the end of them strange thing that we should never have heard any more of that business i suppose it was because our margaret was such a favourite with queen isabella who didnt want to raise questions with england or stir up dirty water  perhaps answered castell the water was dirty wasnt it  dirty as a thames mudbank at low tide clever woman isabella no one else would have thought of making a man ridiculous as she did by morella when she gave his life to betty and promised and vowed on his behalf that he would acknowledge her as his lady no fear of any trouble from him after that in the way of plots for the crown or things of that sort why he must have been the laughingstock of the whole landand a laughingstock never does anything you remember the spanish saying kings swords cut and priests fires burn but streetsongs kill quickest i should like to learn more of what has become of them all though wouldnt you master except bernaldez of course for hes been safe in paris these many years and doing well there they say  yes answered castell with a little smilethat is unless i had to go to spain to find out  just then the three children came running up bursting through the gate all together  mind my flowerbed you little rogues shouted captain smith shaking his stick at them whereat they got behind him and made faces  wheres the squirrel peter asked castell  we hunted it out of the tree grandad and right across the grass and got round it by the edge of the brook and then  then what did you catch it  no grandad for when we thought we had it sure it jumped into the water and swam away  other people in a fix have done that before said castell laughing and bethinking him of a certain river quay  it wasnt fair cried the boy indignantly squirrels shouldnt swim and if i can catch it i will put it in a cage  i think that squirrel will stop in the woods for the rest of its life peter  grandadgrandad called out the youngest child from the gate whither she had wandered being weary of the tale of the squirrel there are a lot of people coming down the road on horses such fine people come and see  this news excited the curiosity of the old gentlemen for not many fine people came to dedham at any rate both of them rose somewhat stiffly and walked to the gate to look yes the child was right for there sure enough about two hundred yards away advanced an imposing cavalcade in front of it mounted on a fine horse sat a still finer lady a very large and handsome lady dressed in black silks and wearing a black lace veil that hung from her head at her side was another lady much muffled up as though she found the climate cold and riding between them on a pony a gallant looking little boy after these came servants male and female six or eight of them and last of all a great wain laden with baggage drawn by four big flemish horses  now whom have we here ejaculated castell staring at them  captain smith stared too and sniffed at the wind as he had often done upon his deck on a foggy morning  i seem to smell spaniards he said which is a smell i dont like look at their rigging now master castell of whom does that barque with all her sails set remind you  castell shook his head doubtfully  i seem to remember went on smith a great girl decked out like a maypole running across white sand in that place of bulls at sevillebut i forgot you werent there were you  now a loud ringing voice was heard speaking in spanish and commanding some one to go to yonder house and inquire where was the gate to the old hall then castell knew at once  it is betty he said by the beard of abraham it is betty  i think so too but dont talk of abraham master he is a dangerous man abraham in these very christian lands say by the keys of st peter or by st pauls infirmities  child broke in castell turning to one of the little girls run up to the hall and tell your father and mother that betty has come and brought half spain with her quickly now and remember the name betty  the child departed wondering by the back way while castell and smith walked towards the strangers  can we assist you señora asked the former in spanish  marchioness of morella if you please she began in the same language then suddenly added in english why bless my eyes if it isnt my old master john castell with white wool instead of black  it came white after my shaving by a sainted barber in the holy house said castell but come off that tall horse of yours betty my deari beg your pardonmost noble and highly born marchioness of morella and give me a kiss  that i will twenty if you like she answered arriving in his arms so suddenly from on high that had it not been for the sturdy support of smith behind they would both of them have rolled upon the ground  whose are those children she asked when she had kissed castell and shaken smith by the hand but no need to ask they have got my cousin margarets eyes and peters long nose how are they she added anxiously  you will see for yourself in a minute or two come send on your people and baggage to the hall though where they will stow them all i dont know and walk with us  betty hesitated for she had been calculating upon the effect of a triumphal entry in full state but at that moment there appeared margaret and peter themselvesmargaret a beautiful matron with a child in her arms running and peter looking much as he had always been spare long of limb stern but for the kindly eyes striding away behind and after him sundry servants and the little girl margaret  then there arose a veritable babel of tongues punctuated by embracings but in the end the retinue and the baggage were got off up the drive followed by the children and the little spanishlooking boy with whom they had already made friends leaving only betty and her closely muffledup attendant this attendant peter contemplated for a while as though there were something familiar to him in her general air  apparently she observed his interest for as though by accident she moved some of the wrappings that hid her face revealing a single soft and lustrous eye and a few square inches of olivecoloured cheek then peter knew her at once  how are you inez he said stretching out his hand with a smile for really he was delighted to see her  as well as a poor wanderer in a strange and very damp country can be don peter she answered in her languorous voice and certainly somewhat the better for seeing an old friend whom last she met in a certain bakers shop do you remember  remember answered peter it is not a thing i am likely to forget inez what became of fray henriques i have heard several different stories  one never can be sure she answered as she uncovered her smiling red lips there are so many dungeons in that old moorish holy house and elsewhere that it is impossible to keep count of their occupants however good your information all i know is that he got into trouble over that business poor man suspicions arose about his conduct in the procession which the captain here will recall and she pointed to smith also it is very dangerous for men in such positions to visit jewish quarters and to write incautious lettersno not the one you think of i kept faithbut others afterwards begging for it back again some of which miscarried  is he dead then asked peter  worse i think she answereda living death the punishment of the wall  poor wretch said peter with a shudder  yes remarked inez reflectively few doctors like their own medicine  i say inez said peter nodding his head towards betty that marquis isnt coming here is he  in the spirit perhaps don peter not otherwise  so he is really dead what killed him  laughter i think or rather being laughed at he got quite well of the hurts you gave him and then of course he had to keep the queens gage and take the most noble lady yonder late betty as his marchioness he couldnt do less after she beat you off him with your own sword and nursed him back to life but he never heard the last of it they made songs about him in the streets and would ask him how his godmother isabella was because she had promised and vowed on his behalf also whether the marchioness had broken any lances for his sake lately and so forth  poor man said peter again in tones of the deepest sympathy a cruel fate i should have done better to kill him  much but dont say so to the noble betty who thinks that he had a very happy married life under her protecting care really he ate his heart out till even i who hated him was sorry think of it one of the proudest men in spain and the most gallant a nephew of the king a pillar of the church his sovereigns plenipotentiary to the moors and on secret mattersthe common mock of the vulgar yes and of the great too  the great which of them  nearly all for the queen set the fashioni wonder why she hated him so inez added looking shrewdly at peter then without waiting for an answer went on she did it very cleverly by always making the most of the most honourable betty in public calling her near to her talking with her admiring her english beauty and so forth and what her majesty did everybody else did until my exalted mistress nearly went off her head so full was she of pride and glory as for the marquis he fell ill and after the taking of granada went to live there quietly betty went with him for she was a good wife and saved lots of money she buried him a year ago for he died slow and gave him one of the finest tombs in spainit isnt finished yet that is all the story now she has brought her boy the young marquis to england for a year or two for she has a very warm heart and longed to see you all also she thought she had better go away a while for her sons sake as for me now that morella is dead i am head of the householdsecretary general purveyor of intelligence and anything else you like at a good salary  you are not married i suppose asked peter  no inez answered i saw so much of men when i was younger that i seem to have had enough of them or perhaps she went on fixing that mild and lustrous eye upon him there was one of them whom i liked too well to wish  she paused for they had crossed the drawbridge and arrived opposite to the old hall the gorgeous betty and the fair margaret accompanied by the others and talking rapidly had passed through the wide doorway into its spacious vestibule inez looked after them and perceived standing like a guard at the foot of the open stair that scarred suit of white armour and riven shield blazoned with the golden falcon isabellas gift in which peter had fought and conquered the marquis of morella then she stepped back and contemplated the house critically  at each end of it rose a stone tower built for the purposes of defence and all around ran a deep moat within the circle of this moat and surrounded by poplars and ancient yews on the south side of the hall lay a walled pleasaunce or garden of turf pierced by paths and planted with flowering hawthorns and other shrubs and at the end of it almost hidden in drooping willows a stone basin of water looking at it inez saw at once that so far as the circumstances of climate and situation would allow peter in the laying out of this place had copied another in the faroff southern city of granada even down to the details of the steps and seats she turned to him and said innocently  sir peter are you minded to walk with me in that garden this pleasant evening i do not see any window in yonder tower  peter turned red as the scar across his face and laughed as he answered  there may be one for all that get you into the house dear inez for none can be more welcome there but i walk no more alone with you in gardens  the end
