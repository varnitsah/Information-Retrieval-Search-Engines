pretentious history or a philosophical dissertation it is a record of several years of variegated vagabondizing and its object is rather to help the resting reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics or goad him with science still there is information in the volume information concerning an interesting episode in the history of the far west about which no books have been written by persons who were on the ground in person and saw the happenings of the time with their own eyes i allude to the rise growth and culmination of the silvermining fever in nevada a curious episode in some respects the only one of its peculiar kind that has occurred in the land and the only one indeed that is likely to occur in it  yes take it all around there is quite a good deal of information in the book i regret this very much but really it could not be helped information appears to stew out of me naturally like the precious ottar of roses out of the otter sometimes it has seemed to me that i would give worlds if i could retain my facts but it cannot be the more i calk up the sources and the tighter i get the more i leak wisdom therefore i can only claim indulgence at

cconcerning a frightful assassination that was never consummated       chapter i  my brother had just been appointed secretary of nevada territoryan office of such majesty that it concentrated in itself the duties and dignities of treasurer comptroller secretary of state and acting governor in the governors absence  a salary of eighteen hundred dollars a year and the title of mr secretary gave to the great position an air of wild and imposing grandeur  i was young and ignorant and i envied my brother  i coveted his distinction and his financial splendor but particularly and especially the long strange journey he was going to make and the curious new world he was going to explore  he was going to travel  i never had been away from home and that word travel had a seductive charm for me  pretty soon he would be hundreds and hundreds of miles away on the great plains and deserts and among the mountains of the far west and would see buffaloes and indians and prairie dogs and antelopes and have all kinds of adventures and may be get hanged or scalped and have ever such a fine time and write home and tell us all about it and be a hero  and he would see the gold mines and the silver mines and maybe go about of an afternoon when his work was done and pick up two or three pailfuls of shining slugs and nuggets of gold and silver on the hillside  and by and by he would become very rich and return home by sea and be able to talk as calmly about san francisco and the ocean and the isthmus as if it was nothing of any consequence to have seen those marvels face to face  what i suffered in contemplating his happiness pen cannot describe  and so when he offered me in cold blood the sublime position of private secretary under him it appeared to me that the heavens and the earth passed away and the firmament was rolled together as a scroll  i had nothing more to desire  my contentment was complete  at the end of an hour or two i was ready for the journey  not much packing up was necessary because we were going in the overland stage from the missouri frontier to nevada and passengers were only allowed a small quantity of baggage apiece  there was no pacific railroad in those fine times of ten or twelve years agonot a single rail of it i only proposed to stay in nevada three monthsi had no thought of staying longer than that  i meant to see all i could that was new and strange and then hurry home to business  i little thought that i would not see the end of that threemonth pleasure excursion for six or seven uncommonly long years  i dreamed all night about indians deserts and silver bars and in due time next day we took shipping at the st louis wharf on board a steamboat bound up the missouri river  we were six days going from st louis to st joa trip that was so dull and sleepy and eventless that it has left no more impression on my memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many days  no record is left in my mind now concerning it but a confused jumble of savagelooking snags which we deliberately walked over with one wheel or the other and of reefs which we butted and butted and then retired from and climbed over in some softer place and of sandbars which we roosted on occasionally and rested and then got out our crutches and sparred over  in fact the boat might almost as well have gone to st jo by land for she was walking most of the time anyhowclimbing over reefs and clambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long  the captain said she was a bully boat and all she wanted was more shear and a bigger wheel  i thought she wanted a pair of stilts but i had the deep sagacity not to say so     chapter ii  the first thing we did on that glad evening that landed us at st joseph was to hunt up the stageoffice and pay a hundred and fifty dollars apiece for tickets per overland coach to carson city nevada  the next morning bright and early we took a hasty breakfast and hurried to the startingplace  then an inconvenience presented itself which we had not properly appreciated before namely that one cannot make a heavy traveling trunk stand for twentyfive pounds of baggage because it weighs a good deal more  but that was all we could take twentyfive pounds each  so we had to snatch our trunks open and make a selection in a good deal of a hurry  we put our lawful twentyfive pounds apiece all in one valise and shipped the trunks back to st louis again  it was a sad parting for now we had no swallowtail coats and white kid gloves to wear at pawnee receptions in the rocky mountains and no stovepipe hats nor patentleather boots nor anything else necessary to make life calm and peaceful  we were reduced to a warfooting  each of us put on a rough heavy suit of clothing woolen army shirt and stogy boots included and into the valise we crowded a few white shirts some underclothing and such things  my brother the secretary took along about four pounds of united states statutes and six pounds of unabridged dictionary for we did not knowpoor innocentsthat such things could be bought in san francisco on one day and received in carson city the next  i was armed to the teeth with a pitiful little smith  wessons sevenshooter which carried a ball like a homoeopathic pill and it took the whole seven to make a dose for an adult  but i thought it was grand  it appeared to me to be a dangerous weapon  it only had one faultyou could not hit anything with it  one of our conductors practiced awhile on a cow with it and as long as she stood still and behaved herself she was safe but as soon as she went to moving about and he got to shooting at other things she came to grief  the secretary had a smallsized colts revolver strapped around him for protection against the indians and to guard against accidents he carried it uncapped  mr george bemis was dismally formidable  george bemis was our fellowtraveler  we had never seen him before  he wore in his belt an old original allen revolver such as irreverent people called a pepperbox simply drawing the trigger back cocked and fired the pistol  as the trigger came back the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn over and presently down would drop the hammer and away would speed the ball to aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a feat which was probably never done with an allen in the world  but georges was a reliable weapon nevertheless because as one of the stagedrivers afterward said if she didnt get what she went after she would fetch something else and so she did  she went after a deuce of spades nailed against a tree once and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards to the left of it  bemis did not want the mule but the owner came out with a doublebarreled shotgun and persuaded him to buy it anyhow  it was a cheerful weaponthe allen sometimes all its six barrels would go off at once and then there was no safe place in all the region round about but behind it  we took two or three blankets for protection against frosty weather in the mountains  in the matter of luxuries we were modestwe took none along but some pipes and five pounds of smoking tobacco  we had two large canteens to carry water in between stations on the plains and we also took with us a little shotbag of silver coin for daily expenses in the way of breakfasts and dinners  by eight oclock everything was ready and we were on the other side of the river  we jumped into the stage the driver cracked his whip and we bowled away and left the states behind us  it was a superb summer morning and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine  there was a freshness and breeziness too and an exhilarating sense of emancipation from all sorts of cares and responsibilities that almost made us feel that the years we had spent in the close hot city toiling and slaving had been wasted and thrown away  we were spinning along through kansas and in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on the great plains  just here the land was rollinga grand sweep of regular elevations and depressions as far as the eye could reachlike the stately heave and swell of the oceans bosom after a storm  and everywhere were cornfields accenting with squares of deeper green this limitless expanse of grassy land  but presently this sea upon dry ground was to lose its rolling character and stretch away for seven hundred miles as level as a floor  our coach was a great swinging and swaying stage of the most sumptuous descriptionan imposing cradle on wheels  it was drawn by six handsome horses and by the side of the driver sat the conductor the legitimate captain of the craft for it was his business to take charge and care of the mails baggage express matter and passengers  we three were the only passengers this trip  we sat on the back seat inside  about all the rest of the coach was full of mail bagsfor we had three days delayed mails with us  almost touching our knees a perpendicular wall of mail matter rose up to the roof  there was a great pile of it strapped on top of the stage and both the fore and hind boots were full we had twentyseven hundred pounds of it aboard the driver saida little for brigham and carson and frisco but the heft of it for the injuns which is powerful troublesome thout they get plenty of truck to read but as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenance which was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake we guessed that his remark was intended to be facetious and to mean that we would unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the plains and leave it to the indians or whosoever wanted it  we changed horses every ten miles all day long and fairly flew over the hard level road  we jumped out and stretched our legs every time the coach stopped and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatigued  after supper a woman got in who lived about fifty miles further on and we three had to take turns at sitting outside with the driver and conductor  apparently she was not a talkative woman  she would sit there in the gathering twilight and fasten her steadfast eyes on a mosquito rooting into her arm and slowly she would raise her other hand till she had got his range and then she would launch a slap at him that would have jolted a cow and after that she would sit and contemplate the corpse with tranquil satisfactionfor she never missed her mosquito she was a dead shot at short range  she never removed a carcase but left them there for bait  i sat by this grim sphynx and watched her kill thirty or forty mosquitoeswatched her and waited for her to say something but she never did  so i finally opened the conversation myself  i said  the mosquitoes are pretty bad about here madam  you bet  what did i understand you to say madam  you bet  then she cheered up and faced around and said  danged if i didnt begin to think you fellers was deef and dumb  i did bgosh  here ive sot and sot and sot abustn muskeeters and wonderin what was ailin ye  fust i thot you was deef and dumb then i thot you was sick or crazy or suthin and then by and by i begin to reckon you was a passel of sickly fools that couldnt think of nothing to say  wherd ye come from  the sphynx was a sphynx no more  the fountains of her great deep were broken up and she rained the nine parts of speech forty days and forty nights metaphorically speaking and buried us under a desolating deluge of trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacle of rejoinder projecting above the tossing waste of dislocated grammar and decomposed pronunciation  how we suffered suffered suffered  she went on hour after hour till i was sorry i ever opened the mosquito question and gave her a start she never did stop again until she got to her journeys end toward daylight and then she stirred us up as she was leaving the stage for we were nodding by that time and said  now you git out at cottonwood you fellers and lay over a couple o days and ill be along some time tonight and if i can do ye any good by edgin in a word now and then im right thar  folksll tell yout ive always ben kind o offish and particlar for a gal thats raised in the woods and i am with the ragtag and bobtail and a gal has to be if she wants to be anything but when people comes along which is my equals i reckon im a pretty sociable heifer after all  we resolved not to lay by at cottonwood     chapter iii  about an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along smoothly over the roadso smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a gentle lulling way that was gradually soothing us to sleep and dulling our consciousnesswhen something gave away under us  we were dimly aware of it but indifferent to it  the coach stopped  we heard the driver and conductor talking together outside and rummaging for a lantern and swearing because they could not find itbut we had no interest in whatever had happened and it only added to our comfort to think of those people out there at work in the murky night and we snug in our nest with the curtains drawn  but presently by the sounds there seemed to be an examination going on and then the drivers voice said  by george the thoroughbrace is broke  this startled me broad awakeas an undefined sense of calamity is always apt to do  i said to myself now a thoroughbrace is probably part of a horse and doubtless a vital part too from the dismay in the drivers voice  leg maybeand yet how could he break his leg waltzing along such a road as this  no it cant be his leg  that is impossible unless he was reaching for the driver  now what can be the thoroughbrace of a horse i wonder  well whatever comes i shall not air my ignorance in this crowd anyway  just then the conductors face appeared at a lifted curtain and his lantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter  he said gents youll have to turn out a spell  thoroughbrace is broke  we climbed out into a chill drizzle and felt ever so homeless and dreary  when i found that the thing they called a thoroughbrace was the massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks itself in i said to the driver  i never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that before that i can remember  how did it happen  why it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days mail thats how it happened said he  and right here is the very direction which is wrote on all the newspaperbags which was to be put out for the injuns for to keep em quiet  its most uncommon lucky becuz its so nation dark i should a gone by unbeknowns if that air thoroughbrace hadnt broke  i knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his though i could not see his face because he was bent down at work and wishing him a safe delivery i turned to and helped the rest get out the mailsacks it made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out  when they had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again but put no mail on top and only half as much inside as there was before  the conductor bent all the seatbacks down and then filled the coach just half full of mailbags from end to end  we objected loudly to this for it left us no seats  but the conductor was wiser than we and said a bed was better than seats and moreover this plan would protect his thoroughbraces  we never wanted any seats after that  the lazy bed was infinitely preferable  i had many an exciting day subsequently lying on it reading the statutes and the dictionary and wondering how the characters would turn out  the conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station to take charge of the abandoned mailbags and we drove on  it was now just dawn and as we stretched our cramped legs full length on the mail sacks and gazed out through the windows across the wide wastes of greensward clad in cool powdery mist to where there was an expectant look in the eastern horizon our perfect enjoyment took the form of a tranquil and contented ecstasy  the stage whirled along at a spanking gait the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a most exhilarating way the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously the pattering of the horses hoofs the cracking of the drivers whip and his hiyi glang were music the spinning ground and the waltzing trees appeared to give us a mute hurrah as we went by and then slack up and look after us with interest or envy or something and as we lay and smoked the pipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years of tiresome city life that had gone before it we felt that there was only one complete and satisfying happiness in the world and we had found it  after breakfast at some station whose name i have forgotten we three climbed up on the seat behind the driver and let the conductor have our bed for a nap  and by and by when the sun made me drowsy i lay down on my face on top of the coach grasping the slender iron railing and slept for an hour or more  that will give one an appreciable idea of those matchless roads  instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast hold of the railing when the stage jolts but when it only swings and sways no grip is necessary  overland drivers and conductors used to sit in their places and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time on good roads while spinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour  i saw them do it often  there was no danger about it a sleeping man will seize the irons in time when the coach jolts  these men were hard worked and it was not possible for them to stay awake all the time  by and by we passed through marysville and over the big blue and little sandy thence about a mile and entered nebraska  about a mile further on we came to the big sandyone hundred and eighty miles from st joseph  as the sun was going down we saw the first specimen of an animal known familiarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desertfrom kansas clear to the pacific oceanas the jackass rabbit he is well named he is just like any other rabbit except that he is from one third to twice as large has longer legs in proportion to his size and has the most preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature but a jackass  when he is sitting quiet thinking about his sins or is absentminded or unapprehensive of danger his majestic ears project above him conspicuously but the breaking of a twig will scare him nearly to death and then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for home  all you can see then for the next minute is his long gray form stretched out straight and streaking it through the low sagebrush head erect eyes right and ears just canted a little to the rear but showing you where the animal is all the time the same as if he carried a jib  now and then he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs high over the stunted sagebrush and scores a leap that would make a horse envious presently he comes down to a long graceful lope and shortly he mysteriously disappears  he has crouched behind a sagebush and will sit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of him when he will get under way again  but one must shoot at this creature once if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels and do the best he knows how  he is frightened clear through now and he lays his long ears down on his back straightens himself out like a yardstick every spring he makes and scatters miles behind him with an easy indifference that is enchanting  our party made this specimen hump himself as the conductor said  the secretary started him with a shot from the colt i commenced spitting at him with my weapon and all in the same instant the old allens whole broadside let go with a rattling crash and it is not putting it too strong to say that the rabbit was frantic  he dropped his ears set up his tail and left for san francisco at a speed which can only be described as a flash and a vanish  long after he was out of sight we could hear him whiz  i do not remember where we first came across sagebrush but as i have been speaking of it i may as well describe it  this is easily done for if the reader can imagine a gnarled and venerable live oaktree reduced to a little shrub two feethigh with its rough bark its foliage its twisted boughs all complete he can picture the sagebrush exactly  often on lazy afternoons in the mountains i have lain on the ground with my face under a sagebush and entertained myself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were liliputian birds and that the ants marching and countermarching about its base were liliputian flocks and herds and myself some vast loafer from brobdignag waiting to catch a little citizen and eat him  it is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature is the sagebrush  its foliage is a grayish green and gives that tint to desert and mountain  it smells like our domestic sage and sagetea made from it taste like the sagetea which all boys are so well acquainted with  the sagebrush is a singularly hardy plant and grows right in the midst of deep sand and among barren rocks where nothing else in the vegetable world would try to grow except bunchgrass bunchgrass grows on the bleak mountainsides of nevada and neighboring territories and offers excellent feed for stock even in the dead of winter wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it notwithstanding its unpromising home bunchgrass is a better and more nutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass that is knownso stockmen saythe sagebushes grow from three to six or seven feet apart all over the mountains and deserts of the far west clear to the borders of california  there is not a tree of any kind in the deserts for hundreds of milesthere is no vegetation at all in a regular desert except the sagebrush and its cousin the greasewood which is so much like the sagebrush that the difference amounts to little  campfires and hot suppers in the deserts would be impossible but for the friendly sagebrush  its trunk is as large as a boys wrist and from that up to a mans arm and its crooked branches are half as large as its trunkall good sound hard wood very like oak  when a party camps the first thing to be done is to cut sagebrush and in a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use  a hole a foot wide two feet deep and two feet long is dug and sagebrush chopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with glowing coals  then the cooking begins and there is no smoke and consequently no swearing  such a fire will keep all night with very little replenishing and it makes a very sociable campfire and one around which the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible instructive and profoundly entertaining  sagebrush is very fair fuel but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure  nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child the mule  but their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing for they will eat pine knots or anthracite coal or brass filings or lead pipe or old bottles or anything that comes handy and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner  mules and donkeys and camels have appetites that anything will relieve temporarily but nothing satisfy  in syria once at the headwaters of the jordan a camel took charge of my overcoat while the tents were being pitched and examined it with a critical eye all over with as much interest as if he had an idea of getting one made like it and then after he was done figuring on it as an article of apparel he began to contemplate it as an article of diet he put his foot on it and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth and chewed and chewed at it gradually taking it in and all the while opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy as if he had never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before in his life  then he smacked his lips once or twice and reached after the other sleeve next he tried the velvet collar and smiled a smile of such contentment that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing about an overcoat  the tails went next along with some percussion caps and cough candy and some figpaste from constantinople  and then my newspaper correspondence dropped out and he took a chance in that manuscript letters written for the home papers  but he was treading on dangerous ground now  he began to come across solid wisdom in those documents that was rather weighty on his stomach and occasionally he would take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth it was getting to be perilous times with him but he held his grip with good courage and hopefully till at last he began to stumble on statements that not even a camel could swallow with impunity  he began to gag and gasp and his eyes to stand out and his forelegs to spread and in about a quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenters workbench and died a death of indescribable agony  i went and pulled the manuscript out of his mouth and found that the sensitive creature had choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of fact that i ever laid before a trusting public  i was about to say when diverted from my subject that occasionally one finds sagebushes five or six feet high and with a spread of branch and foliage in proportion but two or two and a half feet is the usual height     chapter iv  as the sun went down and the evening chill came on we made preparation for bed  we stirred up the hard leather lettersacks and the knotty canvas bags of printed matter knotty and uneven because of projecting ends and corners of magazines boxes and books  we stirred them up and redisposed them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possible and we did improve it too though after all our work it had an upheaved and billowy look about it like a little piece of a stormy sea  next we hunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mailbags where they had settled and put them on  then we got down our coats vests pantaloons and heavy woolen shirts from the armloops where they had been swinging all day and clothed ourselves in themfor there being no ladies either at the stations or in the coach and the weather being hot we had looked to our comfort by stripping to our underclothing at nine oclock in the morning  all things being now ready we stowed the uneasy dictionary where it would lie as quiet as possible and placed the watercanteens and pistols where we could find them in the dark  then we smoked a final pipe and swapped a final yarn after which we put the pipes tobacco and bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the mailbags and then fastened down the coach curtains all around and made the place as dark as the inside of a cow as the conductor phrased it in his picturesque way  it was certainly as dark as any place could benothing was even dimly visible in it  and finally we rolled ourselves up like silkworms each person in his own blanket and sank peacefully to sleep  whenever the stage stopped to change horses we would wake up and try to recollect where we wereand succeedand in a minute or two the stage would be off again and we likewise  we began to get into country now threaded here and there with little streams  these had high steep banks on each side and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up the other our party inside got mixed somewhat  first we would all be down in a pile at the forward end of the stage nearly in a sitting posture and in a second we would shoot to the other end and stand on our heads and we would sprawl and kick too and ward off ends and corners of mailbags that came lumbering over us and about us and as the dust rose from the tumult we would all sneeze in chorus and the majority of us would grumble and probably say some hasty thing like take your elbow out of my ribscant you quit crowding  every time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the other the unabridged dictionary would come too and every time it came it damaged somebody  one trip it barked the secretarys elbow the next trip it hurt me in the stomach and the third it tilted bemiss nose up till he could look down his nostrilshe said  the pistols and coin soon settled to the bottom but the pipes pipestems tobacco and canteens clattered and floundered after the dictionary every time it made an assault on us and aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes and water down our backs  still all things considered it was a very comfortable night  it wore gradually away and when at last a cold gray light was visible through the puckers and chinks in the curtains we yawned and stretched with satisfaction shed our cocoons and felt that we had slept as much as was necessary  by and by as the sun rose up and warmed the world we pulled off our clothes and got ready for breakfast  we were just pleasantly in time for five minutes afterward the driver sent the weird music of his bugle winding over the grassy solitudes and presently we detected a low hut or two in the distance  then the rattling of the coach the clatter of our six horses hoofs and the drivers crisp commands awoke to a louder and stronger emphasis and we went sweeping down on the station at our smartest speed  it was fascinatingthat old overland stagecoaching  we jumped out in undress uniform  the driver tossed his gathered reins out on the ground gaped and stretched complacently drew off his heavy buckskin gloves with great deliberation and insufferable dignitytaking not the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquires after his health and humbly facetious and flattering accostings and obsequious tenders of service from five or six hairy and halfcivilized stationkeepers and hostlers who were nimbly unhitching our steeds and bringing the fresh team out of the stablesfor in the eyes of the stagedriver of that day stationkeepers and hostlers were a sort of good enough low creatures useful in their place and helping to make up a world but not the kind of beings which a person of distinction could afford to concern himself with while on the contrary in the eyes of the stationkeeper and the hostler the stagedriver was a heroa great and shining dignitary the worlds favorite son the envy of the people the observed of the nations  when they spoke to him they received his insolent silence meekly and as being the natural and proper conduct of so great a man when he opened his lips they all hung on his words with admiration he never honored a particular individual with a remark but addressed it with a broad generality to the horses the stables the surrounding country and the human underlings when he discharged a facetious insulting personality at a hostler that hostler was happy for the day when he uttered his one jestold as the hills coarse profane witless and inflicted on the same audience in the same language every time his coach drove up therethe varlets roared and slapped their thighs and swore it was the best thing theyd ever heard in all their lives  and how they would fly around when he wanted a basin of water a gourd of the same or a light for his pipebut they would instantly insult a passenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at their hands they could do that sort of insolence as well as the driver they copied it fromfor let it be borne in mind the overland driver had but little less contempt for his passengers than he had for his hostlers  the hostlers and stationkeepers treated the really powerful conductor of the coach merely with the best of what was their idea of civility but the driver was the only being they bowed down to and worshipped  how admiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he gloved himself with lingering deliberation while some happy hostler held the bunch of reins aloft and waited patiently for him to take it  and how they would bombard him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked his long whip and went careering away  the station buildings were long low huts made of sundried mudcolored bricks laid up without mortar adobes the spaniards call these bricks and americans shorten it to dobies  the roofs which had no slant to them worth speaking of were thatched and then sodded or covered with a thick layer of earth and from this sprung a pretty rank growth of weeds and grass  it was the first time we had ever seen a mans front yard on top of his house  the building consisted of barns stableroom for twelve or fifteen horses and a hut for an eatingroom for passengers this latter had bunks in it for the stationkeeper and a hostler or two you could rest your elbow on its eaves and you had to bend in order to get in at the door  in place of a window there was a square hole about large enough for a man to crawl through but this had no glass in it there was no flooring but the ground was packed hard  there was no stove but the fireplace served all needful purposes  there were no shelves no cupboards no closets  in a corner stood an open sack of flour and nestling against its base were a couple of black and venerable tin coffeepots a tin teapot a little bag of salt and a side of bacon   by the door of the stationkeepers den outside was a tin washbasin on the ground  near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow bar soap and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt significantly but this latter was the stationkeepers private towel and only two persons in all the party might venture to use itthe stagedriver and the conductor  the latter would not from a sense of decency the former would not because did not choose to encourage the advances of a stationkeeper  we had towelsin the valise they might as well have been in sodom and gomorrah  we and the conductor used our handkerchiefs and the driver his pantaloons and sleeves  by the door inside was fastened a small oldfashioned lookingglass frame with two little fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it this arrangement afforded a pleasant doublebarreled portrait of you when you looked into it with one half of your head set up a couple of inches above the other half  from the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a stringbut if i had to describe that patriarch or die i believe i would order some sample coffins  it had come down from esau and samson and had been accumulating hair ever sincealong with certain impurities  in one corner of the room stood three or four rifles and muskets together with horns and pouches of ammunition  the stationmen wore pantaloons of coarse countrywoven stuff and into the seat and the inside of the legs were sewed ample additions of buckskin to do duty in place of leggings when the man rode horsebackso the pants were half dull blue and half yellow and unspeakably picturesque  the pants were stuffed into the tops of high boots the heels whereof were armed with great spanish spurs whose little iron clogs and chains jingled with every step  the man wore a huge beard and mustachios an old slouch hat a blue woolen shirt no suspenders no vest no coatin a leathern sheath in his belt a great long navy revolver slung on right side hammer to the front and projecting from his boot a hornhandled bowieknife  the furniture of the hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way  the rockingchairs and sofas were not present and never had been but they were represented by two threelegged stools a pineboard bench four feet long and two empty candleboxes  the table was a greasy board on stilts and the tablecloth and napkins had not comeand they were not looking for them either  a battered tin platter a knife and fork and a tin pint cup were at each mans place and the driver had a queensware saucer that had seen better days  of course this duke sat at the head of the table there was one isolated piece of table furniture that bore about it a touching air of grandeur in misfortune  this was the caster  it was german silver and crippled and rusty but it was so preposterously out of place there that it was suggestive of a tattered exiled king among barbarians and the majesty of its native position compelled respect even in its degradation  there was only one cruet left and that was a stopperless flyspecked brokennecked thing with two inches of vinegar in it and a dozen preserved flies with their heels up and looking sorry they had invested there  the stationkeeper upended a disk of last weeks bread of the shape and size of an oldtime cheese and carved some slabs from it which were as good as nicholson pavement and tenderer  he sliced off a piece of bacon for each man but only the experienced old hands made out to eat it for it was condemned army bacon which the united states would not feed to its soldiers in the forts and the stage company had bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers and employees  we may have found this condemned army bacon further out on the plains than the section i am locating it in but we found itthere is no gainsaying that  then he poured for us a beverage which he called slum gullion and it is hard to think he was not inspired when he named it  it really pretended to be tea but there was too much dishrag and sand and old baconrind in it to deceive the intelligent traveler  he had no sugar and no milknot even a spoon to stir the ingredients with  we could not eat the bread or the meat nor drink the slumgullion and when i looked at that melancholy vinegarcruet i thought of the anecdote a very very old one even at that day of the traveler who sat down to a table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard  he asked the landlord if this was all  the landlord said  all  why thunder and lightning i should think there was mackerel enough there for six  but i dont like mackerel  ohthen help yourself to the mustard  in other days i had considered it a good a very good anecdote but there was a dismal plausibility about it here that took all the humor out of it  our breakfast was before us but our teeth were idle  i tasted and smelt and said i would take coffee i believed  the stationboss stopped dead still and glared at me speechless  at last when he came to he turned away and said as one who communes with himself upon a matter too vast to grasp  coffee  well if that dont go clean ahead of me im dd  we could not eat and there was no conversation among the hostlers and herdsmenwe all sat at the same board  at least there was no conversation further than a single hurried request now and then from one employee to another  it was always in the same form and always gruffly friendly  its western freshness and novelty startled me at first and interested me but it presently grew monotonous and lost its charm  it was  pass the bread you son of a skunk  no i forgetskunk was not the word it seems to me it was still stronger than that i know it was in fact but it is gone from my memory apparently  however it is no matterprobably it was too strong for print anyway  it is the landmark in my memory which tells me where i first encountered the vigorous new vernacular of the occidental plains and mountains  we gave up the breakfast and paid our dollar apiece and went back to our mailbag bed in the coach and found comfort in our pipes  right here we suffered the first diminution of our princely state  we left our six fine horses and took six mules in their place  but they were wild mexican fellows and a man had to stand at the head of each of them and hold him fast while the driver gloved and got himself ready  and when at last he grasped the reins and gave the word the men sprung suddenly away from the mules heads and the coach shot from the station as if it had issued from a cannon  how the frantic animals did scamper  it was a fierce and furious gallopand the gait never altered for a moment till we reeled off ten or twelve miles and swept up to the next collection of little stationhuts and stables  so we flew along all day  at 2 pm  the belt of timber that fringes the north platte and marks its windings through the vast level floor of the plains came in sight  at 4 pm  we crossed a branch of the river and at 5 pm  we crossed the platte itself and landed at fort kearney fiftysix hours out from st joethree hundred miles  now that was stagecoaching on the great overland ten or twelve years ago when perhaps not more than ten men in america all told expected to live to see a railroad follow that route to the pacific  but the railroad is there now and it pictures a thousand odd comparisons and contrasts in my mind to read the following sketch in the new york times of a recent trip over almost the very ground i have been describing  i can scarcely comprehend the new state of things       across the continent       at 420 pm sunday we rolled out of the station at omaha and      started westward on our long jaunt  a couple of hours out dinner      was announcedan event to those of us who had yet to experience      what it is to eat in one of pullmans hotels on wheels so stepping      into the car next forward of our sleeping palace we found ourselves      in the diningcar  it was a revelation to us that first dinner on      sunday  and though we continued to dine for four days and had as      many breakfasts and suppers our whole party never ceased to admire      the perfection of the arrangements and the marvelous results      achieved  upon tables covered with snowy linen and garnished with      services of solid silver ethiop waiters flitting about in spotless      white placed as by magic a repast at which delmonico himself could      have had no occasion to blush and indeed in some respects it      would be hard for that distinguished chef to match our menu for in      addition to all that ordinarily makes up a firstchop dinner had we      not our antelope steak the gormand who has not experienced this      bah what does he know of the feast of fat things our delicious      mountainbrook trout and choice fruits and berries and sauce      piquant and unpurchasable our sweetscented appetitecompelling      air of the prairies       you may depend upon it we all did justice to the good things and      as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling krug whilst we      sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour agreed it was the      fastest living we had ever experienced  we beat that however two      days afterward when we made twentyseven miles in twentyseven      minutes while our champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not      a drop after dinner we repaired to our drawingroom car and as      it was sabbath eve intoned some of the grand old hymnspraise god      from whom etc shining shore coronation etcthe voices of      the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the      evening air while our train with its great glaring polyphemus      eye lighting up long vistas of prairie rushed into the night and      the wild  then to bed in luxurious couches where we slept the      sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning monday at eight      oclock to find ourselves at the crossing of the north platte      three hundred miles from omahafifteen hours and forty minutes      out     chapter v  another night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil  but morning came by and by  it was another glad awakening to fresh breezes vast expanses of level greensward bright sunlight an impressive solitude utterly without visible human beings or human habitations and an atmosphere of such amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand were more than three mile away  we resumed undress uniform climbed atop of the flying coach dangled our legs over the side shouted occasionally at our frantic mules merely to see them lay their ears back and scamper faster tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing away and leveled an outlook over the worldwide carpet about us for things new and strange to gaze at  even at this day it thrills me through and through to think of the life the gladness and the wild sense of freedom that used to make the blood dance in my veins on those fine overland mornings  along about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairiedog villages the first antelope and the first wolf  if i remember rightly this latter was the regular cayote pronounced kyote of the farther deserts  and if it was he was not a pretty creature or respectable either for i got well acquainted with his race afterward and can speak with confidence  the cayote is a long slim sick and sorrylooking skeleton with a gray wolfskin stretched over it a tolerably bushy tail that forever sags down with a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery a furtive and evil eye and a long sharp face with slightly lifted lip and exposed teeth  he has a general slinking expression all over  the cayote is a living breathing allegory of want  he is always hungry  he is always poor out of luck and friendless  the meanest creatures despise him and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede  he is so spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are pretending a threat the rest of his face is apologizing for it  and he is so homelyso scrawny and ribby and coarsehaired and pitiful when he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out and then turns a little out of the course he was pursuing depresses his head a bit and strikes a long softfooted trot through the sagebrush glancing over his shoulder at you from time to time till he is about out of easy pistol range and then he stops and takes a deliberate survey of you he will trot fifty yards and stop againanother fifty and stop again and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the gray of the sagebrush and he disappears  all this is when you make no demonstration against him but if you do he develops a livelier interest in his journey and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a deal of real estate between himself and your weapon that by the time you have raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle and by the time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon and by the time you have drawn a bead on him you see well enough that nothing but an unusually longwinded streak of lightning could reach him where he is now  but if you start a swiftfooted dog after him you will enjoy it ever so muchespecially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of himself and has been brought up to think he knows something about speed  the cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambition and make him lay his head still lower to the ground and stretch his neck further to the front and pant more fiercely and stick his tail out straighter behind and move his furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy and leave a broader and broader and higher and denser cloud of desert sand smoking behind and marking his long wake across the level plain and all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the cayote and to save the soul of him he cannot understand why it is that he cannot get perceptibly closer and he begins to get aggravated and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile and he grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been taken in by an entire stranger and what an ignoble swindle that long calm softfooted trot is and next he notices that he is getting fagged and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away from himand then that towndog is mad in earnest and he begins to strain and weep and swear and paw the sand higher than ever and reach for the cayote with concentrated and desperate energy  this spurt finds him six feet behind the gliding enemy and two miles from his friends  and then in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face the cayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more and with a something about it which seems to say well i shall have to tear myself away from you bubbusiness is business and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all dayand forthwith there is a rushing sound and the sudden splitting of a long crack through the atmosphere and behold that dog is solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude  it makes his head swim  he stops and looks all around climbs the nearest sandmound and gazes into the distance shakes his head reflectively and then without a word he turns and jogs along back to his train and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon and feels unspeakably mean and looks ashamed and hangs his tail at halfmast for a week  and for as much as a year after that whenever there is a great hue and cry after a cayote that dog will merely glance in that direction without emotion and apparently observe to himself i believe i do not wish any of the pie  the cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding desert along with the lizard the jackassrabbit and the raven and gets an uncertain and precarious living and earns it  he seems to subsist almost wholly on the carcases of oxen mules and horses that have dropped out of emigrant trains and died and upon windfalls of carrion and occasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have been opulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned army bacon  he will eat anything in the world that his first cousins the desertfrequenting tribes of indians will and they will eat anything they can bite  it is a curious fact that these latter are the only creatures known to history who will eat nitroglycerine and ask for more if they survive  the cayote of the deserts beyond the rocky mountains has a peculiarly hard time of it owing to the fact that his relations the indians are just as apt to be the first to detect a seductive scent on the desert breeze and follow the fragrance to the late ox it emanated from as he is himself and when this occurs he has to content himself with sitting off at a little distance watching those people strip off and dig out everything edible and walk off with it  then he and the waiting ravens explore the skeleton and polish the bones  it is considered that the cayote and the obscene bird and the indian of the desert testify their blood kinship with each other in that they live together in the waste places of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and friendship while hating all other creature and yearning to assist at their funerals  he does not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast and a hundred and fifty to dinner because he is sure to have three or four days between meals and he can just as well be traveling and looking at the scenery as lying around doing nothing and adding to the burdens of his parents  we soon learned to recognize the sharp vicious bark of the cayote as it came across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among the mailsacks and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune made shift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long days good luck and a limitless larder the morrow     chapter vi  our new conductor just shipped had been without sleep for twenty hours such a thing was very frequent  from st joseph missouri to sacramento california by stagecoach was nearly nineteen hundred miles and the trip was often made in fifteen days the cars do it in four and a half now but the time specified in the mail contracts and required by the schedule was eighteen or nineteen days if i remember rightly  this was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows and other unavoidable causes of detention  the stage company had everything under strict discipline and good system  over each two hundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent and invested him with great authority  his beat or jurisdiction of two hundred and fifty miles was called a division he purchased horses mules harness and food for men and beasts and distributed these things among his stage stations from time to time according to his judgment of what each station needed  he erected station buildings and dug wells he attended to the paying of the stationkeepers hostlers drivers and blacksmiths and discharged them whenever he chose  he was a very very great man in his divisiona kind of grand mogul a sultan of the indies in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner and in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stagedriver dwindled to a penny dip  there were about eight of these kings all told on the overland route  next in rank and importance to the divisionagent came the conductor his beat was the same length as the agentstwo hundred and fifty miles he sat with the driver and when necessary rode that fearful distance night and day without other rest or sleep than what he could get perched thus on top of the flying vehicle  think of it  he had absolute charge of the mails express matter passengers and stage coach until he delivered them to the next conductor and got his receipt for them  consequently he had to be a man of intelligence decision and considerable executive ability  he was usually a quiet pleasant man who attended closely to his duties and was a good deal of a gentleman it was not absolutely necessary that the divisionagent should be a gentleman and occasionally he wasnt  but he was always a general in administrative ability and a bulldog in courage and determination otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overland service would never in any instance have been to him anything but an equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and a coffin at the end of it  there were about sixteen or eighteen conductors on the overland for there was a daily stage each way and a conductor on every stage  next in real and official rank and importance after the conductor came my delight the drivernext in real but not in apparent importancefor we have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the driver was to the conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flagship  the drivers beat was pretty long and his sleepingtime at the stations pretty short sometimes and so but for the grandeur of his position his would have been a sorry life as well as a hard and a wearing one  we took a new driver every day or every night for they drove backward and forward over the same piece of road all the time and therefore we never got as well acquainted with them as we did with the conductors and besides they would have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengers anyhow as a general thing  still we were always eager to get a sight of each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed for each and every day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one or loath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to be sociable and friendly with  and so the first question we asked the conductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers was always which is him  the grammar was faulty maybe but we could not know then that it would go into a book some day  as long as everything went smoothly the overland driver was well enough situated but if a fellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble for the coach must go on and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxurious rest after his long nights siege in the midst of wind and rain and darkness had to stay where he was and do the sick mans work  once in the rocky mountains when i found a driver sound asleep on the box and the mules going at the usual breakneck pace the conductor said never mind him there was no danger and he was doing double dutyhad driven seventyfive miles on one coach and was now going back over it on this without rest or sleep  a hundred and fifty miles of holding back of six vindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees  it sounds incredible but i remember the statement well enough  the stationkeepers hostlers etc were low rough characters as already described and from western nebraska to nevada a considerable sprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlawsfugitives from justice criminals whose best security was a section of country which was without law and without even the pretence of it  when the divisionagent issued an order to one of these parties he did it with the full understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy sixshooter and so he always went fixed to make things go along smoothly  now and then a divisionagent was really obliged to shoot a hostler through the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have taught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been different  but they were snappy able men those divisionagents and when they tried to teach a subordinate anything that subordinate generally got it through his head  a great portion of this vast machinerythese hundreds of men and coaches and thousands of mules and horseswas in the hands of mr ben holliday  all the western half of the business was in his hands  this reminds me of an incident of palestine travel which is pertinent here so i will transfer it just in the language in which i find it set down in my holy land notebook        no doubt everybody has heard of ben hollidaya man of prodigious       energy who used to send mails and passengers flying across the       continent in his overland stagecoaches like a very whirlwindtwo       thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half by the watch  but       this fragment of history is not about ben holliday but about a       young new york boy by the name of jack who traveled with our small       party of pilgrims in the holy land and who had traveled to       california in mr hollidays overland coaches three years before       and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of       mr h aged nineteen  jack was a good boya goodhearted and       always wellmeaning boy who had been reared in the city of new       york and although he was bright and knew a great many useful       things his scriptural education had been a good deal neglectedto       such a degree indeed that all holy land history was fresh and new       to him and all bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his       virgin ear        also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of       jack in that he was learned in the scriptures and an enthusiast       concerning them  he was our encyclopedia and we were never tired       of listening to his speeches nor he of making them  he never       passed a celebrated locality from bashan to bethlehem without       illuminating it with an oration  one day when camped near the       ruins of jericho he burst forth with something like this        jack do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds       the jordan valley  the mountains of moab jack  think of it my       boythe actual mountains of moabrenowned in scripture history       we are actually standing face to face with those illustrious crags       and peaksand for all we know dropping his voice impressively       our eyes may be resting at this very moment upon the spot where       lies the mysterious grave of moses  think of it jack        moses who  falling inflection        moses who  jack you ought to be ashamed of yourselfyou ought to       be ashamed of such criminal ignorance  why moses the great guide       soldier poet lawgiver of ancient israel  jack from this spot       where we stand to egypt stretches a fearful desert three hundred       miles in extentand across that desert that wonderful man brought       the children of israelguiding them with unfailing sagacity for       forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing       rocks and hills and landed them at last safe and sound within       sight of this very spot and where we now stand they entered the       promised land with anthems of rejoicing  it was a wonderful       wonderful thing to do jack  think of it        forty years  only three hundred miles  humph  ben holliday would       have fetched them through in thirtysix hours  the boy meant no harm  he did not know that he had said anything that was wrong or irreverent  and so no one scolded him or felt offended with himand nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing the heedless blunders of a boy  at noon on the fifth day out we arrived at the crossing of the south platte alias julesburg alias overland city four hundred and seventy miles from st josephthe strangest quaintest funniest frontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been astonished with     chapter vii  it did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to us such a long acquaintance with deep still almost lifeless and houseless solitude  we tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric people crumbled off the corner of some other world and wakened up suddenly in this  for an hour we took as much interest in overland city as if we had never seen a town before  the reason we had an hour to spare was because we had to change our stage for a less sumptuous affair called a mudwagon and transfer our freight of mails  presently we got under way again  we came to the shallow yellow muddy south platte with its low banks and its scattering flat sandbars and pigmy islandsa melancholy stream straggling through the centre of the enormous flat plain and only saved from being impossible to find with the naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on either bank  the platte was up they saidwhich made me wish i could see it when it was down if it could look any sicker and sorrier  they said it was a dangerous stream to cross now because its quicksands were liable to swallow up horses coach and passengers if an attempt was made to ford it  but the mails had to go and we made the attempt  once or twice in midstream the wheels sunk into the yielding sands so threateningly that we half believed we had dreaded and avoided the sea all our lives to be shipwrecked in a mudwagon in the middle of a desert at last  but we dragged through and sped away toward the setting sun  next morning just before dawn when about five hundred and fifty miles from st joseph our mudwagon broke down  we were to be delayed five or six hours and therefore we took horses by invitation and joined a party who were just starting on a buffalo hunt  it was noble sport galloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning but our part of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace for a wounded buffalo bull chased the passenger bemis nearly two miles and then he forsook his horse and took to a lone tree  he was very sullen about the matter for some twentyfour hours but at last he began to soften little by little and finally he said  well it was not funny and there was no sense in those gawks making themselves so facetious over it  i tell you i was angry in earnest for awhile  i should have shot that long gangly lubber they called hank if i could have done it without crippling six or seven other peoplebut of course i couldnt the old allens so confounded comprehensive  i wish those loafers had been up in the tree they wouldnt have wanted to laugh so  if i had had a horse worth a centbut no the minute he saw that buffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow he raised straight up in the air and stood on his heels  the saddle began to slip and i took him round the neck and laid close to him and began to pray  then he came down and stood up on the other end awhile and the bull actually stopped pawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacle  then the bull made a pass at him and uttered a bellow that sounded perfectly frightful it was so close to me and that seemed to literally prostrate my horses reason and make a raving distracted maniac of him and i wish i may die if he didnt stand on his head for a quarter of a minute and shed tears  he was absolutely out of his mindhe was as sure as truth itself and he really didnt know what he was doing  then the bull came charging at us and my horse dropped down on all fours and took a fresh startand then for the next ten minutes he would actually throw one handspring after another so fast that the bull began to get unsettled too and didnt know where to start inand so he stood there sneezing and shovelling dust over his back and bellowing every now and then and thinking he had got a fifteenhundred dollar circus horse for breakfast certain  well i was first out on his neckthe horses not the bullsand then underneath and next on his rump and sometimes head up and sometimes heelsbut i tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be ripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death as you might say  pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away some of my horses tail i suppose but do not know being pretty busy at the time but something made him hungry for solitude and suggested to him to get up and hunt for it  and then you ought to have seen that spider legged old skeleton go and you ought to have seen the bull cut out after him toohead down tongue out tail up bellowing like everything and actually mowing down the weeds and tearing up the earth and boosting up the sand like a whirlwind  by george it was a hot race  i and the saddle were back on the rump and i had the bridle in my teeth and holding on to the pommel with both hands  first we left the dogs behind then we passed a jackass rabbit then we overtook a cayote and were gaining on an antelope when the rotten girth let go and threw me about thirty yards off to the left and as the saddle went down over the horses rump he gave it a lift with his heels that sent it more than four hundred yards up in the air i wish i may die in a minute if he didnt  i fell at the foot of the only solitary tree there was in nine counties adjacent as any creature could see with the naked eye and the next second i had hold of the bark with four sets of nails and my teeth and the next second after that i was astraddle of the main limb and blaspheming my luck in a way that made my breath smell of brimstone  i had the bull now if he did not think of one thing  but that one thing i dreaded  i dreaded it very seriously there was a possibility that the bull might not think of it but there were greater chances that he would  i made up my mind what i would do in case he did  it was a little over forty feet to the ground from where i sat  i cautiously unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddle  your saddle  did you take your saddle up in the tree with you  take it up in the tree with me  why how you talk  of course i didnt no man could do that  it fell in the tree when it came down  ohexactly  certainly  i unwound the lariat and fastened one end of it to the limb  it was the very best green rawhide and capable of sustaining tons  i made a slipnoose in the other end and then hung it down to see the length  it reached down twentytwo feethalf way to the ground i then loaded every barrel of the allen with a double charge  i felt satisfied  i said to myself if he never thinks of that one thing that i dread all rightbut if he does all right anyhowi am fixed for him but dont you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing that always happens  indeed it is so  i watched the bull now with anxiety anxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such a situation and felt that at any moment death might come  presently a thought came into the bulls eye  i knew it said iif my nerve fails now i am lost  sure enough it was just as i had dreaded he started in to climb the tree  what the bull  of coursewho else  but a bull cant climb a tree  he cant cant he  since you know so much about it did you ever see a bull try  no  i never dreamt of such a thing  well then what is the use of your talking that way then  because you never saw a thing done is that any reason why it cant be done  well all rightgo on  what did you do  the bull started up and got along well for about ten feet then slipped and slid back  i breathed easier  he tried it againgot up a little higherslipped again  but he came at it once more and this time he was careful  he got gradually higher and higher and my spirits went down more and more  up he camean inch at a timewith his eyes hot and his tongue hanging out  higher and higherhitched his foot over the stump of a limb and looked up as much as to say you are my meat friend up againhigher and higher and getting more excited the closer he got he was within ten feet of me  i took a long breathand then said i it is now or never  i had the coil of the lariat all ready i paid it out slowly till it hung right over his head all of a sudden i let go of the slack and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck  quicker than lightning i out with the allen and let him have it in the face  it was an awful roar and must have scared the bull out of his senses  when the smoke cleared away there he was dangling in the air twenty foot from the ground and going out of one convulsion into another faster than you could count  i didnt stop to count anyhowi shinned down the tree and shot for home  bemis is all that true just as you have stated it  i wish i may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it isnt  well we cant refuse to believe it and we dont  but if there were some proofs  proofs  did i bring back my lariat  no  did i bring back my horse  no  did you ever see the bull again  no  well then what more do you want  i never saw anybody as particular as you are about a little thing like that  i made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it by the skin of his teeth  this episode reminds me of an incident of my brief sojourn in siam years afterward  the european citizens of a town in the neighborhood of bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name of eckert an englishmana person famous for the number ingenuity and imposing magnitude of his lies  they were always repeating his most celebrated falsehoods and always trying to draw him out before strangers but they seldom succeeded  twice he was invited to the house where i was visiting but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lie one day a planter named bascom an influential man and a proud and sometimes irascible one invited me to ride over with him and call on eckert  as we jogged along said he  now do you know where the fault lies  it lies in putting eckert on his guard  the minute the boys go to pumping at eckert he knows perfectly well what they are after and of course he shuts up his shell  anybody might know he would  but when we get there we must play him finer than that  let him shape the conversation to suit himselflet him drop it or change it whenever he wants to  let him see that nobody is trying to draw him out  just let him have his own way  he will soon forget himself and begin to grind out lies like a mill  dont get impatient just keep quiet and let me play him  i will make him lie  it does seem to me that the boys must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simple trick as that  eckert received us heartilya pleasantspoken gentlemannered creature we sat in the veranda an hour sipping english ale and talking about the king and the sacred white elephant the sleeping idol and all manner of things and i noticed that my comrade never led the conversation himself or shaped it but simply followed eckerts lead and betrayed no solicitude and no anxiety about anything  the effect was shortly perceptible  eckert began to grow communicative he grew more and more at his ease and more and more talkative and sociable  another hour passed in the same way and then all of a sudden eckert said  oh by the way  i came near forgetting  i have got a thing here to astonish you  such a thing as neither you nor any other man ever heard ofive got a cat that will eat cocoanut  common green cocoanutand not only eat the meat but drink the milk  it is soill swear to it  a quick glance from bascoma glance that i understoodthen  why bless my soul i never heard of such a thing  man it is impossible  i knew you would say it  ill fetch the cat  he went in the house  bascom said  therewhat did i tell you  now that is the way to handle eckert  you see i have petted him along patiently and put his suspicions to sleep i am glad we came  you tell the boys about it when you go back  cat eat a cocoanutoh my  now that is just his way exactlyhe will tell the absurdest lie and trust to luck to get out of it again  cat eat a cocoanutthe innocent fool  eckert approached with his cat sure enough  bascom smiled  said he  ill hold the catyou bring a cocoanut  eckert split one open and chopped up some pieces  bascom smuggled a wink to me and proffered a slice of the fruit to puss  she snatched it swallowed it ravenously and asked for more  we rode our two miles in silence and wide apart  at least i was silent though bascom cuffed his horse and cursed him a good deal notwithstanding the horse was behaving well enough  when i branched off homeward bascom said  keep the horse till morning  andyou need not speak of this foolishness to the boys     chapter viii  in a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and watching for the ponyriderthe fleet messenger who sped across the continent from st joe to sacramento carrying letters nineteen hundred miles in eight days  think of that for perishable horse and human flesh and blood to do  the ponyrider was usually a little bit of a man brimful of spirit and endurance  no matter what time of the day or night his watch came on and no matter whether it was winter or summer raining snowing hailing or sleeting or whether his beat was a level straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices or whether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with hostile indians he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off like the wind  there was no idlingtime for a ponyrider on duty he rode fifty miles without stopping by daylight moonlight starlight or through the blackness of darknessjust as it happened  he rode a splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a gentleman kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles and then as he came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a fresh impatient steed the transfer of rider and mailbag was made in the twinkling of an eye and away flew the eager pair and were out of sight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look  both rider and horse went flying light the riders dress was thin and fitted close he wore a roundabout and a skullcap and tucked his pantaloons into his boottops like a racerider  he carried no armshe carried nothing that was not absolutely necessary for even the postage on his literary freight was worth five dollars a letter  he got but little frivolous correspondence to carryhis bag had business letters in it mostly  his horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight too  he wore a little wafer of a racingsaddle and no visible blanket he wore light shoes or none at all  the little flat mailpockets strapped under the riders thighs would each hold about the bulk of a childs primer  they held many and many an important business chapter and newspaper letter but these were written on paper as airy and thin as goldleaf nearly and thus bulk and weight were economized  the stagecoach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twentyfive miles a day twentyfour hours the ponyrider about two hundred and fifty there were about eighty ponyriders in the saddle all the time night and day stretching in a long scattering procession from missouri to california forty flying eastward and forty toward the west and among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery every single day in the year  we had had a consuming desire from the beginning to see a ponyrider but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to streak by in the night and so we heard only a whiz and a hail and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out of the windows  but now we were expecting one along every moment and would see him in broad daylight  presently the driver exclaims  here he comes  every neck is stretched further and every eye strained wider  away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears against the sky and it is plain that it moves  well i should think so  in a second or two it becomes a horse and rider rising and falling rising and fallingsweeping toward us nearer and nearergrowing more and more distinct more and more sharply definednearer and still nearer and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the earanother instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck a wave of the riders hand but no reply and man and horse burst past our excited faces and go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm  so sudden is it all and so like a flash of unreal fancy that but for the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mailsack after the vision had flashed by and disappeared we might have doubted whether we had seen any actual horse and man at all maybe  we rattled through scotts bluffs pass by and by  it was along here somewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali water in the road and we cordially hailed it as a firstclass curiosity and a thing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the ignorant at home this water gave the road a soapy appearance and in many places the ground looked as if it had been whitewashed  i think the strange alkali water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon yet and i know we felt very complacent and conceited and better satisfied with life after we had added it to our list of things which we had seen and some other people had not  in a small way we were the same sort of simpletons as those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks of mont blanc and the matterhorn and derive no pleasure from it except the reflection that it isnt a common experience  but once in a while one of those parties trips and comes darting down the long mountaincrags in a sitting posture making the crusted snow smoke behind him flitting from bench to bench and from terrace to terrace jarring the earth where he strikes and still glancing and flitting on again sticking an iceberg into himself every now and then and tearing his clothes snatching at things to save himself taking hold of trees and fetching them along with him roots and all starting little rocks now and then then big boulders then acres of ice and snow and patches of forest gathering and still gathering as he goes adding and still adding to his massed and sweeping grandeur as he nears a three thousandfoot precipice till at last he waves his hat magnificently and rides into eternity on the back of a raging and tossing avalanche  this is all very fine but let us not be carried away by excitement but ask calmly how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments next day with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of him  we crossed the sand hills near the scene of the indian mail robbery and massacre of 1856 wherein the driver and conductor perished and also all the passengers but one it was supposed but this must have been a mistake for at different times afterward on the pacific coast i was personally acquainted with a hundred and thirtythree or four people who were wounded during that massacre and barely escaped with their lives there was no doubt of the truth of iti had it from their own lips  one of these parties told me that he kept coming across arrowheads in his system for nearly seven years after the massacre and another of them told me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after the indians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself he could not restrain his tears for his clothes were completely ruined  the most trustworthy tradition avers however that only one man a person named babbitt survived the massacre and he was desperately wounded  he dragged himself on his hands and knee for one leg was broken to a station several miles away  he did it during portions of two nights lying concealed one day and part of another and for more than forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger thirst and bodily pain  the indians robbed the coach of everything it contained including quite an amount of treasure     chapter ix  we passed fort laramie in the night and on the seventh morning out we found ourselves in the black hills with laramie peak at our elbow apparently looming vast and solitarya deep dark rich indigo blue in hue so portentously did the old colossus frown under his beetling brows of stormcloud  he was thirty or forty miles away in reality but he only seemed removed a little beyond the low ridge at our right  we breakfasted at horseshoe station six hundred and seventysix miles out from st joseph  we had now reached a hostile indian country and during the afternoon we passed laparelle station and enjoyed great discomfort all the time we were in the neighborhood being aware that many of the trees we dashed by at arms length concealed a lurking indian or two during the preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through the ponyriders jacket but he had ridden on just the same because ponyriders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except when killed  as long as they had life enough left in them they had to stick to the horse and ride even if the indians had been waiting for them a week and were entirely out of patience  about two hours and a half before we arrived at laparelle station the keeper in charge of it had fired four times at an indian but he said with an injured air that the indian had skipped around sos to spile everythingand ammunitions blamed skurse too the most natural inference conveyed by his manner of speaking was that in skipping around the indian had taken an unfair advantage  the coach we were in had a neat hole through its fronta reminiscence of its last trip through this region  the bullet that made it wounded the driver slightly but he did not mind it much  he said the place to keep a man huffy was down on the southern overland among the apaches before the company moved the stage line up on the northern route  he said the apaches used to annoy him all the time down there and that he came as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundance because they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he couldnt hold his vittles  this persons statement were not generally believed  we shut the blinds down very tightly that first night in the hostile indian country and lay on our arms  we slept on them some but most of the time we only lay on them  we did not talk much but kept quiet and listened  it was an inkyblack night and occasionally rainy  we were among woods and rocks hills and gorgesso shut in in fact that when we peeped through a chink in a curtain we could discern nothing  the driver and conductor on top were still too or only spoke at long intervals in low tones as is the way of men in the midst of invisible dangers  we listened to raindrops pattering on the roof and the grinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel and the low wailing of the wind and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us inseparable from travel at night in a closecurtained vehicle the sense of remaining perfectly still in one place notwithstanding the jolting and swaying of the vehicle the trampling of the horses and the grinding of the wheels we listened a long time with intent faculties and bated breath every time one of us would relax and draw a long sigh of relief and start to say something a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden hark and instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again  so the tiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away until at last our tense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness and we slept if one might call such a condition by so strong a namefor it was a sleep set with a hairtrigger  it was a sleep seething and teeming with a weird and distressful confusion of shreds and fagends of dreamsa sleep that was a chaos  presently dreams and sleep and the sullen hush of the night were startled by a ringing report and cloven by such a long wild agonizing shriek  then we heardten steps from the stage  help  help  help it was our drivers voice  kill him  kill him like a dog  im being murdered  will no man lend me a pistol  look out head him off head him off  two pistol shots a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feet as if a crowd were closing and surging together around some object several heavy dull blows as with a club a voice that said appealingly dont gentlemen please dontim a dead man then a fainter groan and another blow and away sped the stage into the darkness and left the grisly mystery behind us  what a startle it was  eight seconds would amply cover the time it occupiedmaybe even five would do it  we only had time to plunge at a curtain and unbuckle and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hindering flurry when our whip cracked sharply overhead and we went rumbling and thundering away down a mountain grade  we fed on that mystery the rest of the nightwhat was left of it for it was waning fast  it had to remain a present mystery for all we could get from the conductor in answer to our hails was something that sounded through the clatter of the wheels like tell you in the morning  so we lit our pipes and opened the corner of a curtain for a chimney and lay there in the dark listening to each others story of how he first felt and how many thousand indians he first thought had hurled themselves upon us and what his remembrance of the subsequent sounds was and the order of their occurrence  and we theorized too but there was never a theory that would account for our drivers voice being out there nor yet account for his indian murderers talking such good english if they were indians  so we chatted and smoked the rest of the night comfortably away our boding anxiety being somehow marvelously dissipated by the real presence of something to be anxious about  we never did get much satisfaction about that dark occurrence  all that we could make out of the odds and ends of the information we gathered in the morning was that the disturbance occurred at a station that we changed drivers there and that the driver that got off there had been talking roughly about some of the outlaws that infested the region for there wasnt a man around there but had a price on his head and didnt dare show himself in the settlements the conductor said he had talked roughly about these characters and ought to have drove up there with his pistol cocked and ready on the seat alongside of him and begun business himself because any softy would know they would be laying for him  that was all we could gather and we could see that neither the conductor nor the new driver were much concerned about the matter  they plainly had little respect for a man who would deliver offensive opinions of people and then be so simple as to come into their presence unprepared to back his judgment as they pleasantly phrased the killing of any fellowbeing who did not like said opinions  and likewise they plainly had a contempt for the mans poor discretion in venturing to rouse the wrath of such utterly reckless wild beasts as those outlawsand the conductor added  i tell you its as much as slade himself want to do  this remark created an entire revolution in my curiosity  i cared nothing now about the indians and even lost interest in the murdered driver  there was such magic in that name slade  day or night now i stood always ready to drop any subject in hand to listen to something new about slade and his ghastly exploits  even before we got to overland city we had begun to hear about slade and his division for he was a divisionagent on the overland and from the hour we had left overland city we had heard drivers and conductors talk about only three things californy the nevada silver mines and this desperado slade  and a deal the most of the talk was about slade  we had gradually come to have a realizing sense of the fact that slade was a man whose heart and hands and soul were steeped in the blood of offenders against his dignity a man who awfully avenged all injuries affront insults or slights of whatever kindon the spot if he could years afterward if lack of earlier opportunity compelled it a man whose hate tortured him day and night till vengeance appeased itand not an ordinary vengeance either but his enemys absolute deathnothing less a man whose face would light up with a terrible joy when he surprised a foe and had him at a disadvantage  a high and efficient servant of the overland an outlaw among outlaws and yet their relentless scourge slade was at once the most bloody the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen that inhabited the savage fastnesses of the mountains     chapter x  really and truly two thirds of the talk of drivers and conductors had been about this man slade ever since the day before we reached julesburg  in order that the eastern reader may have a clear conception of what a rocky mountain desperado is in his highest state of development i will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one straightforward narrative and present it in the following shape  slade was born in illinois of good parentage  at about twentysix years of age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country  at st joseph missouri he joined one of the early californiabound emigrant trains and was given the post of trainmaster  one day on the plains he had an angry dispute with one of his wagondrivers and both drew their revolvers  but the driver was the quicker artist and had his weapon cocked first  so slade said it was a pity to waste life on so small a matter and proposed that the pistols be thrown on the ground and the quarrel settled by a fistfight  the unsuspecting driver agreed and threw down his pistolwhereupon slade laughed at his simplicity and shot him dead  he made his escape and lived a wild life for awhile dividing his time between fighting indians and avoiding an illinois sheriff who had been sent to arrest him for his first murder  it is said that in one indian battle he killed three savages with his own hand and afterward cut their ears off and sent them with his compliments to the chief of the tribe  slade soon gained a name for fearless resolution and this was sufficient merit to procure for him the important post of overland divisionagent at julesburg in place of mr jules removed  for some time previously the companys horses had been frequently stolen and the coaches delayed by gangs of outlaws who were wont to laugh at the idea of any mans having the temerity to resent such outrages  slade resented them promptly  the outlaws soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fear anything that breathed the breath of life  he made short work of all offenders  the result was that delays ceased the companys property was let alone and no matter what happened or who suffered slades coaches went through every time  true in order to bring about this wholesome change slade had to kill several mensome say three others say four and others sixbut the world was the richer for their loss  the first prominent difficulty he had was with the exagent jules who bore the reputation of being a reckless and desperate man himself  jules hated slade for supplanting him and a good fair occasion for a fight was all he was waiting for  by and by slade dared to employ a man whom jules had once discharged  next slade seized a team of stagehorses which he accused jules of having driven off and hidden somewhere for his own use war was declared and for a day or two the two men walked warily about the streets seeking each other jules armed with a doublebarreled shot gun and slade with his historycreating revolver  finally as slade stepped into a store jules poured the contents of his gun into him from behind the door  slade was plucky and jules got several bad pistol wounds in return  then both men fell and were carried to their respective lodgings both swearing that better aim should do deadlier work next time  both were bedridden a long time but jules got to his feet first and gathering his possessions together packed them on a couple of mules and fled to the rocky mountains to gather strength in safety against the day of reckoning  for many months he was not seen or heard of and was gradually dropped out of the remembrance of all save slade himself  but slade was not the man to forget him  on the contrary common report said that slade kept a reward standing for his capture dead or alive  after awhile seeing that slades energetic administration had restored peace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road the overland stage company transferred him to the rocky ridge division in the rocky mountains to see if he could perform a like miracle there  it was the very paradise of outlaws and desperadoes  there was absolutely no semblance of law there  violence was the rule  force was the only recognized authority  the commonest misunderstandings were settled on the spot with the revolver or the knife  murders were done in open day and with sparkling frequency and nobody thought of inquiring into them it was considered that the parties who did the killing had their private reasons for it for other people to meddle would have been looked upon as indelicate  after a murder all that rocky mountain etiquette required of a spectator was that he should help the gentleman bury his game otherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him the first time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn in interring him  slade took up his residence sweetly and peacefully in the midst of this hive of horsethieves and assassins and the very first time one of them aired his insolent swaggerings in his presence he shot him dead  he began a raid on the outlaws and in a singularly short space of time he had completely stopped their depredations on the stage stock recovered a large number of stolen horses killed several of the worst desperadoes of the district and gained such a dread ascendancy over the rest that they respected him admired him feared him obeyed him  he wrought the same marvelous change in the ways of the community that had marked his administration at overland city  he captured two men who had stolen overland stock and with his own hands he hanged them  he was supreme judge in his district and he was jury and executioner likewiseand not only in the case of offences against his employers but against passing emigrants as well  on one occasion some emigrants had their stock lost or stolen and told slade who chanced to visit their camp  with a single companion he rode to a ranch the owners of which he suspected and opening the door commenced firing killing three and wounding the fourth  from a bloodthirstily interesting little montana bookthe vigilantes of montana by prof thos j dimsdalei take this paragraph        while on the road slade held absolute sway  he would ride down to       a station get into a quarrel turn the house out of windows and       maltreat the occupants most cruelly  the unfortunates had no means       of redress and were compelled to recuperate as best they could  on one of these occasions it is said he killed the father of the fine little halfbreed boy jemmy whom he adopted and who lived with his widow after his execution  stories of slades hanging men and of innumerable assaults shootings stabbings and beatings in which he was a principal actor form part of the legends of the stage line  as for minor quarrels and shootings it is absolutely certain that a minute history of slades life would be one long record of such practices  slade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver  the legends say that one morning at rocky ridge when he was feeling comfortable he saw a man approaching who had offended him some days beforeobserve the fine memory he had for matters like thatand gentlemen said slade drawing it is a good twentyyard shotill clip the third button on his coat  which he did  the bystanders all admired it  and they all attended the funeral too  on one occasion a man who kept a little whiskyshelf at the station did something which angered sladeand went and made his will  a day or two afterward slade came in and called for some brandy  the man reached under the counter ostensibly to get a bottlepossibly to get something else but slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and satisfied smile of his which the neighbors had long ago learned to recognize as a deathwarrant in disguise and told him to none of thatpass out the highpriced article  so the poor barkeeper had to turn his back and get the highpriced brandy from the shelf and when he faced around again he was looking into the muzzle of slades pistol  and the next instant added my informant impressively he was one of the deadest men that ever lived  the stagedrivers and conductors told us that sometimes slade would leave a hated enemy wholly unmolested unnoticed and unmentioned for weeks togetherhad done it once or twice at any rate  and some said they believed he did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness so that he could get the advantage of them and others said they believed he saved up an enemy that way just as a schoolboy saves up a cake and made the pleasure go as far as it would by gloating over the anticipation one of these cases was that of a frenchman who had offended slade to the surprise of everybody slade did not kill him on the spot but let him alone for a considerable time  finally however he went to the frenchmans house very late one night knocked and when his enemy opened the door shot him deadpushed the corpse inside the door with his foot set the house on fire and burned up the dead man his widow and three children  i heard this story from several different people and they evidently believed what they were saying  it may be true and it may not  give a dog a bad name etc  slade was captured once by a party of men who intended to lynch him they disarmed him and shut him up in a strong loghouse and placed a guard over him  he prevailed on his captors to send for his wife so that he might have a last interview with her  she was a brave loving spirited woman  she jumped on a horse and rode for life and death when she arrived they let her in without searching her and before the door could be closed she whipped out a couple of revolvers and she and her lord marched forth defying the party  and then under a brisk fire they mounted double and galloped away unharmed  in the fulness of time slades myrmidons captured his ancient enemy jules whom they found in a wellchosen hidingplace in the remote fastnesses of the mountains gaining a precarious livelihood with his rifle  they brought him to rocky ridge bound hand and foot and deposited him in the middle of the cattleyard with his back against a post  it is said that the pleasure that lit slades face when he heard of it was something fearful to contemplate  he examined his enemy to see that he was securely tied and then went to bed content to wait till morning before enjoying the luxury of killing him  jules spent the night in the cattleyard and it is a region where warm nights are never known in the morning slade practised on him with his revolver nipping the flesh here and there and occasionally clipping off a finger while jules begged him to kill him outright and put him out of his misery  finally slade reloaded and walking up close to his victim made some characteristic remarks and then dispatched him  the body lay there half a day nobody venturing to touch it without orders and then slade detailed a party and assisted at the burial himself  but he first cut off the dead mans ears and put them in his vest pocket where he carried them for some time with great satisfaction  that is the story as i have frequently heard it told and seen it in print in california newspapers it is doubtless correct in all essential particulars  in due time we rattled up to a stagestation and sat down to breakfast with a halfsavage halfcivilized company of armed and bearded mountaineers ranchmen and station employees  the most gentlemanlyappearing quiet and affable officer we had yet found along the road in the overland companys service was the person who sat at the head of the table at my elbow  never youth stared and shivered as i did when i heard them call him slade  here was romance and i sitting face to face with itlooking upon it touching ithobnobbing with it as it were  here right by my side was the actual ogre who in fights and brawls and various ways had taken the lives of twentysix human beings or all men lied about him  i suppose i was the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange lands and wonderful people  he was so friendly and so gentlespoken that i warmed to him in spite of his awful history  it was hardly possible to realize that this pleasant person was the pitiless scourge of the outlaws the rawheadandbloodybones the nursing mothers of the mountains terrified their children with and to this day i can remember nothing remarkable about slade except that his face was rather broad across the cheek bones and that the cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin and straight  but that was enough to leave something of an effect upon me for since then i seldom see a face possessing those characteristics without fancying that the owner of it is a dangerous man  the coffee ran out  at least it was reduced to one tincupful and slade was about to take it when he saw that my cup was empty  he politely offered to fill it but although i wanted it i politely declined  i was afraid he had not killed anybody that morning and might be needing diversion  but still with firm politeness he insisted on filling my cup and said i had traveled all night and better deserved it than heand while he talked he placidly poured the fluid to the last drop  i thanked him and drank it but it gave me no comfort for i could not feel sure that he would not be sorry presently that he had given it away and proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the loss but nothing of the kind occurred  we left him with only twentysix dead people to account for and i felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thought that in so judiciously taking care of no 1 at that breakfasttable i had pleasantly escaped being no 27  slade came out to the coach and saw us off first ordering certain rearrangements of the mailbags for our comfort and then we took leave of him satisfied that we should hear of him again some day and wondering in what connection     chapter xi  and sure enough two or three years afterward we did hear him again news came to the pacific coast that the vigilance committee in montana whither slade had removed from rocky ridge had hanged him  i find an account of the affair in the thrilling little book i quoted a paragraph from in the last chapterthe vigilantes of montana being a reliable account of the capture trial and execution of henry plummers notorious road agent band by prof thos j dimsdale virginia city mt mr dimsdales chapter is well worth reading as a specimen of how the people of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove inefficient  mr dimsdale makes two remarks about slade both of which are accurately descriptive and one of which is exceedingly picturesque those who saw him in his natural state only would pronounce him to be a kind husband a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman on the contrary those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by a gang of armed roughs would pronounce him a fiend incarnate  and this from fort kearney west he was feared a great deal more than the almighty  for compactness simplicity and vigor of expression i will back that sentence against anything in literature  mr dimsdales narrative is as follows  in all places where italics occur they are mine        after the execution of the five men on the 14th of january the       vigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended  they had       freed the country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent and       they determined that in the absence of the regular civil authority       they would establish a peoples court where all offenders should be       tried by judge and jury  this was the nearest approach to social       order that the circumstances permitted and though strict legal       authority was wanting yet the people were firmly determined to       maintain its efficiency and to enforce its decrees  it may here be       mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal       ladder leading to the scaffold on which slade perished was the       tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of this court followed       by his arrest of the judge alex davis by authority of a presented       derringer and with his own hands        j a slade was himself we have been informed a vigilante he       openly boasted of it and said he knew all that they knew  he was       never accused or even suspected of either murder or robbery       committed in this territory the latter crime was never laid to his       charge in any place but that he had killed several men in other       localities was notorious and his bad reputation in this respect was       a most powerful argument in determining his fate when he was       finally arrested for the offence above mentioned  on returning from       milk river he became more and more addicted to drinking until at       last it was a common feat for him and his friends to take the       town  he and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one       horse galloping through the streets shouting and yelling firing       revolvers etc  on many occasions he would ride his horse into       stores break up bars toss the scales out of doors and use most       insulting language to parties present  just previous to the day of       his arrest he had given a fearful beating to one of his followers       but such was his influence over them that the man wept bitterly at       the gallows and begged for his life with all his power  it had       become quite common when slade was on a spree for the shopkeepers       and citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights being       fearful of some outrage at his hands  for his wanton destruction of       goods and furniture he was always ready to pay when sober if he       had money but there were not a few who regarded payment as small       satisfaction for the outrage and these men were his personal       enemies        from time to time slade received warnings from men that he well knew       would not deceive him of the certain end of his conduct  there was       not a moment for weeks previous to his arrest in which the public       did not expect to hear of some bloody outrage  the dread of his       very name and the presence of the armed band of hangerson who       followed him alone prevented a resistance which must certainly have       ended in the instant murder or mutilation of the opposing party        slade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose       organization we have described and had treated it with respect by       paying one or two fines and promising to pay the rest when he had       money but in the transaction that occurred at this crisis he       forgot even this caution and goaded by passion and the hatred of       restraint he sprang into the embrace of death        slade had been drunk and cutting up all night  he and his       companions had made the town a perfect hell  in the morning j m       fox the sheriff met him arrested him took him into court and       commenced reading a warrant that he had for his arrest by way of       arraignment  he became uncontrollably furious and seizing the       writ he tore it up threw it on the ground and stamped upon it        the clicking of the locks of his companions revolvers was instantly       heard and a crisis was expected  the sheriff did not attempt his       retention but being at least as prudent as he was valiant he       succumbed leaving slade the master of the situation and the       conqueror and ruler of the courts law and lawmakers  this was a       declaration of war and was so accepted  the vigilance committee       now felt that the question of social order and the preponderance of       the lawabiding citizens had then and there to be decided  they       knew the character of slade and they were well aware that they must       submit to his rule without murmur or else that he must be dealt       with in such fashion as would prevent his being able to wreak his       vengeance on the committee who could never have hoped to live in       the territory secure from outrage or death and who could never       leave it without encountering his friend whom his victory would       have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that would have rendered       them reckless of consequences  the day previous he had ridden into       dorriss store and on being requested to leave he drew his       revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him       another saloon he had led his horse into and buying a bottle of       wine he tried to make the animal drink it  this was not considered       an uncommon performance as he had often entered saloons and       commenced firing at the lamps causing a wild stampede        a leading member of the committee met slade and informed him in the       quiet earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is       saying slade get your horse at once and go home or there will       be  to pay  slade started and took a long look with his dark       and piercing eyes at the gentleman  what do you mean  said he       you have no right to ask me what i mean was the quiet reply get       your horse at once and remember what i tell you  after a short       pause he promised to do so and actually got into the saddle but       being still intoxicated he began calling aloud to one after another       of his friends and at last seemed to have forgotten the warning he       had received and became again uproarious shouting the name of a       wellknown courtezan in company with those of two men whom he       considered heads of the committee as a sort of challenge perhaps       however as a simple act of bravado  it seems probable that the       intimation of personal danger he had received had not been forgotten       entirely though fatally for him he took a foolish way of showing       his remembrance of it  he sought out alexander davis the judge of       the court and drawing a cocked derringer he presented it at his       head and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own       safety  as the judge stood perfectly quiet and offered no       resistance to his captor no further outrage followed on this score       previous to this on account of the critical state of affairs the       committee had met and at last resolved to arrest him  his       execution had not been agreed upon and at that time would have       been negatived most assuredly  a messenger rode down to nevada to       inform the leading men of what was on hand as it was desirable to       show that there was a feeling of unanimity on the subject all along       the gulch        the miners turned out almost en masse leaving their work and       forming in solid column about six hundred strong armed to the       teeth they marched up to virginia  the leader of the body well       knew the temper of his men on the subject  he spurred on ahead of       them and hastily calling a meeting of the executive he told them       plainly that the miners meant business and that if they came up       they would not stand in the street to be shot down by slades       friends but that they would take him and hang him  the meeting was       small as the virginia men were loath to act at all  this momentous       announcement of the feeling of the lower town was made to a cluster       of men who were deliberation behind a wagon at the rear of a store       on main street        the committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities  all       the duty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task       before them but they had to decide and that quickly  it was       finally agreed that if the whole body of the miners were of the       opinion that he should be hanged that the committee left it in       their hands to deal with him  off at hot speed rode the leader of       the nevada men to join his command        slade had found out what was intended and the news sobered him       instantly  he went into p s pfouts store where davis was and       apologized for his conduct saying that he would take it all back        the head of the column now wheeled into wallace street and marched       up at quick time  halting in front of the store the executive       officer of the committee stepped forward and arrested slade who was       at once informed of his doom and inquiry was made as to whether he       had any business to settle  several parties spoke to him on the       subject but to all such inquiries he turned a deaf ear being       entirely absorbed in the terrifying reflections on his own awful       position  he never ceased his entreaties for life and to see his       dear wife  the unfortunate lady referred to between whom and slade       there existed a warm affection was at this time living at their       ranch on the madison  she was possessed of considerable personal       attractions tall wellformed of graceful carriage pleasing       manners and was withal an accomplished horsewoman        a messenger from slade rode at full speed to inform her of her       husbands arrest  in an instant she was in the saddle and with all       the energy that love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament       and a strong physique she urged her fleet charger over the twelve       miles of rough and rocky ground that intervened between her and the       object of her passionate devotion        meanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations       for the execution in the valley traversed by the branch  beneath       the site of pfouts and russells stone building there was a corral       the gateposts of which were strong and high  across the top was       laid a beam to which the rope was fastened and a drygoods box       served for the platform  to this place slade was marched       surrounded by a guard composing the best armed and most numerous       force that has ever appeared in montana territory        the doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears prayers and       lamentations that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the       fatal beam  he repeatedly exclaimed my god my god must i die       oh my dear wife        on the return of the fatigue party they encountered some friends of       slade staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee       but who were personally attached to the condemned  on hearing of       his sentence one of them a stouthearted man pulled out his       handkerchief and walked away weeping like a child  slade still       begged to see his wife most piteously and it seemed hard to deny       his request but the bloody consequences that were sure to follow       the inevitable attempt at a rescue that her presence and entreaties       would have certainly incited forbade the granting of his request       several gentlemen were sent for to see him in his last moments one       of whom judge davis made a short address to the people but in       such low tones as to be inaudible save to a few in his immediate       vicinity  one of his friends after exhausting his powers of       entreaty threw off his coat and declared that the prisoner could       not be hanged until he himself was killed  a hundred guns were       instantly leveled at him whereupon he turned and fled but being       brought back he was compelled to resume his coat and to give a       promise of future peaceable demeanor        scarcely a leading man in virginia could be found though numbers of       the citizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made       all lamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution        everything being ready the command was given men do your duty       and the box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet he died       almost instantaneously        the body was cut down and carried to the virginia hotel where in a       darkened room it was scarcely laid out when the unfortunate and       bereaved companion of the deceased arrived at headlong speed to       find that all was over and that she was a widow  her grief and       heartpiercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her       attachment for her lost husband and a considerable period elapsed       before she could regain the command of her excited feelings  there is something about the desperadonature that is wholly unaccountableat least it looks unaccountable  it is this  the true desperado is gifted with splendid courage and yet he will take the most infamous advantage of his enemy armed and free he will stand up before a host and fight until he is shot all to pieces and yet when he is under the gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child  words are cheap and it is easy to call slade a coward all executed men who do not die game are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people and when we read of slade that he had so exhausted himself by tears prayers and lamentations that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal beam the disgraceful word suggests itself in a momentyet in frequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded rocky mountain cutthroats by shooting down their comrades and leaders and never offering to hide or fly slade showed that he was a man of peerless bravery  no coward would dare that  many a notorious coward many a chickenlivered poltroon coarse brutal degraded has made his dying speech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with what looked liked the calmest fortitude and so we are justified in believing from the low intellect of such a creature that it was not moral courage that enabled him to do it  then if moral courage is not the requisite quality what could it have been that this stouthearted slade lackedthis bloody desperate kindlymannered urbane gentleman who never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would kill them whenever or wherever he came across them next  i think it is a conundrum worth investigating     chapter xii  just beyond the breakfaststation we overtook a mormon emigrant train of thirtythree wagons and tramping wearily along and driving their herd of loose cows were dozens of coarseclad and sadlooking men women and children who had walked as they were walking now day after day for eight lingering weeks and in that time had compassed the distance our stage had come in eight days and three hoursseven hundred and ninetyeight miles  they were dusty and uncombed hatless bonnetless and ragged and they did look so tired  after breakfast we bathed in horse creek a previously limpid sparkling streaman appreciated luxury for it was very seldom that our furious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind  we changed horses ten or twelve times in every twentyfour hourschanged mules rathersix mulesand did it nearly every time in four minutes it was lively work  as our coach rattled up to each station six harnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable and in the twinkling of an eye almost the old team was out and the new one in and we off and away again  during the afternoon we passed sweetwater creek independence rock devils gate and the devils gap  the latter were wild specimens of rugged scenery and full of interestwe were in the heart of the rocky mountains now  and we also passed by alkali or soda lake and we woke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the world when the driver said that the mormons often came there from great salt lake city to haul away saleratus  he said that a few days gone by they had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground it was a dry lake to load two wagons and that when they got these two wagonsloads of a drug that cost them nothing to salt lake they could sell it for twentyfive cents a pound  in the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity and one we had been hearing a good deal about for a day or two and were suffering to see this was what might be called a natural icehouse  it was august now and sweltering weather in the daytime yet at one of the stations the men could scape the soil on the hillside under the lee of a range of boulders and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of icehard compactly frozen and clear as crystal  toward dawn we got under way again and presently as we sat with raised curtains enjoying our earlymorning smoke and contemplating the first splendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain peaks flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit as if the invisible creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted with a smile we hove in sight of south pass city  the hotelkeeper the postmaster the blacksmith the mayor the constable the city marshal and the principal citizen and property holder all came out and greeted us cheerily and we gave him good day  he gave us a little indian news and a little rocky mountain news and we gave him some plains information in return  he then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up among the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds  south pass city consisted of four log cabins one if which was unfinished and the gentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten citizens of the place  think of hotelkeeper postmaster blacksmith mayor constable city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into one person and crammed into one skin  bemis said he was a perfect allens revolver of dignities  and he said that if he were to die as postmaster or as blacksmith or as postmaster and blacksmith both the people might stand it but if he were to die all over it would be a frightful loss to the community  two miles beyond south pass city we saw for the first time that mysterious marvel which all western untraveled boys have heard of and fully believe in but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with their own eyes neverthelessbanks of snow in dead summer time  we were now far up toward the sky and knew all the time that we must presently encounter lofty summits clad in the eternal snow which was so common place a matter of mention in books and yet when i did see it glittering in the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was august and that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear it i was full as much amazed as if i never had heard of snow in august before truly seeing is believingand many a man lives a long life through thinking he believes certain universally received and well established things and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by those things once he would discover that he did not really believe them before but only thought he believed them  in a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws of glittering snow clasping them and with here and there in the shade down the mountain side a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger than a ladys pockethandkerchief but being in reality as large as a public square  and now at last we were fairly in the renowned south pass and whirling gayly along high above the common world  we were perched upon the extreme summit of the great range of the rocky mountains toward which we had been climbing patiently climbing ceaselessly climbing for days and nights togetherand about us was gathered a convention of natures kings that stood ten twelve and even thirteen thousand feet highgrand old fellows who would have to stoop to see mount washington in the twilight we were in such an airy elevation above the creeping populations of the earth that now and then when the obstructing crags stood out of the way it seemed that we could look around and abroad and contemplate the whole great globe with its dissolving views of mountains seas and continents stretching away through the mystery of the summer haze  as a general thing the pass was more suggestive of a valley than a suspension bridge in the cloudsbut it strongly suggested the latter at one spot  at that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple domes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a hidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their bases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and look over  these sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes of cloud which shredded away from time to time and drifted off fringed and torn trailing their continents of shadow after them and catching presently on an intercepting peak wrapped it about and brooded there then shredded away again and left the purple peak as they had left the purple domes downy and white with newlaid snow  in passing these monstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the spectators head swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his impulse was to shrink when they came closet  in the one place i speak of one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and canyons leading down down and away to a vague plain with a thread in it which was a road and bunches of feathers in it which were treesa pretty picture sleeping in the sunlightbut with a darkness stealing over it and glooming its features  deeper and deeper under the frown of a coming storm and then while no film or shadow marred the noon brightness of his high perch he could watch the tempest break forth down there and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted rain drive along the canyonsides and hear the thunders peal and crash and roar  we had this spectacle a familiar one to many but to us a novelty  we bowled along cheerily and presently at the very summit though it had been all summit to us and all equally level for half an hour or more we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and sent it in opposite directions  the conductor said that one of those streams which we were looking at was just starting on a journey westward to the gulf of california and the pacific ocean through hundreds and even thousands of miles of desert solitudes  he said that the other was just leaving its home among the snowpeaks on a similar journey eastward and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simple rivulet it would still be plodding its patient way down the mountain sides and canyonbeds and between the banks of the yellowstone and by and by would join the broad missouri and flow through unknown plains and deserts and unvisited wildernesses and add a long and troubled pilgrimage among snags and wrecks and sandbars and enter the mississippi touch the wharves of st louis and still drift on traversing shoals and rocky channels then endless chains of bottomless and ample bends walled with unbroken forests then mysterious byways and secret passages among woody islands then the chained bends again bordered with wide levels of shining sugarcane in place of the sombre forests then by new orleans and still other chains of bendsand finally after two long months of daily and nightly harassment excitement enjoyment adventure and awful peril of parched throats pumps and evaporation pass the gulf and enter into its rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea never to look upon its snowpeaks again or regret them  i freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home and dropped it in the stream  but i put no stamp on it and it was held for postage somewhere  on the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons many tired men and women and many a disgusted sheep and cow  in the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition i recognized john   of all persons in the world to meet on top of the rocky mountains thousands of miles from home he was the last one i should have looked for  we were schoolboys together and warm friends for years but a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had never been renewed  the act of which i speak was this  i had been accustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third story of a building and overlooked the street  one day this editor gave me a watermelon which i made preparations to devour on the spot but chancing to look out of the window i saw john standing directly under it and an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head which i immediately did  i was the loser for it spoiled the melon and john never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted but now met again under these circumstances  we recognized each other simultaneously and hands were grasped as warmly as if no coldness had ever existed between us and no allusion was made to any  all animosities were buried and the simple fact of meeting a familiar face in that isolated spot so far from home was sufficient to make us forget all things but pleasant ones and we parted again with sincere goodbye and god bless you from both  we had been climbing up the long shoulders of the rocky mountains for many tedious hourswe started down them now  and we went spinning away at a round rate too  we left the snowy wind river mountains and uinta mountains behind and sped away always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long ranks of white skeletons of mules and oxenmonuments of the huge emigration of other daysand here and there were upended boards or small piles of stones which the driver said marked the restingplace of more precious remains  it was the loneliest land for a grave  a land given over to the cayote and the ravenwhich is but another name for desolation and utter solitude  on damp murky nights these scattered skeletons gave forth a soft hideous glow like very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague desert  it was because of the phosphorus in the bones  but no scientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted by one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it  at midnight it began to rain and i never saw anything like itindeed i did not even see this for it was too dark  we fastened down the curtains and even caulked them with clothing but the rain streamed in in twenty places nothwithstanding  there was no escape  if one moved his feet out of a stream he brought his body under one and if he moved his body he caught one somewhere else  if he struggled out of the drenched blankets and sat up he was bound to get one down the back of his neck meantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping gullies in it for the driver could not see an inch before his face nor keep the road and the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses still  with the first abatement the conductor turned out with lanterns to look for the road and the first dash he made was into a chasm about fourteen feet deep his lantern following like a meteor  as soon as he touched bottom he sang out frantically  dont come here  to which the driver who was looking over the precipice where he had disappeared replied with an injured air think im a dam fool  the conductor was more than an hour finding the roada matter which showed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking he traced our wheeltracks to the imminent verge of danger in two places  i have always been glad that we were not killed that night i do not know any particular reason but i have always been glad in the morning the tenth day out we crossed green river a fine large limpid streamstuck in it with the water just up to the top of our mailbed and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep bank  but it was nice cool water and besides it could not find any fresh place on us to wet  at the green river station we had breakfasthot biscuits fresh antelope steaks and coffeethe only decent meal we tasted between the united states and great salt lake city and the only one we were ever really thankful for  think of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it to leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a shottower after all these years have gone by  at five pm  we reached fort bridger one hundred and seventeen miles from the south pass and one thousand and twentyfive miles from st joseph  fiftytwo miles further on near the head of echo canyon we met sixty united states soldiers from camp floyd  the day before they had fired upon three hundred or four hundred indians whom they supposed gathered together for no good purpose  in the fight that had ensued four indians were captured and the main body chased four miles but nobody killed  this looked like business  we had a notion to get out and join the sixty soldiers but upon reflecting that there were four hundred of the indians we concluded to go on and join the indians  echo canyon is twenty miles long  it was like a long smooth narrow street with a gradual descending grade and shut in by enormous perpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate four hundred feet high in many places and turreted like mediaeval castles  this was the most faultless piece of road in the mountains and the driver said he would let his team out  he did and if the pacific express trains whiz through there now any faster than we did then in the stagecoach i envy the passengers the exhilaration of it  we fairly seemed to pick up our wheels and flyand the mail matter was lifted up free from everything and held in solution  i am not given to exaggeration and when i say a thing i mean it  however time presses  at four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit of big mountain fifteen miles from salt lake city when all the world was glorified with the setting sun and the most stupendous panorama of mountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight  we looked out upon this sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow  even the overland stagedriver stopped his horses and gazed  half an hour or an hour later we changed horses and took supper with a mormon destroying angel  destroying angels as i understand it are latterday saints who are set apart by the church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious citizens  i had heard a deal about these mormon destroying angels and the dark and bloody deeds they had done and when i entered this ones house i had my shudder all ready  but alas for all our romances he was nothing but a loud profane offensive old blackguard  he was murderous enough possibly to fill the bill of a destroyer but would you have any kind of an angel devoid of dignity  could you abide an angel in an unclean shirt and no suspenders  could you respect an angel with a horselaugh and a swagger like a buccaneer  there were other blackguards presentcomrades of this one  and there was one person that looked like a gentlemanheber c kimballs son tall and well made and thirty years old perhaps  a lot of slatternly women flitted hither and thither in a hurry with coffeepots plates of bread and other appurtenances to supper and these were said to be the wives of the angelor some of them at least  and of course they were for if they had been hired help they would not have let an angel from above storm and swear at them as he did let alone one from the place this one hailed from  this was our first experience of the western peculiar institution and it was not very prepossessing  we did not tarry long to observe it but hurried on to the home of the latterday saints the stronghold of the prophets the capital of the only absolute monarch in americagreat salt lake city  as the night closed in we took sanctuary in the salt lake house and unpacked our baggage     chapter xiii  we had a fine supper of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetablesa great variety and as great abundance  we walked about the streets some afterward and glanced in at shops and stores and there was fascination in surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a mormon this was fairyland to us to all intents and purposesa land of enchantment and goblins and awful mystery  we felt a curiosity to ask every child how many mothers it had and if it could tell them apart and we experienced a thrill every time a dwellinghouse door opened and shut as we passed disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and shouldersfor we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a mormon family in all its comprehensive ampleness disposed in the customary concentric rings of its home circle  by and by the acting governor of the territory introduced us to other gentiles and we spent a sociable hour with them  gentiles are people who are not mormons  our fellowpassenger bemis took care of himself during this part of the evening and did not make an overpowering success of it either for he came into our room in the hotel about eleven oclock full of cheerfulness and talking loosely disjointedly and indiscriminately and every now and then tugging out a ragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it this together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a chair and his vest on the floor on the other side and piling his pants on the floor just in front of the same chair and then comtemplating the general result with superstitious awe and finally pronouncing it too many for him and going to bed with his boots on led us to fear that something he had eaten had not agreed with him  but we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking  it was the exclusively mormon refresher valley tan  valley tan or at least one form of valley tan is a kind of whisky or first cousin to it is of mormon invention and manufactured only in utah  tradition says it is made of imported fire and brimstone  if i remember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom by brigham young and no private drinking permitted among the faithful except they confined themselves to valley tan  next day we strolled about everywhere through the broad straight level streets and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen thousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it and no visible drunkards or noisy people a limpid stream rippling and dancing through every street in place of a filthy gutter block after block of trim dwellings built of frame and sunburned bricka great thriving orchard and garden behind every one of them apparentlybranches from the street stream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit treesand a grand general air of neatness repair thrift and comfort around and about and over the whole  and everywhere were workshops factories and all manner of industries and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen wherever one looked and in ones ears was the ceaseless clink of hammers the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and flywheels  the armorial crest of my own state consisted of two dissolute bears holding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the pertinent remark united we standhicdivided we fall  it was always too figurative for the author of this book  but the mormon crest was easy  and it was simple unostentatious and fitted like a glove it was a representation of a golden beehive with the bees all at work  the city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the state of connecticut and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall of mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds and whose shoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long  seen from one of these dizzy heights twelve or fifteen miles off great salt lake city is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a childs toyvillage reposing under the majestic protection of the chinese wall  on some of those mountains to the southwest it had been raining every day for two weeks but not a drop had fallen in the city  and on hot days in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and growling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious snowstorm going on in the mountains  they could enjoy it at a distance at those seasons every day though no snow would fall in their streets or anywhere near them  salt lake city was healthyan extremely healthy city  they declared there was only one physician in the place and he was arrested every week regularly and held to answer under the vagrant act for having no visible means of support  they always give you a good substantial article of truth in salt lake and good measure and good weight too very often if you wished to weigh one of their airiest little commonplace statements you would want the hay scales  we desired to visit the famous inland sea the american dead sea the great salt lakeseventeen miles horseback from the cityfor we had dreamed about it and thought about it and talked about it and yearned to see it all the first part of our trip but now when it was only arms length away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest  and so we put it off in a sort of general way till next dayand that was the last we ever thought of it  we dined with some hospitable gentiles and visited the foundation of the prodigious temple and talked long with that shrewd connecticut yankee heber c kimball since deceased a saint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce  we saw the tithinghouse and the lion house and i do not know or remember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds and curious names  we flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour and picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining nonsense and went to bed at night satisfied  the second day we made the acquaintance of mr street since deceased and put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king he seemed a quiet kindly easymannered dignified selfpossessed old gentleman of fiftyfive or sixty and had a gentle craft in his eye that probably belonged there  he was very simply dressed and was just taking off a straw hat as we entered  he talked about utah and the indians and nevada and general american matters and questions with our secretary and certain government officials who came with us  but he never paid any attention to me notwithstanding i made several attempts to draw him out on federal politics and his high handed attitude toward congress  i thought some of the things i said were rather fine  but he merely looked around at me at distant intervals something as i have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling with her tail  by and by i subsided into an indignant silence and so sat until the end hot and flushed and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage but he was calm  his conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook  when the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence he put his hand on my head beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother  ahyour child i presume  boy or girl     chapter xiv  mr street was very busy with his telegraphic mattersand considering that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged snowy uninhabited mountains and waterless treeless melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as possible  he could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the roadside either but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those exhausting desertsand it was two days journey from water to water in one or two of them  mr streets contract was a vast work every way one looked at it and yet to comprehend what the vague words eight hundred miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts mean one must go over the ground in personpen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary reality to the reader  and after all mr ss mightiest difficulty turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all unto mormons he had sublet the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make little or nothing and so they tranquilly threw their poles overboard in mountain or desert just as it happened when they took the notion and drove home and went about their customary business  they were under written contract to mr street but they did not care anything for that  they said they would admire to see a gentile force a mormon to fulfil a losing contract in utah  and they made themselves very merry over the matter  street saidfor it was he that told us these things  i was in dismay  i was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a given time and this disaster looked very much like ruin  it was an astounding thing it was such a wholly unlookedfor difficulty that i was entirely nonplussed  i am a business manhave always been a business mando not know anything but businessand so you can imagine how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country where written contracts were worthlessthat main security that sheetanchor that absolute necessity of business  my confidence left me there was no use in making new contractsthat was plain  i talked with first one prominent citizen and then another  they all sympathized with me first rate but they did not know how to help me  but at last a gentile said go to brigham youngthese small fry cannot do you any good  i did not think much of the idea for if the law could not help me what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with either making the laws or executing them  he might be a very good patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle but something sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred refractory halfcivilized subcontractors  but what was a man to do i thought if mr young could not do anything else he might probably be able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two and so i went straight to him and laid the whole case before him  he said very little but he showed strong interest all the way through  he examined all the papers in detail and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch either in the papers or my statement he would go back and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result then he made a list of the contractors names  finally he said  mr street this is all perfectly plain  these contracts are strictly and legally drawn and are duly signed and certified  these men manifestly entered into them with their eyes open  i see no fault or flaw anywhere  then mr young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and said take this list of names to soandso and tell him to have these men here at suchandsuch an hour  they were there to the minute  so was i  mr young asked them a number of questions and their answers made my statement good  then he said to them  you signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own free will and accord  yes  then carry them out to the letter if it makes paupers of you  go  and they did go too  they are strung across the deserts now working like bees  and i never hear a word out of them  there is a batch of governors and judges and other officials here shipped from washington and they maintain the semblance of a republican form of governmentbut the petrified truth is that utah is an absolute monarchy and brigham young is king  mr street was a fine man and i believe his story  i knew him well during several years afterward in san francisco  our stay in salt lake city amounted to only two days and therefore we had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter  i had the will to do it  with the gushing selfsufficiency of youth i was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform hereuntil i saw the mormon women  then i was touched  my heart was wiser than my head  it warmed toward these poor ungainly and pathetically homely creatures and as i turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes i said nothe man that marries one of them has done an act of christian charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind not their harsh censureand the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of openhanded generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered in his presence and worship in silence        for a brief sketch of mormon history and the noted mountain meadow       massacre see appendices a and b      chapter xv  it is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about assassinations of intractable gentiles  i cannot easily conceive of anything more cosy than the night in salt lake which we spent in a gentile den smoking pipes and listening to tales of how burton galloped in among the pleading and defenceless morisites and shot them down men and women like so many dogs  and how bill hickman a destroying angel shot drown and arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt and how porter rockwell did this and that dreadful thing  and how heedless people often come to utah and make remarks about brigham or polygamy or some other sacred matter and the very next morning at daylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley contentedly waiting for the hearse  and the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these gentiles talk about polygamy and how some portly old frog of an elder or a bishop marries a girllikes her marries her sisterlikes her marries another sisterlikes her takes anotherlikes her marries her motherlikes her marries her father grandfather great grandfather and then comes back hungry and asks for more  and how the pert young thing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable grandmother have to rank away down toward d 4 in their mutual husbands esteem and have to sleep in the kitchen as like as not  and how this dreadful sort of thing this hiving together in one foul nest of mother and daughters and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother in rank and authority are things which mormon women submit to because their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth and the more children he rears the higher the place they will all have in the world to comeand the warmer maybe though they do not seem to say anything about that  according to these gentile friends of ours brigham youngs harem contains twenty or thirty wives  they said that some of them had grown old and gone out of active service but were comfortably housed and cared for in the heneryor the lion house as it is strangely named  along with each wife were her childrenfifty altogether  the house was perfectly quiet and orderly when the children were still  they all took their meals in one room and a happy and homelike sight it was pronounced to be  none of our party got an opportunity to take dinner with mr young but a gentile by the name of johnson professed to have enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the lion house  he gave a preposterous account of the calling of the roll and other preliminaries and the carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in  but he embellished rather too much  he said that mr young told him several smart sayings of certain of his twoyearolds observing with some pride that for many years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of the eastern magazines and then he wanted to show mr johnson one of the pets that had said the last good thing but he could not find the child  he searched the faces of the children in detail but could not decide which one it was  finally he gave it up with a sigh and said  i thought i would know the little cub again but i dont  mr johnson said further that mr young observed that life was a sad sad thing because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride  and mr johnson said that while he and mr young were pleasantly conversing in private one of the mrs youngs came in and demanded a breastpin remarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breastpin to no 6 and she for one did not propose to let this partiality go on without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it  mr young reminded her that there was a stranger present  mrs young said that if the state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger he could find room outside  mr young promised the breastpin and she went away  but in a minute or two another mrs young came in and demanded a breastpin  mr young began a remonstrance but mrs young cut him short  she said no 6 had got one and no 11 was promised one and it was no use for him to try to impose on hershe hoped she knew her rights  he gave his promise and she went  and presently three mrs youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of tears abuse and entreaty  they had heard all about no 6 no 11 and no 14  three more breastpins were promised  they were hardly gone when nine more mrs youngs filed into the presence and a new tempest burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest  nine breastpins were promised and the weird sisters filed out again  and in came eleven more weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth  eleven promised breastpins purchased peace once more  that is a specimen said mr young  you see how it is  you see what a life i lead  a man cant be wise all the time  in a heedless moment i gave my darling no 6excuse my calling her thus as her other name has escaped me for the momenta breastpin  it was only worth twentyfive dollarsthat is apparently that was its whole costbut its ultimate cost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more  you yourself have seen it climb up to six hundred and fifty dollarsand alas even that is not the end  for i have wives all over this territory of utah  i have dozens of wives whose numbers even i do not know without looking in the family bible  they are scattered far and wide among the mountains and valleys of my realm  and mark you every solitary one of them will hear of this wretched breast pin and every last one of them will have one or die  no 6s breast pin will cost me twentyfive hundred dollars before i see the end of it  and these creatures will compare these pins together and if one is a shade finer than the rest they will all be thrown on my hands and i will have to order a new lot to keep peace in the family  sir you probably did not know it but all the time you were present with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant servitors of mine  if you had offered to give a child a dime or a stick of candy or any trifle of the kind you would have been snatched out of the house instantly provided it could be done before your gift left your hand  otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an exactly similar gift to all my childrenand knowing by experience the importance of the thing i would have stood by and seen to it myself that you did it and did it thoroughly  once a gentleman gave one of my children a tin whistlea veritable invention of satan sir and one which i have an unspeakable horror of and so would you if you had eighty or ninety children in your house  but the deed was donethe man escaped  i knew what the result was going to be and i thirsted for vengeance  i ordered out a flock of destroying angels and they hunted the man far into the fastnesses of the nevada mountains  but they never caught him  i am not cruel siri am not vindictive except when sorely outragedbut if i had caught him sir so help me joseph smith i would have locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death by the slaughtered body of st parley pratt whom god assail there was never anything on this earth like it  i knew who gave the whistle to the child but i could not make those jealous mothers believe me  they believed i did it and the result was just what any man of reflection could have foreseen i had to order a hundred and ten whistlesi think we had a hundred and ten children in the house then but some of them are off at college nowi had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking things and i wish i may never speak another word if we didnt have to talk on our fingers entirely from that time forth until the children got tired of the whistles  and if ever another man gives a whistle to a child of mine and i get my hands on him i will hang him higher than haman  that is the word with the bark on it  shade of nephi  you dont know anything about married life  i am rich and everybody knows it  i am benevolent and everybody takes advantage of it  i have a strong fatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me  every time a woman wants to do well by her darling she puzzles her brain to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands  why sir a woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of complexion and so had the woman and swore that the child was mine and she my wifethat i had married her at suchandsuch a time in suchandsuch a place but she had forgotten her number and of course i could not remember her name  well sir she called my attention to the fact that the child looked like me and really it did seem to resemble mea common thing in the territoryand to cut the story short i put it in my nursery and she left  and by the ghost of orson hyde when they came to wash the paint off that child it was an injun  bless my soul you dont know anything about married life  it is a perfect dogs life sira perfect dogs life  you cant economize  it isnt possible  i have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all occasions  but it is of no use  first youll marry a combination of calico and consumption thats as thin as a rail and next youll get a creature thats nothing more than the dropsy in disguise and then youve got to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon  that is the way it goes  and think of the washbillexcuse these tearsnine hundred and eightyfour pieces a week  no sir there is no such a thing as economy in a family like mine  why just the one item of cradlesthink of it and vermifuge soothing syrup  teething rings  and papas watches for the babies to play with  and things to scratch the furniture with  and lucifer matches for them to eat and pieces of glass to cut themselves with the item of glass alone would support your family i venture to say sir let me scrimp and squeeze all i can i still cant get ahead as fast as i feel i ought to with my opportunities  bless you sir at a time when i had seventytwo wives in this house i groaned under the pressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventytwo bedsteads when the money ought to have been out at interest and i just sold out the whole stock sir at a sacrifice and built a bedstead seven feet long and ninetysix feet wide  but it was a failure sir  i could not sleep it appeared to me that the whole seventytwo women snored at once the roar was deafening  and then the danger of it  that was what i was looking at  they would all draw in their breath at once and you could actually see the walls of the house suck inand then they would all exhale their breath at once and you could see the walls swell out and strain and hear the rafters crack and the shingles grind together my friend take an old mans advice and dont encumber yourself with a large familymind i tell you dont do it  in a small family and in a small family only you will find that comfort and that peace of mind which are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford us and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth and no acquisition of fame power and greatness can ever compensate us take my word for it ten or eleven wives is all you neednever go over it  some instinct or other made me set this johnson down as being unreliable and yet he was a very entertaining person and i doubt if some of the information he gave us could have been acquired from any other source he was a pleasant contrast to those reticent mormons     chapter xvi  all men have heard of the mormon bible but few except the elect have seen it or at least taken the trouble to read it  i brought away a copy from salt lake  the book is a curiosity to me it is such a pretentious affair and yet so slow so sleepy such an insipid mess of inspiration  it is chloroform in print  if joseph smith composed this book the act was a miraclekeeping awake while he did it was at any rate  if he according to tradition merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriouslyengraved plates of copper which he declares he found under a stone in an outoftheway locality the work of translating was equally a miracle for the same reason  the book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history with the old testament for a model followed by a tedious plagiarism of the new testament  the author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint oldfashioned sound and structure of our king jamess translation of the scriptures and the result is a mongrelhalf modern glibness and half ancient simplicity and gravity  the latter is awkward and constrained the former natural but grotesque by the contrast  whenever he found his speech growing too modernwhich was about every sentence or twohe ladled in a few such scriptural phrases as exceeding sore and it came to pass etc and made things satisfactory again  and it came to pass was his pet  if he had left that out his bible would have been only a pamphlet  the titlepage reads as follows        the book of mormon an account written by the hand of mormon upon       plates taken from the plates of nephi        wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of nephi       and also of the lamanites written to the lamanites who are a       remnant of the house of israel and also to jew and gentile written       by way of commandment and also by the spirit of prophecy and of       revelation  written and sealed up and hid up unto the lord that       they might not be destroyed to come forth by the gift and power of       god unto the interpretation thereof sealed by the hand of moroni       and hid up unto the lord to come forth in due time by the way of       gentile the interpretation thereof by the gift of god  an       abridgment taken from the book of ether also which is a record of       the people of jared who were scattered at the time the lord       confounded the language of the people when they were building a       tower to get to heaven  hid up is good  and so is whereforethough why wherefore  any other word would have answered as wellthoughin truth it would not have sounded so scriptural  next comes        the testimony of three witnesses       be it known unto all nations kindreds tongues and people unto       whom this work shall come that we through the grace of god the       father and our lord jesus christ have seen the plates which       contain this record which is a record of the people of nephi and       also of the lamanites their brethren and also of the people of       jared who came from the tower of which hath been spoken and we       also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of       god for his voice hath declared it unto us wherefore we know of a       surety that the work is true  and we also testify that we have seen       the engravings which are upon the plates and they have been shown       unto us by the power of god and not of man  and we declare with       words of soberness that an angel of god came down from heaven and       he brought and laid before our eyes that we beheld and saw the       plates and the engravings thereon and we know that it is by the       grace of god the father and our lord jesus christ that we beheld       and bear record that these things are true and it is marvellous in       our eyes nevertheless the voice of the lord commanded us that we       should bear record of it wherefore to be obedient unto the       commandments of god we bear testimony of these things  and we know       that if we are faithful in christ we shall rid our garments of the       blood of all men and be found spotless before the judgmentseat of       christ and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens  and the       honor be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost which       is one god  amen                           oliver cowdery                           david whitmer                           martin harris  some people have to have a world of evidence before they can come anywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything but for me when a man tells me that he has seen the engravings which are upon the plates and not only that but an angel was there at the time and saw him see them and probably took his receipt for it i am very far on the road to conviction no matter whether i ever heard of that man before or not and even if i do not know the name of the angel or his nationality either  next is this        and also the testimony of eight witnesses       be it known unto all nations kindreds tongues and people unto       whom this work shall come that joseph smith jr the translator of       this work has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken       which have the appearance of gold and as many of the leaves as the       said smith has translated we did handle with our hands and we also       saw the engravings thereon all of which has the appearance of       ancient work and of curious workmanship  and this we bear record       with words of soberness that the said smith has shown unto us for       we have seen and hefted and know of a surety that the said smith       has got the plates of which we have spoken  and we give our names       unto the world to witness unto the world that which we have seen       and we lie not god bearing witness of it                           christian whitmer                           jacob whitmer                           peter whitmer jr                           john whitmer                           hiram page                           joseph smith sr                           hyrum smith                           samuel h  smith  and when i am far on the road to conviction and eight men be they grammatical or otherwise come forward and tell me that they have seen the plates too and not only seen those plates but hefted them i am convinced  i could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire whitmer family had testified  the mormon bible consists of fifteen booksbeing the books of jacob enos jarom omni mosiah zeniff alma helaman ether moroni two books of mormon and three of nephi  in the first book of nephi is a plagiarism of the old testament which gives an account of the exodus from jerusalem of the children of lehi and it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness during eight years and their supernatural protection by one of their number a party by the name of nephi  they finally reached the land of bountiful and camped by the sea  after they had remained there for the space of many dayswhich is more scriptural than definitenephi was commanded from on high to build a ship wherein to carry the people across the waters  he travestied noahs arkbut he obeyed orders in the matter of the plan  he finished the ship in a single day while his brethren stood by and made fun of itand of him toosaying our brother is a fool for he thinketh that he can build a ship  they did not wait for the timbers to dry but the whole tribe or nation sailed the next day  then a bit of genuine nature cropped out and is revealed by outspoken nephi with scriptural franknessthey all got on a spree they and also their wives began to make themselves merry insomuch that they began to dance and to sing and to speak with much rudeness yea they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness  nephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings but they tied him neck and heels and went on with their lark  but observe how nephi the prophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers        and it came to pass that after they had bound me insomuch that i       could not move the compass which had been prepared of the lord       did cease to work wherefore they knew not whither they should       steer the ship insomuch that there arose a great storm yea a       great and terrible tempest and we were driven back upon the waters       for the space of three days and they began to be frightened       exceedingly lest they should be drowned in the sea nevertheless       they did not loose me  and on the fourth day which we had been       driven back the tempest began to be exceeding sore  and it came to       pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea  then they untied him        and it came to pass after they had loosed me behold i took the       compass and it did work whither i desired it  and it came to pass       that i prayed unto the lord and after i had prayed the winds did       cease and the storm did cease and there was a great calm  equipped with their compass these ancients appear to have had the advantage of noah  their voyage was toward a promised landthe only name they give it they reached it in safety  polygamy is a recent feature in the mormon religion and was added by brigham young after joseph smiths death  before that it was regarded as an abomination  this verse from the mormon bible occurs in chapter ii of the book of jacob        for behold thus saith the lord this people begin to wax in       iniquity they understand not the scriptures for they seek to       excuse themselves in committing whoredoms because of the things       which were written concerning david and solomon his son  behold       david and solomon truly had many wives and concubines which thing       was abominable before me saith the lord wherefore thus saith the       lord i have led this people forth out of the land of jerusalem by       the power of mine arm that i might raise up unto me a righteous       branch from the fruit of the loins of joseph  wherefore i the lord       god will no suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old  however the project failedor at least the modern mormon end of itfor brigham suffers it  this verse is from the same chapter        behold the lamanites your brethren whom ye hate because of their       filthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins are       more righteous than you for they have not forgotten the commandment       of the lord which was given unto our fathers that they should       have save it were one wife and concubines they should have none  the following verse from chapter ix of the book of nephi appears to contain information not familiar to everybody        and now it came to pass that when jesus had ascended into heaven       the multitude did disperse and every man did take his wife and his       children and did return to his own home        and it came to pass that on the morrow when the multitude was       gathered together behold nephi and his brother whom he had raised       from the dead whose name was timothy and also his son whose name       was jonas and also mathoni and mathonihah his brother and kumen       and kumenenhi and jeremiah and shemnon and jonas and zedekiah       and isaiah now these were the names of the disciples whom jesus had       chosen  in order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and picturesqueness as seen by these mormon twelve accompanied on of the tenderest episodes in the life of our saviour than other eyes seem to have been aware of i quote the following from the same booknephi        and it came to pass that jesus spake unto them and bade them arise       and they arose from the earth and he said unto them blessed are ye       because of your faith  and now behold my joy is full  and when he       had said these words he wept and the multitude bear record of it       and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and       prayed unto the father for them  and when he had done this he wept       again and he spake unto the multitude and saith unto them behold       your little ones  and as they looked to behold they cast their       eyes toward heaven and they saw the heavens open and they saw       angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire       and they came down and encircled those little ones about and they       were encircled about with fire and the angels did minister unto       them and the multitude did see and hear and bear record and they       know that their record is true for they all of them did see and       hear every man for himself and they were in number about two       thousand and five hundred souls and they did consist of men women       and children  and what else would they be likely to consist of  the book of ether is an incomprehensible medley of if history much of it relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has possibly never heard of and who inhabited a country which is not set down in the geography  these was a king with the remarkable name of coriantumr and he warred with shared and lib and shiz and others in the plains of heshlon and the valley of gilgal and the wilderness of akish and the land of moran and the plains of agosh and ogath and ramah and the land of corihor and the hill comnor by the waters of ripliancum etc etc etc  and it came to pass after a deal of fighting that coriantumr upon making calculation of his losses found that there had been slain two millions of mighty men and also their wives and their childrensay 5000000 or 6000000 in alland he began to sorrow in his heart  unquestionably it was time  so he wrote to shiz asking a cessation of hostilities and offering to give up his kingdom to save his people  shiz declined except upon condition that coriantumr would come and let him cut his head off firsta thing which coriantumr would not do  then there was more fighting for a season then four years were devoted to gathering the forces for a final struggleafter which ensued a battle which i take it is the most remarkable set forth in historyexcept perhaps that of the kilkenny cats which it resembles in some respects  this is the account of the gathering and the battle        7  and it came to pass that they did gather together all the       people upon all the face of the land who had not been slain save       it was ether  and it came to pass that ether did behold all the       doings of the people and he beheld that the people who were for       coriantumr were gathered together to the army of coriantumr and       the people who were for shiz were gathered together to the army of       shiz wherefore they were for the space of four years gathering       together the people that they might get all who were upon the face       of the land and that they might receive all the strength which it       was possible that they could receive  and it came to pass that when       they were all gathered together every one to the army which he       would with their wives and their children both men women and       children being armed with weapons of war having shields and       breastplates and headplates and being clothed after the manner       of war they did march forth one against another to battle and       they fought all that day and conquered not  and it came to pass       that when it was night they were weary and retired to their camps       and after they had retired to their camps they took up a howling       and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people and so       great were their cries their howlings and lamentations that it did       rend the air exceedingly  and it came to pass that on the morrow       they did go again to battle and great and terrible was that day       nevertheless they conquered not and when the night came again they       did rend the air with their cries and their howlings and their       mournings for the loss of the slain of their people        8  and it came to pass that coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto       shiz desiring that he would not come again to battle but that he       would take the kingdom and spare the lives of the people  but       behold the spirit of the lord had ceased striving with them and       satan had full power over the hearts of the people for they were       given up unto the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of       their minds that they might be destroyed wherefore they went again       to battle  and it came to pass that they fought all that day and       when the night came they slept upon their swords and on the morrow       they fought even until the night came and when the night came they       were drunken with anger even as a man who is drunken with wine and       they slept again upon their swords and on the morrow they fought       again and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save       it were fifty and two of the people of coriantumr and sixty and       nine of the people of shiz  and it came to pass that they slept       upon their swords that night and on the morrow they fought again       and they contended in their mights with their swords and with their       shields all that day and when the night came there were thirty and       two of the people of shiz and twenty and seven of the people of       coriantumr        9  and it came to pass that they ate and slept and prepared for       death on the morrow  and they were large and mighty men as to the       strength of men  and it came to pass that they fought for the space       of three hours and they fainted with the loss of blood  and it       came to pass that when the men of coriantumr had received sufficient       strength that they could walk they were about to flee for their       lives but behold shiz arose and also his men and he swore in his       wrath that he would slay coriantumr or he would perish by the       sword wherefore he did pursue them and on the morrow he did       overtake them and they fought again with the sword  and it came to       pass that when they had all fallen by the sword save it were       coriantumr and shiz behold shiz had fainted with loss of blood       and it came to pass that when coriantumr had leaned upon his sword       that he rested a little he smote off the head of shiz  and it came       to pass that after he had smote off the head of shiz that shiz       raised upon his hands and fell and after that he had struggled for       breath he died  and it came to pass that coriantumr fell to the       earth and became as if he had no life  and the lord spake unto       ether and said unto him go forth  and he went forth and beheld       that the words of the lord had all been fulfilled and he finished       his record and the hundredth part i have not written  it seems a pity he did not finish for after all his dreary former chapters of commonplace he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming interesting  the mormon bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read but there is nothing vicious in its teachings  its code of morals is unobjectionable it is smouched milton from the new testament and no credit given     chapter xvii  at the end of our two days sojourn we left great salt lake city hearty and well fed and happyphysically superb but not so very much wiser as regards the mormon question than we were when we arrived perhaps we had a deal more information than we had before of course but we did not know what portion of it was reliable and what was notfor it all came from acquaintances of a daystrangers strictly speaking  we were told for instance that the dreadful mountain meadows massacre was the work of the indians entirely and that the gentiles had meanly tried to fasten it upon the mormons we were told likewise that the indians were to blame partly and partly the mormons and we were told likewise and just as positively that the mormons were almost if not wholly and completely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless butchery we got the story in all these different shapes but it was not till several years afterward that mrs waites book the mormon prophet came out with judge cradlebaughs trial of the accused parties in it and revealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that the mormons were the assassins  all our information had three sides to it and so i gave up the idea that i could settle the mormon question in two days  still i have seen newspaper correspondents do it in one  i left great salt lake a good deal confused as to what state of things existed thereand sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a state of things existed there at all or not  but presently i remembered with a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three trivial things there which we could be certain of and so the two days were not wholly lost  for instance we had learned that we were at last in a pioneer land in absolute and tangible reality  the high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and bewildering distances of freightage  in the east in those days the smallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the smallest purchasable quantity of any commodity  west of cincinnati the smallest coin in use was the silver fivecent piece and no smaller quantity of an article could be bought than five cents worth  in overland city the lowest coin appeared to be the tencent piece but in salt lake there did not seem to be any money in circulation smaller than a quarter or any smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twentyfive cents worth  we had always been used to half dimes and five cents worth as the minimum of financial negotiations but in salt lake if one wanted a cigar it was a quarter if he wanted a chalk pipe it was a quarter if he wanted a peach or a candle or a newspaper or a shave or a little gentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him from having the toothache twentyfive cents was the price every time when we looked at the shotbag of silver now and then we seemed to be wasting our substance in riotous living but if we referred to the expense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the kind  but people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices and fond and vain of bothit is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon ones toleration  after a months acquaintance with the twentyfive cent minimum the average human being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable fivecent days  how sunburnt with blushes i used to get in gaudy nevada every time i thought of my first financial experience in salt lake it was on this wise which is a favorite expression of great authors and a very neat one too but i never hear anybody say on this wise when they are talking  a young halfbreed with a complexion like a yellowjacket asked me if i would have my boots blacked  it was at the salt lake house the morning after we arrived  i said yes and he blacked them  then i handed him a silver fivecent piece with the benevolent air of a person who is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty and suffering  the yellowjacket took it with what i judged to be suppressed emotion and laid it reverently down in the middle of his broad hand  then he began to contemplate it much as a philosopher contemplates a gnats ear in the ample field of his microscope  several mountaineers teamsters stagedrivers etc drew near and dropped into the tableau and fell to surveying the money with that attractive indifference to formality which is noticeable in the hardy pioneer  presently the yellowjacket handed the half dime back to me and told me i ought to keep my money in my pocketbook instead of in my soul and then i wouldnt get it cramped and shriveled up so  what a roar of vulgar laughter there was  i destroyed the mongrel reptile on the spot but i smiled and smiled all the time i was detaching his scalp for the remark he made was good for an injun  yes we had learned in salt lake to be charged great prices without letting the inward shudder appear on the surfacefor even already we had overheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers conductors and hostlers and finally among citizens of salt lake until we were well aware that these superior beings despised emigrants  we permitted no telltale shudders and winces in our countenances for we wanted to seem pioneers or mormons halfbreeds teamsters stagedrivers mountain meadow assassinsanything in the world that the plains and utah respected and admiredbut we were wretchedly ashamed of being emigrants and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not swear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way  and many a time in nevada afterwards we had occasion to remember with humiliation that we were emigrants and consequently a low and inferior sort of creatures  perhaps the reader has visited utah nevada or california even in these latter days and while communing with himself upon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he considers the world has had his wings clipped by finding that he is the one to be pitied and that there are entire populations around him ready and willing to do it for himyea who are complacently doing it for him already wherever he steps his foot  poor thing they are making fun of his hat and the cut of his new york coat and his conscientiousness about his grammar and his feeble profanity and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores shafts tunnels and other things which he never saw before and never felt enough interest in to read about  and all the time that he is thinking what a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country that lonely land the citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting compassion because he is an emigrant instead of that proudest and blessedest creature that exists on all the earth a fortyniner  the accustomed coach life began again now and by midnight it almost seemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks at all  we had made one alteration however  we had provided enough bread boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred miles of staging we had still to do  and it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate the majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and eat ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled alternately in rainbows thunderstorms and peerless sunsets  nothing helps scenery like ham and eggs  ham and eggs and after these a pipean old rank delicious pipeham and eggs and scenery a down grade a flying coach a fragrant pipe and a contented heartthese make happiness  it is what all the ages have struggled for     chapter xviii  at eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been the important military station of camp floyd some fortyfive or fifty miles from salt lake city  at four pm  we had doubled our distance and were ninety or a hundred miles from salt lake  and now we entered upon one of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the diffused and diluted horrors of saharaan alkali desert  for sixtyeight miles there was but one break in it  i do not remember that this was really a break indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a watering depot in the midst of the stretch of sixtyeight miles  if my memory serves me there was no well or spring at this place but the water was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the desert  there was a stage station there  it was fortyfive miles from the beginning of the desert and twentythree from the end of it  we plowed and dragged and groped along the whole livelong night and at the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the fortyfivemile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the imported water was  the sun was just rising  it was easy enough to cross a desert in the night while we were asleep and it was pleasant to reflect in the morning that we in actual person had encountered an absolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence of the ignorant thenceforward  and it was pleasant also to reflect that this was not an obscure back country desert but a very celebrated one the metropolis itself as you may say  all this was very well and very comfortable and satisfactorybut now we were to cross a desert in daylight  this was finenovelromanticdramatically adventurous this indeed was worth living for worth traveling for  we would write home all about it  this enthusiasm this stern thirst for adventure wilted under the sultry august sun and did not last above one hour  one poor little hourand then we were ashamed that we had gushed so  the poetry was all in the anticipationthere is none in the reality  imagine a vast waveless ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes imagine this solemn waste tufted with ashdusted sagebushes imagine the lifeless silence and solitude that belong to such a place imagine a coach creeping like a bug through the midst of this shoreless level and sending up tumbled volumes of dust as if it were a bug that went by steam imagine this aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour and the shore still as far away as ever apparently imagine team driver coach and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color imagine ashdrifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes  this is the reality of it  the sun beats down with dead blistering relentless malignity the perspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast but scarcely a sign of it finds its way to the surfaceit is absorbed before it gets there there is not the faintest breath of air stirring there is not a merciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament there is not a living creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand there is not a soundnot a sighnot a whispernot a buzz or a whir of wings or distant pipe of birdnot even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless people that dead air  and so the occasional sneezing of the resting mules and the champing of the bits grate harshly on the grim stillness not dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one feel more lonesome and forsaken than before  the mules under violent swearing coaxing and whipcracking would make at stated intervals a spurt and drag the coach a hundred or may be two hundred yards stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back enveloping the vehicle to the wheeltops or higher and making it seem afloat in a fog  then a rest followed with the usual sneezing and bitchamping  then another spurt of a hundred yards and another rest at the end of it  all day long we kept this up without water for the mules and without ever changing the team  at least we kept it up ten hours which i take it is a day and a pretty honest one in an alkali desert it was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon  and it was so hot and so close and our water canteens went dry in the middle of the day and we got so thirsty  it was so stupid and tiresome and dull and the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel deliberation  it was so trying to give ones watch a good long undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling away the time and not trying to get ahead any  the alkali dust cut through our lips it persecuted our eyes it ate through the delicate membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleedingand truly and seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared and left the desert trip nothing but a harsh realitya thirsty sweltering longing hateful reality  two miles and a quarter an hour for ten hoursthat was what we accomplished  it was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a snailpace as that when we had been used to making eight and ten miles an hour  when we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert we were glad for the first time that the dictionary was along because we never could have found language to tell how glad we were in any sort of dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it  but there could not have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language sufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twentythree mile pull  to try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were would be to gild refined gold or paint the lily  somehow now that it is there the quotation does not seem to fitbut no matter let it stay anyhow  i think it is a graceful and attractive thing and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where it would fit but could not succeed  these efforts have kept my mind distracted and ill at ease and made my narrative seem broken and disjointed in places  under these circumstances it seems to me best to leave it in as above since this will afford at least a temporary respite from the wear and tear of trying to lead up to this really apt and beautiful quotation     chapter xix  on the morning of the sixteenth day out from st joseph we arrived at the entrance of rocky canyon two hundred and fifty miles from salt lake it was along in this wild country somewhere and far from any habitation of white men except the stage stations that we came across the wretchedest type of mankind i have ever seen up to this writing  i refer to the goshoot indians  from what we could see and all we could learn they are very considerably inferior to even the despised digger indians of california inferior to all races of savages on our continent inferior to even the terra del fuegans inferior to the hottentots and actually inferior in some respects to the kytches of africa  indeed i have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of woods uncivilized races of men clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to take rank with the goshoots  i find but one people fairly open to that shameful verdict  it is the bosjesmans bushmen of south africa  such of the goshoots as we saw along the road and hanging about the stations were small lean scrawny creatures in complexion a dull black like the ordinary american negro their faces and hands bearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months years and even generations according to the age of the proprietor a silent sneaking treacherous looking race taking note of everything covertly like all the other noble red men that we do not read about and betraying no sign in their countenances indolent everlastingly patient and tireless like all other indians prideless beggarsfor if the beggar instinct were left out of an indian he would not go any more than a clock without a pendulum hungry always hungry and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat though often eating what a hog would decline hunters but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat jackass rabbits  crickets and grasshoppers and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes savages who when asked if they have the common indian belief in a great spirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion thinking whiskey is referred to a thin scattering race of almost naked black children these goshoots are who produce nothing at all and have no villages and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal communitiesa people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep off a portion of the snow and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky wintry repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit  the bushmen and our goshoots are manifestly descended from the selfsame gorilla or kangaroo or norway rat whichever animaladam the darwinians trace them to  one would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the goshoots and yet they used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months and then come some dark night when no mischief was expected and burn down the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out and once in the night they attacked the stagecoach when a district judge of nevada territory was the only passenger and with their first volley of arrows and a bullet or two they riddled the stage curtains wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver  the latter was full of pluck and so was his passenger  at the drivers call judge mott swung himself out clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team and away they plunged through the racing mob of skeletons and under a hurtling storm of missiles  the stricken driver had sunk down on the boot as soon as he was wounded but had held on to the reins and said he would manage to keep hold of them until relieved  and after they were taken from his relaxing grasp he lay with his head between judge motts feet and tranquilly gave directions about the road he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and left behind and that if he managed that the main difficulty would be at an end and then if the judge drove so and so giving directions about bad places in the road and general course he would reach the next station without trouble  the judge distanced the enemy and at last rattled up to the station and knew that the nights perils were done but there was no comradeinarms for him to rejoice with for the soldierly driver was dead  let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the overland drivers now  the disgust which the goshoots gave me a disciple of cooper and a worshipper of the red maneven of the scholarly savages in the last of the mohicans who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen who divide each sentence into two equal parts one part critically grammatical refined and choice of language and the other part just such an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer as a broadway clerk might make after eating an edition of emerson bennetts works and studying frontier life at the bowery theatre a couple of weeksi say that the nausea which the goshoots gave me an indian worshipper set me to examining authorities to see if perchance i had been overestimating the red man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance the revelations that came were disenchanting  it was curious to see how quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous filthy and repulsiveand how quickly the evidences accumulated that wherever one finds an indian tribe he has only found goshoots more or less modified by circumstances and surroundingsbut goshoots after all they deserve pity poor creatures and they can have mineat this distance  nearer by they never get anybodys  there is an impression abroad that the baltimore and washington railroad company and many of its employees are goshoots but it is an error there is only a plausible resemblance which while it is apt enough to mislead the ignorant cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both tribes  but seriously it was not only poor wit but very wrong to start the report referred to above for however innocent the motive may have been the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who have a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the rocky mountains heaven knows  if we cannot find it in our hearts to give those poor naked creatures our christian sympathy and compassion in gods name let us at least not throw mud at them     chapter xx  on the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet seen and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon its heels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless  on the eighteenth day we encountered the eastwardbound telegraphconstructors at reese river station and sent a message to his excellency gov nye at carson city distant one hundred and fiftysix miles  on the nineteenth day we crossed the great american desertforty memorable miles of bottomless sand into which the coach wheels sunk from six inches to a foot  we worked our passage most of the way across that is to say we got out and walked  it was a dreary pull and a long and thirsty one for we had no water  from one extremity of this desert to the other the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the forty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step  the desert was one prodigious graveyard  and the logchains wagon tyres and rotting wrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones  i think we saw logchains enough rusting there in the desert to reach across any state in the union  do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the fearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to california endured  at the border of the desert lies carson lake or the sink of the carson a shallow melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred miles in circumference  carson river empties into it and is lostsinks mysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun againfor the lake has no outlet whatever  there are several rivers in nevada and they all have this mysterious fate  they end in various lakes or sinks and that is the last of them  carson lake humboldt lake walker lake mono lake are all great sheets of water without any visible outlet  water is always flowing into them none is ever seen to flow out of them and yet they remain always level full neither receding nor overflowing  what they do with their surplus is only known to the creator  on the western verge of the desert we halted a moment at ragtown  it consisted of one log house and is not set down on the map  this reminds me of a circumstance  just after we left julesburg on the platte i was sitting with the driver and he said  i can tell you a most laughable thing indeed if you would like to listen to it  horace greeley went over this road once  when he was leaving carson city he told the driver hank monk that he had an engagement to lecture at placerville and was very anxious to go through quick  hank monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace the coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of horaces coat and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage and then he yelled at hank monk and begged him to go easiersaid he warnt in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago but hank monk said keep your seat horace and ill get you there on timeand you bet you he did too what was left of him  a day or two after that we picked up a denver man at the cross roads and he told us a good deal about the country and the gregory diggings he seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the affairs of colorado  by and by he remarked  i can tell you a most laughable thing indeed if you would like to listen to it  horace greeley went over this road once  when he was leaving carson city he told the driver hank monk that he had an engagement to lecture at placerville and was very anxious to go through quick  hank monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace  the coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of horaces coat and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage and then he yelled at hank monk and begged him to go easiersaid he warnt in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago but hank monk said keep your seat horace and ill get you there on timeand you bet you he did too what was left of him  at fort bridger some days after this we took on board a cavalry sergeant a very proper and soldierly person indeed  from no other man during the whole journey did we gather such a store of concise and wellarranged military information  it was surprising to find in the desolate wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with everything useful to know in his line of life and yet of such inferior rank and unpretentious bearing  for as much as three hours we listened to him with unabated interest  finally he got upon the subject of transcontinental travel and presently said  i can tell you a very laughable thing indeed if you would like to listen to it  horace greeley went over this road once  when he was leaving carson city he told the driver hank monk that he had an engagement to lecture at placerville and was very anxious to go through quick  hank monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace  the coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of horaces coat and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage and then he yelled at hank monk and begged him to go easiersaid he warnt in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago but hank monk said keep your seat horace and ill get you there on timeand you bet you he did too what was left of him  when we were eight hours out from salt lake city a mormon preacher got in with us at a way stationa gentle softspoken kindly man and one whom any stranger would warm to at first sight  i can never forget the pathos that was in his voice as he told in simple language the story of his peoples wanderings and unpitied sufferings  no pulpit eloquence was ever so moving and so beautiful as this outcasts picture of the first mormon pilgrimage across the plains struggling sorrowfully onward to the land of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves and watering it with tears  his words so wrought upon us that it was a relief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful channel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came under treatment  one matter after another was pleasantly discussed and at length the stranger said  i can tell you a most laughable thing indeed if you would like to listen to it  horace greeley went over this road once  when he was leaving carson city he told the driver hank monk that he had an engagement to lecture in placerville and was very anxious to go through quick  hank monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace  the coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of horaces coat and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage and then he yelled at hank monk and begged him to go easiersaid he warnt in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago but hank monk said keep your seat horace and ill get you there on timeand you bet you bet you he did too what was left of him  ten miles out of ragtown we found a poor wanderer who had lain down to die  he had walked as long as he could but his limbs had failed him at last  hunger and fatigue had conquered him  it would have been inhuman to leave him there  we paid his fare to carson and lifted him into the coach  it was some little time before he showed any very decided signs of life but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips we finally brought him to a languid consciousness  then we fed him a little and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a grateful light softened his eye  we made his mailsack bed as comfortable as possible and constructed a pillow for him with our coats he seemed very thankful  then he looked up in our faces and said in a feeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it  gentlemen i know not who you are but you have saved my life and although i can never be able to repay you for it i feel that i can at least make one hour of your long journey lighter  i take it you are strangers to this great thorough fare but i am entirely familiar with it  in this connection i can tell you a most laughable thing indeed if you would like to listen to it  horace greeley  i said impressively  suffering stranger proceed at your peril  you see in me the melancholy wreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood  what has brought me to this  that thing which you are about to tell  gradually but surely that tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength undermined my constitution withered my life  pity my helplessness  spare me only just this once and tell me about young george washington and his little hatchet for a change  we were saved  but not so the invalid  in trying to retain the anecdote in his system he strained himself and died in our arms  i am aware now that i ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen of all that region what i asked of that mere shadow of a man for after seven years residence on the pacific coast i know that no passenger or driver on the overland ever corked that anecdote in when a stranger was by and survived  within a period of six years i crossed and recrossed the sierras between nevada and california thirteen times by stage and listened to that deathless incident four hundred and eightyone or eightytwo times  i have the list somewhere  drivers always told it conductors told it landlords told it chance passengers told it the very chinamen and vagrant indians recounted it  i have had the same driver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon  it has come to me in all the multitude of tongues that babel bequeathed to earth and flavored with whiskey brandy beer cologne sozodont tobacco garlic onions grasshopperseverything that has a fragrance to it through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the sons of men  i never have smelt any anecdote as often as i have smelt that one never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that one  and you never could learn to know it by its smell because every time you thought you had learned the smell of it it would turn up with a different smell  bayard taylor has written about this hoary anecdote richardson has published it so have jones smith johnson ross browne and every other correspondenceinditing being that ever set his foot upon the great overland road anywhere between julesburg and san francisco and i have heard that it is in the talmud  i have seen it in print in nine different foreign languages i have been told that it is employed in the inquisition in rome and i now learn with regret that it is going to be set to music  i do not think that such things are right  stagecoaching on the overland is no more and stage drivers are a race defunct  i wonder if they bequeathed that baldheaded anecdote to their successors the railroad brakemen and conductors and if these latter still persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes as did many a tourist of other days that the real grandeurs of the pacific coast are not yo semite and the big trees but hank monk and his adventure with horace greeley  and what makes that worn anecdote the more aggravating is that the adventure it celebrates never occurred if it were a good anecdote that seeming demerit would be its chiefest virtue for creative power belongs to greatness but what ought to be done to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this  if i were to suggest what ought to be done to him i should be called extravagantbut what does the sixteenth chapter of daniel say  aha     chapter xxi  we were approaching the end of our long journey  it was the morning of the twentieth day  at noon we would reach carson city the capital of nevada territory  we were not glad but sorry  it had been a fine pleasure trip we had fed fat on wonders every day we were now well accustomed to stage life and very fond of it so the idea of coming to a standstill and settling down to a humdrum existence in a village was not agreeable but on the contrary depressing  visibly our new home was a desert walled in by barren snowclad mountains  there was not a tree in sight  there was no vegetation but the endless sagebrush and greasewood  all nature was gray with it  we were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning house  we were coated with it like millers so were the coach the mules the mailbags the driverwe and the sagebrush and the other scenery were all one monotonous color  long trains of freight wagons in the distance envelope in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on fire  these teams and their masters were the only life we saw otherwise we moved in the midst of solitude silence and desolation every twenty steps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen with its dustcoated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs frequently a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated the passing coach with meditative serenity  by and by carson city was pointed out to us  it nestled in the edge of a great plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an assemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of mountains overlooking it whose summits seemed lifted clear out of companionship and consciousness of earthly things  we arrived disembarked and the stage went on  it was a wooden town its population two thousand souls  the main street consisted of four or five blocks of little white frame stores which were too high to sit down on but not too high for various other purposes in fact hardly high enough  they were packed close together side by side as if room were scarce in that mighty plain  the sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and inclined to rattle when walked upon  in the middle of the town opposite the stores was the plaza which is native to all towns beyond the rocky mountains a large unfenced level vacancy with a liberty pole in it and very useful as a place for public auctions horse trades and mass meetings and likewise for teamsters to camp in  two other sides of the plaza were faced by stores offices and stables  the rest of carson city was pretty scattering  we were introduced to several citizens at the stageoffice and on the way up to the governors from the hotelamong others to a mr harris who was on horseback he began to say something but interrupted himself with the remark  ill have to get you to excuse me a minute yonder is the witness that swore i helped to rob the california coacha piece of impertinent intermeddling sir for i am not even acquainted with the man  then he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a sixshooter and the stranger began to explain with another  when the pistols were emptied the stranger resumed his work mending a whiplash and mr harris rode by with a polite nod homeward bound with a bullet through one of his lungs and several in his hips and from them issued little rivulets of blood that coursed down the horses sides and made the animal look quite picturesque  i never saw harris shoot a man after that but it recalled to mind that first day in carson  this was all we saw that day for it was two oclock now and according to custom the daily washoe zephyr set in a soaring dustdrift about the size of the united states set up edgewise came with it and the capital of nevada territory disappeared from view  still there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting to new comers for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things strange to the upper airthings living and dead that flitted hither and thither going and coming appearing and disappearing among the rolling billows of dusthats chickens and parasols sailing in the remote heavens blankets tin signs sagebrush and shingles a shade lower doormats and buffalo robes lower still shovels and coal scuttles on the next grade glass doors cats and little children on the next disrupted lumber yards light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next and down only thirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of emigrating roofs and vacant lots  it was something to see that much  i could have seen more if i could have kept the dust out of my eyes  but seriously a washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter  it blows flimsy houses down lifts shingle roofs occasionally rolls up tin ones like sheet music now and then blows a stage coach over and spills the passengers and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people there is that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are looking skyward after their hats  carson streets seldom look inactive on summer afternoons because there are so many citizens skipping around their escaping hats like chambermaids trying to head off a spider  the washoe zephyr washoe is a pet nickname for nevada is a peculiar scriptural wind in that no man knoweth whence it cometh  that is to say where it originates  it comes right over the mountains from the west but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the other side  it probably is manufactured on the mountaintop for the occasion and starts from there  it is a pretty regular wind in the summer time  its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the next morning and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours needs to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward of the point he is aiming at  and yet the first complaint a washoe visitor to san francisco makes is that the sea winds blow so there there is a good deal of human nature in that  we found the state palace of the governor of nevada territory to consist of a white frame onestory house with two small rooms in it and a stanchion supported shed in frontfor grandeurit compelled the respect of the citizen and inspired the indians with awe  the newly arrived chief and associate justices of the territory and other machinery of the government were domiciled with less splendor  they were boarding around privately and had their offices in their bedrooms  the secretary and i took quarters in the ranch of a worthy french lady by the name of bridget oflannigan a camp follower of his excellency the governor  she had known him in his prosperity as commanderinchief of the metropolitan police of new york and she would not desert him in his adversity as governor of nevada  our room was on the lower floor facing the plaza and when we had got our bed a small table two chairs the government fireproof safe and the unabridged dictionary into it there was still room enough left for a visitormay be two but not without straining the walls  but the walls could stand itat least the partitions could for they consisted simply of one thickness of white cotton domestic stretched from corner to corner of the room  this was the rule in carsonany other kind of partition was the rare exception  and if you stood in a dark room and your neighbors in the next had lights the shadows on your canvas told queer secrets sometimes  very often these partitions were made of old flour sacks basted together and then the difference between the common herd and the aristocracy was that the common herd had unornamented sacks while the walls of the aristocrat were overpowering with rudimental frescoie red and blue mill brands on the flour sacks  occasionally also the better classes embellished their canvas by pasting pictures from harpers weekly on them  in many cases too the wealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other evidences of a sumptuous and luxurious taste  washoe people take a joke so hard that i must explain that the above description was only the rule there were many honorable exceptions in carsonplastered ceilings and houses that had considerable furniture in themm t  we had a carpet and a genuine queensware washbowl  consequently we were hated without reserve by the other tenants of the oflannigan ranch  when we added a painted oilcloth window curtain we simply took our lives into our own hands  to prevent bloodshed i removed up stairs and took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen white pine cotbedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the one sole room of which the second story consisted  it was a jolly company the fourteen  they were principally voluntary campfollowers of the governor who had joined his retinue by their own election at new york and san francisco and came along feeling that in the scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not make their condition more precarious than it was and might reasonably expect to make it better  they were popularly known as the irish brigade though there were only four or five irishmen among all the governors retainers  his goodnatured excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen createdespecially when there arose a rumor that they were paid assassins of his brought along to quietly reduce the democratic vote when desirable  mrs oflannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week apiece and they were cheerfully giving their notes for it  they were perfectly satisfied but bridget presently found that notes that could not be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a carson boardinghouse  so she began to harry the governor to find employment for the brigade  her importunities and theirs together drove him to a gentle desperation at last and he finally summoned the brigade to the presence then said he  gentlemen i have planned a lucrative and useful service for you a service which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes and afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by observation and study  i want you to survey a railroad from carson city westward to a certain point  when the legislature meets i will have the necessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged  what a railroad over the sierra nevada mountains  well then survey it eastward to a certain point  he converted them into surveyors chainbearers and so on and turned them loose in the desert  it was recreation with a vengeance recreation on foot lugging chains through sand and sagebrush under a sultry sun and among cattle bones cayotes and tarantulas  romantic adventure could go no further  they surveyed very slowly very deliberately very carefully  they returned every night during the first week dusty footsore tired and hungry but very jolly  they brought in great store of prodigious hairy spiderstarantulasand imprisoned them in covered tumblers up stairs in the ranch  after the first week they had to camp on the field for they were getting well eastward  they made a good many inquiries as to the location of that indefinite certain point but got no information  at last to a peculiarly urgent inquiry of how far eastward  governor nye telegraphed back  to the atlantic ocean blast youand then bridge it and go on  this brought back the dusty toilers who sent in a report and ceased from their labors  the governor was always comfortable about it he said mrs oflannigan would hold him for the brigades board anyhow and he intended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys he said with his oldtime pleasant twinkle that he meant to survey them into utah and then telegraph brigham to hang them for trespass  the surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them and so we had quite a menagerie arranged along the shelves of the room  some of these spiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy muscular legs and when their feelings were hurt or their dignity offended they were the wickedestlooking desperadoes the animal world can furnish if their glass prisonhouses were touched ever so lightly they were up and spoiling for a fight in a minute  starchyproud  indeed they would take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of congress there was as usual a furious zephyr blowing the first night of the brigades return and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew off and a corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch there was a simultaneous awakening and a tumultuous muster of the brigade in the dark and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other in the narrow aisle between the bedrows  in the midst of the turmoil bob h sprung up out of a sound sleep and knocked down a shelf with his head  instantly he shouted  turn out boysthe tarantulas is loose  no warning ever sounded so dreadful  nobody tried any longer to leave the room lest he might step on a tarantula  every man groped for a trunk or a bed and jumped on it  then followed the strangest silencea silence of grisly suspense it was toowaiting expectancy fear  it was as dark as pitch and one had to imagine the spectacle of those fourteen scantclad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds for not a thing could be seen  then came occasional little interruptions of the silence and one could recognize a man and tell his locality by his voice or locate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or changes of position  the occasional voices were not given to much speakingyou simply heard a gentle ejaculation of ow followed by a solid thump and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or something touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor another silence  presently you would hear a gasping voice say  sususomethings crawling up the back of my neck  every now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a sorrowful o lord and then you knew that somebody was getting away from something he took for a tarantula and not losing any time about it either  directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear  ive got him  ive got him pause and probable change of circumstances  no hes got me  oh aint they never going to fetch a lantern  the lantern came at that moment in the hands of mrs oflannigan whose anxiety to know the amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not prevented her waiting a judicious interval after getting out of bed and lighting up to see if the wind was done now up stairs or had a larger contract  the landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was picturesque and might have been funny to some people but was not to us although we were perched so strangely upon boxes trunks and beds and so strangely attired too we were too earnestly distressed and too genuinely miserable to see any fun about it and there was not the semblance of a smile anywhere visible  i know i am not capable of suffering more than i did during those few minutes of suspense in the dark surrounded by those creeping bloodyminded tarantulas  i had skipped from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agony and every time i touched anything that was furzy i fancied i felt the fangs  i had rather go to war than live that episode over again  nobody was hurt the man who thought a tarantula had got him was mistakenonly a crack in a box had caught his finger  not one of those escaped tarantulas was ever seen again  there were ten or twelve of them  we took candles and hunted the place high and low for them but with no success  did we go back to bed then  we did nothing of the kind  money could not have persuaded us to do it  we sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage and keeping a sharp lookout for the enemy     chapter xxii  it was the end of august and the skies were cloudless and the weather superb  in two or three weeks i had grown wonderfully fascinated with the curious new country and concluded to put off my return to the states awhile  i had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch hat blue woolen shirt and pants crammed into boottops and gloried in the absence of coat vest and braces  i felt rowdyish and bully as the historian josephus phrases it in his fine chapter upon the destruction of the temple  it seemed to me that nothing could be so fine and so romantic  i had become an officer of the government but that was for mere sublimity  the office was an unique sinecure  i had nothing to do and no salary  i was private secretary to his majesty the secretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us  so johnny k and i devoted our time to amusement  he was the young son of an ohio nabob and was out there for recreation  he got it  we had heard a world of talk about the marvellous beauty of lake tahoe and finally curiosity drove us thither to see it  three or four members of the brigade had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and stored up a quantity of provisions in their camp  we strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders and took an axe apiece and startedfor we intended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy we were on foot  the reader will find it advantageous to go horseback we were told that the distance was eleven miles  we tramped a long time on level ground and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles high and looked over  no lake there  we descended on the other side crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or four thousand miles high apparently and looked over again  no lake yet  we sat down tired and perspiring and hired a couple of chinamen to curse those people who had beguiled us  thus refreshed we presently resumed the march with renewed vigor and determination  we plodded on two or three hours longer and at last the lake burst upon usa noble sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea and walled in by a rim of snowclad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet higher still  it was a vast oval and one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around it  as it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly photographed upon its still surface i thought it must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords  we found the small skiff belonging to the brigade boys and without loss of time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that signified the locality of the camp  i got johnny to rownot because i mind exertion myself but because it makes me sick to ride backwards when i am at work  but i steered  a threemile pull brought us to the camp just as the night fell and we stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly hungry  in a cache among the rocks we found the provisions and the cooking utensils and then all fatigued as i was i sat down on a boulder and superintended while johnny gathered wood and cooked supper many a man who had gone through what i had would have wanted to rest  it was a delicious supperhot bread fried bacon and black coffee it was a delicious solitude we were in too  three miles away was a sawmill and some workmen but there were not fifteen other human beings throughout the wide circumference of the lake  as the darkness closed down and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels we smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our pains  in due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two large boulders and soon feel asleep careless of the procession of ants that passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our persons nothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us for it had been fairly earned and if our consciences had any sins on them they had to adjourn court for that night any way  the wind rose just as we were losing consciousness and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf upon the shore  it is always very cold on that lake shore in the night but we had plenty of blankets and were warm enough  we never moved a muscle all night but waked at early dawn in the original positions and got up at once thoroughly refreshed free from soreness and brim full of friskiness there is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience  that morning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day before sick ones at any rate  but the world is slow and people will go to water cures and movement cures and to foreign lands for health three months of camp life on lake tahoe would restore an egyptian mummy to his pristine vigor and give him an appetite like an alligator  i do not mean the oldest and driest mummies of course but the fresher ones the air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine bracing and delicious  and why shouldnt it beit is the same the angels breathe i think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a man cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side  not under a roof but under the sky it seldom or never rains there in the summer time  i know a man who went there to die  but he made a failure of it he was a skeleton when he came and could barely stand  he had no appetite and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future three months later he was sleeping out of doors regularly eating all he could hold three times a day and chasing game over mountains three thousand feet high for recreation  and he was a skeleton no longer but weighed part of a ton  this is no fancy sketch but the truth  his disease was consumption  i confidently commend his experience to other skeletons  i superintended again and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in the boat and skirted along the lake shore about three miles and disembarked  we liked the appearance of the place and so we claimed some three hundred acres of it and stuck our notices on a tree  it was yellow pine timber landa dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and from one to five feet through at the butt  it was necessary to fence our property or we could not hold it  that is to say it was necessary to cut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way as to form a sort of enclosure with pretty wide gaps in it  we cut down three trees apiece and found it such heartbreaking work that we decided to rest our case on those if they held the property well and good if they didnt let the property spill out through the gaps and go it was no use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land next day we came back to build a housefor a house was also necessary in order to hold the property  we decided to build a substantial loghouse and excite the envy of the brigade boys but by the time we had cut and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate and so we concluded to build it of saplings  however two saplings duly cut and trimmed compelled recognition of the fact that a still modester architecture would satisfy the law and so we concluded to build a brush house  we devoted the next day to this work but we did so much sitting around and discussing that by the middle of the afternoon we had achieved only a halfway sort of affair which one of us had to watch while the other cut brush lest if both turned our backs we might not be able to find it again it had such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding vegetation  but we were satisfied with it  we were land owners now duly seized and possessed and within the protection of the law  therefore we decided to take up our residence on our own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only such an experience can bring  late the next afternoon after a good long rest we sailed away from the brigade camp with all the provisions and cooking utensils we could carry offborrow is the more accurate word and just as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing     chapter xxiii  if there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber ranch for the next two or three weeks it must be a sort of life which i have not read of in books or experienced in person  we did not see a human being but ourselves during the time or hear any sounds but those that were made by the wind and the waves the sighing of the pines and now and then the faroff thunder of an avalanche  the forest about us was dense and cool the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with sunshine the broad lake before us was glassy and clear or rippled and breezy or black and stormtossed according to natures mood and its circling border of mountain domes clothed with forests scarred with landslides cloven by canons and valleys and helmeted with glittering snow fitly framed and finished the noble picture  the view was always fascinating bewitching entrancing  the eye was never tired of gazing night or day in calm or storm it suffered but one grief and that was that it could not look always but must close sometimes in sleep  we slept in the sand close to the waters edge between two protecting boulders which took care of the stormy nightwinds for us  we never took any paregoric to make us sleep  at the first break of dawn we were always up and running footraces to tone down excess of physical vigor and exuberance of spirits  that is johnny wasbut i held his hat while smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory of the sun and followed the conquering light as it swept down among the shadows and set the captive crags and forests free  we watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water till every little detail of forest precipice and pinnacle was wrought in and finished and the miracle of the enchanter complete  then to business  that is drifting around in the boat  we were on the north shore there the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray sometimes white this gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has elsewhere on the lake  we usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from shore and then lay down on the thwarts in the sun and let the boat drift by the hour whither it would  we seldom talked it interrupted the sabbath stillness and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and indolence brought  the shore all along was indented with deep curved bays and coves bordered by narrow sandbeaches and where the sand ended the steep mountainsides rose right up aloft into spacerose up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular and thickly wooded with tall pines  so singularly clear was the water that where it was only twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat seemed floating in the air  yes where it was even eighty feet deep every little pebble was distinct every speckled trout every handsbreadth of sand  often as we lay on our faces a granite boulder as large as a village church would start out of the bottom apparently and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface till presently it threatened to touch our faces and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar and avert the danger  but the boat would float on and the boulder descend again and then we could see that when we had been exactly above it it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface  down through the transparency of these great depths the water was not merely transparent but dazzlingly brilliantly so  all objects seen through it had a bright strong vividness not only of outline but of every minute detail which they would not have had when seen simply through the same depth of atmosphere  so empty and airy did all spaces seem below us and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in midnothingness that we called these boatexcursions balloonvoyages  we fished a good deal but we did not average one fish a week  we could see trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us or sleeping in shoals on the bottom but they would not bitethey could see the line too plainly perhaps  we frequently selected the trout we wanted and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his nose at a depth of eighty feet but he would only shake it off with an annoyed manner and shift his position  we bathed occasionally but the water was rather chilly for all it looked so sunny  sometimes we rowed out to the blue water a mile or two from shore  it was as dead blue as indigo there because of the immense depth  by official measurement the lake in its centre is one thousand five hundred and twentyfive feet deep  sometimes on lazy afternoons we lolled on the sand in camp and smoked pipes and read some old wellworn novels  at night by the campfire we played euchre and sevenup to strengthen the mindand played them with cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summers acquaintance with them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of diamonds  we never slept in our house  it never recurred to us for one thing and besides it was built to hold the ground and that was enough  we did not wish to strain it  by and by our provisions began to run short and we went back to the old camp and laid in a new supply  we were gone all day and reached home again about nightfall pretty tired and hungry  while johnny was carrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our house for future use i took the loaf of bread some slices of bacon and the coffeepot ashore set them down by a tree lit a fire and went back to the boat to get the fryingpan  while i was at this i heard a shout from johnny and looking up i saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises johnny was on the other side of it  he had to run through the flames to get to the lake shore and then we stood helpless and watched the devastation  the ground was deeply carpeted with dry pineneedles and the fire touched them off as if they were gunpowder  it was wonderful to see with what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled  my coffeepot was gone and everything with it  in a minute and a half the fire seized upon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high and then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific we were driven to the boat by the intense heat and there we remained spellbound  within half an hour all before us was a tossing blinding tempest of flame  it went surging up adjacent ridgessurmounted them and disappeared in the canons beyondburst into view upon higher and farther ridges presentlyshed a grander illumination abroad and dove again flamed out again directly higher and still higher up the mountainsidethrew out skirmishing parties of fire here and there and sent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and ribs and gorges till as far as the eye could reach the lofty mountainfronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava streams away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy glare and the firmament above was a reflected hell  every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the lake  both pictures were sublime both were beautiful but that in the lake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held it with the stronger fascination  we sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours  we never thought of supper and never felt fatigue  but at eleven oclock the conflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision and then darkness stole down upon the landscape again  hunger asserted itself now but there was nothing to eat  the provisions were all cooked no doubt but we did not go to see  we were homeless wanderers again without any property  our fence was gone our house burned down no insurance  our pine forest was well scorched the dead trees all burned up and our broad acres of manzanita swept away  our blankets were on our usual sandbed however and so we lay down and went to sleep  the next morning we started back to the old camp but while out a long way from shore so great a storm came up that we dared not try to land  so i baled out the seas we shipped and johnny pulled heavily through the billows till we had reached a point three or four miles beyond the camp  the storm was increasing and it became evident that it was better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down in a hundred fathoms of water so we ran in with tall whitecaps following and i sat down in the sternsheets and pointed her headon to the shore the instant the bow struck a wave came over the stern that washed crew and cargo ashore and saved a deal of trouble  we shivered in the lee of a boulder all the rest of the day and froze all the night through  in the morning the tempest had gone down and we paddled down to the camp without any unnecessary delay  we were so starved that we ate up the rest of the brigades provisions and then set out to carson to tell them about it and ask their forgiveness  it was accorded upon payment of damages  we made many trips to the lake after that and had many a hairbreadth escape and bloodcurdling adventure which will never be recorded in any history     chapter xxiv  i resolved to have a horse to ride  i had never seen such wild free magnificent horsemanship outside of a circus as these picturesquelyclad mexicans californians and mexicanized americans displayed in carson streets every day  how they rode  leaning just gently forward out of the perpendicular easy and nonchalant with broad slouchhat brim blown square up in front and long riata swinging above the head they swept through the town like the wind  the next minute they were only a sailing puff of dust on the far desert  if they trotted they sat up gallantly and gracefully and seemed part of the horse did not go jiggering up and down after the silly missnancy fashion of the ridingschools  i had quickly learned to tell a horse from a cow and was full of anxiety to learn more  i was resolved to buy a horse  while the thought was rankling in my mind the auctioneer came skurrying through the plaza on a black beast that had as many humps and corners on him as a dromedary and was necessarily uncomely but he was going going at twentytwohorse saddle and bridle at twentytwo dollars gentlemen and i could hardly resist  a man whom i did not know he turned out to be the auctioneers brother noticed the wistful look in my eye and observed that that was a very remarkable horse to be going at such a price and added that the saddle alone was worth the money  it was a spanish saddle with ponderous tapidaros and furnished with the ungainly soleleather covering with the unspellable name  i said i had half a notion to bid  then this keeneyed person appeared to me to be taking my measure but i dismissed the suspicion when he spoke for his manner was full of guileless candor and truthfulness  said he  i know that horseknow him well  you are a stranger i take it and so you might think he was an american horse maybe but i assure you he is not  he is nothing of the kind butexcuse my speaking in a low voice other people being nearhe is without the shadow of a doubt a genuine mexican plug  i did not know what a genuine mexican plug was but there was something about this mans way of saying it that made me swear inwardly that i would own a genuine mexican plug or die  has he any othereradvantages  i inquired suppressing what eagerness i could  he hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my armyshirt led me to one side and breathed in my ear impressively these words  he can outbuck anything in america  going going goingat twenttyfour dollars and a half gen  twentyseven i shouted in a frenzy  and sold said the auctioneer and passed over the genuine mexican plug to me  i could scarcely contain my exultation  i paid the money and put the animal in a neighboring liverystable to dine and rest himself  in the afternoon i brought the creature into the plaza and certain citizens held him by the head and others by the tail while i mounted him  as soon as they let go he placed all his feet in a bunch together lowered his back and then suddenly arched it upward and shot me straight into the air a matter of three or four feet  i came as straight down again lit in the saddle went instantly up again came down almost on the high pommel shot up again and came down on the horses neckall in the space of three or four seconds  then he rose and stood almost straight up on his hind feet and i clasping his lean neck desperately slid back into the saddle and held on  he came down and immediately hoisted his heels into the air delivering a vicious kick at the sky and stood on his forefeet  and then down he came once more and began the original exercise of shooting me straight up again  the third time i went up i heard a stranger say  oh dont he buck though  while i was up somebody struck the horse a sounding thwack with a leathern strap and when i arrived again the genuine mexican plug was not there  a california youth chased him up and caught him and asked if he might have a ride  i granted him that luxury  he mounted the genuine got lifted into the air once but sent his spurs home as he descended and the horse darted away like a telegram  he soared over three fences like a bird and disappeared down the road toward the washoe valley  i sat down on a stone with a sigh and by a natural impulse one of my hands sought my forehead and the other the base of my stomach  i believe i never appreciated till then the poverty of the human machineryfor i still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere  pen cannot describe how i was jolted up  imagination cannot conceive how disjointed i washow internally externally and universally i was unsettled mixed up and ruptured  there was a sympathetic crowd around me though  one elderlylooking comforter said  stranger youve been taken in  everybody in this camp knows that horse  any child any injun could have told you that hed buck he is the very worst devil to buck on the continent of america  you hear me im curry  old curry  old abe curry  and moreover he is a simonpure outandout genuine dd mexican plug and an uncommon mean one at that too  why you turnip if you had laid low and kept dark theres chances to buy an american horse for mighty little more than you paid for that bloody old foreign relic  i gave no sign but i made up my mind that if the auctioneers brothers funeral took place while i was in the territory i would postpone all other recreations and attend it  after a gallop of sixteen miles the californian youth and the genuine mexican plug came tearing into town again shedding foamflakes like the spumespray that drives before a typhoon and with one final skip over a wheelbarrow and a chinaman cast anchor in front of the ranch  such panting and blowing  such spreading and contracting of the red equine nostrils and glaring of the wild equine eye  but was the imperial beast subjugated  indeed he was not  his lordship the speaker of the house thought he was and mounted him to go down to the capitol but the first dash the creature made was over a pile of telegraph poles half as high as a church and his time to the capitolone mile and three quartersremains unbeaten to this day  but then he took an advantagehe left out the mile and only did the three quarters  that is to say he made a straight cut across lots preferring fences and ditches to a crooked road and when the speaker got to the capitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made the trip on a comet  in the evening the speaker came home afoot for exercise and got the genuine towed back behind a quartz wagon  the next day i loaned the animal to the clerk of the house to go down to the dana silver mine six miles and he walked back for exercise and got the horse towed everybody i loaned him to always walked back they never could get enough exercise any other way  still i continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him my idea being to get him crippled and throw him on the borrowers hands or killed and make the borrower pay for him  but somehow nothing ever happened to him  he took chances that no other horse ever took and survived but he always came out safe  it was his daily habit to try experiments that had always before been considered impossible but he always got through  sometimes he miscalculated a little and did not get his rider through intact but he always got through himself  of course i had tried to sell him but that was a stretch of simplicity which met with little sympathy  the auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on him for four days dispersing the populace interrupting business and destroying children and never got a bidat least never any but the eighteendollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make the people only smiled pleasantly and restrained their desire to buy if they had any  then the auctioneer brought in his bill and i withdrew the horse from the market  we tried to trade him off at private vendue next offering him at a sacrifice for secondhand tombstones old iron temperance tractsany kind of property  but holders were stiff and we retired from the market again  i never tried to ride the horse any more walking was good enough exercise for a man like me that had nothing the matter with him except ruptures internal injuries and such things finally i tried to give him away  but it was a failure  parties said earthquakes were handy enough on the pacific coastthey did not wish to own one  as a last resort i offered him to the governor for the use of the brigade  his face lit up eagerly at first but toned down again and he said the thing would be too palpable  just then the livery stable man brought in his bill for six weeks keepingstallroom for the horse fifteen dollars hay for the horse two hundred and fifty  the genuine mexican plug had eaten a ton of the article and the man said he would have eaten a hundred if he had let him  i will remark here in all seriousness that the regular price of hay during that year and a part of the next was really two hundred and fifty dollars a ton  during a part of the previous year it had sold at five hundred a ton in gold and during the winter before that there was such scarcity of the article that in several instances small quantities had brought eight hundred dollars a ton in coin  the consequence might be guessed without my telling it peopled turned their stock loose to starve and before the spring arrived carson and eagle valleys were almost literally carpeted with their carcases  any old settler there will verify these statements  i managed to pay the livery bill and that same day i gave the genuine mexican plug to a passing arkansas emigrant whom fortune delivered into my hand  if this ever meets his eye he will doubtless remember the donation  now whoever has had the luck to ride a real mexican plug will recognize the animal depicted in this chapter and hardly consider him exaggerated but the uninitiated will feel justified in regarding his portrait as a fancy sketch perhaps     chapter xxv  originally nevada was a part of utah and was called carson county and a pretty large county it was too  certain of its valleys produced no end of hay and this attracted small colonies of mormon stockraisers and farmers to them  a few orthodox americans straggled in from california but no love was lost between the two classes of colonists  there was little or no friendly intercourse each party staid to itself  the mormons were largely in the majority and had the additional advantage of being peculiarly under the protection of the mormon government of the territory  therefore they could afford to be distant and even peremptory toward their neighbors  one of the traditions of carson valley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the time i speak of  the hired girl of one of the american families was irish and a catholic yet it was noted with surprise that she was the only person outside of the mormon ring who could get favors from the mormons  she asked kindnesses of them often and always got them  it was a mystery to everybody  but one day as she was passing out at the door a large bowie knife dropped from under her apron and when her mistress asked for an explanation she observed that she was going out to borry a washtub from the mormons  in 1858 silver lodes were discovered in carson county and then the aspect of things changed  californians began to flock in and the american element was soon in the majority  allegiance to brigham young and utah was renounced and a temporary territorial government for washoe was instituted by the citizens  governor roop was the first and only chief magistrate of it  in due course of time congress passed a bill to organize nevada territory and president lincoln sent out governor nye to supplant roop  at this time the population of the territory was about twelve or fifteen thousand and rapidly increasing  silver mines were being vigorously developed and silver mills erected  business of all kinds was active and prosperous and growing more so day by day  the people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government but did not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant states put in authority over thema sentiment that was natural enough  they thought the officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among prominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion and who would be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly acquainted with the needs of the territory  they were right in viewing the matter thus without doubt  the new officers were emigrants and that was no title to anybodys affection or admiration either  the new government was received with considerable coolness  it was not only a foreign intruder but a poor one  it was not even worth plucking except by the smallest of small fry officeseekers and such  everybody knew that congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year in greenbacks for its supportabout money enough to run a quartz mill a month  and everybody knew also that the first years money was still in washington and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and difficult process  carson city was too wary and too wise to open up a credit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent haste  there is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a newborn territorial government to get a start in this world  ours had a trying time of it  the organic act and the instructions from the state department commanded that a legislature should be elected at suchandsuch a time and its sittings inaugurated at suchandsuch a date  it was easy to get legislators even at three dollars a day although board was four dollars and fifty cents for distinction has its charm in nevada as well as elsewhere and there were plenty of patriotic souls out of employment but to get a legislative hall for them to meet in was another matter altogether  carson blandly declined to give a room rentfree or let one to the government on credit  but when curry heard of the difficulty he came forward solitary and alone and shouldered the ship of state over the bar and got her afloat again  i refer to curryold curryold abe curry  but for him the legislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert  he offered his large stone building just outside the capital limits rentfree and it was gladly accepted  then he built a horserailroad from town to the capitol and carried the legislators gratis  he also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature and covered the floors with clean sawdust by way of carpet and spittoon combined  but for curry the government would have died in its tender infancy  a canvas partition to separate the senate from the house of representatives was put up by the secretary at a cost of three dollars and forty cents but the united states declined to pay for it  upon being reminded that the instructions permitted the payment of a liberal rent for a legislative hall and that that money was saved to the country by mr currys generosity the united states said that did not alter the matter and the three dollars and forty cents would be subtracted from the secretarys eighteen hundred dollar salaryand it was  the matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature of the new governments difficulties  the secretary was sworn to obey his volume of written instructions and these commanded him to do two certain things without fail viz  1  get the house and senate journals printed and 2  for this work pay one dollar and fifty cents per thousand for composition and one dollar and fifty cents per token for presswork in greenbacks  it was easy to swear to do these two things but it was entirely impossible to do more than one of them  when greenbacks had gone down to forty cents on the dollar the prices regularly charged everybody by printing establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per thousand and one dollar and fifty cents per token in gold  the instructions commanded that the secretary regard a paper dollar issued by the government as equal to any other dollar issued by the government  hence the printing of the journals was discontinued  then the united states sternly rebuked the secretary for disregarding the instructions and warned him to correct his ways  wherefore he got some printing done forwarded the bill to washington with full exhibits of the high prices of things in the territory and called attention to a printed market report wherein it would be observed that even hay was two hundred and fifty dollars a ton  the united states responded by subtracting the printingbill from the secretarys suffering salaryand moreover remarked with dense gravity that he would find nothing in his instructions requiring him to purchase hay  nothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a us treasury comptrollers understanding  the very fires of the hereafter could get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it  in the days i speak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that twenty thousand dollars would not go as far in nevada where all commodities ranged at an enormous figure as it would in the other territories where exceeding cheapness was the rule  he was an officer who looked out for the little expenses all the time  the secretary of the territory kept his office in his bedroom as i before remarked and he charged the united states no rent although his instructions provided for that item and he could have justly taken advantage of it a thing which i would have done with more than lightning promptness if i had been secretary myself  but the united states never applauded this devotion  indeed i think my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person in its employ  those instructions we used to read a chapter from them every morning as intellectual gymnastics and a couple of chapters in sunday school every sabbath for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had much valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics those instructions commanded that penknives envelopes pens and writingpaper be furnished the members of the legislature  so the secretary made the purchase and the distribution  the knives cost three dollars apiece  there was one too many and the secretary gave it to the clerk of the house of representatives  the united states said the clerk of the house was not a member of the legislature and took that three dollars out of the secretarys salary as usual  white men charged three or four dollars a load for sawing up stovewood  the secretary was sagacious enough to know that the united states would never pay any such price as that so he got an indian to saw up a load of office wood at one dollar and a half  he made out the usual voucher but signed no name to itsimply appended a note explaining that an indian had done the work and had done it in a very capable and satisfactory way but could not sign the voucher owing to lack of ability in the necessary direction  the secretary had to pay that dollar and a half  he thought the united states would admire both his economy and his honesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a pretended indians signature to the voucher but the united states did not see it in that light  the united states was too much accustomed to employing dollarandahalf thieves in all manner of official capacities to regard his explanation of the voucher as having any foundation in fact  but the next time the indian sawed wood for us i taught him to make a cross at the bottom of the voucherit looked like a cross that had been drunk a yearand then i witnessed it and it went through all right the united states never said a word  i was sorry i had not made the voucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one  the government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic villainy and i think i might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if i had remained in the public service a year or two  that was a fine collection of sovereigns that first nevada legislature they levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand dollars and ordered expenditures to the extent of about a million  yet they had their little periodical explosions of economy like all other bodies of the kind  a member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by dispensing with the chaplain  and yet that shortsighted man needed the chaplain more than any other member perhaps for he generally sat with his feet on his desk eating raw turnips during the morning prayer  the legislature sat sixty days and passed private tollroad franchises all the time  when they adjourned it was estimated that every citizen owned about three franchises and it was believed that unless congress gave the territory another degree of longitude there would not be room enough to accommodate the tollroads  the ends of them were hanging over the boundary line everywhere like a fringe  the fact is the freighting business had grown to such important proportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly acquired tollroad fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines     chapter xxvi  by and by i was smitten with the silver fever  prospecting parties were leaving for the mountains every day and discovering and taking possession of rich silverbearing lodes and ledges of quartz  plainly this was the road to fortune  the great gould and curry mine was held at three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived but in two months it had sprung up to eight hundred  the ophir had been worth only a mere trifle a year gone by and now it was selling at nearly four thousand dollars a foot  not a mine could be named that had not experienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time everybody was talking about these marvels  go where you would you heard nothing else from morning till far into the night  tom soandso had sold out of the amanda smith for 40000hadnt a cent when he took up the ledge six months ago  john jones had sold half his interest in the bald eagle and mary ann for 65000 gold coin and gone to the states for his family  the widow brewster had struck it rich in the golden fleece and sold ten feet for 18000hadnt money enough to buy a crape bonnet when singsing tommy killed her husband at baldy johnsons wake last spring  the last chance had found a clay casing and knew they were right on the ledgeconsequence feet that went begging yesterday were worth a brick house apiece today and seedy owners who could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday were roaring drunk on champagne today and had hosts of warm personal friends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from longcontinued want of practice  johnny morgan a common loafer had gone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand dollars in consequence of the decision in the lady franklin and rough and ready lawsuit  and so onday in and day out the talk pelted our ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us  i would have been more or less than human if i had not gone mad like the rest  cartloads of solid silver bricks as large as pigs of lead were arriving from the mills every day and such sights as that gave substance to the wild talk about me  i succumbed and grew as frenzied as the craziest  every few days news would come of the discovery of a brannew mining region immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness and away the surplus population would scamper to take possession  by the time i was fairly inoculated with the disease esmeralda had just had a run and humboldt was beginning to shriek for attention  humboldt humboldt was the new cry and straightway humboldt the newest of the new the richest of the rich the most marvellous of the marvellous discoveries in silverland was occupying two columns of the public prints to esmeraldas one  i was just on the point of starting to esmeralda but turned with the tide and got ready for humboldt  that the reader may see what moved me and what would as surely have moved him had he been there i insert here one of the newspaper letters of the day  it and several other letters from the same calm hand were the main means of converting me  i shall not garble the extract but put it in just as it appeared in the daily territorial enterprise        but what about our mines  i shall be candid with you  i shall       express an honest opinion based upon a thorough examination       humboldt county is the richest mineral region upon gods footstool       each mountain range is gorged with the precious ores  humboldt is       the true golconda        the other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four       thousand dollars to the ton  a week or two ago an assay of just       such surface developments made returns of seven thousand dollars to       the ton  our mountains are full of rambling prospectors  each day       and almost every hour reveals new and more startling evidences of       the profuse and intensified wealth of our favored county  the metal       is not silver alone  there are distinct ledges of auriferous ore       a late discovery plainly evinces cinnabar  the coarser metals are       in gross abundance  lately evidences of bituminous coal have been       detected  my theory has ever been that coal is a ligneous       formation  i told col  whitman in times past that the       neighborhood of dayton nevada betrayed no present or previous       manifestations of a ligneous foundation and that hence i had no       confidence in his lauded coal mines  i repeated the same doctrine       to the exultant coal discoverers of humboldt  i talked with my       friend captain burch on the subject  my pyrhanism vanished upon his       statement that in the very region referred to he had seen petrified       trees of the length of two hundred feet  then is the fact       established that huge forests once cast their grim shadows over this       remote section  i am firm in the coal faith        have no fears of the mineral resources of humboldt county  they are       immenseincalculable  let me state one or two things which will help the reader to better comprehend certain items in the above  at this time our near neighbor gold hill was the most successful silver mining locality in nevada  it was from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks came  very rich and scarce gold hill ore yielded from 100 to 400 to the ton but the usual yield was only 20 to 40 per tonthat is to say each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars but the reader will perceive by the above extract that in humboldt from one fourth to nearly half the mass was silver  that is to say every one hundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three hundred and fifty in it  some days later this same correspondent wrote        i have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this       regionit is incredible  the intestines of our mountains are       gorged with precious ore to plethora  i have said that nature       has so shaped our mountains as to furnish most excellent       facilities for the working of our mines  i have also told you       that the country about here is pregnant with the finest mill       sites in the world  but what is the mining history of humboldt       the sheba mine is in the hands of energetic san francisco       capitalists  it would seem that the ore is combined with metals       that render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain       machinery  the proprietors have combined the capital and labor       hinted at in my exordium  they are toiling and probing  their       tunnel has reached the length of one hundred feet  from primal       assays alone coupled with the development of the mine and public       confidence in the continuance of effort the stock had reared       itself to eight hundred dollars market value  i do not know that       one ton of the ore has been converted into current metal  i do       know that there are many lodes in this section that surpass the       sheba in primal assay value  listen a moment to the calculations       of the sheba operators  they purpose transporting the ore       concentrated to europe  the conveyance from star city its       locality to virginia city will cost seventy dollars per ton       from virginia to san francisco forty dollars per ton from       thence to liverpool its destination ten dollars per ton  their       idea is that its conglomerate metals will reimburse them their       cost of original extraction the price of transportation and the       expense of reduction and that then a ton of the raw ore will net       them twelve hundred dollars  the estimate may be extravagant       cut it in twain and the product is enormous far transcending       any previous developments of our racy territory        a very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield       five hundred dollars to the ton  such fecundity throws the gould        curry the ophir and the mexican of your neighborhood in the       darkest shadow  i have given you the estimate of the value of a       single developed mine  its richness is indexed by its market       valuation  the people of humboldt county are feet crazy  as i       write our towns are near deserted  they look as languid as a       consumptive girl  what has become of our sinewy and athletic       fellowcitizens  they are coursing through ravines and over       mountain tops  their tracks are visible in every direction       occasionally a horseman will dash among us  his steed betrays       hard usage  he alights before his adobe dwelling hastily       exchanges courtesies with his townsmen hurries to an assay       office and from thence to the district recorders  in the       morning having renewed his provisional supplies he is off again       on his wild and unbeaten route  why the fellow numbers already       his feet by the thousands  he is the horseleech  he has the       craving stomach of the shark or anaconda  he would conquer       metallic worlds  this was enough  the instant we had finished reading the above article four of us decided to go to humboldt  we commenced getting ready at once  and we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not deciding soonerfor we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be found and secured before we got there and we might have to put up with ledges that would not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a ton maybe  an hour before i would have felt opulent if i had owned ten feet in a gold hill mine whose ore produced twentyfive dollars to the ton now i was already annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with mines the poorest of which would be a marvel in gold hill     chapter xxvii  hurry was the word  we wasted no time  our party consisted of four personsa blacksmith sixty years of age two young lawyers and myself we bought a wagon and two miserable old horses  we put eighteen hundred pounds of provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of carson on a chilly december afternoon  the horses were so weak and old that we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out and walked  it was an improvement  next we found that it would be better if a third man got out  that was an improvement also  it was at this time that i volunteered to drive although i had never driven a harnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt fairly excused from such a responsibility  but in a little while it was found that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also it was at this time that i resigned the position of driver and never resumed it again  within the hour we found that it would not only be better but was absolutely necessary that we four taking turns two at a time should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it through the sand leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of the way and hold up the tongue  perhaps it is well for one to know his fate at first and get reconciled to it  we had learned ours in one afternoon  it was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove that wagon and those horses two hundred miles  so we accepted the situation and from that time forth we never rode  more than that we stood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind  we made seven miles and camped in the desert  young clagett now member of congress from montana unharnessed and fed and watered the horses oliphant and i cut sagebrush built the fire and brought water to cook with and old mr ballou the blacksmith did the cooking  this division of labor and this appointment was adhered to throughout the journey we had no tent and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain  we were so tired that we slept soundly  we were fifteen days making the triptwo hundred miles thirteen rather for we lay by a couple of days in one place to let the horses rest  we could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had towed the horses behind the wagon but we did not think of that until it was too late and so went on shoving the horses and the wagon too when we might have saved half the labor  parties who met us occasionally advised us to put the horses in the wagon but mr ballou through whose ironclad earnestness no sarcasm could pierce said that that would not do because the provisions were exposed and would suffer the horses being bituminous from long deprivation  the reader will excuse me from translating  what mr ballou customarily meant when he used a long word was a secret between himself and his maker  he was one of the best and kindest hearted men that ever graced a humble sphere of life  he was gentleness and simplicity itselfand unselfishness too  although he was more than twice as old as the eldest of us he never gave himself any airs privileges or exemptions on that account  he did a young mans share of the work and did his share of conversing and entertaining from the general standpoint of any agenot from the arrogant overawing summitheight of sixty years  his one striking peculiarity was his partingtonian fashion of loving and using big words for their own sakes and independent of any bearing they might have upon the thought he was purposing to convey  he always let his ponderous syllables fall with an easy unconsciousness that left them wholly without offensiveness in truth his air was so natural and so simple that one was always catching himself accepting his stately sentences as meaning something when they really meant nothing in the world  if a word was long and grand and resonant that was sufficient to win the old mans love and he would drop that word into the most outoftheway place in a sentence or a subject and be as pleased with it as if it were perfectly luminous with meaning  we four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the frozen ground and slept side by side and finding that our foolish longlegged hound pup had a deal of animal heat in him oliphant got to admitting him to the bed between himself and mr ballou hugging the dogs warm back to his breast and finding great comfort in it  but in the night the pup would get stretchy and brace his feet against the old mans back and shove grunting complacently the while and now and then being warm and snug grateful and happy he would paw the old mans back simply in excess of comfort and at yet other times he would dream of the chase and in his sleep tug at the old mans back hair and bark in his ear  the old gentleman complained mildly about these familiarities at last and when he got through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not a proper animal to admit to bed with tired men because he was so meretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions  we turned the dog out  it was a hard wearing toilsome journey but it had its bright side for after each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper of fried bacon bread molasses and black coffee the pipesmoking songsinging and yarnspinning around the evening campfire in the still solitudes of the desert was a happy carefree sort of recreation that seemed the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury  it is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men whether city or countrybred  we are descended from desertlounging arabs and countless ages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root out of us the nomadic instinct  we all confess to a gratified thrill at the thought of camping out  once we made twentyfive miles in a day and once we made forty miles through the great american desert and ten miles beyondfifty in all in twentythree hours without halting to eat drink or rest  to stretch out and go to sleep even on stony and frozen ground after pushing a wagon and two horses fifty miles is a delight so supreme that for the moment it almost seems cheap at the price  we camped two days in the neighborhood of the sink of the humboldt we tried to use the strong alkaline water of the sink but it would not answer  it was like drinking lye and not weak lye either  it left a taste in the mouth bitter and every way execrable and a burning in the stomach that was very uncomfortable  we put molasses in it but that helped it very little we added a pickle yet the alkali was the prominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking  the coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet invented  it was really viler to the taste than the unameliorated water itself  mr ballou being the architect and builder of the beverage felt constrained to endorse and uphold it and so drank half a cup by little sips making shift to praise it faintly the while but finally threw out the remainder and said frankly it was too technical for him  but presently we found a spring of fresh water convenient and then with nothing to mar our enjoyment and no stragglers to interrupt it we entered into our rest     chapter xxviii  after leaving the sink we traveled along the humboldt river a little way  people accustomed to the monster milewide mississippi grow accustomed to associating the term river with a high degree of watery grandeur  consequently such people feel rather disappointed when they stand on the shores of the humboldt or the carson and find that a river in nevada is a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of the erie canal in all respects save that the canal is twice as long and four times as deep  one of the pleasantest and most invigorating exercises one can contrive is to run and jump across the humboldt river till he is overheated and then drink it dry  on the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and entered unionville humboldt county in the midst of a driving snowstorm  unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a libertypole six of the cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon and the other five faced them  the rest of the landscape was made up of bleak mountain walls that rose so high into the sky from both sides of the canyon that the village was left as it were far down in the bottom of a crevice it was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before the darkness lifted and revealed unionville  we built a small rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it with canvas leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney through which the cattle used to tumble occasionally at night and mash our furniture and interrupt our sleep  it was very cold weather and fuel was scarce indians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs and when we could catch a laden indian it was welland when we could not which was the rule not the exception we shivered and bore it  i confess without shame that i expected to find masses of silver lying all about the ground  i expected to see it glittering in the sun on the mountain summits  i said nothing about this for some instinct told me that i might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it and so if i betrayed my thought i might bring derision upon myself  yet i was as perfectly satisfied in my own mind as i could be of anything that i was going to gather up in a day or two or at furthest a week or two silver enough to make me satisfactorily wealthyand so my fancy was already busy with plans for spending this money  the first opportunity that offered i sauntered carelessly away from the cabin keeping an eye on the other boys and stopping and contemplating the sky when they seemed to be observing me but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear i fled away as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted till i was far beyond sight and call  then i began my search with a feverish excitement that was brimful of expectationalmost of certainty i crawled about the ground seizing and examining bits of stone blowing the dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes and then peering at them with anxious hope  presently i found a bright fragment and my heart bounded  i hid behind a boulder and polished it and scrutinized it with a nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than absolute certainty itself could have afforded  the more i examined the fragment the more i was convinced that i had found the door to fortune  i marked the spot and carried away my specimen  up and down the rugged mountain side i searched with always increasing interest and always augmenting gratitude that i had come to humboldt and come in time  of all the experiences of my life this secret search among the hidden treasures of silverland was the nearest to unmarred ecstasy  it was a delirious revel  by and by in the bed of a shallow rivulet i found a deposit of shining yellow scales and my breath almost forsook me  a gold mine and in my simplicity i had been content with vulgar silver  i was so excited that i half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me  then a fear came upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my secret moved by this thought i made a circuit of the place and ascended a knoll to reconnoiter  solitude  no creature was near  then i returned to my mine fortifying myself against possible disappointment but my fears were groundlessthe shining scales were still there  i set about scooping them out and for an hour i toiled down the windings of the stream and robbed its bed  but at last the descending sun warned me to give up the quest and i turned homeward laden with wealth  as i walked along i could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose  in this little time the former had so fallen in my estimation that once or twice i was on the point of throwing it away  the boys were as hungry as usual but i could eat nothing  neither could i talk  i was full of dreams and far away  their conversation interrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat and annoyed me a little too i despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about  but as they proceeded it began to amuse me  it grew to be rare fun to hear them planning their poor little economies and sighing over possible privations and distresses when a gold mine all our own lay within sight of the cabin and i could point it out at any moment  smothered hilarity began to oppress me presently  it was hard to resist the impulse to burst out with exultation and reveal everything but i did resist  i said within myself that i would filter the great news through my lips calmly and be serene as a summer morning while i watched its effect in their faces  i said  where have you all been  prospecting  what did you find  nothing  nothing  what do you think of the country  cant tell yet said mr ballou who was an old gold miner and had likewise had considerable experience among the silver mines  well havent you formed any sort of opinion  yes a sort of a one  its fair enough here may be but overrated seven thousand dollar ledges are scarce though  that sheba may be rich enough but we dont own it and besides the rock is so full of base metals that all the science in the world cant work it  well not starve here but well not get rich im afraid  so you think the prospect is pretty poor  no name for it  well wed better go back hadnt we  oh not yetof course not  well try it a riffle first  suppose nowthis is merely a supposition you knowsuppose you could find a ledge that would yield say a hundred and fifty dollars a ton would that satisfy you  try us once from the whole party  or supposemerely a supposition of coursesuppose you were to find a ledge that would yield two thousand dollars a tonwould that satisfy you  herewhat do you mean  what are you coming at  is there some mystery behind all this  never mind  i am not saying anything  you know perfectly well there are no rich mines hereof course you do  because you have been around and examined for yourselves  anybody would know that that had been around  but just for the sake of argument supposein a kind of general waysuppose some person were to tell you that twothousanddollar ledges were simply contemptiblecontemptible understandand that right yonder in sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure silveroceans of itenough to make you all rich in twentyfour hours come  i should say he was as crazy as a loon said old ballou but wild with excitement nevertheless  gentlemen said i i dont say anythingi havent been around you know and of course dont know anythingbut all i ask of you is to cast your eye on that for instance and tell me what you think of it and i tossed my treasure before them  there was an eager scramble for it and a closing of heads together over it under the candlelight  then old ballou said  think of it  i think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and nasty glittering mica that isnt worth ten cents an acre  so vanished my dream  so melted my wealth away  so toppled my airy castle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn  moralizing i observed then that all that glitters is not gold  mr ballou said i could go further than that and lay it up among my treasures of knowledge that nothing that glitters is gold  so i learned then once for all that gold in its native state is but dull unornamental stuff and that only lowborn metals excite the admiration of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter  however like the rest of the world i still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of mica  commonplace human nature cannot rise above that     chapter xxix  true knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough  we went out prospecting with mr ballou  we climbed the mountain sides and clambered among sagebrush rocks and snow till we were ready to drop with exhaustion but found no silvernor yet any gold  day after day we did this  now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the declivities and apparently abandoned and now and then we found one or two listless men still burrowing  but there was no appearance of silver these holes were the beginnings of tunnels and the purpose was to drive them hundreds of feet into the mountain and some day tap the hidden ledge where the silver was  some day  it seemed far enough away and very hopeless and dreary  day after day we toiled and climbed and searched and we younger partners grew sicker and still sicker of the promiseless toil  at last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock which projected from the earth high upon the mountain  mr ballou broke off some fragments with a hammer and examined them long and attentively with a small eyeglass threw them away and broke off more said this rock was quartz and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver contained it  i had thought that at least it would be caked on the outside of it like a kind of veneering  he still broke off pieces and critically examined them now and then wetting the piece with his tongue and applying the glass  at last he exclaimed  weve got it  we were full of anxiety in a moment  the rock was clean and white where it was broken and across it ran a ragged thread of blue  he said that that little thread had silver in it mixed with base metal such as lead and antimony and other rubbish and that there was a speck or two of gold visible  after a great deal of effort we managed to discern some little fine yellow specks and judged that a couple of tons of them massed together might make a gold dollar possibly  we were not jubilant but mr ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than that  he saved what he called the richest piece of the rock in order to determine its value by the process called the fireassay  then we named the mine monarch of the mountains modesty of nomenclature is not a prominent feature in the mines and mr ballou wrote out and stuck up the following notice preserving a copy to be entered upon the books in the mining recorders office in the town        notice        we the undersigned claim three claims of three hundred feet each       and one for discovery on this silverbearing quartz lead or lode       extending north and south from this notice with all its dips       spurs and angles variations and sinuosities together with fifty       feet of ground on either side for working the same  we put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made but when we talked the matter all over with mr ballou we felt depressed and dubious  he said that this surface quartz was not all there was of our mine but that the wall or ledge of rock called the monarch of the mountains extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet into the earth he illustrated by saying it was like a curbstone and maintained a nearly uniform thicknesssay twenty feetaway down into the bowels of the earth and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on each side of it and that it kept to itself and maintained its distinctive character always no matter how deep it extended into the earth or how far it stretched itself through and across the hills and valleys  he said it might be a mile deep and ten miles long for all we knew and that wherever we bored into it above ground or below we would find gold and silver in it but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was cased between  and he said that down in the great depths of the ledge was its richness and the deeper it went the richer it grew  therefore instead of working here on the surface we must either bore down into the rock with a shaft till we came to where it was richsay a hundred feet or so or else we must go down into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the mountain side and tap the ledge far under the earth  to do either was plainly the labor of months for we could blast and bore only a few feet a daysome five or six  but this was not all  he said that after we got the ore out it must be hauled in wagons to a distant silvermill ground up and the silver extracted by a tedious and costly process  our fortune seemed a century away  but we went to work  we decided to sink a shaft  so for a week we climbed the mountain laden with picks drills gads crowbars shovels cans of blasting powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main at first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and threw it out with shovels and the hole progressed very well  but the rock became more compact presently and gads and crowbars came into play  but shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder  that was the weariest work  one of us held the iron drill in its place and another would strike with an eightpound sledgeit was like driving nails on a large scale  in the course of an hour or two the drill would reach a depth of two or three feet making a hole a couple of inches in diameter  we would put in a charge of powder insert half a yard of fuse pour in sand and gravel and ram it down then light the fuse and run  when the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air we would go back and find about a bushel of that hard rebellious quartz jolted out  nothing more  one week of this satisfied me  i resigned clagget and oliphant followed  our shaft was only twelve feet deep  we decided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted  so we went down the mountain side and worked a week at the end of which time we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in and judged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the ledge i resigned again and the other boys only held out one day longer we decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted  we wanted a ledge that was already developed  there were none in the camp  we dropped the monarch for the time being  meantime the camp was filling up with people and there was a constantly growing excitement about our humboldt mines  we fell victims to the epidemic and strained every nerve to acquire more feet  we prospected and took up new claims put notices on them and gave them grandiloquent names  we traded some of our feet for feet in other peoples claims in a little while we owned largely in the gray eagle the columbiana the branch mint the maria jane the universe the roothogordie the samson and delilah the treasure trove the golconda the sultana the boomerang the great republic the grand mogul and fifty other mines that had never been molested by a shovel or scratched with a pick  we had not less than thirty thousand feet apiece in the richest mines on earth as the frenzied cant phrased itand were in debt to the butcher  we were stark mad with excitementdrunk with happinesssmothered under mountains of prospective wealtharrogantly compassionate toward the plodding millions who knew not our marvellous canyonbut our credit was not good at the grocers  it was the strangest phase of life one can imagine  it was a beggars revel  there was nothing doing in the districtno miningno milling no productive effortno incomeand not enough money in the entire camp to buy a corner lot in an eastern village hardly and yet a stranger would have supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires prospecting parties swarmed out of town with the first flush of dawn and swarmed in again at nightfall laden with spoilrocks  nothing but rocks  every mans pockets were full of them the floor of his cabin was littered with them they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves     chapter xxx  i met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand feet in undeveloped silver mines every single foot of which they believed would shortly be worth from fifty to a thousand dollarsand as often as any other way they were men who had not twentyfive dollars in the world  every man you met had his new mine to boast of and his specimens ready and if the opportunity offered he would infallibly back you into a corner and offer as a favor to you not to him to part with just a few feet in the golden age or the sarah jane or some other unknown stack of croppings for money enough to get a square meal with as the phrase went  and you were never to reveal that he had made you the offer at such a ruinous price for it was only out of friendship for you that he was willing to make the sacrifice  then he would fish a piece of rock out of his pocket and after looking mysteriously around as if he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in his possession he would dab the rock against his tongue clap an eyeglass to it and exclaim  look at that  right there in that red dirt  see it  see the specks of gold  and the streak of silver  thats from the uncle abe  theres a hundred thousand tons like that in sight  right in sight mind you and when we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid it will be the richest thing in the world  look at the assay  i dont want you to believe melook at the assay  then he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the portion of rock assayed had given evidence of containing silver and gold in the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands of dollars to the ton   i little knew then that the custom was to hunt out the richest piece of rock and get it assayed  very often that piece the size of a filbert was the only fragment in a ton that had a particle of metal in itand yet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton of rubbish it came from  on such a system of assaying as that the humboldt world had gone crazy on the authority of such assays its newspaper correspondents were frothing about rock worth four and seven thousand dollars a ton  and does the reader remember a few pages back the calculations of a quoted correspondent whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the way to england the metals extracted and the gold and silver contents received back by the miners as clear profit the copper antimony and other things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses incurred  everybodys head was full of such calculations as those such raving insanity rather  few people took work into their calculationsor outlay of money either except the work and expenditures of other people  we never touched our tunnel or our shaft again  why  because we judged that we had learned the real secret of success in silver miningwhich was not to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our brows and the labor of our hands but to sell the ledges to the dull slaves of toil and let them do the mining  before leaving carson the secretary and i had purchased feet from various esmeralda stragglers  we had expected immediate returns of bullion but were only afflicted with regular and constant assessments insteaddemands for money wherewith to develop the said mines  these assessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into the matter personally  therefore i projected a pilgrimage to carson and thence to esmeralda  i bought a horse and started in company with mr ballou and a gentleman named ollendorff a prussiannot the party who has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched foreign grammars with their interminable repetitions of questions which never have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation among human beings  we rode through a snowstorm for two or three days and arrived at honey lake smiths a sort of isolated inn on the carson river  it was a twostory log house situated on a small knoll in the midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly carson winds its melancholy way  close to the house were the overland stage stables built of sundried bricks  there was not another building within several leagues of the place  towards sunset about twenty haywagons arrived and camped around the house and all the teamsters came in to suppera very very rough set  there were one or two overland stage drivers there also and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers consequently the house was well crowded  we walked out after supper and visited a small indian camp in the vicinity  the indians were in a great hurry about something and were packing up and getting away as fast as they could  in their broken english they said bymby heap water and by the help of signs made us understand that in their opinion a flood was coming  the weather was perfectly clear and this was not the rainy season  there was about a foot of water in the insignificant riveror maybe two feet the stream was not wider than a back alley in a village and its banks were scarcely higher than a mans head  so where was the flood to come from  we canvassed the subject awhile and then concluded it was a ruse and that the indians had some better reason for leaving in a hurry than fears of a flood in such an exceedingly dry time  at seven in the evening we went to bed in the second storywith our clothes on as usual and all three in the same bed for every available space on the floors chairs etc was in request and even then there was barely room for the housing of the inns guests  an hour later we were awakened by a great turmoil and springing out of bed we picked our way nimbly among the ranks of snoring teamsters on the floor and got to the front windows of the long room  a glance revealed a strange spectacle under the moonlight  the crooked carson was full to the brim and its waters were raging and foaming in the wildest waysweeping around the sharp bends at a furious speed and bearing on their surface a chaos of logs brush and all sorts of rubbish  a depression where its bed had once been in other times was already filling and in one or two places the water was beginning to wash over the main bank  men were flying hither and thither bringing cattle and wagons close up to the house for the spot of high ground on which it stood extended only some thirty feet in front and about a hundred in the rear  close to the old river bed just spoken of stood a little log stable and in this our horses were lodged  while we looked the waters increased so fast in this place that in a few minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs  we suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle but meant damageand not only to the small log stable but to the overland buildings close to the main river for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great haycorral adjoining  we ran down and joined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals  we waded kneedeep into the log stable unfastened the horses and waded out almost waistdeep so fast the waters increased  then the crowd rushed in a body to the haycorral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house  meantime it was discovered that owens an overland driver was missing and a man ran to the large stable and wading in boottop deep discovered him asleep in his bed awoke him and waded out again  but owens was drowsy and resumed his nap but only for a minute or two for presently he turned in his bed his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water it was up level with the mattress  he waded out breastdeep almost and the next moment the sunburned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling  at eleven oclock only the roof of the little log stable was out of water and our inn was on an island in midocean  as far as the eye could reach in the moonlight there was no desert visible but only a level waste of shining water  the indians were true prophets but how did they get their information  i am not able to answer the question we remained cooped up eight days and nights with that curious crew swearing drinking and card playing were the order of the day and occasionally a fight was thrown in for variety  dirt and verminbut let us forget those features their profusion is simply inconceivableit is better that they remain so  there were two menhowever this chapter is long enough     chapter xxxi  there were two men in the company who caused me particular discomfort one was a little swede about twentyfive years old who knew only one song and he was forever singing it  by day we were all crowded into one small stifling barroom and so there was no escaping this persons music  through all the profanity whiskyguzzling old sledge and quarreling his monotonous song meandered with never a variation in its tiresome sameness and it seemed to me at last that i would be content to die in order to be rid of the torture  the other man was a stalwart ruffian called arkansas who carried two revolvers in his belt and a bowie knife projecting from his boot and who was always drunk and always suffering for a fight  but he was so feared that nobody would accommodate him  he would try all manner of little wary ruses to entrap somebody into an offensive remark and his face would light up now and then when he fancied he was fairly on the scent of a fight but invariably his victim would elude his toils and then he would show a disappointment that was almost pathetic  the landlord johnson was a meek wellmeaning fellow and arkansas fastened on him early as a promising subject and gave him no rest day or night for awhile  on the fourth morning arkansas got drunk and sat himself down to wait for an opportunity  presently johnson came in just comfortably sociable with whisky and said  i reckon the pennsylvania lection  arkansas raised his finger impressively and johnson stopped  arkansas rose unsteadily and confronted him  said he  whawhat do you know aabout pennsylvania  answer me that  whawhat do you know bout pennsylvania  i was only goin to say  you was only goin to say  you was  you

thats all  gimme that old flipper agin  they embraced with drunken affection on the landlords part and unresponsive toleration on the part of arkansas who bribed by a drink was disappointed of his prey once more  but the foolish landlord was so happy to have escaped butchery that he went on talking when he ought to have marched himself out of danger  the consequence was that arkansas shortly began to glower upon him dangerously and presently said  lanlord will you pplease make that remark over agin if you please  i was asayin to scotty that my father was upards of eighty year old when he died  was that all that you said  yes that was all  didnt say nothing but that  nonothing  then an uncomfortable silence  arkansas played with his glass a moment lolling on his elbows on the counter  then he meditatively scratched his left shin with his right boot while the awkward silence continued  but presently he loafed away toward the stove looking dissatisfied roughly shouldered two or three men out of a comfortable position occupied it himself gave a sleeping dog a kick that sent him howling under a bench then spread his long legs and his blanketcoat tails apart and proceeded to warm his back  in a little while he fell to grumbling to himself and soon he slouched back to the bar and said  lanlord whats your idea for rakin up old personalities and blowin about your father  aint this company agreeable to you  aint it  if this company aint agreeable to you praps wed better leave  is that your idea  is that what youre coming at  why bless your soul arkansas i warnt thinking of such

murder somebody this mornini knowed it perfectly well  im the man am i  its me youre goin to murder is it  but you cant do it thout i get one chance first you thievin blackhearted whitelivered son of a nigger  draw your weepon  with that arkansas began to shoot and the landlord to clamber over benches men and every sort of obstacle in a frantic desire to escape in the midst of the wild hubbub the landlord crashed through a glass door and as arkansas charged after him the landlords wife suddenly appeared in the doorway and confronted the desperado with a pair of scissors  her fury was magnificent  with head erect and flashing eye she stood a moment and then advanced with her weapon raised  the astonished ruffian hesitated and then fell back a step  she followed she backed him step by step into the middle of the barroom and then while the wondering crowd closed up and gazed she gave him such another tonguelashing as never a cowed and shamefaced braggart got before perhaps  as she finished and retired victorious a roar of applause shook the house and every man ordered drinks for the crowd in one and the same breath  the lesson was entirely sufficient  the reign of terror was over and the arkansas domination broken for good  during the rest of the season of island captivity there was one man who sat apart in a state of permanent humiliation never mixing in any quarrel or uttering a boast and never resenting the insults the once cringing crew now constantly leveled at him and that man was arkansas  by the fifth or sixth morning the waters had subsided from the land but the stream in the old river bed was still high and swift and there was no possibility of crossing it  on the eighth it was still too high for an entirely safe passage but life in the inn had become next to insupportable by reason of the dirt drunkenness fighting etc and so we made an effort to get away  in the midst of a heavy snowstorm we embarked in a canoe taking our saddles aboard and towing our horses after us by their halters  the prussian ollendorff was in the bow with a paddle ballou paddled in the middle and i sat in the stern holding the halters  when the horses lost their footing and began to swim ollendorff got frightened for there was great danger that the horses would make our aim uncertain and it was plain that if we failed to land at a certain spot the current would throw us off and almost surely cast us into the main carson which was a boiling torrent now such a catastrophe would be death in all probability for we would be swept to sea in the sink or overturned and drowned  we warned ollendorff to keep his wits about him and handle himself carefully but it was useless the moment the bow touched the bank he made a spring and the canoe whirled upside down in tenfoot water  ollendorff seized some brush and dragged himself ashore but ballou and i had to swim for it encumbered with our overcoats  but we held on to the canoe and although we were washed down nearly to the carson we managed to push the boat ashore and make a safe landing  we were cold and watersoaked but safe  the horses made a landing too but our saddles were gone of course  we tied the animals in the sagebrush and there they had to stay for twentyfour hours  we baled out the canoe and ferried over some food and blankets for them but we slept one more night in the inn before making another venture on our journey  the next morning it was still snowing furiously when we got away with our new stock of saddles and accoutrements  we mounted and started  the snow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign of a road perceptible and the snowfall was so thick that we could not see more than a hundred yards ahead else we could have guided our course by the mountain ranges  the case looked dubious but ollendorff said his instinct was as sensitive as any compass and that he could strike a beeline for carson city and never diverge from it  he said that if he were to straggle a single point out of the true line his instinct would assail him like an outraged conscience  consequently we dropped into his wake happy and content  for half an hour we poked along warily enough but at the end of that time we came upon a fresh trail and ollendorff shouted proudly  i knew i was as dead certain as a compass boys  here we are right in somebodys tracks that will hunt the way for us without any trouble lets hurry up and join company with the party  so we put the horses into as much of a trot as the deep snow would allow and before long it was evident that we were gaining on our predecessors for the tracks grew more distinct  we hurried along and at the end of an hour the tracks looked still newer and fresherbut what surprised us was that the number of travelers in advance of us seemed to steadily increase  we wondered how so large a party came to be traveling at such a time and in such a solitude  somebody suggested that it must be a company of soldiers from the fort and so we accepted that solution and jogged along a little faster still for they could not be far off now but the tracks still multiplied and we began to think the platoon of soldiers was miraculously expanding into a regimentballou said they had already increased to five hundred  presently he stopped his horse and said  boys these are our own tracks and weve actually been circussing round and round in a circle for more than two hours out here in this blind desert  by george this is perfectly hydraulic  then the old man waxed wroth and abusive  he called ollendorff all manner of hard namessaid he never saw such a lurid fool as he was and ended with the peculiarly venomous opinion that he did not know as much as a logarythm  we certainly had been following our own tracks  ollendorff and his mental compass were in disgrace from that moment  after all our hard travel here we were on the bank of the stream again with the inn beyond dimly outlined through the driving snowfall  while we were considering what to do the young swede landed from the canoe and took his pedestrian way carsonwards singing his same tiresome song about his sister and his brother and the child in the grave with its mother and in a short minute faded and disappeared in the white oblivion  he was never heard of again  he no doubt got bewildered and lost and fatigue delivered him over to sleep and sleep betrayed him to death  possibly he followed our treacherous tracks till he became exhausted and dropped  presently the overland stage forded the now fast receding stream and started toward carson on its first trip since the flood came  we hesitated no longer now but took up our march in its wake and trotted merrily along for we had good confidence in the drivers bump of locality  but our horses were no match for the fresh stage team  we were soon left out of sight but it was no matter for we had the deep ruts the wheels made for a guide  by this time it was three in the afternoon and consequently it was not very long before night cameand not with a lingering twilight but with a sudden shutting down like a cellar door as is its habit in that country  the snowfall was still as thick as ever and of course we could not see fifteen steps before us but all about us the white glare of the snowbed enabled us to discern the smooth sugarloaf mounds made by the covered sagebushes and just in front of us the two faint grooves which we knew were the steadily filling and slowly disappearing wheeltracks  now those sagebushes were all about the same heightthree or four feet they stood just about seven feet apart all over the vast desert each of them was a mere snowmound now in any direction that you proceeded the same as in a well laid out orchard you would find yourself moving down a distinctly defined avenue with a row of these snowmounds an either side of itan avenue the customary width of a road nice and level in its breadth and rising at the sides in the most natural way by reason of the mounds  but we had not thought of this  then imagine the chilly thrill that shot through us when it finally occurred to us far in the night that since the last faint trace of the wheeltracks had long ago been buried from sight we might now be wandering down a mere sagebrush avenue miles away from the road and diverging further and further away from it all the time  having a cake of ice slipped down ones back is placid comfort compared to it  there was a sudden leap and stir of blood that had been asleep for an hour and as sudden a rousing of all the drowsing activities in our minds and bodies  we were alive and awake at onceand shaking and quaking with consternation too  there was an instant halting and dismounting a bending low and an anxious scanning of the roadbed  useless of course for if a faint depression could not be discerned from an altitude of four or five feet above it it certainly could not with ones nose nearly against it     chapter xxxii  we seemed to be in a road but that was no proof  we tested this by walking off in various directionsthe regular snowmounds and the regular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the true road and that the others had found only false ones  plainly the situation was desperate  we were cold and stiff and the horses were tired  we decided to build a sagebrush fire and camp out till morning this was wise because if we were wandering from the right road and the snowstorm continued another day our case would be the next thing to hopeless if we kept on  all agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us now and so we set about building it  we could find no matches and so we tried to make shift with the pistols  not a man in the party had ever tried to do such a thing before but not a man in the party doubted that it could be done and without any troublebecause every man in the party had read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to believe it with trusting simplicity just as he had long ago accepted and believed that other common bookfraud about indians and lost hunters making a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together  we huddled together on our knees in the deep snow and the horses put their noses together and bowed their patient heads over us and while the feathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white statuary we proceeded with the momentous experiment  we broke twigs from a sage bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter of our bodies  in the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready and then while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious suspense ollendorff applied his revolver pulled the trigger and blew the pile clear out of the county  it was the flattest failure that ever was  this was distressing but it paled before a greater horrorthe horses were gone  i had been appointed to hold the bridles but in my absorbing anxiety over the pistol experiment i had unconsciously dropped them and the released animals had walked off in the storm  it was useless to try to follow them for their footfalls could make no sound and one could pass within two yards of the creatures and never see them  we gave them up without an effort at recovering them and cursed the lying books that said horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship in a distressful time like ours  we were miserable enough before we felt still more forlorn now patiently but with blighted hope we broke more sticks and piled them and once more the prussian shot them into annihilation  plainly to light a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience and the middle of a desert at midnight in a snowstorm was not a good place or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment  we gave it up and tried the other  each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing them together  at the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled and so were the sticks  we bitterly execrated the indians the hunters and the books that had betrayed us with the silly device and wondered dismally what was next to be done  at this critical moment mr ballou fished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket  to have found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck compared to this  one cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstancesor how lovable and precious and sacredly beautiful to the eye  this time we gathered sticks with high hopes and when mr ballou prepared to light the first match there was an amount of interest centred upon him that pages of writing could not describe  the match burned hopefully a moment and then went out  it could not have carried more regret with it if it had been a human life  the next match simply flashed and died the wind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of success  we gathered together closer than ever and developed a solicitude that was rapt and painful as mr ballou scratched our last hope on his leg  it lit burned blue and sickly and then budded into a robust flame  shading it with his hands the old gentleman bent gradually down and every heart went with himeverybody too for that matterand blood and breath stood still  the flame touched the sticks at last took gradual hold upon themhesitatedtook a stronger hold hesitated againheld its breath five heartbreaking seconds then gave a sort of human gasp and went out  nobody said a word for several minutes  it was a solemn sort of silence even the wind put on a stealthy sinister quiet and made no more noise than the falling flakes of snow  finally a sadvoiced conversation began and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the conviction that this was our last night with the living  i had so hoped that i was the only one who felt so  when the others calmly acknowledged their conviction it sounded like the summons itself  ollendorff said  brothers let us die together  and let us go without one hard feeling towards each other  let us forget and forgive bygones  i know that you have felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe and for knowing too much and leading you round and round in the snowbut i meant well forgive me  i acknowledge freely that i have had hard feelings against mr ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm which is a thing i do not know what but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and unbecoming in america and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has hurt me a great dealbut let it go i forgive mr ballou with all my heart and  poor ollendorff broke down and the tears came  he was not alone for i was crying too and so was mr ballou  ollendorff got his voice again and forgave me for things i had done and said  then he got out his bottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never touch another drop  he said he had given up all hope of life and although illprepared was ready to submit humbly to his fate that he wished he could be spared a little longer not for any selfish reason but to make a thorough reform in his character and by devoting himself to helping the poor nursing the sick and pleading with the people to guard themselves against the evils of intemperance make his life a beneficent example to the young and lay it down at last with the precious reflection that it had not been lived in vain  he ended by saying that his reform should begin at this moment even here in the presence of death since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to prosecute it to mens help and benefitand with that he threw away the bottle of whisky  mr ballou made remarks of similar purport and began the reform he could not live to continue by throwing away the ancient pack of cards that had solaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable  he said he never gambled but still was satisfied that the meddling with cards in any way was immoral and injurious and no man could be wholly pure and blemishless without eschewing them  and therefore continued he in doing this act i already feel more in sympathy with that spiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform  these rolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have done and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with satisfaction  my own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades and i know that the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere  we were all sincere and all deeply moved and earnest for we were in the presence of death and without hope  i threw away my pipe and in doing it felt that at last i was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden me like a tyrant all my days  while i yet talked the thought of the good i might have done in the world and the still greater good i might now do with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide me if i could only be spared a few years longer overcame me and the tears came again  we put our arms about each others necks and awaited the warning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing  it came stealing over us presently and then we bade each other a last farewell  a delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding senses while the snowflakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered body  oblivion came  the battle of life was done     chapter xxxiii  i do not know how long i was in a state of forgetfulness but it seemed an age  a vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees and then came a gathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body  i shuddered  the thought flitted through my brain this is deaththis is the hereafter  then came a white upheaval at my side and a voice said with bitterness  will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind  it was ballouat least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture with ballous voice  i rose up and there in the gray dawn not fifteen steps from us were the frame buildings of a stage station and under a shed stood our still saddled and bridled horses  an arched snowdrift broke up now and ollendorff emerged from it and the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word we really had nothing to say  we were like the profane man who could not do the subject justice the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to commence anyhow  the joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned wellnigh dissipated indeed  we presently began to grow pettish by degrees and sullen and then angry at each other angry at ourselves angry at everything in general we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and in unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses unsaddled them and sought shelter in the station  i have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd adventure  it occurred almost exactly as i have stated it  we actually went into camp in a snowdrift in a desert at midnight in a storm forlorn and hopeless within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn  for two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust the mystery was gone now and it was plain enough why the horses had deserted us  without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a minute after they had left us and they must have overheard and enjoyed all our confessions and lamentations  after breakfast we felt better and the zest of life soon came back the world looked bright again and existence was as dear to us as ever presently an uneasiness came over megrew upon meassailed me without ceasing  alas my regeneration was not completei wanted to smoke i resisted with all my strength but the flesh was weak  i wandered away alone and wrestled with myself an hour  i recalled my promises of reform and preached to myself persuasively upbraidingly exhaustively  but it was all vain i shortly found myself sneaking among the snowdrifts hunting for my pipe  i discovered it after a considerable search and crept away to hide myself and enjoy it  i remained behind the barn a good while asking myself how i would feel if my braver stronger truer comrades should catch me in my degradation  at last i lit the pipe and no human being can feel meaner and baser than i did then  i was ashamed of being in my own pitiful company  still dreading discovery i felt that perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer and so i turned the corner  as i turned the one corner smoking ollendorff turned the other with his bottle to his lips and between us sat unconscious ballou deep in a game of solitaire with the old greasy cards  absurdity could go no farther  we shook hands and agreed to say no more about reform and examples to the rising generation  the station we were at was at the verge of the twentysixmile desert if we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before we must have heard men shouting there and firing pistols for they were expecting some sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would infallibly get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by sounds  while we remained at the station three of the drovers arrived nearly exhausted with their wanderings but two others of their party were never heard of afterward  we reached carson in due time and took a rest  this rest together with preparations for the journey to esmeralda kept us there a week and the delay gave us the opportunity to be present at the trial of the great landslide case of hyde vs morganan episode which is famous in nevada to this day  after a word or two of necessary explanation i will set down the history of this singular affair just as it transpired     chapter xxxiv  the mountains are very high and steep about carson eagle and washoe valleysvery high and very steep and so when the snow gets to melting off fast in the spring and the warm surfaceearth begins to moisten and soften the disastrous landslides commence  the reader cannot know what a landslide is unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole side of a mountain taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the valley leaving a vast treeless unsightly scar upon the mountains front to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he may go on living within seventy miles of that place  general buncombe was shipped out to nevada in the invoice of territorial officers to be united states attorney  he considered himself a lawyer of parts and he very much wanted an opportunity to manifest itpartly for the pure gratification of it and partly because his salary was territorially meagre which is a strong expression  now the older citizens of a new territory look down upon the rest of the world with a calm benevolent compassion as long as it keeps out of the waywhen it gets in the way they snub it  sometimes this latter takes the shape of a practical joke  one morning dick hyde rode furiously up to general buncombes door in carson city and rushed into his presence without stopping to tie his horse  he seemed much excited  he told the general that he wanted him to conduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundred dollars if he achieved a victory  and then with violent gestures and a world of profanity he poured out his grief  he said it was pretty well known that for some years he had been farming or ranching as the more customary term is in washoe district and making a successful thing of it and furthermore it was known that his ranch was situated just in the edge of the valley and that tom morgan owned a ranch immediately above it on the mountain side  and now the trouble was that one of those hated and dreaded landslides had come and slid morgans ranch fences cabins cattle barns and everything down on top of his ranch and exactly covered up every single vestige of his property to a depth of about thirtyeight feet  morgan was in possession and refused to vacate the premisessaid he was occupying his own cabin and not interfering with anybody elsesand said the cabin was standing on the same dirt and same ranch it had always stood on and he would like to see anybody make him vacate  and when i reminded him said hyde weeping that it was on top of my ranch and that he was trespassing he had the infernal meanness to ask me why didnt i stay on my ranch and hold possession when i see him acoming  why didnt i stay on it the blathering lunaticby george when i heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the whole world was aripping and atearing down that mountain side splinters and cordwood thunder and lightning hail and snow odds and ends of hay stacks and awful clouds of dusttrees going end over end in the air rocks as big as a house jumping bout a thousand feet high and busting into ten million pieces cattle turned inside out and acoming head on with their tails hanging out between their teethand in the midst of all that wrack and destruction sot that cussed morgan on his gatepost awondering why i didnt stay and hold possession  laws bless me i just took one glimpse general and lit outn the county in three jumps exactly  but what grinds me is that that morgan hangs on there and wont move offn that ranchsays its hisn and hes going to keep itlikes it bettern he did when it was higher up the hill  mad  well ive been so mad for two days i couldnt find my way to townbeen wandering around in the brush in a starving conditiongot anything here to drink general but im here now and im agoing to law  you hear me  never in all the world perhaps were a mans feelings so outraged as were the generals  he said he had never heard of such highhanded conduct in all his life as this morgans  and he said there was no use in going to lawmorgan had no shadow of right to remain where he was nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it and no lawyer would take his case and no judge listen to it  hyde said that right there was where he was mistakeneverybody in town sustained morgan hal brayton a very smart lawyer had taken his case the courts being in vacation it was to be tried before a referee and exgovernor roop had already been appointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall near the hotel at two that afternoon  the general was amazed  he said he had suspected before that the people of that territory were fools and now he knew it  but he said rest easy rest easy and collect the witnesses for the victory was just as certain as if the conflict were already over  hyde wiped away his tears and left  at two in the afternoon referee roops court opened and roop appeared throned among his sheriffs the witnesses and spectators and wearing upon his face a solemnity so aweinspiring that some of his fellowconspirators had misgivings that maybe he had not comprehended after all that this was merely a joke  an unearthly stillness prevailed for at the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the command  order in the court  and the sheriffs promptly echoed it  presently the general elbowed his way through the crowd of spectators with his arms full of lawbooks and on his ears fell an order from the judge which was the first respectful recognition of his high official dignity that had ever saluted them and it trickled pleasantly through his whole system  way for the united states attorney  the witnesses were calledlegislators high government officers ranchmen miners indians chinamen negroes  three fourths of them were called by the defendant morgan but no matter their testimony invariably went in favor of the plaintiff hyde  each new witness only added new testimony to the absurdity of a mans claiming to own another mans property because his farm had slid down on top of it  then the morgan lawyers made their speeches and seemed to make singularly weak ones they did really nothing to help the morgan cause  and now the general with exultation in his face got up and made an impassioned effort he pounded the table he banged the lawbooks he shouted and roared and howled he quoted from everything and everybody poetry sarcasm statistics history pathos bathos blasphemy and wound up with a grand warwhoop for free speech freedom of the press free schools the glorious bird of america and the principles of eternal justice applause  when the general sat down he did it with the conviction that if there was anything in good strong testimony a great speech and believing and admiring countenances all around mr morgans case was killed exgovernor roop leant his head upon his hand for some minutes thinking and the still audience waited for his decision  then he got up and stood erect with bended head and thought again  then he walked the floor with long deliberate strides his chin in his hand and still the audience waited  at last he returned to his throne seated himself and began impressively  gentlemen i feel the great responsibility that rests upon me this day this is no ordinary case  on the contrary it is plain that it is the most solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide gentlemen i have listened attentively to the evidence and have perceived that the weight of it the overwhelming weight of it is in favor of the plaintiff hyde  i have listened also to the remarks of counsel with high interestand especially will i commend the masterly and irrefutable logic of the distinguished gentleman who represents the plaintiff  but gentlemen let us beware how we allow mere human testimony human ingenuity in argument and human ideas of equity to influence us at a moment so solemn as this  gentlemen it ill becomes us worms as we are to meddle with the decrees of heaven  it is plain to me that heaven in its inscrutable wisdom has seen fit to move this defendants ranch for a purpose  we are but creatures and we must submit  if heaven has chosen to favor the defendant morgan in this marked and wonderful manner and if heaven dissatisfied with the position of the morgan ranch upon the mountain side has chosen to remove it to a position more eligible and more advantageous for its owner it ill becomes us insects as we are to question the legality of the act or inquire into the reasons that prompted it  noheaven created the ranches and it is heavens prerogative to rearrange them to experiment with them around at its pleasure  it is for us to submit without repining  i warn you that this thing which has happened is a thing with which the sacrilegious hands and brains and tongues of men must not meddle gentlemen it is the verdict of this court that the plaintiff richard hyde has been deprived of his ranch by the visitation of god  and from this decision there is no appeal  buncombe seized his cargo of lawbooks and plunged out of the courtroom frantic with indignation  he pronounced roop to be a miraculous fool an inspired idiot  in all good faith he returned at night and remonstrated with roop upon his extravagant decision and implored him to walk the floor and think for half an hour and see if he could not figure out some sort of modification of the verdict  roop yielded at last and got up to walk  he walked two hours and a half and at last his face lit up happily and he told buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch underneath the new morgan ranch still belonged to hyde that his title to the ground was just as good as it had ever been and therefore he was of opinion that hyde had a right to dig it out from under there and  the general never waited to hear the end of it  he was always an impatient and irascible man that way  at the end of two months the fact that he had been played upon with a joke had managed to bore itself like another hoosac tunnel through the solid adamant of his understanding     chapter xxxv  when we finally left for esmeralda horseback we had an addition to the company in the person of capt john nye the governors brother  he had a good memory and a tongue hung in the middle  this is a combination which gives immortality to conversation  capt john never suffered the talk to flag or falter once during the hundred and twenty miles of the journey  in addition to his conversational powers he had one or two other endowments of a marked character  one was a singular handiness about doing anything and everything from laying out a railroad or organizing a political party down to sewing on buttons shoeing a horse or setting a broken leg or a hen  another was a spirit of accommodation that prompted him to take the needs difficulties and perplexities of anybody and everybody upon his own shoulders at any and all times and dispose of them with admirable facility and alacrityhence he always managed to find vacant beds in crowded inns and plenty to eat in the emptiest larders  and finally wherever he met a man woman or child in camp inn or desert he either knew such parties personally or had been acquainted with a relative of the same  such another traveling comrade was never seen before  i cannot forbear giving a specimen of the way in which he overcame difficulties  on the second day out we arrived very tired and hungry at a poor little inn in the desert and were told that the house was full no provisions on hand and neither hay nor barley to spare for the horsesmust move on  the rest of us wanted to hurry on while it was yet light but capt john insisted on stopping awhile we dismounted and entered  there was no welcome for us on any face capt john began his blandishments and within twenty minutes he had accomplished the following things viz found old acquaintances in three teamsters discovered that he used to go to school with the landlords mother recognized his wife as a lady whose life he had saved once in california by stopping her runaway horse mended a childs broken toy and won the favor of its mother a guest of the inn helped the hostler bleed a horse and prescribed for another horse that had the heaves treated the entire party three times at the landlords bar produced a later paper than anybody had seen for a week and sat himself down to read the news to a deeply interested audience  the result summed up was as follows the hostler found plenty of feed for our horses we had a trout supper an exceedingly sociable time after it good beds to sleep in and a surprising breakfast in the morningand when we left we left lamented by all  capt john had some bad traits but he had some uncommonly valuable ones to offset them with  esmeralda was in many respects another humboldt but in a little more forward state  the claims we had been paying assessments on were entirely worthless and we threw them away  the principal one cropped out of the top of a knoll that was fourteen feet high and the inspired board of directors were running a tunnel under that knoll to strike the ledge  the tunnel would have to be seventy feet long and would then strike the ledge at the same dept that a shaft twelve feet deep would have reached  the board were living on the assessments  nbthis hint comes too late for the enlightenment of new york silver miners they have already learned all about this neat trick by experience  the board had no desire to strike the ledge knowing that it was as barren of silver as a curbstone  this reminiscence calls to mind jim townsends tunnel  he had paid assessments on a mine called the daley till he was wellnigh penniless  finally an assessment was levied to run a tunnel two hundred and fifty feet on the daley and townsend went up on the hill to look into matters  he found the daley cropping out of the apex of an exceedingly sharppointed peak and a couple of men up there facing the proposed tunnel townsend made a calculation  then he said to the men  so you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred and fifty feet to strike this ledge  yes sir  well do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and arduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man  why nohow is that  because this hill is only twentyfive feet through from side to side and so you have got to build two hundred and twentyfive feet of your tunnel on trestlework  the ways of silver mining boards are exceedingly dark and sinuous  we took up various claims and commenced shafts and tunnels on them but never finished any of them  we had to do a certain amount of work on each to hold it else other parties could seize our property after the expiration of ten days  we were always hunting up new claims and doing a little work on them and then waiting for a buyerwho never came  we never found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton and as the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for working ore and extracting the silver our pocketmoney melted steadily away and none returned to take its place  we lived in a little cabin and cooked for ourselves and altogether it was a hard life though a hopeful onefor we never ceased to expect fortune and a customer to burst upon us some day  at last when flour reached a dollar a pound and money could not be borrowed on the best security at less than eight per cent a month i being without the security too i abandoned mining and went to milling that is to say i went to work as a common laborer in a quartz mill at ten dollars a week and board     chapter xxxvi  i had already learned how hard and long and dismal a task it is to burrow down into the bowels of the earth and get out the coveted ore and now i learned that the burrowing was only half the work and that to get the silver out of the ore was the dreary and laborious other half of it we had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark this mill was a sixstamp affair driven by steam  six tall upright rods of iron as large as a mans ankle and heavily shod with a mass of iron and steel at their lower ends were framed together like a gate and these rose and fell one after the other in a ponderous dance in an iron box called a battery  each of these rods or stamps weighed six hundred pounds  one of us stood by the battery all day long breaking up masses of silverbearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the battery  the ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to powder and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it to a creamy paste  the minutest particles were driven through a fine wire screen which fitted close around the battery and were washed into great tubs warmed by superheated steamamalgamating pans they are called the mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by revolving mullers  a quantity of quicksilver was kept always in the battery and this seized some of the liberated gold and silver particles and held on to them quicksilver was shaken in a fine shower into the pans also about every half hour through a buckskin sack  quantities of coarse salt and sulphate of copper were added from time to time to assist the amalgamation by destroying base metals which coated the gold and silver and would not let it unite with the quicksilver  all these tiresome things we had to attend to constantly  streams of dirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad wooden troughs to the ravine  one would not suppose that atoms of gold and silver would float on top of six inches of water but they did and in order to catch them coarse blankets were laid in the troughs and little obstructing riffles charged with quicksilver were placed here and there across the troughs also  these riffles had to be cleaned and the blankets washed out every evening to get their precious accumulationsand after all this eternity of trouble one third of the silver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way to the end of the troughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day there is nothing so aggravating as silver milling  there never was any idle time in that mill  there was always something to do  it is a pity that adam could not have gone straight out of eden into a quartz mill in order to understand the full force of his doom to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow  every now and then during the day we had to scoop some pulp out of the pans and tediously wash it in a horn spoonwash it little by little over the edge till at last nothing was left but some little dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom  if they were soft and yielding the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of copper or some other chemical rubbish to assist digestion if they were crisp to the touch and would retain a dint they were freighted with all the silver and gold they could seize and hold and consequently the pan needed a fresh charge of quicksilver  when there was nothing else to do one could always screen tailings  that is to say he could shovel up the dried sand that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs and dash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbles and prepare it for working over  the process of amalgamation differed in the various mills and this included changes in style of pans and other machinery and a great diversity of opinion existed as to the best in use but none of the methods employed involved the principle of milling ore without screening the tailings  of all recreations in the world screening tailings on a hot day with a longhandled shovel is the most undesirable  at the end of the week the machinery was stopped and we cleaned up that is to say we got the pulp out of the pans and batteries and washed the mud patiently away till nothing was left but the long accumulating mass of quicksilver with its imprisoned treasures  this we made into heavy compact snowballs and piled them up in a bright luxurious heap for inspection  making these snowballs cost me a fine gold ringthat and ignorance together for the quicksilver invaded the ring with the same facility with which water saturates a spongeseparated its particles and the ring crumbled to pieces  we put our pile of quicksilver balls into an iron retort that had a pipe leading from it to a pail of water and then applied a roasting heat the quicksilver turned to vapor escaped through the pipe into the pail and the water turned it into good wholesome quicksilver again quicksilver is very costly and they never waste it  on opening the retort there was our weeks worka lump of pure white frosty looking silver twice as large as a mans head  perhaps a fifth of the mass was gold but the color of it did not showwould not have shown if two thirds of it had been gold  we melted it up and made a solid brick of it by pouring it into an iron brickmould  by such a tedious and laborious process were silver bricks obtained this mill was but one of many others in operation at the time  the first one in nevada was built at egan canyon and was a small insignificant affair and compared most unfavorably with some of the immense establishments afterwards located at virginia city and elsewhere  from our bricks a little corner was chipped off for the fireassaya method used to determine the proportions of gold silver and base metals in the mass  this is an interesting process  the chip is hammered out as thin as paper and weighed on scales so fine and sensitive that if you weigh a twoinch scrap of paper on them and then write your name on the paper with a course soft pencil and weigh it again the scales will take marked notice of the addition  then a little lead also weighed is rolled up with the flake of silver and the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a cupel made by compressing bone ashes into a cupshape in a steel mold  the base metals oxydize and are absorbed with the lead into the pores of the cupel  a button or globule of perfectly pure gold and silver is left behind and by weighing it and noting the loss the assayer knows the proportion of base metal the brick contains  he has to separate the gold from the silver now  the button is hammered out flat and thin put in the furnace and kept some time at a red heat after cooling it off it is rolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric acid the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready to be weighed on its own merits  then salt water is poured into the vessel containing the dissolved silver and the silver returns to palpable form again and sinks to the bottom  nothing now remains but to weigh it then the proportions of the several metals contained in the brick are known and the assayer stamps the value of the brick upon its surface  the sagacious reader will know now without being told that the speculative miner in getting a fireassay made of a piece of rock from his mine to help him sell the same was not in the habit of picking out the least valuable fragment of rock on his dumppile but quite the contrary  i have seen men hunt over a pile of nearly worthless quartz for an hour and at last find a little piece as large as a filbert which was rich in gold and silverand this was reserved for a fireassay  of course the fireassay would demonstrate that a ton of such rock would yield hundreds of dollarsand on such assays many an utterly worthless mine was sold  assaying was a good business and so some men engaged in it occasionally who were not strictly scientific and capable  one assayer got such rich results out of all specimens brought to him that in time he acquired almost a monopoly of the business  but like all men who achieve success he became an object of envy and suspicion  the other assayers entered into a conspiracy against him and let some prominent citizens into the secret in order to show that they meant fairly  then they broke a little fragment off a carpenters grindstone and got a stranger to take it to the popular scientist and get it assayed  in the course of an hour the result camewhereby it appeared that a ton of that rock would yield 118440 in silver and 36636 in gold  due publication of the whole matter was made in the paper and the popular assayer left town between two days  i will remark in passing that i only remained in the milling business one week  i told my employer i could not stay longer without an advance in my wages that i liked quartz milling indeed was infatuated with it that i had never before grown so tenderly attached to an occupation in so short a time that nothing it seemed to me gave such scope to intellectual activity as feeding a battery and screening tailings and nothing so stimulated the moral attributes as retorting bullion and washing blanketsstill i felt constrained to ask an increase of salary he said he was paying me ten dollars a week and thought it a good round sum  how much did i want  i said about four hundred thousand dollars a month and board was about all i could reasonably ask considering the hard times  i was ordered off the premises  and yet when i look back to those days and call to mind the exceeding hardness of the labor i performed in that mill i only regret that i did not ask him seven hundred thousand  shortly after this i began to grow crazy along with the rest of the population about the mysterious and wonderful cement mine and to make preparations to take advantage of any opportunity that might offer to go and help hunt for it     chapter xxxvii  it was somewhere in the neighborhood of mono lake that the marvellous whiteman cement mine was supposed to lie  every now and then it would be reported that mr w had passed stealthily through esmeralda at dead of night in disguise and then we would have a wild excitementbecause he must be steering for his secret mine and now was the time to follow him in less than three hours after daylight all the horses and mules and donkeys in the vicinity would be bought hired or stolen and half the community would be off for the mountains following in the wake of whiteman  but w would drift about through the mountain gorges for days together in a purposeless sort of way until the provisions of the miners ran out and they would have to go back home  i have known it reported at eleven at night in a large mining camp that whiteman had just passed through and in two hours the streets so quiet before would be swarming with men and animals  every individual would be trying to be very secret but yet venturing to whisper to just one neighbor that w had passed through  and long before daylightthis in the dead of winterthe stampede would be complete the camp deserted and the whole population gone chasing after w  the tradition was that in the early immigration more than twenty years ago three young germans brothers who had survived an indian massacre on the plains wandered on foot through the deserts avoiding all trails and roads and simply holding a westerly direction and hoping to find california before they starved or died of fatigue  and in a gorge in the mountains they sat down to rest one day when one of them noticed a curious vein of cement running along the ground shot full of lumps of dull yellow metal  they saw that it was gold and that here was a fortune to be acquired in a single day  the vein was about as wide as a curbstone and fully two thirds of it was pure gold  every pound of the wonderful cement was worth wellnigh 200  each of the brothers loaded himself with about twentyfive pounds of it and then they covered up all traces of the vein made a rude drawing of the locality and the principal landmarks in the vicinity and started westward again  but troubles thickened about them  in their wanderings one brother fell and broke his leg and the others were obliged to go on and leave him to die in the wilderness  another worn out and starving gave up by and by and laid down to die but after two or three weeks of incredible hardships the third reached the settlements of california exhausted sick and his mind deranged by his sufferings  he had thrown away all his cement but a few fragments but these were sufficient to set everybody wild with excitement  however he had had enough of the cement country and nothing could induce him to lead a party thither  he was entirely content to work on a farm for wages  but he gave whiteman his map and described the cement region as well as he could and thus transferred the curse to that gentlemanfor when i had my one accidental glimpse of mr w in esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine in hunger and thirst poverty and sickness for twelve or thirteen years some people believed he had found it but most people believed he had not  i saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have been given to whiteman by the young german and it was of a seductive nature  lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice of fruit cake  the privilege of working such a mine one week would be sufficient for a man of reasonable desires  a new partner of ours a mr higbie knew whiteman well by sight and a friend of ours a mr van dorn was well acquainted with him and not only that but had whitemans promise that he should have a private hint in time to enable him to join the next cement expedition  van dorn had promised to extend the hint to us  one evening higbie came in greatly excited and said he felt certain he had recognized whiteman up town disguised and in a pretended state of intoxication  in a little while van dorn arrived and confirmed the news and so we gathered in our cabin and with heads close together arranged our plans in impressive whispers  we were to leave town quietly after midnight in two or three small parties so as not to attract attention and meet at dawn on the divide overlooking mono lake eight or nine miles distant  we were to make no noise after starting and not speak above a whisper under any circumstances  it was believed that for once whitemans presence was unknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected  our conclave broke up at nine oclock and we set about our preparation diligently and with profound secrecy  at eleven oclock we saddled our horses hitched them with their long riatas or lassos and then brought out a side of bacon a sack of beans a small sack of coffee some sugar a hundred pounds of flour in sacks some tin cups and a coffee pot frying pan and some few other necessary articles  all these things were packed on the back of a led horseand whoever has not been taught by a spanish adept to pack an animal let him never hope to do the thing by natural smartness  that is impossible  higbie had had some experience but was not perfect  he put on the pack saddle a thing like a sawbuck piled the property on it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under it every which way taking a hitch in it every now and then and occasionally surging back on it till the horses sides sunk in and he gasped for breathbut every time the lashings grew tight in one place they loosened in another we never did get the load tight all over but we got it so that it would do after a fashion and then we started in single file close order and without a word  it was a dark night  we kept the middle of the road and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows of cabins and whenever a miner came to his door i trembled for fear the light would shine on us an excite curiosity  but nothing happened  we began the long winding ascent of the canyon toward the divide and presently the cabins began to grow infrequent and the intervals between them wider and wider and then i began to breathe tolerably freely and feel less like a thief and a murderer  i was in the rear leading the pack horse  as the ascent grew steeper he grew proportionately less satisfied with his cargo and began to pull back on his riata occasionally and delay progress  my comrades were passing out of sight in the gloom  i was getting anxious  i coaxed and bullied the pack horse till i presently got him into a trot and then the tin cups and pans strung about his person frightened him and he ran his riata was wound around the pummel of my saddle and so as he went by he dragged me from my horse and the two animals traveled briskly on without me  but i was not alonethe loosened cargo tumbled overboard from the pack horse and fell close to me  it was abreast of almost the last cabin  a miner came out and said  hello  i was thirty steps from him and knew he could not see me it was so very dark in the shadow of the mountain  so i lay still  another head appeared in the light of the cabin door and presently the two men walked toward me  they stopped within ten steps of me and one said  sh  listen  i could not have been in a more distressed state if i had been escaping justice with a price on my head  then the miners appeared to sit down on a boulder though i could not see them distinctly enough to be very sure what they did  one said  i heard a noise as plain as i ever heard anything  it seemed to be about there  a stone whizzed by my head  i flattened myself out in the dust like a postage stamp and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little he would probably hear another noise  in my heart now i execrated secret expeditions  i promised myself that this should be my last though the sierras were ribbed with cement veins  then one of the men said  ill tell you what  welch knew what he was talking about when he said he saw whiteman today  i heard horsesthat was the noise  i am going down to welchs right away  they left and i was glad  i did not care whither they went so they went  i was willing they should visit welch and the sooner the better  as soon as they closed their cabin door my comrades emerged from the gloom they had caught the horses and were waiting for a clear coast again  we remounted the cargo on the pack horse and got under way and as day broke we reached the divide and joined van dorn  then we journeyed down into the valley of the lake and feeling secure we halted to cook breakfast for we were tired and sleepy and hungry  three hours later the rest of the population filed over the divide in a long procession and drifted off out of sight around the borders of the lake  whether or not my accident had produced this result we never knew but at least one thing was certainthe secret was out and whiteman would not enter upon a search for the cement mine this time  we were filled with chagrin  we held a council and decided to make the best of our misfortune and enjoy a weeks holiday on the borders of the curious lake  mono it is sometimes called and sometimes the dead sea of california  it is one of the strangest freaks of nature to be found in any land but it is hardly ever mentioned in print and very seldom visited because it lies away off the usual routes of travel and besides is so difficult to get at that only men content to endure the roughest life will consent to take upon themselves the discomforts of such a trip  on the morning of our second day we traveled around to a remote and particularly wild spot on the borders of the lake where a stream of fresh icecold water entered it from the mountain side and then we went regularly into camp  we hired a large boat and two shotguns from a lonely ranchman who lived some ten miles further on and made ready for comfort and recreation we soon got thoroughly acquainted with the lake and all its peculiarities     chapter xxxviii  mono lake lies in a lifeless treeless hideous desert eight thousand feet above the level of the sea and is guarded by mountains two thousand feet higher whose summits are always clothed in clouds  this solemn silent sailless seathis lonely tenant of the loneliest spot on earth is little graced with the picturesque  it is an unpretending expanse of grayish water about a hundred miles in circumference with two islands in its centre mere upheavals of rent and scorched and blistered lava snowed over with gray banks and drifts of pumicestone and ashes the winding sheet of the dead volcano whose vast crater the lake has seized upon and occupied  the lake is two hundred feet deep and its sluggish waters are so strong with alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly soiled garment into them once or twice and wring it out it will be found as clean as if it had been through the ablest of washerwomens hands  while we camped there our laundry work was easy  we tied the weeks washing astern of our boat and sailed a quarter of a mile and the job was complete all to the wringing out  if we threw the water on our heads and gave them a rub or so the white lather would pile up three inches high  this water is not good for bruised places and abrasions of the skin  we had a valuable dog  he had raw places on him  he had more raw places on him than sound ones  he was the rawest dog i almost ever saw  he jumped overboard one day to get away from the flies  but it was bad judgment in his condition it would have been just as comfortable to jump into the fire  the alkali water nipped him in all the raw places simultaneously and he struck out for the shore with considerable interest  he yelped and barked and howled as he wentand by the time he got to the shore there was no bark to himfor he had barked the bark all out of his inside and the alkali water had cleaned the bark all off his outside and he probably wished he had never embarked in any such enterprise  he ran round and round in a circle and pawed  the earth and clawed the air and threw double somersaults sometimes backward and sometimes forward in the most extraordinary manner  he was not a demonstrative dog as a general thing but rather of a grave and serious turn of mind and i never saw him take so much interest in anything before  he finally struck out over the mountains at a gait which we estimated at about two hundred and fifty miles an hour and he is going yet  this was about nine years ago  we look for what is left of him along here every day  a white man cannot drink the water of mono lake for it is nearly pure lye  it is said that the indians in the vicinity drink it sometimes though  it is not improbable for they are among the purest liars i ever saw  there will be no additional charge for this joke except to parties requiring an explanation of it  this joke has received high commendation from some of the ablest minds of the age  there are no fish in mono lakeno frogs no snakes no polliwigs nothing in fact that goes to make life desirable  millions of wild ducks and seagulls swim about the surface but no living thing exists under the surface except a white feathery sort of worm one half an inch long which looks like a bit of white thread frayed out at the sides  if you dip up a gallon of water you will get about fifteen thousand of these  they give to the water a sort of grayishwhite appearance  then there is a fly which looks something like our house fly  these settle on the beach to eat the worms that wash ashoreand any time you can see there a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide and this belt extends clear around the lakea belt of flies one hundred miles long if you throw a stone among them they swarm up so thick that they look dense like a cloud  you can hold them under water as long as you pleasethey do not mind itthey are only proud of it  when you let them go they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report and walk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially with a view to affording instructive entertainment to man in that particular way  providence leaves nothing to go by chance  all things have their uses and their part and proper place in natures economy the ducks eat the fliesthe flies eat the wormsthe indians eat all threethe wild cats eat the indiansthe white folks eat the wild catsand thus all things are lovely  mono lake is a hundred miles in a straight line from the oceanand between it and the ocean are one or two ranges of mountainsyet thousands of seagulls go there every season to lay their eggs and rear their young  one would as soon expect to find seagulls in kansas and in this connection let us observe another instance of natures wisdom  the islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava coated over with ashes and pumicestone and utterly innocent of vegetation or anything that would burn and seagulls eggs being entirely useless to anybody unless they be cooked nature has provided an unfailing spring of boiling water on the largest island and you can put your eggs in there and in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement i have made during the past fifteen years  within ten feet of the boiling spring is a spring of pure cold water sweet and wholesome  so in that island you get your board and washing free of chargeand if nature had gone further and furnished a nice american hotel clerk who was crusty and disobliging and didnt know anything about the time tables or the railroad routesoranythingand was proud of iti would not wish for a more desirable boardinghouse  half a dozen little mountain brooks flow into mono lake but not a stream of any kind flows out of it  it neither rises nor falls apparently and what it does with its surplus water is a dark and bloody mystery  there are only two seasons in the region round about mono lakeand these are the breaking up of one winter and the beginning of the next  more than once in esmeralda i have seen a perfectly blistering morning open up with the thermometer at ninety degrees at eight oclock and seen the snow fall fourteen inches deep and that same identical thermometer go down to fortyfour degrees under shelter before nine oclock at night under favorable circumstances it snows at least once in every single month in the year in the little town of mono  so uncertain is the climate in summer that a lady who goes out visiting cannot hope to be prepared for all emergencies unless she takes her fan under one arm and her snow shoes under the other  when they have a fourth of july procession it generally snows on them and they do say that as a general thing when a man calls for a brandy toddy there the bar keeper chops it off with a hatchet and wraps it up in a paper like maple sugar  and it is further reported that the old soakers havent any teethwore them out eating gin cocktails and brandy punches  i do not endorse that statementi simply give it for what it is worthand it is worthwell i should say millions to any man who can believe it without straining himself  but i do endorse the snow on the fourth of julybecause i know that to be true     chapter xxxix  about seven oclock one blistering hot morningfor it was now dead summer timehigbie and i took the boat and started on a voyage of discovery to the two islands  we had often longed to do this but had been deterred by the fear of storms for they were frequent and severe enough to capsize an ordinary rowboat like ours without great difficultyand once capsized death would ensue in spite of the bravest swimming for that venomous water would eat a mans eyes out like fire and burn him out inside too if he shipped a sea  it was called twelve miles straight out to the islandsa long pull and a warm onebut the morning was so quiet and sunny and the lake so smooth and glassy and dead that we could not resist the temptation  so we filled two large tin canteens with water since we were not acquainted with the locality of the spring said to exist on the large island and started  higbies brawny muscles gave the boat good speed but by the time we reached our destination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than twelve  we landed on the big island and went ashore  we tried the water in the canteens now and found that the sun had spoiled it it was so brackish that we could not drink it so we poured it out and began a search for the springfor thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent that one has no means at hand of quenching it  the island was a long moderately high hill of ashesnothing but gray ashes and pumicestone in which we sunk to our knees at every stepand all around the top was a forbidding wall of scorched and blasted rocks  when we reached the top and got within the wall we found simply a shallow farreaching basin carpeted with ashes and here and there a patch of fine sand  in places picturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices giving evidence that although this ancient crater had gone out of active business there was still some fire left in its furnaces  close to one of these jets of steam stood the only tree on the islanda small pine of most graceful shape and most faultless symmetry its color was a brilliant green for the steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always moist  it contrasted strangely enough did this vigorous and beautiful outcast with its dead and dismal surroundings  it was like a cheerful spirit in a mourning household  we hunted for the spring everywhere traversing the full length of the island two or three miles and crossing it twiceclimbing ashhills patiently and then sliding down the other side in a sitting posture plowing up smothering volumes of gray dust  but we found nothing but solitude ashes and a heartbreaking silence  finally we noticed that the wind had risen and we forgot our thirst in a solicitude of greater importance for the lake being quiet we had not taken pains about securing the boat  we hurried back to a point overlooking our landing place and thenbut mere words cannot describe our dismaythe boat was gone  the chances were that there was not another boat on the entire lake  the situation was not comfortablein truth to speak plainly it was frightful  we were prisoners on a desolate island in aggravating proximity to friends who were for the present helpless to aid us and what was still more uncomfortable was the reflection that we had neither food nor water  but presently we sighted the boat  it was drifting along leisurely about fifty yards from shore tossing in a foamy sea it drifted and continued to drift but at the same safe distance from land and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us at the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape and higbie ran ahead and posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault  if we failed there there was no hope for us  it was driving gradually shoreward all the time now but whether it was driving fast enough to make the connection or not was the momentous question  when it got within thirty steps of higbie i was so excited that i fancied i could hear my own heart beat  when a little later it dragged slowly along and seemed about to go by only one little yard out of reach it seemed as if my heart stood still and when it was exactly abreast him and began to widen away and he still standing like a watching statue i knew my heart did stop  but when he gave a great spring the next instant and lit fairly in the stern i discharged a warwhoop that woke the solitudes  but it dulled my enthusiasm presently when he told me he had not been caring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not so that it passed within eight or ten yards of him for he had made up his mind to shut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance  imbecile that i was i had not thought of that  it was only a long swim that could be fatal  the sea was running high and the storm increasing  it was growing late toothree or four in the afternoon  whether to venture toward the mainland or not was a question of some moment  but we were so distressed by thirst that we decide to try it and so higbie fell to work and i took the steeringoar  when we had pulled a mile laboriously we were evidently in serious peril for the storm had greatly augmented the billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests the heavens were hung with black and the wind blew with great fury we would have gone back now but we did not dare to turn the boat around because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would upset of course  our only hope lay in keeping her headon to the seas it was hard work to do this she plunged so and so beat and belabored the billows with her rising and falling bows  now and then one of higbies oars would trip on the top of a wave and the other one would snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus we were drenched by the sprays constantly and the boat occasionally shipped water  by and by powerful as my comrade was his great exertions began to tell on him and he was anxious that i should change places with him till he could rest a little  but i told him this was impossible for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we changed the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea capsize and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soapsuds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present at our own inquest  but things cannot last always  just as the darkness shut down we came booming into port head on  higbie dropped his oars to hurrahi dropped mine to helpthe sea gave the boat a twist and over she went  the agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises chafes and blistered hands is unspeakable and nothing but greasing all over will modify it but we ate drank and slept well that night notwithstanding  in speaking of the peculiarities of mono lake i ought to have mentioned that at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque turretlooking masses and clusters of a whitish coarsegrained rock that resembles inferior mortar dried hard and if one breaks off fragments of this rock he will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly petrified gulls eggs deeply imbedded in the mass  how did they get there  i simply state the fact for it is a factand leave the geological reader to crack the nut at his leisure and solve the problem after his own fashion  at the end of a week we adjourned to the sierras on a fishing excursion and spent several days in camp under snowy castle peak and fished successfully for trout in a bright miniature lake whose surface was between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea cooling ourselves during the hot august noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet deep under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers flourished luxuriously and at night entertaining ourselves by almost freezing to death  then we returned to mono lake and finding that the cement excitement was over for the present packed up and went back to esmeralda  mr ballou reconnoitred awhile and not liking the prospect set out alone for humboldt  about this time occurred a little incident which has always had a sort of interest to me from the fact that it came so near instigating my funeral  at a time when an indian attack had been expected the citizens hid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient to hand when wanted  a neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the bakeoven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open ground near a frame outhouse or shed and from and after that day never thought of it again  we hired a halftamed indian to do some washing for us and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub  the ancient stove reposed within six feet of him and before his face  finally it occurred to him that hot water would be better than cold and he went out and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a kettle of water  then he returned to his tub  i entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes and was about to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious crash and disappeared leaving not a splinter behind  fragments of it fell in the streets full two hundred yards away  nearly a third of the shed roof over our heads was destroyed and one of the stove lids after cutting a small stanchion half in two in front of the indian whizzed between us and drove partly through the weatherboarding beyond  i was as white as a sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless  but the indian betrayed no trepidation no distress not even discomfort  he simply stopped washing leaned forward and surveyed the clean blank ground a moment and then remarked  mph  dam stove heap goneand resumed his scrubbing as placidly as if it were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do  i will explain that heap is injunenglish for very much  the reader will perceive the exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance     chapter xl i now come to a curious episodethe most curious i think that had yet accented my slothful valueless heedless career  out of a hillside toward the upper end of the town projected a wall of reddish looking quartzcroppings the exposed comb of a silverbearing ledge that extended deep down into the earth of course  it was owned by a company entitled the wide west  there was a shaft sixty or seventy feet deep on the under side of the croppings and everybody was acquainted with the rock that came from itand tolerably rich rock it was too but nothing extraordinary  i will remark here that although to the inexperienced stranger all the quartz of a particular district looks about alike an old resident of the camp can take a glance at a mixed pile of rock separate the fragments and tell you which mine each came from as easily as a confectioner can separate and classify the various kinds and qualities of candy in a mixed heap of the article  all at once the town was thrown into a state of extraordinary excitement in mining parlance the wide west had struck it rich  everybody went to see the new developments and for some days there was such a crowd of people about the wide west shaft that a stranger would have supposed there was a mass meeting in session there  no other topic was discussed but the rich strike and nobody thought or dreamed about anything else every man brought away a specimen ground it up in a hand mortar washed it out in his horn spoon and glared speechless upon the marvelous result  it was not hard rock but black decomposed stuff which could be crumbled in the hand like a baked potato and when spread out on a paper exhibited a thick sprinkling of gold and particles of native silver higbie brought a handful to the cabin and when he had washed it out his amazement was beyond description  wide west stock soared skywards  it was said that repeated offers had been made for it at a thousand dollars a foot and promptly refused  we have all had the bluesthe mere skybluesbut mine were indigo nowbecause i did not own in the wide west  the world seemed hollow to me and existence a grief  i lost my appetite and ceased to take an interest in anything  still i had to stay and listen to other peoples rejoicings because i had no money to get out of the camp with  the wide west company put a stop to the carrying away of specimens and well they might for every handful of the ore was worth a sun of some consequence  to show the exceeding value of the ore i will remark that a sixteenhundredpounds parcel of it was sold just as it lay at the mouth of the shaft at one dollar a pound and the man who bought it packed it on mules a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles over the mountains to san francisco satisfied that it would yield at a rate that would richly compensate him for his trouble  the wide west people also commanded their foreman to refuse any but their own operatives permission to enter the mine at any time or for any purpose  i kept up my blue meditations and higbie kept up a deal of thinking too but of a different sort  he puzzled over the rock examined it with a glass inspected it in different lights and from different points of view and after each experiment delivered himself in soliloquy of one and the same unvarying opinion in the same unvarying formula  it is not wide west rock  he said once or twice that he meant to have a look into the wide west shaft if he got shot for it  i was wretched and did not care whether he got a look into it or not  he failed that day and tried again at night failed again got up at dawn and tried and failed again  then he lay in ambush in the sage brush hour after hour waiting for the two or three hands to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner made a start once but was prematureone of the men came back for something tried it again but when almost at the mouth of the shaft another of the men rose up from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitre and he dropped on the ground and lay quiet presently he crawled on his hands and knees to the mouth of the shaft gave a quick glance around then seized the rope and slid down the shaft  he disappeared in the gloom of a side drift just as a head appeared in the mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted hellowhich he did not answer  he was not disturbed any more  an hour later he entered the cabin hot red and ready to burst with smothered excitement and exclaimed in a stage whisper  i knew it  we are rich  its a blind lead  i thought the very earth reeled under me  doubtconvictiondoubt againexultationhope amazement belief unbeliefevery emotion imaginable swept in wild procession through my heart and brain and i could not speak a word  after a moment or two of this mental fury i shook myself to rights and said  say it again  its blind lead  cal letslets burn the houseor kill somebody  lets get out where theres room to hurrah  but what is the use  it is a hundred times too good to be true  its a blind lead for a millionhanging wallfoot wallclay casingseverything complete he swung his hat and gave three cheers and i cast doubt to the winds and chimed in with a will  for i was worth a million dollars and did not care whether school kept or not  but perhaps i ought to explain  a blind lead is a lead or ledge that does not crop out above the surface  a miner does not know where to look for such leads but they are often stumbled upon by accident in the course of driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft  higbie knew the wide west rock perfectly well and the more he had examined the new developments the more he was satisfied that the ore could not have come from the wide west vein  and so had it occurred to him alone of all the camp that there was a blind lead down in the shaft and that even the wide west people themselves did not suspect it  he was right  when he went down the shaft he found that the blind lead held its independent way through the wide west vein cutting it diagonally and that it was enclosed in its own welldefined casingrocks and clay  hence it was public property  both leads being perfectly well defined it was easy for any miner to see which one belonged to the wide west and which did not  we thought it well to have a strong friend and therefore we brought the foreman of the wide west to our cabin that night and revealed the great surprise to him  higbie said  we are going to take possession of this blind lead record it and establish ownership and then forbid the wide west company to take out any more of the rock  you cannot help your company in this matter nobody can help them  i will go into the shaft with you and prove to your entire satisfaction that it is a blind lead  now we propose to take you in with us and claim the blind lead in our three names  what do you say  what could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch forth his hand and take possession of a fortune without risk of any kind and without wronging any one or attaching the least taint of dishonor to his name  he could only say agreed  the notice was put up that night and duly spread upon the recorders books before ten oclock  we claimed two hundred feet eachsix hundred feet in allthe smallest and compactest organization in the district and the easiest to manage  no one can be so thoughtless as to suppose that we slept that night higbie and i went to bed at midnight but it was only to lie broad awake and think dream scheme  the floorless tumbledown cabin was a palace the ragged gray blankets silk the furniture rosewood and mahogany each new splendor that burst out of my visions of the future whirled me bodily over in bed or jerked me to a sitting posture just as if an electric battery had been applied to me  we shot fragments of conversation back and forth at each other  once higbie said  when are you going hometo the states  tomorrowwith an evolution or two ending with a sitting position wellnobut next month at furthest  well go in the same steamer  agreed  a pause  steamer of the 10th  yes  no the 1st  all right  another pause  where are you going to live  said higbie  san francisco  thats me  pause  too hightoo much climbingfrom higbie  what is  i was thinking of russian hillbuilding a house up there  too much climbing  shant you keep a carriage  of course  i forgot that  pause  cal what kind of a house are you going to build  i was thinking about that  threestory and an attic  but what kind  well i dont hardly know  brick i suppose  brickbosh  why  what is your idea  brown stone frontfrench plate glassbilliardroom off the diningroomstatuary and paintingsshrubbery and twoacre grass plat greenhouseiron

france england germanyspain italy switzerland syria greece palestine arabia persia egyptall overeverywhere  im agreed  all right  wont it be a swell trip  well spend forty or fifty thousand dollars trying to make it one anyway  another long pause  higbie we owe the butcher six dollars and he has been threatening to stop our  hang the butcher  amen  and so it went on  by three oclock we found it was no use and so we got up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise  it was my week to cook  i always hated cookingnow i abhorred it  the news was all over town  the former excitement was greatthis one was greater still  i walked the streets serene and happy  higbie said the foreman had been offered two hundred thousand dollars for his third of the mine  i said i would like to see myself selling for any such price  my ideas were lofty  my figure was a million  still i honestly believe that if i had been offered it it would have had no other effect than to make me hold off for more  i found abundant enjoyment in being rich  a man offered me a threehundreddollar horse and wanted to take my simple unendorsed note for it  that brought the most realizing sense i had yet had that i was actually rich beyond shadow of doubt  it was followed by numerous other evidences of a similar natureamong which i may mention the fact of the butcher leaving us a double supply of meat and saying nothing about money  by the laws of the district the locators or claimants of a ledge were obliged to do a fair and reasonable amount of work on their new property within ten days after the date of the location or the property was forfeited and anybody could go and seize it that chose  so we determined to go to work the next day  about the middle of the afternoon as i was coming out of the post office i met a mr gardiner who told me that capt john nye was lying dangerously ill at his place the ninemile ranch and that he and his wife were not able to give him nearly as much care and attention as his case demanded  i said if he would wait for me a moment i would go down and help in the sick room i ran to the cabin to tell higbie  he was not there but i left a note on the table for him and a few minutes later i left town in gardiners wagon     chapter xli  captain nye was very ill indeed with spasmodic rheumatism  but the old gentleman was himselfwhich is to say he was kindhearted and agreeable when comfortable but a singularly violent wildcat when things did not go well  he would be smiling along pleasantly enough when a sudden spasm of his disease would take him and he would go out of his smile into a perfect fury  he would groan and wail and howl with the anguish and fill up the odd chinks with the most elaborate profanity that strong convictions and a fine fancy could contrive  with fair opportunity he could swear very well and handle his adjectives with considerable judgment but when the spasm was on him it was painful to listen to him he was so awkward  however i had seen him nurse a sick man himself and put up patiently with the inconveniences of the situation and consequently i was willing that he should have full license now that his own turn had come  he could not disturb me with all his raving and ranting for my mind had work on hand and it labored on diligently night and day whether my hands were idle or employed  i was altering and amending the plans for my house and thinking over the propriety of having the billardroom in the attic instead of on the same floor with the diningroom also i was trying to decide between green and blue for the upholstery of the drawingroom for although my preference was blue i feared it was a color that would be too easily damaged by dust and sunlight likewise while i was content to put the coachman in a modest livery i was uncertain about a footmani needed one and was even resolved to have one but wished he could properly appear and perform his functions out of livery for i somewhat dreaded so much show and yet inasmuch as my late grandfather had had a coachman and such things but no liveries i felt rather drawn to beat himor beat his ghost at any rate i was also systematizing the european trip and managed to get it all laid out as to route and length of time to be devoted to it everything with one exceptionnamely whether to cross the desert from cairo to jerusalem per camel or go by sea to beirut and thence down through the country per caravan  meantime i was writing to the friends at home every day instructing them concerning all my plans and intentions and directing them to look up a handsome homestead for my mother and agree upon a price for it against my coming and also directing them to sell my share of the tennessee land and tender the proceeds to the widows and orphans fund of the typographical union of which i had long been a member in good standing  this tennessee land had been in the possession of the family many years and promised to confer high fortune upon us some day it still promises it but in a less violent way  when i had been nursing the captain nine days he was somewhat better but very feeble  during the afternoon we lifted him into a chair and gave him an alcoholic vapor bath and then set about putting him on the bed again  we had to be exceedingly careful for the least jar produced pain  gardiner had his shoulders and i his legs in an unfortunate moment i stumbled and the patient fell heavily on the bed in an agony of torture  i never heard a man swear so in my life  he raved like a maniac and tried to snatch a revolver from the tablebut i got it he ordered me out of the house and swore a world of oaths that he would kill me wherever he caught me when he got on his feet again  it was simply a passing fury and meant nothing  i knew he would forget it in an hour and maybe be sorry for it too but it angered me a little at the moment  so much so indeed that i determined to go back to esmeralda  i thought he was able to get along alone now since he was on the war path  i took supper and as soon as the moon rose began my ninemile journey on foot  even millionaires needed no horses in those days for a mere ninemile jaunt without baggage  as i raised the hill overlooking the town it lacked fifteen minutes of twelve  i glanced at the hill over beyond the canyon and in the bright moonlight saw what appeared to be about half the population of the village massed on and around the wide west croppings  my heart gave an exulting bound and i said to myself they have made a new strike tonightand struck it richer than ever no doubt  i started over there but gave it up  i said the strick would keep and i had climbed hill enough for one night  i went on down through the town and as i was passing a little german bakery a woman ran out and begged me to come in and help her  she said her husband had a fit  i went in and judged she was righthe appeared to have a hundred of them compressed into one two germans were there trying to hold him and not making much of a success of it  i ran up the street half a block or so and routed out a sleeping doctor brought him down half dressed and we four wrestled with the maniac and doctored drenched and bled him for more than an hour and the poor german woman did the crying  he grew quiet now and the doctor and i withdrew and left him to his friends  it was a little after one oclock  as i entered the cabin door tired but jolly the dingy light of a tallow candle revealed higbie sitting by the pine table gazing stupidly at my note which he held in his fingers and looking pale old and haggard  i halted and looked at him  he looked at me stolidly  i said  higbie whatwhat is it  were ruinedwe didnt do the workthe blind leads relocated  it was enough  i sat down sick grievedbrokenhearted indeed  a minute before i was rich and brimful of vanity i was a pauper now and very meek  we sat still an hour busy with thought busy with vain and useless selfupbraidings busy with why didnt i do this and why didnt i do that but neither spoke a word  then we dropped into mutual explanations and the mystery was cleared away  it came out that higbie had depended on me as i had on him and as both of us had on the foreman  the folly of it  it was the first time that ever staid and steadfast higbie had left an important matter to chance or failed to be true to his full share of a responsibility  but he had never seen my note till this moment and this moment was the first time he had been in the cabin since the day he had seen me last he also had left a note for me on that same fatal afternoonhad ridden up on horseback and looked through the window and being in a hurry and not seeing me had tossed the note into the cabin through a broken pane  here it was on the floor where it had remained undisturbed for nine days        dont fail to do the work before the ten days expire  w       has passed through and given me notice  i am to join him at       mono lake and we shall go on from there tonight  he says       he will find it this time sure  cal  w  meant whiteman of course  that thrice accursed cement  that was the way of it  an old miner like higbie could no more withstand the fascination of a mysterious mining excitement like this cement foolishness than he could refrain from eating when he was famishing  higbie had been dreaming about the marvelous cement for months and now against his better judgment he had gone off and taken the chances on my keeping secure a mine worth a million undiscovered cement veins  they had not been followed this time  his riding out of town in broad daylight was such a commonplace thing to do that it had not attracted any attention  he said they prosecuted their search in the fastnesses of the mountains during nine days without success they could not find the cement  then a ghastly fear came over him that something might have happened to prevent the doing of the necessary work to hold the blind lead though indeed he thought such a thing hardly possible and forthwith he started home with all speed  he would have reached esmeralda in time but his horse broke down and he had to walk a great part of the distance  and so it happened that as he came into esmeralda by one road i entered it by another  his was the superior energy however for he went straight to the wide west instead of turning aside as i had doneand he arrived there about five or ten minutes too late the notice was already up the relocation of our mine completed beyond recall and the crowd rapidly dispersing  he learned some facts before he left the ground  the foreman had not been seen about the streets since the night we had located the minea telegram had called him to california on a matter of life and death it was said  at any rate he had done no work and the watchful eyes of the community were taking note of the fact  at midnight of this woful tenth day the ledge would be relocatable and by eleven oclock the hill was black with men prepared to do the relocating  that was the crowd i had seen when i fancied a new strike had been madeidiot that i was  we three had the same right to relocate the lead that other people had provided we were quick enough as midnight was announced fourteen men duly armed and ready to back their proceedings put up their notice and proclaimed their ownership of the blind lead under the new name of the johnson  but a d allen our partner the foreman put in a sudden appearance about that time with a cocked revolver in his hand and said his name must be added to the list or he would thin out the johnson company some  he was a manly splendid determined fellow and known to be as good as his word and therefore a compromise was effected  they put in his name for a hundred feet reserving to themselves the customary two hundred feet each  such was the history of the nights events as higbie gathered from a friend on the way home  higbie and i cleared out on a new mining excitement the next morning glad to get away from the scene of our sufferings and after a month or two of hardship and disappointment returned to esmeralda once more then we learned that the wide west and the johnson companies had consolidated that the stock thus united comprised five thousand feet or shares that the foreman apprehending tiresome litigation and considering such a huge concern unwieldy had sold his hundred feet for ninety thousand dollars in gold and gone home to the states to enjoy it if the stock was worth such a gallant figure with five thousand shares in the corporation it makes me dizzy to think what it would have been worth with only our original six hundred in it  it was the difference between six hundred men owning a house and five thousand owning it  we would have been millionaires if we had only worked with pick and spade one little day on our property and so secured our ownership  it reads like a wild fancy sketch but the evidence of many witnesses and likewise that of the official records of esmeralda district is easily obtainable in proof that it is a true history  i can always have it to say that i was absolutely and unquestionably worth a million dollars once for ten days  a year ago my esteemed and in every way estimable old millionaire partner higbie wrote me from an obscure little mining camp in california that after nine or ten years of buffetings and hard striving he was at last in a position where he could command twentyfive hundred dollars and said he meant to go into the fruit business in a modest way how such a thought would have insulted him the night we lay in our cabin planning european trips and brown stone houses on russian hill     chapter xlii  what to do next  it was a momentous question  i had gone out into the world to shift for myself at the age of thirteen for my father had endorsed for friends and although he left us a sumptuous legacy of pride in his fine virginian stock and its national distinction i presently found that i could not live on that alone without occasional bread to wash it down with  i had gained a livelihood in various vocations but had not dazzled anybody with my successes still the list was before me and the amplest liberty in the matter of choosing provided i wanted to workwhich i did not after being so wealthy  i had once been a grocery clerk for one day but had consumed so much sugar in that time that i was relieved from further duty by the proprietor said he wanted me outside so that he could have my custom  i had studied law an entire week and then given it up because it was so prosy and tiresome  i had engaged briefly in the study of blacksmithing but wasted so much time trying to fix the bellows so that it would blow itself that the master turned me adrift in disgrace and told me i would come to no good  i had been a booksellers clerk for awhile but the customers bothered me so much i could not read with any comfort and so the proprietor gave me a furlough and forgot to put a limit to it  i had clerked in a drug store part of a summer but my prescriptions were unlucky and we appeared to sell more stomach pumps than soda water  so i had to go  i had made of myself a tolerable printer under the impression that i would be another franklin some day but somehow had missed the connection thus far  there was no berth open in the esmeralda union and besides i had always been such a slow compositor that i looked with envy upon the achievements of apprentices of two years standing and when i took a take foremen were in the habit of suggesting that it would be wanted some time during the year  i was a good average st louis and new orleans pilot and by no means ashamed of my abilities in that line wages were two hundred and fifty dollars a month and no board to pay and i did long to stand behind a wheel again and never roam any morebut i had been making such an ass of myself lately in grandiloquent letters home about my blind lead and my european excursion that i did what many and many a poor disappointed miner had done before said it is all over with me now and i will never go back home to be pitiedand snubbed  i had been a private secretary a silver miner and a silver mill operative and amounted to less than nothing in each and now  what to do next  i yielded to higbies appeals and consented to try the mining once more we climbed far up on the mountain side and went to work on a little rubbishy claim of ours that had a shaft on it eight feet deep  higbie descended into it and worked bravely with his pick till he had loosened up a deal of rock and dirt and then i went down with a longhandled shovel the most awkward invention yet contrived by man to throw it out you must brace the shovel forward with the side of your knee till it is full and then with a skilful toss throw it backward over your left shoulder  i made the toss and landed the mess just on the edge of the shaft and it all came back on my head and down the back of my neck i never said a word but climbed out and walked home  i inwardly resolved that i would starve before i would make a target of myself and shoot rubbish at it with a longhandled shovel  i sat down in the cabin and gave myself up to solid miseryso to speak  now in pleasanter days i had amused myself with writing letters to the chief paper of the territory the virginia daily territorial enterprise and had always been surprised when they appeared in print my good opinion of the editors had steadily declined for it seemed to me that they might have found something better to fill up with than my literature  i had found a letter in the post office as i came home from the hill side and finally i opened it  eureka  i never did know what eureka meant but it seems to be as proper a word to heave in as any when no other that sounds pretty offers it was a deliberate offer to me of twentyfive dollars a week to come up to virginia and be city editor of the enterprise  i would have challenged the publisher in the blind lead daysi wanted to fall down and worship him now  twentyfive dollars a weekit looked like bloated luxurya fortune a sinful and lavish waste of money but my transports cooled when i thought of my inexperience and consequent unfitness for the positionand straightway on top of this my long array of failures rose up before me  yet if i refused this place i must presently become dependent upon somebody for my bread a thing necessarily distasteful to a man who had never experienced such a humiliation since he was thirteen years old  not much to be proud of since it is so commonbut then it was all i had to be proud of  so i was scared into being a city editor  i would have declined otherwise necessity is the mother of taking chances  i do not doubt that if at that time i had been offered a salary to translate the talmud from the original hebrew i would have acceptedalbeit with diffidence and some misgivingsand thrown as much variety into it as i could for the money  i went up to virginia and entered upon my new vocation  i was a rusty looking city editor i am free to confesscoatless slouch hat blue woolen shirt pantaloons stuffed into boottops whiskered half down to the waist and the universal navy revolver slung to my belt  but i secured a more christian costume and discarded the revolver  i had never had occasion to kill anybody nor ever felt a desire to do so but had worn the thing in deference to popular sentiment and in order that i might not by its absence be offensively conspicuous and a subject of remark  but the other editors and all the printers carried revolvers  i asked the chief editor and proprietor mr goodman i will call him since it describes him as well as any name could do for some instructions with regard to my duties and he told me to go all over town and ask all sorts of people all sorts of questions make notes of the information gained and write them out for publication  and he added  never say we learn soandso or it is reported or it is rumored or we understand soandso but go to headquarters and get the absolute facts and then speak out and say it is soandso  otherwise people will not put confidence in your news  unassailable certainly is the thing that gives a newspaper the firmest and most valuable reputation  it was the whole thing in a nutshell and to this day when i find a reporter commencing his article with we understand i gather a suspicion that he has not taken as much pains to inform himself as he ought to have done  i moralize well but i did not always practise well when i was a city editor i let fancy get the upper hand of fact too often when there was a dearth of news  i can never forget my first days experience as a reporter  i wandered about town questioning everybody boring everybody and finding out that nobody knew anything  at the end of five hours my notebook was still barren  i spoke to mr goodman  he said  dan used to make a good thing out of the hay wagons in a dry time when there were no fires or inquests  are there no hay wagons in from the truckee  if there are you might speak of the renewed activity and all that sort of thing in the hay business you know  it isnt sensational or exciting but it fills up and looks business like  i canvassed the city again and found one wretched old hay truck dragging in from the country  but i made affluent use of it  i multiplied it by sixteen brought it into town from sixteen different directions made sixteen separate items out of it and got up such another sweat about hay as virginia city had never seen in the world before  this was encouraging  two nonpareil columns had to be filled and i was getting along  presently when things began to look dismal again a desperado killed a man in a saloon and joy returned once more  i never was so glad over any mere trifle before in my life  i said to the murderer  sir you are a stranger to me but you have done me a kindness this day which i can never forget  if whole years of gratitude can be to you any slight compensation they shall be yours  i was in trouble and you have relieved me nobly and at a time when all seemed dark and drear  count me your friend from this time forth for i am not a man to forget a favor  if i did not really say that to him i at least felt a sort of itching desire to do it  i wrote up the murder with a hungry attention to details and when it was finished experienced but one regretnamely that they had not hanged my benefactor on the spot so that i could work him up too  next i discovered some emigrant wagons going into camp on the plaza and found that they had lately come through the hostile indian country and had fared rather roughly  i made the best of the item that the circumstances permitted and felt that if i were not confined within rigid limits by the presence of the reporters of the other papers i could add particulars that would make the article much more interesting however i found one wagon that was going on to california and made some judicious inquiries of the proprietor  when i learned through his short and surly answers to my crossquestioning that he was certainly going on and would not be in the city next day to make trouble i got ahead of the other papers for i took down his list of names and added his party to the killed and wounded  having more scope here i put this wagon through an indian fight that to this day has no parallel in history  my two columns were filled  when i read them over in the morning i felt that i had found my legitimate occupation at last  i reasoned within myself that news and stirring news too was what a paper needed and i felt that i was peculiarly endowed with the ability to furnish it mr goodman said that i was as good a reporter as dan  i desired no higher commendation  with encouragement like that i felt that i could take my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and the interests of the paper demanded it     chapter xliii  however as i grew better acquainted with the business and learned the run of the sources of information i ceased to require the aid of fancy to any large extent and became able to fill my columns without diverging noticeably from the domain of fact  i struck up friendships with the reporters of the other journals and we swapped regulars with each other and thus economized work  regulars are permanent sources of news like courts bullion returns cleanups at the quartz mills and inquests  inasmuch as everybody went armed we had an inquest about every day and so this department was naturally set down among the regulars  we had lively papers in those days  my great competitor among the reporters was boggs of the union  he was an excellent reporter  once in three or four months he would get a little intoxicated but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker although always ready to tamper a little with the enemy  he had the advantage of me in one thing he could get the monthly public school report and i could not because the principal hated the enterprise one snowy night when the report was due i started out sadly wondering how i was going to get it  presently a few steps up the almost deserted street i stumbled on boggs and asked him where he was going  after the school report  ill go along with you  no sir  ill excuse you  just as you say  a saloonkeepers boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch and boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully  he gazed fondly after the boy and saw him start up the enterprise stairs  i said  i wish you could help me get that school business but since you cant i must run up to the union office and see if i can get them to let me have a proof of it after they have set it up though i dont begin to suppose they will  good night  hold on a minute  i dont mind getting the report and sitting around with the boys a little while you copy it if youre willing to drop down to the principals with me  now you talk like a rational being  come along  we plowed a couple of blocks through the snow got the report and returned to our office  it was a short document and soon copied meantime boggs helped himself to the punch  i gave the manuscript back to him and we started out to get an inquest for we heard pistol shots near by  we got the particulars with little loss of time for it was only an inferior sort of barroom murder and of little interest to the public and then we separated  away at three oclock in the morning when we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as usual for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on the guitar and on that atrocity the accordionthe proprietor of the union strode in and desired to know if anybody had heard anything of boggs or the school report  we stated the case and all turned out to help hunt for the delinquent  we found him standing on a table in a saloon with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the other haranguing a gang of intoxicated cornish miners on the iniquity of squandering the public moneys on education when hundreds and hundreds of honest hardworking men are literally starving for whiskey  riotous applause  he had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for hours  we dragged him away and put him to bed  of course there was no school report in the union and boggs held me accountable though i was innocent of any intention or desire to compass its absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the misfortune had occurred  but we were perfectly friendly  the day that the school report was next due the proprietor of the genessee mine furnished us a buggy and asked us to go down and write something about the propertya very common request and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies for we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people  in due time we arrived at the minenothing but a hole in the ground ninety feet deep and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and being lowered with a windlass  the workmen had just gone off somewhere to dinner  i was not strong enough to lower boggss bulk so i took an unlighted candle in my teeth made a loop for my foot in the end of the rope implored boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start of him and then swung out over the shaft  i reached the bottom muddy and bruised about the elbows but safe  i lit the candle made an examination of the rock selected some specimens and shouted to boggs to hoist away  no answer  presently a head appeared in the circle of daylight away aloft and a voice came down  are you all set  all sethoist away  are you comfortable  perfectly  could you wait a little  oh certainlyno particular hurry  wellgood by  why  where are you going  after the school report  and he did  i staid down there an hour and surprised the workmen when they hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock i walked home toofive milesup hill  we had no school report next morning but the union had  six months after my entry into journalism the grand flush times of silverland began and they continued with unabated splendor for three years  all difficulty about filling up the local department ceased and the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the world of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every day  virginia had grown to be the livest town for its age and population that america had ever produced  the sidewalks swarmed with peopleto such an extent indeed that it was generally no easy matter to stem the human tide  the streets themselves were just as crowded with quartz wagons freight teams and other vehicles  the procession was endless  so great was the pack that buggies frequently had to wait half an hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street  joy sat on every countenance and there was a glad almost fierce intensity in every eye that told of the moneygetting schemes that were seething in every brain and the high hope that held sway in every heart  money was as plenty as dust every individual considered himself wealthy and a melancholy countenance was nowhere to be seen  there were military companies fire companies brass bands banks hotels theatres hurdygurdy houses wideopen gambling palaces political powwows civic processions street fights murders inquests riots a whiskey mill every fifteen steps a board of aldermen a mayor a city surveyor a city engineer a chief of the fire department with first second and third assistants a chief of police city marshal and a large police force two boards of mining brokers a dozen breweries and half a dozen jails and stationhouses in full operation and some talk of building a church  the flush times were in magnificent flower  large fireproof brick buildings were going up in the principal streets and the wooden suburbs were spreading out in all directions  town lots soared up to prices that were amazing  the great comstock lode stretched its opulent length straight through the town from north to south and every mine on it was in diligent process of development  one of these mines alone employed six hundred and seventyfive men and in the matter of elections the adage was as the gould and curry goes so goes the city  laboring mens wages were four and six dollars a day and they worked in three shifts or gangs and the blasting and picking and shoveling went on without ceasing night and day  the city of virginia roosted royally midway up the steep side of mount davidson seven thousand two hundred feet above the level of the sea and in the clear nevada atmosphere was visible from a distance of fifty miles  it claimed a population of fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand and all day long half of this little army swarmed the streets like bees and the other half swarmed among the drifts and tunnels of the comstock hundreds of feet down in the earth directly under those same streets  often we felt our chairs jar and heard the faint boom of a blast down in the bowels of the earth under the office  the mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it like a roof  each street was a terrace and from each to the next street below the descent was forty or fifty feet  the fronts of the houses were level with the street they faced but their rear first floors were propped on lofty stilts a man could stand at a rear first floor window of a c street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below him facing d street  it was a laborious climb in that thin atmosphere to ascend from d to a street and you were panting and out of breath when you got there but you could turn around and go down again like a house afireso to speak  the atmosphere was so rarified on account of the great altitude that ones blood lay near the surface always and the scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about for the chances were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue  but to offset this the thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds and therefore to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely to afford you any permanent satisfaction for he would be nearly certain to be around looking for you within the month and not with an opera glass either  from virginias airy situation one could look over a vast farreaching panorama of mountain ranges and deserts and whether the day was bright or overcast whether the sun was rising or setting or flaming in the zenith or whether night and the moon held sway the spectacle was always impressive and beautiful  over your head mount davidson lifted its gray dome and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the battlemented hills making a sombre gateway through which a softtinted desert was glimpsed with the silver thread of a river winding through it bordered with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a delicate fringe and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and stretched their long barrier to the filmy horizonfar enough beyond a lake that burned in the desert like a fallen sun though that itself lay fifty miles removed  look from your window where you would there was fascination in the picture  at rare intervalsbut very rarethere were clouds in our skies and then the setting sun would gild and flush and glorify this mighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of color that held the eye like a spell and moved the spirit like music     chapter xliv  my salary was increased to forty dollars a week  but i seldom drew it i had plenty of other resources and what were two broad twentydollar gold pieces to a man who had his pockets full of such and a cumbersome abundance of bright half dollars besides  paper money has never come into use on the pacific coast  reporting was lucrative and every man in the town was lavish with his money and his feet  the city and all the great mountain side were riddled with mining shafts  there were more mines than miners  true not ten of these mines were yielding rock worth hauling to a mill but everybody said wait till the shaft gets down where the ledge comes in solid and then you will see  so nobody was discouraged  these were nearly all wild cat mines and wholly worthless but nobody believed it then  the ophir the gould  curry the mexican and other great mines on the comstock lead in virginia and gold hill were turning out huge piles of rich rock every day and every man believed that his little wild cat claim was as good as any on the main lead and would infallibly be worth a thousand dollars a foot when he got down where it came in solid  poor fellow he was blessedly blind to the fact that he never would see that day  so the thousand wild cat shafts burrowed deeper and deeper into the earth day by day and all men were beside themselves with hope and happiness  how they labored prophesied exulted  surely nothing like it was ever seen before since the world began  every one of these wild cat minesnot mines but holes in the ground over imaginary mineswas incorporated and had handsomely engraved stock and the stock was salable too  it was bought and sold with a feverish avidity in the boards every day  you could go up on the mountain side scratch around and find a ledge there was no lack of them put up a notice with a grandiloquent name in it start a shaft get your stock printed and with nothing whatever to prove that your mine was worth a straw you could put your stock on the market and sell out for hundreds and even thousands of dollars  to make money and make it fast was as easy as it was to eat your dinner  every man owned feet in fifty different wild cat mines and considered his fortune made  think of a city with not one solitary poor man in it one would suppose that when month after month went by and still not a wild cat mine by wild cat i mean in general terms any claim not located on the mother vein ie the comstock yielded a ton of rock worth crushing the people would begin to wonder if they were not putting too much faith in their prospective riches but there was not a thought of such a thing  they burrowed away bought and sold and were happy  new claims were taken up daily and it was the friendly custom to run straight to the newspaper offices give the reporter forty or fifty feet and get them to go and examine the mine and publish a notice of it  they did not care a fig what you said about the property so you said something  consequently we generally said a word or two to the effect that the indications were good or that the ledge was six feet wide or that the rock resembled the comstock and so it didbut as a general thing the resemblance was not startling enough to knock you down  if the rock was moderately promising we followed the custom of the country used strong adjectives and frothed at the mouth as if a very marvel in silver discoveries had transpired  if the mine was a developed one and had no pay ore to show and of course it hadnt we praised the tunnel said it was one of the most infatuating tunnels in the land driveled and driveled about the tunnel till we ran entirely out of ecstasiesbut never said a word about the rock  we would squander half a column of adulation on a shaft or a new wire rope or a dressed pine windlass or a fascinating force pump and close with a burst of admiration of the gentlemanly and efficient superintendent of the mine but never utter a whisper about the rock  and those people were always pleased always satisfied  occasionally we patched up and varnished our reputation for discrimination and stern undeviating accuracy by giving some old abandoned claim a blast that ought to have made its dry bones rattleand then somebody would seize it and sell it on the fleeting notoriety thus conferred upon it  there was nothing in the shape of a mining claim that was not salable we received presents of feet every day  if we needed a hundred dollars or so we sold some if not we hoarded it away satisfied that it would ultimately be worth a thousand dollars a foot  i had a trunk about half full of stock  when a claim made a stir in the market and went up to a high figure i searched through my pile to see if i had any of its stock and generally found it  the prices rose and fell constantly but still a fall disturbed us little because a thousand dollars a foot was our figure and so we were content to let it fluctuate as much as it pleased till it reached it my pile of stock was not all given to me by people who wished their claims noticed  at least half of it was given me by persons who had no thought of such a thing and looked for nothing more than a simple verbal thank you and you were not even obliged by law to furnish that if you are coming up the street with a couple of baskets of apples in your hands and you meet a friend you naturally invite him to take a few  that describes the condition of things in virginia in the flush times  every man had his pockets full of stock and it was the actual custom of the country to part with small quantities of it to friends without the asking  very often it was a good idea to close the transaction instantly when a man offered a stock present to a friend for the offer was only good and binding at that moment and if the price went to a high figure shortly afterward the procrastination was a thing to be regretted  mr stewart senator now from nevada one day told me he would give me twenty feet of justis stock if i would walk over to his office  it was worth five or ten dollars a foot  i asked him to make the offer good for next day as i was just going to dinner  he said he would not be in town so i risked it and took my dinner instead of the stock  within the week the price went up to seventy dollars and afterward to a hundred and fifty but nothing could make that man yield  i suppose he sold that stock of mine and placed the guilty proceeds in his own pocket  my revenge will be found in the accompanying portrait  i met three friends one afternoon who said they had been buying overman stock at auction at eight dollars a foot  one said if i would come up to his office he would give me fifteen feet another said he would add fifteen the third said he would do the same  but i was going after an inquest and could not stop  a few weeks afterward they sold all their overman at six hundred dollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about itand also to urge me to accept of the next fortyfive feet of it that people tried to force on me  these are actual facts and i could make the list a long one and still confine myself strictly to the truth  many a time friends gave us as much as twentyfive feet of stock that was selling at twentyfive dollars a foot and they thought no more of it than they would of offering a guest a cigar  these were flush times indeed  i thought they were going to last always but somehow i never was much of a prophet  to show what a wild spirit possessed the mining brain of the community i will remark that claims were actually located in excavations for cellars where the pick had exposed what seemed to be quartz veinsand not cellars in the suburbs either but in the very heart of the city and forthwith stock would be issued and thrown on the market  it was small matter who the cellar belonged tothe ledge belonged to the finder and unless the united states government interfered inasmuch as the government holds the primary right to mines of the noble metals in nevadaor at least did then it was considered to be his privilege to work it  imagine a stranger staking out a mining claim among the costly shrubbery in your front yard and calmly proceeding to lay waste the ground with pick and shovel and blasting powder  it has been often done in california  in the middle of one of the principal business streets of virginia a man located a mining claim and began a shaft on it  he gave me a hundred feet of the stock and i sold it for a fine suit of clothes because i was afraid somebody would fall down the shaft and sue for damages  i owned in another claim that was located in the middle of another street and to show how absurd people can be that east india stock as it was called sold briskly although there was an ancient tunnel running directly under the claim and any man could go into it and see that it did not cut a quartz ledge or anything that remotely resembled one  one plan of acquiring sudden wealth was to salt a wild cat claim and sell out while the excitement was up  the process was simple  the schemer located a worthless ledge sunk a shaft on it bought a wagon load of rich comstock ore dumped a portion of it into the shaft and piled the rest by its side above ground  then he showed the property to a simpleton and sold it to him at a high figure  of course the wagon load of rich ore was all that the victim ever got out of his purchase a most remarkable case of salting was that of the north ophir it was claimed that this vein was a remote extension of the original ophir a valuable mine on the comstock  for a few days everybody was talking about the rich developments in the north ophir  it was said that it yielded perfectly pure silver in small solid lumps  i went to the place with the owners and found a shaft six or eight feet deep in the bottom of which was a badly shattered vein of dull yellowish unpromising rock  one would as soon expect to find silver in a grindstone  we got out a pan of the rubbish and washed it in a puddle and sure enough among the sediment we found half a dozen black bulletlooking pellets of unimpeachable native silver  nobody had ever heard of such a thing before science could not account for such a queer novelty  the stock rose to sixtyfive dollars a foot and at this figure the worldrenowned tragedian mckean buchanan bought a commanding interest and prepared to quit the stage once morehe was always doing that  and then it transpired that the mine had been saltedand not in any hackneyed way either but in a singularly bold barefaced and peculiarly original and outrageous fashion  on one of the lumps of native silver was discovered the minted legend ted states of and then it was plainly apparent that the mine had been salted with melted halfdollars  the lumps thus obtained had been blackened till they resembled native silver and were then mixed with the shattered rock in the bottom of the shaft  it is literally true  of course the price of the stock at once fell to nothing and the tragedian was ruined  but for this calamity we might have lost mckean buchanan from the stage     chapter xlv  the flush times held bravely on  something over two years before mr goodman and another journeyman printer had borrowed forty dollars and set out from san francisco to try their fortunes in the new city of virginia  they found the territorial enterprise a povertystricken weekly journal gasping for breath and likely to die  they bought it type fixtures goodwill and all for a thousand dollars on long time the editorial sanctum newsroom pressroom publication office bedchamber parlor and kitchen were all compressed into one apartment and it was a small one too  the editors and printers slept on the floor a chinaman did their cooking and the imposingstone was the general dinner table  but now things were changed  the paper was a great daily printed by steam there were five editors and twentythree compositors the subscription price was sixteen dollars a year the advertising rates were exorbitant and the columns crowded  the paper was clearing from six to ten thousand dollars a month and the enterprise building was finished and ready for occupationa stately fireproof brick  every day from five all the way up to eleven columns of live advertisements were left out or crowded into spasmodic and irregular supplements  the gould  curry company were erecting a monster hundredstamp mill at a cost that ultimately fell little short of a million dollars  gould  curry stock paid heavy dividendsa rare thing and an experience confined to the dozen or fifteen claims located on the main lead the comstock  the superintendent of the gould  curry lived rent free in a fine house built and furnished by the company  he drove a fine pair of horses which were a present from the company and his salary was twelve thousand dollars a year  the superintendent of another of the great mines traveled in grand state had a salary of twentyeight thousand dollars a year and in a law suit in after days claimed that he was to have had one per cent on the gross yield of the bullion likewise  money was wonderfully plenty  the trouble was not how to get itbut how to spend it how to lavish it get rid of it squander it  and so it was a happy thing that just at this juncture the news came over the wires that a great united states sanitary commission had been formed and money was wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of the union languishing in the eastern hospitals  right on the heels of it came word that san francisco had responded superbly before the telegram was half a day old  virginia rose as one man  a sanitary committee was hurriedly organized and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in c street and tried to make the clamorous multitude understand that the rest of the committee were flying hither and thither and working with all their might and main and that if the town would only wait an hour an office would be ready books opened and the commission prepared to receive contributions  his voice was drowned and his information lost in a ceaseless roar of cheers and demands that the money be received now they swore they would not wait  the chairman pleaded and argued but deaf to all entreaty men plowed their way through the throng and rained checks of gold coin into the cart and skurried away for more  hands clutching money were thrust aloft out of the jam by men who hoped this eloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could not open the very chinamen and indians caught the excitement and dashed their half dollars into the cart without knowing or caring what it was all about women plunged into the crowd trimly attired fought their way to the cart with their coin and emerged again by and by with their apparel in a state of hopeless dilapidation  it was the wildest mob virginia had ever seen and the most determined and ungovernable and when at last it abated its fury and dispersed it had not a penny in its pocket  to use its own phraseology it came there flush and went away busted  after that the commission got itself into systematic working order and for weeks the contributions flowed into its treasury in a generous stream  individuals and all sorts of organizations levied upon themselves a regular weekly tax for the sanitary fund graduated according to their means and there was not another grand universal outburst till the famous sanitary flour sack came our way  its history is peculiar and interesting  a former schoolmate of mine by the name of reuel gridley was living at the little city of austin in the reese river country at this time and was the democratic candidate for mayor he and the republican candidate made an agreement that the defeated man should be publicly presented with a fiftypound sack of flour by the successful one and should carry it home on his shoulder  gridley was defeated  the new mayor gave him the sack of flour and he shouldered it and carried it a mile or two from lower austin to his home in upper austin attended by a band of music and the whole population  arrived there he said he did not need the flour and asked what the people thought he had better do with it  a voice said  sell it to the highest bidder for the benefit of the sanitary fund  the suggestion was greeted with a round of applause and gridley mounted a drygoods box and assumed the role of auctioneer  the bids went higher and higher as the sympathies of the pioneers awoke and expanded till at last the sack was knocked down to a mill man at two hundred and fifty dollars and his check taken  he was asked where he would have the flour delivered and he said  nowheresell it again  now the cheers went up royally and the multitude were fairly in the spirit of the thing  so gridley stood there and shouted and perspired till the sun went down and when the crowd dispersed he had sold the sack to three hundred different people and had taken in eight thousand dollars in gold  and still the flour sack was in his possession  the news came to virginia and a telegram went back  fetch along your flour sack  thirtysix hours afterward gridley arrived and an afternoon mass meeting was held in the opera house and the auction began  but the sack had come sooner than it was expected the people were not thoroughly aroused and the sale dragged  at nightfall only five thousand dollars had been secured and there was a crestfallen feeling in the community  however there was no disposition to let the matter rest here and acknowledge vanquishment at the hands of the village of austin  till late in the night the principal citizens were at work arranging the morrows campaign and when they went to bed they had no fears for the result at eleven the next morning a procession of open carriages attended by clamorous bands of music and adorned with a moving display of flags filed along c street and was soon in danger of blockade by a huzzaing multitude of citizens  in the first carriage sat gridley with the flour sack in prominent view the latter splendid with bright paint and gilt lettering also in the same carriage sat the mayor and the recorder the other carriages contained the common council the editors and reporters and other people of imposing consequence  the crowd pressed to the corner of c and taylor streets expecting the sale to begin there but they were disappointed and also unspeakably surprised for the cavalcade moved on as if virginia had ceased to be of importance and took its way over the divide toward the small town of gold hill telegrams had gone ahead to gold hill silver city and dayton and those communities were at fever heat and rife for the conflict  it was a very hot day and wonderfully dusty  at the end of a short half hour we descended into gold hill with drums beating and colors flying and enveloped in imposing clouds of dust  the whole populationmen women and children chinamen and indians were massed in the main street all the flags in town were at the mast head and the blare of the bands was drowned in cheers  gridley stood up and asked who would make the first bid for the national sanitary flour sack  gen w said  the yellow jacket silver mining company offers a thousand dollars coin  a tempest of applause followed  a telegram carried the news to virginia and fifteen minutes afterward that citys population was massed in the streets devouring the tidingsfor it was part of the programme that the bulletin boards should do a good work that day  every few minutes a new dispatch was bulletined from gold hill and still the excitement grew telegrams began to return to us from virginia beseeching gridley to bring back the flour sack but such was not the plan of the campaign  at the end of an hour gold hills small population had paid a figure for the flour sack that awoke all the enthusiasm of virginia when the grand total was displayed upon the bulletin boards  then the gridley cavalcade moved on a giant refreshed with new lager beer and plenty of itfor the people brought it to the carriages without waiting to measure itand within three hours more the expedition had carried silver city and dayton by storm and was on its way back covered with glory  every move had been telegraphed and bulletined and as the procession entered virginia and filed down c street at half past eight in the evening the town was abroad in the thoroughfares torches were glaring flags flying bands playing cheer on cheer cleaving the air and the city ready to surrender at discretion  the auction began every bid was greeted with bursts of applause and at the end of two hours and a half a population of fifteen thousand souls had paid in coin for a fiftypound sack of flour a sum equal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks  it was at a rate in the neighborhood of three dollars for each man woman and child of the population  the grand total would have been twice as large but the streets were very narrow and hundreds who wanted to bid could not get within a block of the stand and could not make themselves heard  these grew tired of waiting and many of them went home long before the auction was over  this was the greatest day virginia ever saw perhaps  gridley sold the sack in carson city and several california towns also in san francisco  then he took it east and sold it in one or two atlantic cities i think  i am not sure of that but i know that he finally carried it to st louis where a monster sanitary fair was being held and after selling it there for a large sum and helping on the enthusiasm by displaying the portly silver bricks which nevadas donation had produced he had the flour baked up into small cakes and retailed them at high prices  it was estimated that when the flour sacks mission was ended it had been sold for a grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in greenbacks  this is probably the only instance on record where common family flour brought three thousand dollars a pound in the public market  it is due to mr gridleys memory to mention that the expenses of his sanitary flour sack expedition of fifteen thousand miles going and returning were paid in large part if not entirely out of his own pocket  the time he gave to it was not less than three months mr gridley was a soldier in the mexican war and a pioneer californian he died at stockton california in december 1870 greatly regretted     chapter xlvi  there were nabobs in those daysin the flush times i mean  every rich strike in the mines created one or two  i call to mind several of these  they were careless easygoing fellows as a general thing and the community at large was as much benefited by their riches as they were themselvespossibly more in some cases  two cousins teamsters did some hauling for a man and had to take a small segregated portion of a silver mine in lieu of 300 cash  they gave an outsider a third to open the mine and they went on teaming  but not long  ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying each owner 8000 to 10000 a monthsay 100000 a year  one of the earliest nabobs that nevada was delivered of wore 6000 worth of diamonds in his bosom and swore he was unhappy because he could not spend his money as fast as he made it  another nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached 16000 a month and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine that yielded it for five dollars a day when he first came to the country  the silver and sagebrush state has knowledge of another of these pets of fortunelifted from actual poverty to affluence almost in a single nightwho was able to offer 100000 for a position of high official distinction shortly afterward and did offer itbut failed to get it his politics not being as sound as his bank account  then there was john smith  he was a good honest kindhearted soul born and reared in the lower ranks of life and miraculously ignorant he drove a team and owned a small rancha ranch that paid him a comfortable living for although it yielded but little hay what little it did yield was worth from 250 to 300 in gold per ton in the market presently smith traded a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped silver mine in gold hill  he opened the mine and built a little unpretending tenstamp mill  eighteen months afterward he retired from the hay business for his mining income had reached a most comfortable figure  some people said it was 30000 a month and others said it was 60000  smith was very rich at any rate  and then he went to europe and traveled  and when he came back he was never tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in england and the gorgeous sheep he had seen in spain and the fine cattle he had noticed in the vicinity of rome  he was full of wonders of the old world and advised everybody to travel  he said a man never imagined what surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled  one day on board ship the passengers made up a pool of 500 which was to be the property of the man who should come nearest to guessing the run of the vessel for the next twentyfour hours  next day toward noon the figures were all in the pursers hands in sealed envelopes  smith was serene and happy for he had been bribing the engineer  but another party won the prize  smith said  here that wont do  he guessed two miles wider of the mark than i did  the purser said mr smith you missed it further than any man on board we traveled two hundred and eight miles yesterday  well sir said smith thats just where ive got you for i guessed two hundred and nine  if youll look at my figgers again youll find a 2 and two 0s which stands for 200 dont itand after em youll find a 9 2009 which stands for two hundred and nine  i reckon ill take that money if you please  the gould  curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet and it all belonged originally to the two men whose names it bears  mr curry owned two thirds of itand he said that he sold it out for twentyfive hundred dollars in cash and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in hay and barley in seventeen days by the watch  and he said that gould sold out for a pair of secondhand government blankets and a bottle of whisky that killed nine men in three hours and that an unoffending stranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life  four years afterward the mine thus disposed of was worth in the san francisco market seven millions six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin  in the early days a povertystricken mexican who lived in a canyon directly back of virginia city had a stream of water as large as a mans wrist trickling from the hillside on his premises  the ophir company segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for the stream of water  the hundred feet proved to be the richest part of the entire mine four years after the swap its market value including its mill was 1500000  an individual who owned twenty feet in the ophir mine before its great riches were revealed to men traded it for a horse and a very sorry looking brute he was too  a year or so afterward when ophir stock went up to 3000 a foot this man who had not a cent used to say he was the most startling example of magnificence and misery the world had ever seenbecause he was able to ride a sixtythousanddollar horseyet could not scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle and was obliged to borrow one or ride bareback  he said if fortune were to give him another sixtythousanddollar horse it would ruin him  a youth of nineteen who was a telegraph operator in virginia on a salary of a hundred dollars a month and who when he could not make out german names in the list of san francisco steamer arrivals used to ingeniously select and supply substitutes for them out of an old berlin city directory made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that passed through his hands and buying and selling stocks accordingly through a friend in san francisco  once when a private dispatch was sent from virginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising that the matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be secured he bought forty feet of the stock at twenty dollars a foot and afterward sold half of it at eight hundred dollars a foot and the rest at double that figure  within three months he was worth 150000 and had resigned his telegraphic position  another telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for divulging the secrets of the office agreed with a moneyed man in san francisco to furnish him the result of a great virginia mining lawsuit within an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in san francisco  for this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on purchases and sales made on it by his fellowconspirator  so he went disguised as a teamster to a little wayside telegraph office in the mountains got acquainted with the operator and sat in the office day after day smoking his pipe complaining that his team was fagged out and unable to traveland meantime listening to the dispatches as they passed clicking through the machine from virginia  finally the private dispatch announcing the result of the lawsuit sped over the wires and as soon as he heard it he telegraphed his friend in san francisco  am tired waiting  shall sell the team and go home  it was the signal agreed upon  the word waiting left out would have signified that the suit had gone the other way  the mock teamsters friend picked up a deal of the mining stock at low figures before the news became public and a fortune was the result  for a long time after one of the great virginia mines had been incorporated about fifty feet of the original location were still in the hands of a man who had never signed the incorporation papers  the stock became very valuable and every effort was made to find this man but he had disappeared  once it was heard that he was in new york and one or two speculators went east but failed to find him  once the news came that he was in the bermudas and straightway a speculator or two hurried east and sailed for bermudabut he was not there  finally he was heard of in mexico and a friend of his a barkeeper on a salary scraped together a little money and sought him out bought his feet for a hundred dollars returned and sold the property for 75000  but why go on  the traditions of silverland are filled with instances like these and i would never get through enumerating them were i to attempt do it  i only desired to give the reader an idea of a peculiarity of the flush times which i could not present so strikingly in any other way and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing comprehension of the time and the country  i was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs i have referred to and so for old acquaintance sake i have shifted their occupations and experiences around in such a way as to keep the pacific public from recognizing these once notorious men  no longer notorious for the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity again  in nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two of her nabobs which may or may not have occurred  i give it for what it is worth  col jim had seen somewhat of the world and knew more or less of its ways but col jack was from the back settlements of the states had led a life of arduous toil and had never seen a city  these two blessed with sudden wealth projected a visit to new yorkcol jack to see the sights and col jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune  they reached san francisco in the night and sailed in the morning  arrived in new york col  jack said  ive heard tell of carriages all my life and now i mean to have a ride in one i dont care what it costs  come along  they stepped out on the sidewalk and col jim called a stylish barouche but col jack said  no sir  none of your cheapjohn turnouts for me  im here to have a good time and money aint any object  i mean to have the nobbiest rig thats going  now here comes the very trick  stop that yaller one with the pictures on itdont you fretill stand all the expenses myself  so col jim stopped an empty omnibus and they got in  said col jack  aint it gay though  oh no i reckon not  cushions and windows and pictures till you cant rest  what would the boys say if they could see us cutting a swell like this in new york  by george i wish they could see us  then he put his head out of the window and shouted to the driver  say johnny this suits mesuits yours truly you bet you  i want this shebang all day  im on it old man  let em out  make em go well make it all right with you sonny  the driver passed his hand through the straphole and tapped for his fareit was before the gongs came into common use  col jack took the hand and shook it cordially  he said  you twig me old pard  all right between gents  smell of that and see how you like it  and he put a twentydollar gold piece in the drivers hand  after a moment the driver said he could not make change  bother the change  ride it out  put it in your pocket  then to col  jim with a sounding slap on his thigh  aint it style though  hanged if i dont hire this thing every day for a week  the omnibus stopped and a young lady got in  col jack stared a moment then nudged col jim with his elbow  dont say a word he whispered  let her ride if she wants to gracious theres room enough  the young lady got out her portemonnaie and handed her fare to col jack  whats this for  said he  give it to the driver please  take back your money madam  we cant allow it  youre welcome to ride here as long as you please but this shebangs chartered and we cant let you pay a cent  the girl shrunk into a corner bewildered  an old lady with a basket climbed in and proffered her fare  excuse me said col jack  youre perfectly welcome here madam but we cant allow you to pay  set right down there mum and dont you be the least uneasy  make yourself just as free as if you was in your own turnout  within two minutes three gentlemen two fat women and a couple of children entered  come right along friends said col  jack dont mind us  this is a free blowout  then he whispered to col  jim  new york aint no sociable place i dont reckonit aint no name for it  he resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver and made everybody cordially welcome  the situation dawned on the people and they pocketed their money and delivered themselves up to covert enjoyment of the episode  half a dozen more passengers entered  oh theres plenty of room said col  jack  walk right in and make yourselves at home  a blowout aint worth anything as a blowout unless a body has company  then in a whisper to col  jim but aint these new yorkers friendly  and aint they cool about it too  icebergs aint anywhere  i reckon theyd tackle a hearse if it was going their way  more passengers got in more yet and still more  both seats were filled and a file of men were standing up holding on to the cleats overhead  parties with baskets and bundles were climbing up on the roof halfsuppressed laughter rippled up from all sides  well for clean cool outandout cheek if this dont bang anything that ever i saw im an injun whispered col jack  a chinaman crowded his way in  i weaken said col jack  hold on driver  keep your seats ladies and gents  just make yourselves freeeverythings paid for  driver rustle these folks around as long as theyre a mind to gofriends of ours you know  take them everywheresand if you want more money come to the st nicholas and well make it all right  pleasant journey to you ladies and gentsgo it just as long as you pleaseit shant cost you a cent  the two comrades got out and col jack said  jimmy its the sociablest place i ever saw  the chinaman waltzed in as comfortable as anybody  if wed staid awhile i reckon wed had some niggers  b george well have to barricade our doors tonight or some of these ducks will be trying to sleep with us     chapter xlvii  somebody has said that in order to know a community one must observe the style of its funerals and know what manner of men they bury with most ceremony  i cannot say which class we buried with most eclat in our flush times the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished roughpossibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of society honored their illustrious dead about equally and hence no doubt the philosopher i have quoted from would have needed to see two representative funerals in virginia before forming his estimate of the people  there was a grand time over buck fanshaw when he died  he was a representative citizen  he had killed his mannot in his own quarrel it is true but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers he had kept a sumptuous saloon  he had been the proprietor of a dashing helpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a divorce he had held a high position in the fire department and been a very warwick in politics  when he died there was great lamentation throughout the town but especially in the vast bottomstratum of society  on the inquest it was shown that buck fanshaw in the delirium of a wasting typhoid fever had taken arsenic shot himself through the body cut his throat and jumped out of a fourstory window and broken his neckand after due deliberation the jury sad and tearful but with intelligence unblinded by its sorrow brought in a verdict of death by the visitation of god  what could the world do without juries  prodigious preparations were made for the funeral  all the vehicles in town were hired all the saloons put in mourning all the municipal and firecompany flags hung at halfmast and all the firemen ordered to muster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black  now let us remark in parenthesisas all the peoples of the earth had representative adventurers in the silverland and as each adventurer had brought the slang of his nation or his locality with him the combination made the slang of nevada the richest and the most infinitely varied and copious that had ever existed anywhere in the world perhaps except in the mines of california in the early days  slang was the language of nevada  it was hard to preach a sermon without it and be understood such phrases as you bet  oh no i reckon not  no irish need apply and a hundred others became so common as to fall from the lips of a speaker unconsciouslyand very often when they did not touch the subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything  after buck fanshaws inquest a meeting of the shorthaired brotherhood was held for nothing can be done on the pacific coast without a public meeting and an expression of sentiment  regretful resolutions were passed and various committees appointed among others a committee of one was deputed to call on the minister a fragile gentle spiritual new fledgling from an eastern theological seminary and as yet unacquainted with the ways of the mines  the committeeman scotty briggs made his visit and in after days it was worth something to hear the minister tell about it  scotty was a stalwart rough whose customary suit when on weighty official business like committee work was a fire helmet flaming red flannel shirt patent leather belt with spanner and revolver attached coat hung over arm and pants stuffed into boot tops he formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student  it is fair to say of scotty however in passing that he had a warm heart and a strong love for his friends and never entered into a quarrel when he could reasonably keep out of it  indeed it was commonly said that whenever one of scottys fights was investigated it always turned out that it had originally been no affair of his but that out of native goodheartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who was getting the worst of it  he and buck fanshaw were bosom friends for years and had often taken adventurous potluck together  on one occasion they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a fight among strangers and after gaining a hardearned victory turned and found that the men they were helping had deserted early and not only that but had stolen their coats and made off with them  but to return to scottys visit to the minister  he was on a sorrowful mission now and his face was the picture of woe  being admitted to the presence he sat down before the clergyman placed his firehat on an unfinished manuscript sermon under the ministers nose took from it a red silk handkerchief wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness explanatory of his business  he choked and even shed tears but with an effort he mastered his voice and said in lugubrious tones  are you the duck that runs the gospelmill next door  am i thepardon me i believe i do not understand  with another sigh and a halfsob scotty rejoined  why you see we are in a bit of trouble and the boys thought maybe you would give us a lift if wed tackle youthat is if ive got the rights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxologyworks next door  i am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door  the which  the spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary adjoins these premises  scotty scratched his head reflected a moment and then said  you ruther hold over me pard  i reckon i cant call that hand  ante and pass the buck  how i beg pardon  what did i understand you to say  well youve ruther got the bulge on me  or maybe weve both got the bulge somehow  you dont smoke me and i dont smoke you  you see one of the boys has passed in his checks and we want to give him a good sendoff and so the thing im on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a little chinmusic for us and waltz him through handsome  my friend i seem to grow more and more bewildered  your observations are wholly incomprehensible to me  cannot you simplify them in some way at first i thought perhaps i understood you but i grope now  would it not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and allegory  another pause and more reflection  then said scotty  ill have to pass i judge  how  youve raised me out pard  i still fail to catch your meaning  why that last lead of yourn is too many for methats the idea  i cant neithertrump nor follow suit  the clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed  scotty leaned his head on his hand and gave himself up to thought  presently his face came up sorrowful but confident  ive got it now sos you can savvy he said  what we want is a gospelsharp  see  a what  gospelsharp  parson  oh  why did you not say so before  i am a clergymana parson  now you talk  you see my blind and straddle it like a man  put it thereextending a brawny paw which closed over the ministers small hand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent gratification  now were all right pard  lets start fresh  dont you mind my snuffling a littlebecuz were in a power of trouble  you see one of the boys has gone up the flume  gone where  up the flumethrowed up the sponge you understand  thrown up the sponge  yeskicked the bucket  ahhas departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveler returns  return  i reckon not  why pard hes dead  yes i understand  oh you do  well i thought maybe you might be getting tangled some more  yes you see hes dead again  again  why has he ever been dead before  dead before  no  do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat but you bet you hes awful dead now poor old boy and i wish id never seen this day  i dont want no better friend than buck fanshaw i knowed him by the back and when i know a man and like him i freeze to himyou hear me  take him all round pard there never was a bullier man in the mines  no man ever knowed buck fanshaw to go back on a friend  but its all up you know its all up  it aint no use theyve scooped him  scooped him  yesdeath has  well well well weve got to give him up  yes indeed  its a kind of a hard world after all aint it  but pard he was a rustler  you ought to seen him get started once  he was a bully boy with a glass eye  just spit in his face and give him room according to his strength and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in he was the worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath  pard he was on it  he was on it bigger than an injun  on it  on what  on the shoot  on the shoulder  on the fight you understand he didnt give a continental for any body  beg your pardon friend for coming so near saying a cusswordbut you see im on an awful strain in this palaver on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so mild  but weve got to give him up  there aint any getting around that i dont reckon  now if we can get you to help plant him  preach the funeral discourse  assist at the obsequies  obsquies is good  yes  thats itthats our little game  we are going to get the thing up regardless you know  he was always nifty himself and so you bet you his funeral aint going to be no slouch solid silver doorplate on his coffin six plumes on the hearse and a nigger on the box in a biled shirt and a plug hathows that for high and well take care of you pard  well fix you all right  therell be a kerridge for you and whatever you want you just scape out and well tend to it  weve got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind in no 1s house and dont you be afraid  just go in and toot your horn if you dont sell a clam  put buck through as bully as you can pard for anybody that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men that was ever in the mines  you cant draw it too strong  he never could stand it to see things going wrong  hes done more to make this town quiet and peaceable than any man in it  ive seen him lick four greasers in eleven minutes myself  if a thing wanted regulating he warnt a man to go browsing around after somebody to do it but he would prance in and regulate it himself  he warnt a catholic  scasely  he was down on em  his word was no irish need apply  but it didnt make no difference about that when it came down to what a mans rights wasand so when some roughs jumped the catholic boneyard and started in to stake out townlots in it he went for em  and he cleaned em too  i was there pard and i seen it myself  that was very well indeedat least the impulse waswhether the act was strictly defensible or not  had deceased any religious convictions that is to say did he feel a dependence upon or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power  more reflection  i reckon youve stumped me again pard  could you say it over once more and say it slow  well to simplify it somewhat was he or rather had he ever been connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to selfsacrifice in the interests of morality  all down but nineset em up on the other alley pard  what did i understand you to say  why youre most too many for me you know  when you get in with your left i hunt grass every time  every time you draw you fill but i dont seem to have any luck  lets have a new deal  how  begin again  thats it  very well  was he a good man and  therei see that dont put up another chip till i look at my hand a good man says you  pard it aint no name for it  he was the best man that everpard you would have doted on that man  he could lam any galoot of his inches in america  it was him that put down the riot last election before it got a start and everybody said he was the only man that could have done it  he waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a trumpet in the other and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less than three minutes  he had that riot all broke up and prevented nice before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow  he was always for peace and he would have peacehe could not stand disturbances  pard he was a great loss to this town  it would please the boys if you could chip in something like that and do him justice  here once when the micks got to throwing stones through the methodis sunday school windows buck fanshaw all of his own notion shut up his saloon and took a couple of sixshooters and mounted guard over the sunday school  says he no irish need apply  and they didnt  he was the bulliest man in the mountains pard  he could run faster jump higher hit harder and hold more tanglefoot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen counties  put that in parditll please the boys more than anything you could say  and you can say pard that he never shook his mother  never shook his mother  thats itany of the boys will tell you so  well but why should he shake her  thats what i saybut some people does  not people of any repute  well some that averages pretty soso  in my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own mother ought to  cheese it pard youve banked your ball clean outside the string what i was a drivin at was that he never throwed off on his mother dont you see  no indeedy  he give her a house to live in and town lots and plenty of money and he looked after her and took care of her all the time and when she was down with the smallpox im dd if he didnt set up nights and nuss her himself  beg your pardon for saying it but it hopped out too quick for yours truly  youve treated me like a gentleman pard and i aint the man to hurt your feelings intentional  i think youre white  i think youre a square man pard  i like you and ill lick any man that dont  ill lick him till he cant tell himself from a last years corpse  put it there another fraternal handshakeand exit  the obsequies were all that the boys could desire  such a marvel of funeral pomp had never been seen in virginia  the plumed hearse the dirgebreathing brass bands the closed marts of business the flags drooping at half mast the long plodding procession of uniformed secret societies military battalions and fire companies draped engines carriages of officials and citizens in vehicles and on foot attracted multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks roofs and windows and for years afterward the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in virginia was determined by comparison with buck fanshaws funeral  scotty briggs as a pallbearer and a mourner occupied a prominent place at the funeral and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of the prayer for the dead mans soul ascended he responded in a low voice but with feelings  amen  no irish need apply  as the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy it was probably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone for as scotty had once said it was his word  scotty briggs in after days achieved the distinction of becoming the only convert to religion that was ever gathered from the virginia roughs and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof to construct a christian  the making him one did not warp his generosity or diminish his courage on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to the one and a broader field to the other  if his sundayschool class progressed faster than the other classes was it matter for wonder  i think not  he talked to his pioneer smallfry in a language they understood  it was my large privilege a month before he died to hear him tell the beautiful story of joseph and his brethren to his class without looking at the book  i leave it to the reader to fancy what it was like as it fell riddled with slang from the lips of that grave earnest teacher and was listened to by his little learners with a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as he was that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties     chapter xlviii  the first twentysix graves in the virginia cemetery were occupied by murdered men  so everybody said so everybody believed and so they will always say and believe  the reason why there was so much slaughtering done was that in a new mining district the rough element predominates and a person is not respected until he has killed his man  that was the very expression used  if an unknown individual arrived they did not inquire if he was capable honest industrious buthad he killed his man  if he had not he gravitated to his natural and proper position that of a man of small consequence if he had the cordiality of his reception was graduated according to the number of his dead  it was tedious work struggling up to a position of influence with bloodless hands but when a man came with the blood of half a dozen men on his soul his worth was recognized at once and his acquaintance sought  in nevada for a time the lawyer the editor the banker the chief desperado the chief gambler and the saloon keeper occupied the same level in society and it was the highest  the cheapest and easiest way to become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at large was to stand behind a bar wear a clusterdiamond pin and sell whisky  i am not sure but that the saloonkeeper held a shade higher rank than any other member of society  his opinion had weight  it was his privilege to say how the elections should go  no great movement could succeed without the countenance and direction of the saloonkeepers  it was a high favor when the chief saloonkeeper consented to serve in the legislature or the board of aldermen  youthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law or the army and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon  to be a saloonkeeper and kill a man was to be illustrious  hence the reader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed in nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation so impatient was the slayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being held in indifferent repute by his associates  i knew two youths who tried to kill their men for no other reasonand got killed themselves for their pains  there goes the man that killed bill adams was higher praise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any other speech that admiring lips could utter  the men who murdered virginias original twentysix cemeteryoccupants were never punished  why  because alfred the great when he invented trial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice in his age of the world was not aware that in the nineteenth century the condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency it would prove the most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that human wisdom could contrive  for how could he imagine that we simpletons would go on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it of its usefulness any more than he could imagine that we would go on using his candleclock after we had invented chronometers  in his day news could not travel fast and hence he could easily find a jury of honest intelligent men who had not heard of the case they were called to try but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan compels us to swear in juries composed of fools and rascals because the system rigidly excludes honest men and men of brains  i remember one of those sorrowful farces in virginia which we call a jury trial  a noted desperado killed mr b a good citizen in the most wanton and coldblooded way  of course the papers were full of it and all men capable of reading read about it  and of course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic talked about it  a jurylist was made out and mr b l a prominent banker and a valued citizen was questioned precisely as he would have been questioned in any court in america  have you heard of this homicide  yes  have you held conversations upon the subject  yes  have you formed or expressed opinions about it  yes  have you read the newspaper accounts of it  yes  we do not want you  a minister intelligent esteemed and greatly respected a merchant of high character and known probity a mining superintendent of intelligence and unblemished reputation a quartz mill owner of excellent standing were all questioned in the same way and all set aside  each said the public talk and the newspaper reports had not so biased his mind but that sworn testimony would overthrow his previously formed opinions and enable him to render a verdict without prejudice and in accordance with the facts  but of course such men could not be trusted with the case ignoramuses alone could mete out unsullied justice  when the peremptory challenges were all exhausted a jury of twelve men was impaneleda jury who swore they had neither heard read talked about nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder which the very cattle in the corrals the indians in the sagebrush and the stones in the streets were cognizant of  it was a jury composed of two desperadoes two low beerhouse politicians three barkeepers two ranchmen who could not read and three dull stupid human donkeys  it actually came out afterward that one of these latter thought that incest and arson were the same thing  the verdict rendered by this jury was not guilty  what else could one expect  the jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty and a premium upon ignorance stupidity and perjury  it is a shame that we must continue to use a worthless system because it was good a thousand years ago  in this age when a gentleman of high social standing intelligence and probity swears that testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh with him street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay he is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own ignorance and stupidity and justice would be far safer in his hands than in theirs why could not the jury law be so altered as to give men of brains and honesty and equal chance with fools and miscreants  is it right to show the present favoritism to one class of men and inflict a disability on another in a land whose boast is that all its citizens are free and equal  i am a candidate for the legislature  i desire to tamper with the jury law  i wish to so alter it as to put a premium on intelligence and character and close the jury box against idiots blacklegs and people who do not read newspapers  but no doubt i shall be defeated every effort i make to save the country misses fire  my idea when i began this chapter was to say something about desperadoism in the flush times of nevada  to attempt a portrayal of that era and that land and leave out the blood and carnage would be like portraying mormondom and leaving out polygamy  the desperado stalked the streets with a swagger graded according to the number of his homicides and a nod of recognition from him was sufficient to make a humble admirer happy for the rest of the day  the deference that was paid to a desperado of wide reputation and who kept his private graveyard as the phrase went was marked and cheerfully accorded when he moved along the sidewalk in his excessively longtailed frockcoat shiny stumptoed boots and with dainty little slouch hat tipped over left eye the smallfry roughs made room for his majesty when he entered the restaurant the waiters deserted bankers and merchants to overwhelm him with obsequious service when he shouldered his way to a bar the shouldered parties wheeled indignantly recognized him andapologized  they got a look in return that froze their marrow and by that time a curled and breastpinned bar keeper was beaming over the counter proud of the established acquaintanceship that permitted such a familiar form of speech as  howre ye billy old fel  glad to see you  whatll you takethe old thing  the old thing meant his customary drink of course  the best known names in the territory of nevada were those belonging to these longtailed heroes of the revolver  orators governors capitalists and leaders of the legislature enjoyed a degree of fame but it seemed local and meagre when contrasted with the fame of such men as sam brown jack williams billy mulligan farmer pease sugarfoot mike pock marked jake el dorado johnny jack mcnabb joe mcgee jack harris sixfingered pete etc etc  there was a long list of them  they were brave reckless men and traveled with their lives in their hands  to give them their due they did their killing principally among themselves and seldom molested peaceable citizens for they considered it small credit to add to their trophies so cheap a bauble as the death of a man who was not on the shoot as they phrased it  they killed each other on slight provocation and hoped and expected to be killed themselves for they held it almost shame to die otherwise than with their boots on as they expressed it  i remember an instance of a desperados contempt for such small game as a private citizens life  i was taking a late supper in a restaurant one night with two reporters and a little printer namedbrown for instanceany name will do  presently a stranger with a longtailed coat on came in and not noticing browns hat which was lying in a chair sat down on it  little brown sprang up and became abusive in a moment  the stranger smiled smoothed out the hat and offered it to brown with profuse apologies couched in caustic sarcasm and begged brown not to destroy him  brown threw off his coat and challenged the man to fight abused him threatened him impeached his courage and urged and even implored him to fight and in the meantime the smiling stranger placed himself under our protection in mock distress  but presently he assumed a serious tone and said  very well gentlemen if we must fight we must i suppose  but dont rush into danger and then say i gave you no warning  i am more than a match for all of you when i get started  i will give you proofs and then if my friend here still insists i will try to accommodate him  the table we were sitting at was about five feet long and unusually cumbersome and heavy  he asked us to put our hands on the dishes and hold them in their places a momentone of them was a large oval dish with a portly roast on it  then he sat down tilted up one end of the table set two of the legs on his knees took the end of the table between his teeth took his hands away and pulled down with his teeth till the table came up to a level position dishes and all  he said he could lift a keg of nails with his teeth  he picked up a common glass tumbler and bit a semicircle out of it  then he opened his bosom and showed us a network of knife and bullet scars showed us more on his arms and face and said he believed he had bullets enough in his body to make a pig of lead  he was armed to the teeth  he closed with the remark that he was mr  of caribooa celebrated name whereat we shook in our shoes  i would publish the name but for the suspicion that he might come and carve me  he finally inquired if brown still thirsted for blood  brown turned the thing over in his mind a moment and thenasked him to supper  with the permission of the reader i will group together in the next chapter some samples of life in our small mountain village in the old days of desperadoism  i was there at the time  the reader will observe peculiarities in our official society and he will observe also an instance of how in new countries murders breed murders     chapter xlix  an extract or two from the newspapers of the day will furnish a photograph that can need no embellishment        fatal shooting affrayan affray occurred last evening in a       billiard saloon on c street between deputy marshal jack williams       and wm brown which resulted in the immediate death of the latter       there had been some difficulty between the parties for several       months        an inquest was immediately held and the following testimony       adduced        officer geo birdsall sworn saysi was told wm brown was drunk       and was looking for jack williams so soon as i heard that i started       for the parties to prevent a collision went into the billiard       saloon saw billy brown running around saying if anybody had       anything against him to show cause he was talking in a boisterous       manner and officer perry took him to the other end of the room to       talk to him brown came back to me remarked to me that he thought       he was as good as anybody and knew how to take care of himself he       passed by me and went to the bar dont know whether he drank or       not williams was at the end of the billiardtable next to the       stairway brown after going to the bar came back and said he was       as good as any man in the world he had then walked out to the end       of the first billiardtable from the bar i moved closer to them       supposing there would be a fight as brown drew his pistol i caught       hold of it he had fired one shot at williams dont know the effect       of it caught hold of him with one hand and took hold of the pistol       and turned it up think he fired once after i caught hold of the       pistol i wrenched the pistol from him walked to the end of the       billiardtable and told a party that i had browns pistol and to       stop shooting i think four shots were fired in all after walking       out mr foster remarked that brown was shot dead  oh there was no excitement about ithe merely remarked the small circumstance  four months later the following item appeared in the same paper the enterprise  in this item the name of one of the city officers above referred to deputy marshal jack williams occurs again        robbery and desperate affrayon tuesday night a german named       charles hurtzal engineer in a mill at silver city came to this       place and visited the hurdygurdy house on b street  the music       dancing and teutonic maidens awakened memories of faderland until       our german friend was carried away with rapture  he evidently had       money and was spending if freely  late in the evening jack       williams and andy blessington invited him down stairs to take a cup       of coffee  williams proposed a game of cards and went up stairs to       procure a deck but not finding any returned  on the stairway he       met the german and drawing his pistol knocked him down and rifled       his pockets of some seventy dollars  hurtzal dared give no alarm       as he was told with a pistol at his head if he made any noise or       exposed them they would blow his brains out  so effectually was he       frightened that he made no complaint until his friends forced him       yesterday a warrant was issued but the culprits had disappeared  this efficient city officer jack williams had the common reputation of being a burglar a highwayman and a desperado  it was said that he had several times drawn his revolver and levied money contributions on citizens at dead of night in the public streets of virginia  five months after the above item appeared williams was assassinated while sitting at a card table one night a gun was thrust through the crack of the door and williams dropped from his chair riddled with balls it was said at the time that williams had been for some time aware that a party of his own sort desperadoes had sworn away his life and it was generally believed among the people that williamss friends and enemies would make the assassination memorableand useful tooby a wholesale destruction of each other  it did not so happen but still times were not dull during the next twentyfour hours for within that time a woman was killed by a pistol shot a man was brained with a slung shot and a man named reeder was also disposed of permanently  some matters in the enterprise account of the killing of reeder are worth nothingespecially the accommodating complaisance of a virginia justice of the peace  the italics in the following narrative are mine        more cutting and shootingthe devil seems to have again broken       loose in our town  pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our       streets as in early times  when there has been a long season of       quiet people are slow to wet their hands in blood but once blood       is spilled cutting and shooting come easy  night before last jack       williams was assassinated and yesterday forenoon we had more bloody       work growing out of the killing of williams and on the same street       in which he met his death  it appears that tom reeder a friend of       williams and george gumbert were talking at the meat market of the       latter about the killing of williams the previous night when       reeder said it was a most cowardly act to shoot a man in such a way       giving him no show  gumbert said that williams had as good a       show as he gave billy brown meaning the man killed by williams       last march  reeder said it was a dd lie that williams had no       show at all  at this gumbert drew a knife and stabbed reeder       cutting him in two places in the back  one stroke of the knife cut       into the sleeve of reeders coat and passed downward in a slanting       direction through his clothing and entered his body at the small of       the back another blow struck more squarely and made a much more       dangerous wound  gumbert gave himself up to the officers of       justice and was shortly after discharged by justice atwill on his       own recognizance to appear for trial at six oclock in the evening       in the meantime reeder had been taken into the office of dr owens       where his wounds were properly dressed  one of his wounds was       considered quite dangerous and it was thought by many that it would       prove fatal  but being considerably under the influence of liquor       reeder did not feel his wounds as he otherwise would and he got up       and went into the street  he went to the meat market and renewed       his quarrel with gumbert threatening his life  friends tried to       interfere to put a stop to the quarrel and get the parties away from       each other  in the fashion saloon reeder made threats against the       life of gumbert saying he would kill him and it is said that he       requested the officers not to arrest gumbert as he intended to kill       him  after these threats gumbert went off and procured a       doublebarreled shot gun loaded with buckshot or revolver balls       and went after reeder  two or three persons were assisting him along       the street trying to get him home and had him just in front of the       store of klopstock  harris when gumbert came across toward him       from the opposite side of the street with his gun  he came up       within about ten or fifteen feet of reeder and called out to those       with him to look out get out of the way and they had only time       to heed the warning when he fired  reeder was at the time       attempting to screen himself behind a large cask which stood       against the awning post of klopstock  harriss store but some of       the balls took effect in the lower part of his breast and he reeled       around forward and fell in front of the cask  gumbert then raised       his gun and fired the second barrel which missed reeder and entered       the ground  at the time that this occurred there were a great many       persons on the street in the vicinity and a number of them called       out to gumbert when they saw him raise his gun to hold on and       dont shoot  the cutting took place about ten oclock and the       shooting about twelve  after the shooting the street was instantly       crowded with the inhabitants of that part of the town some       appearing much excited and laughingdeclaring that it looked like       the good old times of 60  marshal perry and officer birdsall       were near when the shooting occurred and gumbert was immediately       arrested and his gun taken from him when he was marched off to       jail  many persons who were attracted to the spot where this bloody       work had just taken place looked bewildered and seemed to be asking       themselves what was to happen next appearing in doubt as to whether       the killing mania had reached its climax or whether we were to turn       in and have a grand killing spell shooting whoever might have given       us offence  it was whispered around that it was not all over yet       five or six more were to be killed before night  reeder was taken       to the virginia city hotel and doctors called in to examine his       wounds  they found that two or three balls had entered his right       side one of them appeared to have passed through the substance of       the lungs while another passed into the liver  two balls were also       found to have struck one of his legs  as some of the balls struck       the cask the wounds in reeders leg were probably from these       glancing downwards though they might have been caused by the second       shot fired  after being shot reeder said when he got on his feet       smiling as he spokeit will take better shooting than that to       kill me  the doctors consider it almost impossible for him to       recover but as he has an excellent constitution he may survive       notwithstanding the number and dangerous character of the wounds he       has received  the town appears to be perfectly quiet at present as       though the late stormy times had cleared our moral atmosphere but       who can tell in what quarter clouds are lowering or plots ripening  reederor at least what was left of himsurvived his wounds two days nothing was ever done with gumbert  trial by jury is the palladium of our liberties  i do not know what a palladium is having never seen a palladium but it is a good thing no doubt at any rate  not less than a hundred men have been murdered in nevadaperhaps i would be within bounds if i said three hundredand as far as i can learn only two persons have suffered the death penalty there  however four or five who had no money and no political influence have been punished by imprisonmentone languished in prison as much as eight months i think  however i do not desire to be extravagantit may have been less  however one prophecy was verified at any rate  it was asserted by the desperadoes that one of their brethren joe mcgee a special policeman was known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate williams and they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against mcgee and that he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that had been adopted for the destruction of williamsa prophecy which came true a year later  after twelve months of distress for mcgee saw a fancied assassin in every man that approached him he made the last of many efforts to get out of the country unwatched  he went to carson and sat down in a saloon to wait for the stageit would leave at four in the morning  but as the night waned and the crowd thinned he grew uneasy and told the barkeeper that assassins were on his track  the barkeeper told him to stay in the middle of the room then and not go near the door or the window by the stove  but a fatal fascination seduced him to the neighborhood of the stove every now and then and repeatedly the barkeeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to remain there  but he could not  at three in the morning he again returned to the stove and sat down by a stranger  before the barkeeper could get to him with another warning whisper some one outside fired through the window and riddled mcgees breast with slugs killing him almost instantly  by the same discharge the stranger at mcgees side also received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or three days     chapter l  these murder and jury statistics remind me of a certain very extraordinary trial and execution of twenty years ago it is a scrap of history familiar to all old californians and worthy to be known by other peoples of the earth that love simple straightforward justice unencumbered with nonsense  i would apologize for this digression but for the fact that the information i am about to offer is apology enough in itself  and since i digress constantly anyhow perhaps it is as well to eschew apologies altogether and thus prevent their growing irksome  capt ned blakelythat name will answer as well as any other fictitious one for he was still with the living at last accounts and may not desire to be famoussailed ships out of the harbor of san francisco for many years  he was a stalwart warmhearted eagleeyed veteran who had been a sailor nearly fifty yearsa sailor from early boyhood  he was a rough honest creature full of pluck and just as full of hardheaded simplicity too  he hated trifling conventionalitiesbusiness was the word with him  he had all a sailors vindictiveness against the quips and quirks of the law and steadfastly believed that the first and last aim and object of the law and lawyers was to defeat justice  he sailed for the chincha islands in command of a guano ship  he had a fine crew but his negro mate was his peton him he had for years lavished his admiration and esteem  it was capt neds first voyage to the chinchas but his fame had gone before himthe fame of being a man who would fight at the dropping of a handkerchief when imposed upon and would stand no nonsense  it was a fame well earned  arrived in the islands he found that the staple of conversation was the exploits of one bill noakes a bully the mate of a trading ship  this man had created a small reign of terror there  at nine oclock at night capt ned all alone was pacing his deck in the starlight  a form ascended the side and approached him  capt ned said  who goes there  im bill noakes the best man in the islands  what do you want aboard this ship  ive heard of capt ned blakely and one of us is a better man than totherill know which before i go ashore  youve come to the right shopim your man  ill learn you to come aboard this ship without an invite  he seized noakes backed him against the mainmast pounded his face to a pulp and then threw him overboard  noakes was not convinced  he returned the next night got the pulp renewed and went overboard head first as before  he was satisfied  a week after this while noakes was carousing with a sailor crowd on shore at noonday capt neds colored mate came along and noakes tried to pick a quarrel with him  the negro evaded the trap and tried to get away  noakes followed him up the negro began to run noakes fired on him with a revolver and killed him  half a dozen seacaptains witnessed the whole affair  noakes retreated to the small aftercabin of his ship with two other bullies and gave out that death would be the portion of any man that intruded there  there was no attempt made to follow the villains there was no disposition to do it and indeed very little thought of such an enterprise  there were no courts and no officers there was no government the islands belonged to peru and peru was far away she had no official representative on the ground and neither had any other nation  however capt ned was not perplexing his head about such things  they concerned him not  he was boiling with rage and furious for justice at nine oclock at night he loaded a doublebarreled gun with slugs fished out a pair of handcuffs got a ships lantern summoned his quartermaster and went ashore  he said  do you see that ship there at the dock  ayay sir  its the venus  ayay sir  youyou know me  ayay sir  very well then  take the lantern  carry it just under your chin ill walk behind you and rest this gunbarrel on your shoulder pinting forwardso  keep your lantern well up sos i can see things ahead of you good  im going to march in on noakesand take himand jug the other chaps  if you flinchwell you know me  ayay sir  in this order they filed aboard softly arrived at noakess den the quartermaster pushed the door open and the lantern revealed the three desperadoes sitting on the floor  capt  ned said  im ned blakely  ive got you under fire  dont you move without ordersany of you  you two kneel down in the corner faces to the wall now  bill noakes put these handcuffs on now come up close quartermaster fasten em  all right  dont stir sir  quartermaster put the key in the outside of the door  now men im going to lock you two in and if you try to burst through this doorwell youve heard of me  bill noakes fall in ahead and march  all set  quartermaster lock the door  noakes spent the night on board blakelys ship a prisoner under strict guard  early in the morning capt ned called in all the seacaptains in the harbor and invited them with nautical ceremony to be present on board his ship at nine oclock to witness the hanging of noakes at the yardarm  what  the man has not been tried  of course he hasnt  but didnt he kill the nigger  certainly he did but you are not thinking of hanging him without a trial  trial  what do i want to try him for if he killed the nigger  oh capt  ned this will never do  think how it will sound  sound be hanged  didnt he kill the nigger  certainly certainly capt  nednobody denies thatbut  then im going to hang him thats all  everybody ive talked to talks just the same way you do  everybody says he killed the nigger everybody knows he killed the nigger and yet every lubber of you wants him tried for it  i dont understand such bloody foolishness as that  tried mind you i dont object to trying him if its got to be done to give satisfaction and ill be there and chip in and help too but put it off till afternoonput it off till afternoon for ill have my hands middling full till after the burying  why what do you mean  are you going to hang him any howand try him afterward  didnt i say i was going to hang him  i never saw such people as you whats the difference  you ask a favor and then you aint satisfied when you get it  before or afters all oneyou know how the trial will go  he killed the nigger  sayi must be going  if your mate would like to come to the hanging fetch him along  i like him  there was a stir in the camp  the captains came in a body and pleaded with capt ned not to do this rash thing  they promised that they would create a court composed of captains of the best character they would empanel a jury they would conduct everything in a way becoming the serious nature of the business in hand and give the case an impartial hearing and the accused a fair trial  and they said it would be murder and punishable by the american courts if he persisted and hung the accused on his ship  they pleaded hard  capt ned said  gentlemen im not stubborn and im not unreasonable  im always willing to do just as near right as i can  how long will it take  probably only a little while  and can i take him up the shore and hang him as soon as you are done  if he is proven guilty he shall be hanged without unnecessary delay  if hes proven guilty  great neptune aint he guilty  this beats my time  why you all know hes guilty  but at last they satisfied him that they were projecting nothing underhanded  then he said  well all right  you go on and try him and ill go down and overhaul his conscience and prepare him to golike enough he needs it and i dont want to send him off without a show for hereafter  this was another obstacle  they finally convinced him that it was necessary to have the accused in court  then they said they would send a guard to bring him  no sir i prefer to fetch him myselfhe dont get out of my hands besides ive got to go to the ship to get a rope anyway  the court assembled with due ceremony empaneled a jury and presently capt ned entered leading the prisoner with one hand and carrying a bible and a rope in the other  he seated himself by the side of his captive and told the court to up anchor and make sail  then he turned a searching eye on the jury and detected noakess friends the two bullies  he strode over and said to them confidentially  youre here to interfere you see  now you vote right do you hearor else therell be a doublebarreled inquest here when this trials off and your remainders will go home in a couple of baskets  the caution was not without fruit  the jury was a unitthe verdict guilty  capt  ned sprung to his feet and said  come alongyoure my meat now my lad anyway  gentlemen youve done yourselves proud  i invite you all to come and see that i do it all straight  follow me to the canyon a mile above here  the court informed him that a sheriff had been appointed to do the hanging and  capt  neds patience was at an end  his wrath was boundless  the subject of a sheriff was judiciously dropped  when the crowd arrived at the canyon capt ned climbed a tree and arranged the halter then came down and noosed his man  he opened his bible and laid aside his hat  selecting a chapter at random he read it through in a deep bass voice and with sincere solemnity  then he said  lad you are about to go aloft and give an account of yourself and the lighter a mans manifest is as far as sins concerned the better for him  make a clean breast man and carry a log with you thatll bear inspection  you killed the nigger  no reply  a long pause  the captain read another chapter pausing from time to time to impress the effect  then he talked an earnest persuasive sermon to him and ended by repeating the question  did you kill the nigger  no replyother than a malignant scowl  the captain now read the first and second chapters of genesis with deep feelingpaused a moment closed the book reverently and said with a perceptible savor of satisfaction  there  four chapters  theres few that would have took the pains with you that i have  then he swung up the condemned and made the rope fast stood by and timed him half an hour with his watch and then delivered the body to the court  a little after as he stood contemplating the motionless figure a doubt came into his face evidently he felt a twinge of consciencea misgivingand he said with a sigh  well praps i ought to burnt him maybe  but i was trying to do for the best  when the history of this affair reached california it was in the early days it made a deal of talk but did not diminish the captains popularity in any degree  it increased it indeed  california had a population then that inflicted justice after a fashion that was simplicity and primitiveness itself and could therefore admire appreciatively when the same fashion was followed elsewhere     chapter li  vice flourished luxuriantly during the heyday of our flush times  the saloons were overburdened with custom so were the police courts the gambling dens the brothels and the jailsunfailing signs of high prosperity in a mining regionin any region for that matter  is it not so  a crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade is brisk and money plenty  still there is one other sign it comes last but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the flush times are at the flood  this is the birth of the literary paper the weekly occidental devoted to literature made its appearance in virginia  all the literary people were engaged to write for it  mr f was to edit it  he was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen and a man who could say happy things in a crisp neat way  once while editor of the union he had disposed of a labored incoherent twocolumn attack made upon him by a contemporary with a single line which at first glance seemed to contain a solemn and tremendous complimentviz the logic of our adversary resembles the peace of godand left it to the readers memory and afterthought to invest the remark with another and more different meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure the rest of the scripturein that it passeth understanding  he once said of a little halfstarved wayside community that had no subsistence except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers who stopped over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage that in their church service they had altered the lords prayer to read give us this day our daily stranger  we expected great things of the occidental  of course it could not get along without an original novel and so we made arrangements to hurl into the work the full strength of the company  mrs f was an able romancist of the ineffable schooli know no other name to apply to a school whose heroes are all dainty and all perfect  she wrote the opening chapter and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked nothing but pearls and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of eccentricity  she also introduced a young french duke of aggravated refinement in love with the blonde  mr f followed next week with a brilliant lawyer who set about getting the dukes estates into trouble and a sparkling young lady of high society who fell to fascinating the duke and impairing the appetite of the blonde  mr d a dark and bloody editor of one of the dailies followed mr f the third  week introducing a mysterious roscicrucian who transmuted metals held consultations with the devil in a cave at dead of night and cast the horoscope of the several heroes and heroines in such a way as to provide plenty of trouble for their future careers and breed a solemn and awful public interest in the novel  he also introduced a cloaked and masked melodramatic miscreant put him on a salary and set him on the midnight track of the duke with a poisoned dagger  he also created an irish coachman with a rich brogue and placed him in the service of the societyyounglady with an ulterior mission to carry billetdoux to the duke  about this time there arrived in virginia a dissolute stranger with a literary turn of mindrather seedy he was but very quiet and unassuming almost diffident indeed  he was so gentle and his manners were so pleasing and kindly whether he was sober or intoxicated that he made friends of all who came in contact with him  he applied for literary work offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and practiced pen and so mr f engaged him at once to help write the novel his chapter was to follow mr ds and mine was to come next  now what does this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed to his quarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of chaos and that chaos in a condition of extravagant activity  the result may be guessed  he scanned the chapters of his predecessors found plenty of heroes and heroines already created and was satisfied with them he decided to introduce no more with all the confidence that whisky inspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant he then launched himself lovingly into his work he married the coachman to the societyyounglady for the sake of the scandal married the duke to the blondes stepmother for the sake of the sensation stopped the desperados salary created a misunderstanding between the devil and the roscicrucian threw the dukes property into the wicked lawyers hands made the lawyers upbraiding conscience drive him to drink thence to delirium tremens thence to suicide broke the coachmans neck let his widow succumb to contumely neglect poverty and consumption caused the blonde to drown herself leaving her clothes on the bank with the customary note pinned to them forgiving the duke and hoping he would be happy revealed to the duke by means of the usual strawberry mark on left arm that he had married his own longlost mother and destroyed his longlost sister instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the duke and the duchess in order to compass poetical justice opened the earth and let the roscicrucian through accompanied with the accustomed smoke and thunder and smell of brimstone and finished with the promise that in the next chapter after holding a general inquest he would take up the surviving character of the novel and tell what became of the devil it read with singular smoothness and with a dead earnestness that was funny enough to suffocate a body  but there was war when it came in the other novelists were furious  the mild stranger not yet more than half sober stood there under a scathing fire of vituperation meek and bewildered looking from one to another of his assailants and wondering what he could have done to invoke such a storm  when a lull came at last he said his say gently and appealinglysaid he did not rightly remember what he had written but was sure he had tried to do the best he could and knew his object had been to make the novel not only pleasant and plausible but instructive and  the bombardment began again  the novelists assailed his illchosen adjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and ridicule and so the siege went on  every time the stranger tried to appease the enemy he only made matters worse  finally he offered to rewrite the chapter  this arrested hostilities  the indignation gradually quieted down peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in safety and got him to his own citadel  but on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk again and again his imagination went mad  he led the heroes and heroines a wilder dance than ever and yet all through it ran that same convincing air of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first work  he got the characters into the most extraordinary situations put them through the most surprising performances and made them talk the strangest talk but the chapter cannot be described  it was symmetrically crazy it was artistically absurd and it had explanatory footnotes that were fully as curious as the text  i remember one of the situations and will offer it as an example of the whole  he altered the character of the brilliant lawyer and made him a greathearted splendid fellow gave him fame and riches and set his age at thirtythree years  then he made the blonde discover through the help of the roscicrucian and the melodramatic miscreant that while the duke loved her money ardently and wanted it he secretly felt a sort of leaning toward the societyyounglady  stung to the quick she tore her affections from him and bestowed them with tenfold power upon the lawyer who responded with consuming zeal  but the parents would none of it  what they wanted in the family was a duke and a duke they were determined to have though they confessed that next to the duke the lawyer had their preference  necessarily the blonde now went into a decline  the parents were alarmed  they pleaded with her to marry the duke but she steadfastly refused and pined on  then they laid a plan  they told her to wait a year and a day and if at the end of that time she still felt that she could not marry the duke she might marry the lawyer with their full consent  the result was as they had foreseen gladness came again and the flush of returning health  then the parents took the next step in their scheme  they had the family physician recommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the thorough restoration of the blondes strength and they invited the duke to be of the party  they judged that the dukes constant presence and the lawyers protracted absence would do the restfor they did not invite the lawyer  so they set sail in a steamer for americaand the third day out when their seasickness called truce and permitted them to take their first meal at the public table behold there sat the lawyer  the duke and party made the best of an awkward situation the voyage progressed and the vessel neared america  but by and by two hundred miles off new bedford the ship took fire she burned to the waters edge of all her crew and passengers only thirty were saved  they floated about the sea half an afternoon and all night long  among them were our friends  the lawyer by superhuman exertions had saved the blonde and her parents swimming back and forth two hundred yards and bringing one each timethe girl first  the duke had saved himself  in the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene and sent their boats  the weather was stormy and the embarkation was attended with much confusion and excitement  the lawyer did his duty like a man helped his exhausted and insensible blonde her parents and some others into a boat the duke helped himself in then a child fell overboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and helped half a dozen people fish it out under the stimulus of its mothers screams  then he ran backa few seconds too latethe blondes boat was under way  so he had to take the other boat and go to the other ship  the storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of each otherdrove them whither it would  when it calmed at the end of three days the blondes ship was seven hundred miles north of boston and the other about seven hundred south of that port  the blondes captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the north atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port without orders such being nautical law  the lawyers captain was to cruise in the north pacific and he could not go back or make a port without orders  all the lawyers money and baggage were in the blondes boat and went to the blondes shipso his captain made him work his passage as a common sailor  when both ships had been cruising nearly a year the one was off the coast of greenland and the other in behrings strait  the blonde had long ago been wellnigh persuaded that her lawyer had been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached the raft and now under the pleadings of her parents and the duke she was at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant and prepare for the hated marriage  but she would not yield a day before the date set  the weeks dragged on the time narrowed orders were given to deck the ship for the weddinga wedding at sea among icebergs and walruses  five days more and all would be over  so the blonde reflected with a sigh and a tear  oh where was her true loveand why why did he not come and save her  at that moment he was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in behrings strait five thousand miles away by the way of the arctic ocean or twenty thousand by the way of the hornthat was the reason  he struck but not with perfect aimhis foot slipped and he fell in the whales mouth and went down his throat  he was insensible five days  then he came to himself and heard voices daylight was streaming through a hole cut in the whales roof  he climbed out and astonished the sailors who were hoisting blubber up a ships side  he recognized the vessel flew aboard surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed  stop the proceedingsim here  come to my arms my own  there were footnotes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein the author endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the possibilities he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from behrings strait to the coast of greenland five thousand miles in five days through the arctic ocean from charles reades love me little love me long and considered that that established the fact that the thing could be done and he instanced jonahs adventure as proof that a man could live in a whales belly and added that if a preacher could stand it three days a lawyer could surely stand it five  there was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now and the stranger was peremptorily discharged and his manuscript flung at his head  but he had already delayed things so much that there was not time for some one else to rewrite the chapter and so the paper came out without any novel in it  it was but a feeble struggling stupid journal and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence at any rate before the first side of the next issue went to press the weekly occidental died as peacefully as an infant  an effort was made to resurrect it with the proposed advantage of a telling new title and mr f said that the phenix would be just the name for it because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its dead ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor but some lowpriced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the lazarus and inasmuch as the people were not profound in scriptural matters but thought the resurrected lazarus and the dilapidated mendicant that begged in the rich mans gateway were one and the same person the name became the laughing stock of the town and killed the paper for good and all  i was sorry enough for i was very proud of being connected with a literary paperprouder than i have ever been of anything since perhaps i had written some rhymes for itpoetry i considered itand it was a great grief to me that the production was on the first side of the issue that was not completed and hence did not see the light  but time brings its revengesi can put it in here it will answer in place of a tear dropped to the memory of the lost occidental  the idea not the chief idea but the vehicle that bears it was probably suggested by the old song called the raging canal but i cannot remember now  i do remember though that at that time i thought my doggerel was one of the ablest poems of the age   the aged pilot man  on the erie canal it was all on a summers day i sailed forth with my parents far away to albany  from out the clouds at noon that day there came a dreadful storm that piled the billows high about and filled us with alarm  a man came rushing from a house saying snub up your boat i pray the customary canal technicality for tie up snub up your boat snub up alas snub up while yet you may  our captain cast one glance astern then forward glanced he and said my wife and little ones i never more shall see  said dollinger the pilot man in noble words but few fear not but lean on dollinger and he will fetch you through  the boat drove on the frightened mules tore through the rain and wind and bravely still in dangers post the whipboy strode behind  come board come board the captain cried nor tempt so wild a storm but still the raging mules advanced and still the boy strode on  then said the captain to us all alas tis plain to me the greater danger is not there but here upon the sea  so let us strive while life remains to save all souls on board and then if die at last we must let         i cannot speak the word  said dollinger the pilot man towring above the crew fear not but trust in dollinger and he will fetch you through  low bridge  low bridge all heads went down the laboring bark sped on a mill we passed we passed church hamlets and fields of corn and all the world came out to see and chased along the shore crying alas alas the sheeted rain the wind the tempests roar alas the gallant ship and crew can nothing help them more  and from our deck sad eyes looked out across the stormy scene the tossing wake of billows aft the bending forests green the chickens sheltered under carts in lee of barn the cows the skurrying swine with straw in mouth the wild spray from our bows  she balances she wavers now let her go about if she misses stays and broaches to were allthen with a shout huray  huray avast  belay take in more sail

turned pale for plain to all this shoaling said a leak had burst the ditchs bed and straight as bolt from crossbow sped our ship swept on with shoaling lead before the fearful gale  sever the towline  cripple the mules too late  there comes a shock another length and the fated craft would have swum in the saving lock  then gathered together the shipwrecked crew and took one last embrace while sorrowful tears from despairing eyes ran down each hopeless face and some did think of their little ones whom they never more might see and others of waiting wives at home and mothers that grieved would be  but of all the children of misery there on that poor sinking frame but one spake words of hope and faith and i worshipped as they came said dollinger the pilot man o brave heart strong and true fear not but trust in dollinger for he will fetch you through  lo  scarce the words have passed his lips the dauntless prophet sayth when every soul about him seeth a wonder crown his faith  and

chapter to say an instructive word or two about the silver mines the reader may take this fair warning and skip if he chooses  the year 1863 was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination of the flush times  virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that degree that the place looked like a very hivethat is when ones vision could pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally blowing in summer  i will say concerning this dust that if you drove ten miles through it you and your horses would be coated with it a sixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a uniform pale yellow color and your buggy would have three inches of dust in it thrown there by the wheels  the delicate scales used by the assayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be airtight and yet some of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would get in somehow and impair the accuracy of those scales  speculation ran riot and yet there was a world of substantial business going on too  all freights were brought over the mountains from california 150 miles by packtrain partly and partly in huge wagons drawn by such long mule teams that each team amounted to a procession and it did seem sometimes that the grand combined procession of animals stretched unbroken from virginia to california  its long route was traceable clear across the deserts of the territory by the writhing serpent of dust it lifted up  by these wagons freights over that hundred and fifty miles were 200 a ton for small lots same price for all express matter brought by stage and 100 a ton for full loads one virginia firm received one hundred tons of freight a month and paid 10000 a month freightage  in the winter the freights were much higher all the bullion was shipped in bars by stage to san francisco a bar was usually about twice the size of a pig of lead and contained from 1500 to 3000 according to the amount of gold mixed with the silver and the freight on it when the shipment was large was one and a quarter per cent of its intrinsic value  so the freight on these bars probably averaged something more than 25 each  small shippers paid two per cent  there were three stages a day each way and i have seen the outgoing stages carry away a third of a ton of bullion each and more than once i saw them divide a twoton lot and take it off  however these were extraordinary events mr valentine wells fargos agent has handled all the bullion shipped through the virginia office for many a month  to his memorywhich is excellentwe are indebted for the following exhibit of the companys business in the virginia office since the first of january 1862 from january 1st to april 1st about 270000 worth of bullion passed through that office during the next quarter 570000 next quarter 800000 next quarter 956000 next quarter 1275000 and for the quarter ending on the 30th of last june about 1600000  thus in a year and a half the virginia office only shipped 5330000 in bullion  during the year 1862 they shipped 2615000 so we perceive the average shipments have more than doubled in the last six months  this gives us room to promise for the virginia office 500000 a month for the year 1863 though perhaps judging by the steady increase in the business we are under estimating somewhat  this gives us 6000000 for the year gold hill and silver city together can beat uswe will give them 10000000  to dayton empire city ophir and carson city we will allow an aggregate of 8000000 which is not over the mark perhaps and may possibly be a little under it  to esmeralda we give 4000000 to reese river and humboldt 2000000 which is liberal now but may not be before the year is out  so we prognosticate that the yield of bullion this year will be about 30000000  placing the number of mills in the territory at one hundred this gives to each the labor of producing 300000 in bullion during the twelve months  allowing them to run three hundred days in the year which none of them more than do this makes their work average 1000 a day  say the mills average twenty tons of rock a day and this rock worth 50 as a general thing and you have the actual work of our one hundred mills figured down to a spot1000 a day each and 30000000 a year in the aggregateenterprise a considerable over estimatem  t  two tons of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forty bars and the freight on it over 1000  each coach always carried a deal of ordinary express matter beside and also from fifteen to twenty passengers at from 25 to 30 a head  with six stages going all the time wells fargo and cos virginia city business was important and lucrative  all along under the centre of virginia and gold hill for a couple of miles ran the great comstock silver lodea vein of ore from fifty to eighty feet thick between its solid walls of rocka vein as wide as some of new yorks streets  i will remind the reader that in pennsylvania a coal vein only eight feet wide is considered ample  virginia was a busy city of streets and houses above ground  under it was another busy city down in the bowels of the earth where a great population of men thronged in and out among an intricate maze of tunnels and drifts flitting hither and thither under a winking sparkle of lights and over their heads towered a vast web of interlocking timbers that held the walls of the gutted comstock apart  these timbers were as large as a mans body and the framework stretched upward so far that no eye could pierce to its top through the closing gloom  it was like peering up through the cleanpicked ribs and bones of some colossal skeleton  imagine such a framework two miles long sixty feet wide and higher than any church spire in america  imagine this stately latticework stretching down broadway from the st nicholas to wall street and a fourth of july procession reduced to pigmies parading on top of it and flaunting their flags high above the pinnacle of trinity steeple one can imagine that but he cannot well imagine what that forest of timbers cost from the time they were felled in the pineries beyond washoe lake hauled up and around mount davidson at atrocious rates of freightage then squared let down into the deep maw of the mine and built up there  twenty ample fortunes would not timber one of the greatest of those silver mines  the spanish proverb says it requires a gold mine to run a silver one and it is true  a beggar with a silver mine is a pitiable pauper indeed if he cannot sell  i spoke of the underground virginia as a city  the gould and curry is only one single mine under there among a great many others yet the gould and currys streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in extent altogether and its population five hundred miners  taken as a whole the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a population of five or six thousand  in this present day some of those populations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under virginia and gold hill and the signalbells that tell them what the superintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as we strike a fire alarm  sometimes men fall down a shaft there a thousand feet deep  in such cases the usual plan is to hold an inquest  if you wish to visit one of those mines you may walk through a tunnel about half a mile long if you prefer it or you may take the quicker plan of shooting like a dart down a shaft on a small platform  it is like tumbling down through an empty steeple feet first  when you reach the bottom you take a candle and tramp through drifts and tunnels where throngs of men are digging and blasting you watch them send up tubs full of great lumps of stonesilver ore you select choice specimens from the mass as souvenirs you admire the world of skeleton timbering you reflect frequently that you are buried under a mountain a thousand feet below daylight being in the bottom of the mine you climb from gallery to gallery up endless ladders that stand straight up and down when your legs fail you at last you lie down in a small boxcar in a cramped incline like a halfupended sewer and are dragged up to daylight feeling as if you are crawling through a coffin that has no end to it arrived at the top you find a busy crowd of men receiving the ascending cars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long rows of bins capable of holding half a dozen tons each under the bins are rows of wagons loading from chutes and trapdoors in the bins and down the long street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the silver mills with their rich freight  it is all done now and there you are you need never go down again for you have seen it all  if you have forgotten the process of reducing the ore in the mill and making the silver bars you can go back and find it again in my esmeralda chapters if so disposed  of course these mines cave in in places occasionally and then it is worth ones while to take the risk of descending into them and observing the crushing power exerted by the pressing weight of a settling mountain i published such an experience in the enterprise once and from it i will take an extract        an hour in the caved mineswe journeyed down into the ophir mine       yesterday to see the earthquake  we could not go down the deep       incline because it still has a propensity to cave in places       therefore we traveled through the long tunnel which enters the hill       above the ophir office and then by means of a series of long       ladders climbed away down from the first to the fourth gallery       traversing a drift we came to the spanish line passed five sets of       timbers still uninjured and found the earthquake  here was as       complete a chaos as ever was seenvast masses of earth and       splintered and broken timbers piled confusedly together with       scarcely an aperture left large enough for a cat to creep through       rubbish was still falling at intervals from above and one timber       which had braced others earlier in the day was now crushed down out       of its former position showing that the caving and settling of the       tremendous mass was still going on  we were in that portion of the       ophir known as the north mines  returning to the surface we       entered a tunnel leading into the central for the purpose of       getting into the main ophir  descending a long incline in this       tunnel we traversed a drift or so and then went down a deep shaft       from whence we proceeded into the fifth gallery of the ophir  from       a sidedrift we crawled through a small hole and got into the midst       of the earthquake againearth and broken timbers mingled together       without regard to grace or symmetry  a large portion of the second       third and fourth galleries had caved in and gone to destructionthe       two latter at seven oclock on the previous evening        at the turntable near the northern extremity of the fifth gallery       two big piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth       gallery and from the looks of the timbers more was about to come       these beams are solideighteen inches square first a great beam       is laid on the floor then upright ones five feet high stand on       it supporting another horizontal beam and so on square above       square like the framework of a window  the superincumbent weight       was sufficient to mash the ends of those great upright beams fairly       into the solid wood of the horizontal ones three inches compressing       and bending the upright beam till it curved like a bow  before the       spanish caved in some of their twelveinch horizontal timbers were       compressed in this way until they were only five inches thick       imagine the power it must take to squeeze a solid log together in       that way  here also was a range of timbers for a distance of       twenty feet tilted six inches out of the perpendicular by the       weight resting upon them from the caved galleries above  you could       hear things cracking and giving way and it was not pleasant to know       that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking down upon       you  the men down in the mine do not mind it however        returning along the fifth gallery we struck the safe part of the       ophir incline and went down it to the sixth but we found ten       inches of water there and had to come back  in repairing the       damage done to the incline the pump had to be stopped for two       hours and in the meantime the water gained about a foot  however       the pump was at work again and the floodwater was decreasing       we climbed up to the fifth gallery again and sought a deep shaft       whereby we might descend to another part of the sixth out of reach       of the water but suffered disappointment as the men had gone to       dinner and there was no one to man the windlass  so having seen       the earthquake we climbed out at the union incline and tunnel and       adjourned all dripping with candle grease and perspiration to       lunch at the ophir office        during the great flush year of 1863 nevada claims to have       produced 25000000 in bullionalmost if not quite a round       million to each thousand inhabitants which is very well       considering that she was without agriculture and manufactures       silver mining was her sole productive industry since the above was       in type i learn from an official source that the above figure is       too high and that the yield for 1863 did not exceed 20000000       however the day for large figures is approaching the sutro tunnel       is to plow through the comstock lode from end to end at a depth of       two thousand feet and then mining will be easy and comparatively       inexpensive and the momentous matters of drainage and hoisting and       hauling of ore will cease to be burdensome  this vast work will       absorb many years and millions of dollars in its completion but       it will early yield money for that desirable epoch will begin as       soon as it strikes the first end of the vein  the tunnel will be       some eight miles long and will develop astonishing riches  cars       will carry the ore through the tunnel and dump it in the mills and       thus do away with the present costly system of double handling and       transportation by mule teams  the water from the tunnel will       furnish the motive power for the mills  mr sutro the originator       of this prodigious enterprise is one of the few men in the world       who is gifted with the pluck and perseverance necessary to follow up       and hound such an undertaking to its completion  he has converted       several obstinate congresses to a deserved friendliness toward his       important work and has gone up and down and to and fro in europe       until he has enlisted a great moneyed interest in it there     chapter liii  every now and then in these days the boys used to tell me i ought to get one jim blaine to tell me the stirring story of his grandfathers old rambut they always added that i must not mention the matter unless jim was drunk at the timejust comfortably and sociably drunk  they kept this up until my curiosity was on the rack to hear the story  i got to haunting blaine but it was of no use the boys always found fault with his condition he was often moderately but never satisfactorily drunk i never watched a mans condition with such absorbing interest such anxious solicitude i never so pined to see a man uncompromisingly drunk before  at last one evening i hurried to his cabin for i learned that this time his situation was such that even the most fastidious could find no fault with ithe was tranquilly serenely symmetrically drunknot a hiccup to mar his voice not a cloud upon his brain thick enough to obscure his memory  as i entered he was sitting upon an empty powderkeg with a clay pipe in one hand and the other raised to command silence  his face was round red and very serious his throat was bare and his hair tumbled in general appearance and costume he was a stalwart miner of the period  on the pine table stood a candle and its dim light revealed the boys sitting here and there on bunks candleboxes powderkegs etc  they said  sh  dont speakhes going to commence                   the story of the old ram  i found a seat at once and blaine said  i dont reckon them times will ever come again  there never was a more bullier old ram than what he was  grandfather fetched him from illinois got him of a man by the name of yatesbill yatesmaybe you might have heard of him his father was a deaconbaptistand he was a rustler too a man had to get up ruther early to get the start of old thankful yates it was him that put the greens up to jining teams with my grandfather when he moved west  seth green was probly the pick of the flock he married a wilkerson sarah wilkersongood cretur she wasone of the likeliest heifers that was ever raised in old stoddard everybody said that knowed her  she could heft a barl of flour as easy as i can flirt a flapjack  and spin dont mention it  independent  humph  when sile hawkins come a browsing around her she let him know that for all his tin he couldnt trot in harness alongside of her  you see sile hawkins wasno it warnt sile hawkins after allit was a galoot by the name of filkins i disremember his first name but he was a stumpcome into prar meeting drunk one night hooraying for nixon becuz he thought it was a primary and old deacon ferguson up and scooted him through the window and he lit on old miss jeffersons head poor old filly  she was a good soulhad a glass eye and used to lend it to old miss wagner that hadnt any to receive company in it warnt big enough and when miss wagner warnt noticing it would get twisted around in the socket and look up maybe or out to one side and every which way while t other one was looking as straight ahead as a spyglass  grown people didnt mind it but it most always made the children cry it was so sort of scary  she tried packing it in raw cotton but it wouldnt work somehowthe cotton would get loose and stick out and look so kind of awful that the children couldnt stand it no way  she was always dropping it out and turning up her old deadlight on the company empty and making them oncomfortable becuz she never could tell when it hopped out being blind on that side you see  so somebody would have to hunch her and say your game eye has fetched loose  miss wagner dear and then all of them would have to sit and wait till she jammed it in againwrong side before as a general thing and green as a birds egg being a bashful cretur and easy sot back before company  but being wrong side before warnt much difference anyway becuz her own eye was skyblue and the glass one was yaller on the front side so whichever way she turned it it didnt match nohow  old miss wagner was considerable on the borrow she was  when she had a quilting or dorcas siety at her house she genally borrowed miss higginss wooden leg to stump around on it was considerable shorter than her other pin but much she minded that  she said she couldnt abide crutches when she had company becuz they were so slow said when she had company and things had to be done she wanted to get up and hump herself she was as bald as a jug and so she used to borrow miss jacopss wig miss jacops was the coffinpeddlers wifea ratty old buzzard he was that used to go roosting around where people was sick waiting for em and there that old rip would sit all day in the shade on a coffin that he judged would fit the canidate and if it was a slow customer and kind of uncertain hed fetch his rations and a blanket along and sleep in the coffin nights  he was anchored out that way in frosty weather for about three weeks once before old robbinss place waiting for him and after that for as much as two years jacops was not on speaking terms with the old man on account of his disappinting him  he got one of his feet froze and lost money too becuz old robbins took a favorable turn and got well  the next time robbins got sick jacops tried to make up with him and varnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along but old robbins was too many for him he had him in and peared to be powerful weak he bought the coffin for ten dollars and jacops was to pay it back and twentyfive more besides if robbins didnt like the coffin after hed tried it  and then robbins died and at the funeral he bursted off the lid and riz up in his shroud and told the parson to let up on the performances becuz he could not stand such a coffin as that you see he had been in a trance once before when he was young and he took the chances on another callating that if he made the trip it was money in his pocket and if he missed fire he couldnt lose a cent  and by george he sued jacops for the rhino and got jedgment and he set up the coffin in his back parlor and said he lowed to take his time now it was always an aggravation to jacops the way that miserable old thing acted  he moved back to indiany pretty soonwent to wellsville wellsville was the place the hogadorns was from  mighty fine family old maryland stock  old squire hogadorn could carry around more mixed licker and cuss better than most any man i ever see  his second wife was the widder billingsshe that was becky martin her dam was deacon dunlaps first wife  her oldest child maria married a missionary and died in graceet up by the savages  they et him too poor feller biled him  it warnt the custom so they say but they explained to friends of hisn that went down there to bring away his things that theyd tried missionaries every other way and never could get any good out of emand so it annoyed all his relations to find out that that mans life was fooled away just out of a dernd experiment so to speak but mind you there aint anything ever reely lost everything that people cant understand and dont see the reason of does good if you only hold on and give it a fair shake provdence dont fire no blank catridges boys  that there missionarys substance unbeknowns to himself actuly converted every last one of them heathens that took a chance at the barbacue  nothing ever fetched them but that  dont tell me it was an accident that he was biled  there aint no such a thing as an accident  when my uncle lem was leaning up agin a scaffolding once sick or drunk or suthin an irishman with a hod full of bricks fell on him out of the third story and broke the old mans back in two places  people said it was an accident  much accident there was about that  he didnt know what he was there for but he was there for a good object  if he hadnt been there the irishman would have been killed  nobody can ever make me believe anything different from that  uncle lems dog was there  why didnt the irishman fall on the dog  becuz the dog would a seen him a coming and stood from under  thats the reason the dog warnt appinted a dog cant be depended on to carry out a special providence  mark my words it was a putup thing  accidents dont happen boys  uncle lems dogi wish you could a seen that dog  he was a reglar shepherdor ruther he was part bull and part shepherdsplendid animal belonged to parson hagar before uncle lem got him  parson hagar belonged to the western reserve hagars prime family his mother was a watson one of his sisters married a wheeler they settled in morgan county and he got nipped by the machinery in a carpet factory and went through in less than a quarter of a minute his widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in and people come a hundred mile to tend the funeral there was fourteen yards in the piece  she wouldnt let them roll him up but planted him just sofull length the church was middling small where they preached the funeral and they had to let one end of the coffin stick out of the window  they didnt bury himthey planted one end and let him stand up same as a monument and they nailed a sign on it and putput onput on itsacred tothe memoryof fourteen yardsof threeplycarpetcontaining all that wasmortalofofwilliamwhe  jim blaine had been growing gradually drowsy and drowsierhis head nodded once twice three timesdropped peacefully upon his breast and he fell tranquilly asleep  the tears were running down the boys cheeks they were suffocating with suppressed laughterand had been from the start though i had never noticed it  i perceived that i was sold i learned then that jim blaines peculiarity was that whenever he reached a certain stage of intoxication no human power could keep him from setting out with impressive unction to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfathers old ramand the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever heard him get concerning it  he always maundered off interminably from one thing to another till his whisky got the best of him and he fell asleep what the thing was that happened to him and his grandfathers old ram is a dark mystery to this day for nobody has ever yet found out     chapter liv  of course there was a large chinese population in virginiait is the case with every town and city on the pacific coast  they are a harmless race when white men either let them alone or treat them no worse than dogs in fact they are almost entirely harmless anyhow for they seldom think of resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries  they are quiet peaceable tractable free from drunkenness and they are as industrious as the day is long  a disorderly chinaman is rare and a lazy one does not exist  so long as a chinaman has strength to use his hands he needs no support from anybody white men often complain of want of work but a chinaman offers no such complaint he always manages to find something to do  he is a great convenience to everybodyeven to the worst class of white men for he bears the most of their sins suffering fines for their petty thefts imprisonment for their robberies and death for their murders  any white man can swear a chinamans life away in the courts but no chinaman can testify against a white man ours is the land of the freenobody denies thatnobody challenges it maybe it is because we wont let other people testify as i write news comes that in broad daylight in san francisco some boys have stoned an inoffensive chinaman to death and that although a large crowd witnessed the shameful deed no one interfered  there are seventy thousand and possibly one hundred thousand chinamen on the pacific coast  there were about a thousand in virginia  they were penned into a chinese quartera thing which they do not particularly object to as they are fond of herding together  their buildings were of wood usually only one story high and set thickly together along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through their quarter was a little removed from the rest of the town  the chief employment of chinamen in towns is to wash clothing  they always send a bill like this below pinned to the clothes  it is mere ceremony for it does not enlighten the customer much  their price for washing was 250 per dozenrather cheaper than white people could afford to wash for at that time  a very common sign on the chinese houses was see yup washer and ironer hong wo washer sam sing  ah hop washing the house servants cooks etc in california and nevada were chiefly chinamen  there were few white servants and no chinawomen so employed chinamen make good house servants being quick obedient patient quick to learn and tirelessly industrious  they do not need to be taught a thing twice as a general thing  they are imitative  if a chinaman were to see his master break up a centre table in a passion and kindle a fire with it that chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture for fuel forever afterward  all chinamen can read write and cipher with easy facilitypity but all our petted voters could  in california they rent little patches of ground and do a deal of gardening  they will raise surprising crops of vegetables on a sand pile  they waste nothing  what is rubbish to a christian a chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or another  he gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white people throw away and procures marketable tin and solder from them by melting  he gathers up old bones and turns them into manure in california he gets a living out of old mining claims that white men have abandoned as exhausted and worthlessand then the officers come down on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the legislature has given the broad general name of foreign mining tax but it is usually inflicted on no foreigners but chinamen  this swindle has in some cases been repeated once or twice on the same victim in the course of the same monthbut the public treasury was no additionally enriched by it probably  chinamen hold their dead in great reverencethey worship their departed ancestors in fact  hence in china a mans front yard back yard or any other part of his premises is made his family burying ground in order that he may visit the graves at any and all times  therefore that huge empire is one mighty cemetery it is ridged and wringled from its centre to its circumference with gravesand inasmuch as every foot of ground must be made to do its utmost in china lest the swarming population suffer for food the very graves are cultivated and yield a harvest custom holding this to be no dishonor to the dead  since the departed are held in such worshipful reverence a chinaman cannot bear that any indignity be offered the places where they sleep mr burlingame said that herein lay chinas bitter opposition to railroads a road could not be built anywhere in the empire without disturbing the graves of their ancestors or friends  a chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except his body lay in his beloved china also he desires to receive himself after death that worship with which he has honored his dead that preceded him therefore if he visits a foreign country he makes arrangements to have his bones returned to china in case he dies if he hires to go to a foreign country on a labor contract there is always a stipulation that his body shall be taken back to china if he dies if the government sells a gang of coolies to a foreigner for the usual fiveyear term it is specified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored to china in case of death  on the pacific coast the chinamen all belong to one or another of several great companies or organizations and these companies keep track of their members register their names and ship their bodies home when they die  the see yup company is held to be the largest of these  the ning yeong company is next and numbers eighteen thousand members on the coast  its headquarters are at san francisco where it has a costly temple several great officers one of whom keeps regal state in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity and a numerous priesthood  in it i was shown a register of its members with the dead and the date of their shipment to china duly marked  every ship that sails from san francisco carries away a heavy freight of chinese corpsesor did at least until the legislature with an ingenious refinement of christian cruelty forbade the shipments as a neat underhanded way of deterring chinese immigration  the bill was offered whether it passed or not  it is my impression that it passed  there was another billit became a lawcompelling every incoming chinaman to be vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly appointed quack no decent doctor would defile himself with such legalized robbery ten dollars for it as few importers of chinese would want to go to an expense like that the lawmakers thought this would be another heavy blow to chinese immigration  what the chinese quarter of virginia was likeor indeed what the chinese quarter of any pacific coast town was and is likemay be gathered from this item which i printed in the enterprise while reporting for that paper        chinatownaccompanied by a fellow reporter we made a trip through       our chinese quarter the other night  the chinese have built their       portion of the city to suit themselves and as they keep neither       carriages nor wagons their streets are not wide enough as a       general thing to admit of the passage of vehicles  at ten oclock       at night the chinaman may be seen in all his glory  in every little       coopedup dingy cavern of a hut faint with the odor of burning       joshlights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly       guttering tallow candle were two or three yellow longtailed       vagabonds coiled up on a sort of short trucklebed smoking opium       motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess       of satisfactionor rather the recent smoker looks thus immediately       after having passed the pipe to his neighborfor opiumsmoking is a       comfortless operation and requires constant attention  a lamp sits       on the bed the length of the long pipestem from the smokers       mouth he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire sets it on       fire and plasters it into the pipe much as a christian would fill a       hole with putty then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds       to smokeand the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of       the juices in the stem would wellnigh turn the stomach of a statue       john likes it though it soothes him he takes about two dozen       whiffs and then rolls over to dream heaven only knows what for we       could not imagine by looking at the soggy creature  possibly in his       visions he travels far away from the gross world and his regular       washing and feast on succulent rats and birdsnests in paradise  mr ah sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at no  13 wang street  he lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest way  he had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies with unpronouncable names imported from china in little crockery jugs and which he offered to us in dainty little miniature washbasins of porcelain  he offered us a mess of birdsnests also small neat sausages of which we could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen to try but we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse and therefore refrained  mr sing had in his store a thousand articles of merchandise curious to behold impossible to imagine the uses of and beyond our ability to describe  his ducks however and his eggs we could understand the former were split open and flattened out like codfish and came from china in that shape and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which kept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage  we found mr hong wo no 37 chowchow street making up a lottery schemein fact we found a dozen others occupied in the same way in various parts of the quarter for about every third chinaman runs a lottery and the balance of the tribe buck at it  tom who speaks faultless english and used to be chief and only cook to the territorial enterprise when the establishment kept bachelors hall two years ago said that sometime chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap ketch um two tree hundred sometime no ketch um anything lottery like one man fight um seventymaybe he whip maybe he get whip heself welly good  however the percentage being sixtynine against him the chances are as a general thing that he get whip heself  we could not see that these lotteries differed in any respect from our own save that the figures being chinese no ignorant white man might ever hope to succeed in telling tother from which the manner of drawing is similar to ours  mr see yup keeps a fancy store on live fox street  he sold us fans of white feathers gorgeously ornamented perfumery that smelled like limburger cheese chinese pens and watchcharms made of a stone unscratchable with steel instruments yet polished and tinted like the inner coat of a seashell  as tokens of his esteem see yup presented the party with gaudy plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with peacocks feathers  we ate chowchow with chopsticks in the celestial restaurants our comrade chided the mooneyed damsels in front of the houses for their want of feminine reserve we received protecting joshlights from our hosts and dickered for a pagan god or two  finally we were impressed with the genius of a chinese bookkeeper he figured up his accounts on a machine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars the different rows represented units tens hundreds and thousands  he fingered them with incredible rapidityin fact he pushed them from place to place as fast as a musical professors fingers travel over the keys of a piano  they are a kindly disposed wellmeaning race and are respected and well treated by the upper classes all over the pacific coast  no californian gentleman or lady ever abuses or oppresses a chinaman under any circumstances an explanation that seems to be much needed in the east only the scum of the population do itthey and their children they and naturally and consistently the policemen and politicians likewise for these are the dustlicking pimps and slaves of the scum there as well as elsewhere in america     chapter lv  i began to get tired of staying in one place so long  there was no longer satisfying variety in going down to carson to report the proceedings of the legislature once a year and horseraces and pumpkinshows once in three months they had got to raising pumpkins and potatoes in washoe valley and of course one of the first achievements of the legislature was to institute a tenthousanddollar agricultural fair to show off forty dollars worth of those pumpkins inhowever the territorial legislature was usually spoken of as the asylum  i wanted to see san francisco  i wanted to go somewhere  i wantedi did not know what i wanted  i had the spring fever and wanted a change principally no doubt  besides a convention had framed a state constitution nine men out of every ten wanted an office i believed that these gentlemen would treat the moneyless and the irresponsible among the population into adopting the constitution and thus wellnigh killing the country it could not well carry such a load as a state government since it had nothing to tax that could stand a tax for undeveloped mines could not and there were not fifty developed ones in the land there was but little realty to tax and it did seem as if nobody was ever going to think of the simple salvation of inflicting a money penalty on murder i believed that a state government would destroy the flush times and i wanted to get away  i believed that the mining stocks i had on hand would soon be worth 100000 and thought if they reached that before the constitution was adopted i would sell out and make myself secure from the crash the change of government was going to bring  i considered 100000 sufficient to go home with decently though it was but a small amount compared to what i had been expecting to return with  i felt rather downhearted about it but i tried to comfort myself with the reflection that with such a sum i could not fall into want  about this time a schoolmate of mine whom i had not seen since boyhood came tramping in on foot from reese river a very allegory of poverty the son of wealthy parents here he was in a strange land hungry bootless mantled in an ancient horseblanket roofed with a brimless hat and so generally and so extravagantly dilapidated that he could have taken the shine out of the prodigal son himself as he pleasantly remarked  he wanted to borrow fortysix dollarstwentysix to take him to san francisco and twenty for something else to buy some soap with maybe for he needed it  i found i had but little more than the amount wanted in my pocket so i stepped in and borrowed fortysix dollars of a banker on twenty days time without the formality of a note and gave it him rather than walk half a block to the office where i had some specie laid up  if anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back that fortysix dollars to the banker for i did not expect it of the prodigal and was not disappointed i would have felt injured  and so would the banker  i wanted a change  i wanted variety of some kind  it came  mr goodman went away for a week and left me the post of chief editor  it destroyed me  the first day i wrote my leader in the forenoon  the second day i had no subject and put it off till the afternoon  the third day i put it off till evening and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the american cyclopedia that steadfast friend of the editor all over this land  the fourth day i fooled around till midnight and then fell back on the cyclopedia again  the fifth day i cudgeled my brain till midnight and then kept the press waiting while i penned some bitter personalities on six different people  the sixth day i labored in anguish till far into the night and brought forthnothing  the paper went to press without an editorial  the seventh day i resigned  on the eighth mr goodman returned and found six duels on his handsmy personalities had borne fruit  nobody except he has tried it knows what it is to be an editor  it is easy to scribble local rubbish with the facts all before you it is easy to clip selections from other papers it is easy to string out a correspondence from any locality but it is unspeakable hardship to write editorials  subjects are the troublethe dreary lack of them i mean every day it is drag drag dragthink and worry and sufferall the world is a dull blank and yet the editorial columns must be filled only give the editor a subject and his work is doneit is no trouble to write it up but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains dry every day in the week fiftytwo weeks in the year  it makes one low spirited simply to think of it  the matter that each editor of a daily paper in america writes in the course of a year would fill from four to eight bulky volumes like this book  fancy what a library an editors work would make after twenty or thirty years service  yet people often marvel that dickens scott bulwer dumas etc have been able to produce so many books  if these authors had wrought as voluminously as newspaper editors do the result would be something to marvel at indeed how editors can continue this tremendous labor this exhausting consumption of brain fibre for their work is creative and not a mere mechanical layingup of facts like reporting day after day and year after year is incomprehensible  preachers take two months holiday in midsummer for they find that to produce two sermons a week is wearing in the long run  in truth it must be so and is so and therefore how an editor can take from ten to twenty texts and build upon them from ten to twenty painstaking editorials a week and keep it up all the year round is farther beyond comprehension than ever  ever since i survived my week as editor i have found at least one pleasure in any newspaper that comes to my hand it is in admiring the long columns of editorial and wondering to myself how in the mischief he did it  mr goodmans return relieved me of employment unless i chose to become a reporter again  i could not do that i could not serve in the ranks after being general of the army  so i thought i would depart and go abroad into the world somewhere  just at this juncture dan my associate in the reportorial department told me casually that two citizens had been trying to persuade him to go with them to new york and aid in selling a rich silver mine which they had discovered and secured in a new mining district in our neighborhood  he said they offered to pay his expenses and give him one third of the proceeds of the sale he had refused to go  it was the very opportunity i wanted  i abused him for keeping so quiet about it and not mentioning it sooner  he said it had not occurred to him that i would like to go and so he had recommended them to apply to marshall the reporter of the other paper i asked dan if it was a good honest mine and no swindle  he said the men had shown him nine tons of the rock which they had got out to take to new york and he could cheerfully say that he had seen but little rock in nevada that was richer and moreover he said that they had secured a tract of valuable timber and a millsite near the mine  my first idea was to kill dan  but i changed my mind notwithstanding i was so angry for i thought maybe the chance was not yet lost  dan said it was by no means lost that the men were absent at the mine again and would not be in virginia to leave for the east for some ten days that they had requested him to do the talking to marshall and he had promised that he would either secure marshall or somebody else for them by the time they got back he would now say nothing to anybody till they returned and then fulfil his promise by furnishing me to them  it was splendid  i went to bed all on fire with excitement for nobody had yet gone east to sell a nevada silver mine and the field was white for the sickle  i felt that such a mine as the one described by dan would bring a princely sum in new york and sell without delay or difficulty  i could not sleep my fancy so rioted through its castles in the air  it was the blind lead come again  next day i got away on the coach with the usual eclat attending departures of old citizensfor if you have only half a dozen friends out there they will make noise for a hundred rather than let you seem to go away neglected and unregrettedand dan promised to keep strict watch for the men that had the mine to sell  the trip was signalized but by one little incident and that occurred just as we were about to start  a very seedy looking vagabond passenger got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver bricks was thrown in  he was standing on the pavement when an awkward express employee carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds stumbled and let it fall on the bummers foot  he instantly dropped on the ground and began to howl in the most heartbreaking way  a sympathizing crowd gathered around and were going to pull his boot off but he screamed louder than ever and they desisted then he fell to gasping and between the gasps ejaculated brandy  for heavens sake brandy  they poured half a pint down him and it wonderfully restored and comforted him then he begged the people to assist him to the stage which was done the express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense but he declined and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along with him to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on he would be grateful and content  he was quickly supplied with two bottles and we drove off  he was so smiling and happy after that that i could not refrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a crushed foot  well said he i hadnt had a drink for twelve hours and hadnt a cent to my name  i was most perishingand so when that duffer dropped that hundredpounder on my foot i see my chance  got a cork leg you know and he pulled up his pantaloons and proved it  he was as drunk as a lord all day long and full of chucklings over his timely ingenuity  one drunken man necessarily reminds one of another  i once heard a gentleman tell about an incident which he witnessed in a californian barroom  he entitled it ye modest man taketh a drink  it was nothing but a bit of acting but it seemed to me a perfect rendering and worthy of toodles himself  the modest man tolerably far gone with beer and other matters enters a saloon twentyfive cents is the price for anything and everything and specie the only money used and lays down a half dollar calls for whiskey and drinks it the barkeeper makes change and lays the quarter in a wet place on the counter the modest man fumbles at it with nerveless fingers but it slips and the water holds it he contemplates it and tries again same result observes that people are interested in what he is at blushes fumbles at the quarter againblushesputs his forefinger carefully slowly down to make sure of his aimpushes the coin toward the barkeeper and says with a sigh  gimme a cigar  naturally another gentleman present told about another drunken man  he said he reeled toward home late at night made a mistake and entered the wrong gate thought he saw a dog on the stoop and it wasan iron one  he stopped and considered wondered if it was a dangerous dog ventured to say be hic begone  no effect  then he approached warily and adopted conciliation pursed up his lips and tried to whistle but failed still approached saying poor dogdoggy doggy doggypoor doggydog  got up on the stoop still petting with fond names till master of the advantages then exclaimed leave you thiefplanted a vindictive kick in his ribs and went headoverheels overboard of course  a pause a sigh or two of pain and then a remark in a reflective voice  awful solid dog  what could he ben eating  ic rocks praps such animals is dangerous  ats what i saytheyre dangerous  if a manicif a man wants to feed a dog on rocks let him feed him on rocks ats all right but let him keep him at homenot have him layin round promiscuous where ic where peoples liable to stumble over him when they aint noticin  it was not without regret that i took a last look at the tiny flag it was thirtyfive feet long and ten feet wide fluttering like a ladys handkerchief from the topmost peak of mount davidson two thousand feet above virginias roofs and felt that doubtless i was bidding a permanent farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous enjoyment of life i had ever experienced  and this reminds me of an incident which the dullest memory virginia could boast at the time it happened must vividly recall at times till its possessor dies  late one summer afternoon we had a rain shower  that was astonishing enough in itself to set the whole town buzzing for it only rains during a week or two weeks in the winter in nevada and even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for any merchant to keep umbrellas for sale  but the rain was not the chief wonder  it only lasted five or ten minutes while the people were still talking about it all the heavens gathered to themselves a dense blackness as of midnight  all the vast eastern front of mount davidson overlooking the city put on such a funereal gloom that only the nearness and solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly distinguishable from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested against  this unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain and as they looked a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving and quivering in the heart of the midnight away up on the extreme summit in a few minutes the streets were packed with people gazing with hardly an uttered word at the one brilliant mote in the brooding world of darkness  it flicked like a candleflame and looked no larger but with such a background it was wonderfully bright small as it was  it was the flagthough no one suspected it at first it seemed so like a supernatural visitor of some kinda mysterious messenger of good tidings some were fain to believe  it was the nations emblem transfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled from view and on no other object did the glory fall in all the broad panorama of mountain ranges and deserts  not even upon the staff of the flagfor that a needle in the distance at any time was now untouched by the light and undistinguishable in the gloom  for a whole hour the weird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude and still the thousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest  how the people were wrought up  the superstition grew apace that this was a mystic courier come with great news from the warthe poetry of the idea excusing and commending itand on it spread from heart to heart from lip to lip and from street to street till there was a general impulse to have out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of artillery  and all that time one sorely tried man the telegraph operator sworn to official secrecy had to lock his lips and chain his tongue with a silence that was like to rend them for he and he only of all the speculating multitude knew the great things this sinking sun had seen that day in the eastvicksburg fallen and the union arms victorious at gettysburg  but for the journalistic monopoly that forbade the slightest revealment of eastern news till a day after its publication in the california papers the glorified flag on mount davidson would have been saluted and resaluted that memorable evening as long as there was a charge of powder to thunder with the city would have been illuminated and every man that had any respect for himself would have got drunkas was the custom of the country on all occasions of public moment  even at this distant day i cannot think of this needlessly marred supreme opportunity without regret  what a time we might have had     chapter lvi  we rumbled over the plains and valleys climbed the sierras to the clouds and looked down upon summerclad california  and i will remark here in passing that all scenery in california requires distance to give it its highest charm  the mountains are imposing in their sublimity and their majesty of form and altitude from any point of viewbut one must have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings a californian forest is best at a little distance for there is a sad poverty of variety in species the trees being chiefly of one monotonous familyredwood pine spruce firand so at a near view there is a wearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms stretched down ward and outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to sh dont say a wordyou might disturb somebody  close at hand too there is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine there is a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining foliage one walks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spines of the foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft of a footfall he tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for substantial shapely leaves he looks for moss and grass to loll upon and finds none for where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt enemies to pensive musing and clean apparel  often a grassy plain in california is what it should be but often too it is best contemplated at a distance because although its grass blades are tall they stand up vindictively straight and selfsufficient and are unsociably wide apart with uncomely spots of barren sand between  one of the queerest things i know of is to hear tourists from the states go into ecstasies over the loveliness of everblooming california  and they always do go into that sort of ecstasies  but perhaps they would modify them if they knew how old californians with the memory full upon them of the dustcovered and questionable summer greens of californian verdure stand astonished and filled with worshipping admiration in the presence of the lavish richness the brilliant green the infinite freshness the spendthrift variety of form and species and foliage that make an eastern landscape a vision of paradise itself  the idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and sombre california when that man has seen new englands meadowexpanses and her maples oaks and cathedralwindowed elms decked in summer attire or the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests comes very near being funnywould be in fact but that it is so pathetic no land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful  the tropics are not for all the sentiment that is wasted on them  they seem beautiful at first but sameness impairs the charm by and by  change is the handmaiden nature requires to do her miracles with  the land that has four welldefined seasons cannot lack beauty or pall with monotony each season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the watching of its unfolding its gradual harmonious development its culminating gracesand just as one begins to tire of it it passes away and a radical change comes with new witcheries and new glories in its train and i think that to one in sympathy with nature each season in its turn seems the loveliest  san francisco a truly fascinating city to live in is stately and handsome at a fair distance but close at hand one notes that the architecture is mostly oldfashioned many streets are made up of decaying smokegrimed wooden houses and the barren sandhills toward the outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently  even the kindly climate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally experienced for a lovely cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and by and then when the longed for rain does come it stays  even the playful earthquake is better contemplated at a dis  however there are varying opinions about that  the climate of san francisco is mild and singularly equable  the thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round  it hardly changes at all  you sleep under one or two light blankets summer and winter and never use a mosquito bar  nobody ever wears summer clothing you wear black broadclothif you have itin august and january just the same  it is no colder and no warmer in the one month than the other  you do not use overcoats and you do not use fans  it is as pleasant a climate as could well be contrived take it all around and is doubtless the most unvarying in the whole world  the wind blows there a good deal in the summer months but then you can go over to oakland if you choosethree or four miles awayit does not blow there  it has only snowed twice in san francisco in nineteen years and then it only remained on the ground long enough to astonish the children and set them to wondering what the feathery stuff was  during eight months of the year straight along the skies are bright and cloudless and never a drop of rain falls  but when the other four months come along you will need to go and steal an umbrella  because you will require it  not just one day but one hundred and twenty days in hardly varying succession  when you want to go visiting or attend church or the theatre you never look up at the clouds to see whether it is likely to rain or notyou look at the almanac  if it is winter it will rainand if it is summer it wont rain and you cannot help it you never need a lightningrod because it never thunders and it never lightens  and after you have listened for six or eight weeks every night to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains you will wish in your heart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsy skies once and make everything aliveyou will wish the prisoned lightnings would cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a blinding glare for one little instant  you would give anything to hear the old familiar thunder again and see the lightning strike somebody  and along in the summer when you have suffered about four months of lustrous pitiless sunshine you are ready to go down on your knees and plead for rainhailsnowthunder and lightninganything to break the monotony you will take an earthquake if you cannot do any better  and the chances are that youll get it too  san francisco is built on sand hills but they are prolific sand hills they yield a generous vegetation  all the rare flowers which people in the states rear with such patient care in parlor flowerpots and greenhouses flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year round calla lilies all sorts of geraniums passion flowers moss rosesi do not know the names of a tenth part of them  i only know that while new yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow californians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers if they only keep their hands off and let them grow  and i have heard that they have also that rarest and most curious of all the flowers the beautiful espiritu santo as the spaniards call itor flower of the holy spirit though i thought it grew only in central americadown on the isthmus in its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove as pure as snow the spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it  the blossom has been conveyed to the states submerged in ether and the bulb has been taken thither also but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived has failed  i have elsewhere spoken of the endless winter of mono california and but this moment of the eternal spring of san francisco  now if we travel a hundred miles in a straight line we come to the eternal summer of sacramento  one never sees summerclothing or mosquitoes in san franciscobut they can be found in sacramento  not always and unvaryingly but about one hundred and fortythree months out of twelve years perhaps  flowers bloom there always the reader can easily believepeople suffer and sweat and swear morning noon and night and wear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves  it gets hot there but if you go down to fort yuma you will find it hotter  fort yuma is probably the hottest place on earth  the thermometer stays at one hundred and twenty in the shade there all the timeexcept when it varies and goes higher  it is a us military post and its occupants get so used to the terrific heat that they suffer without it  there is a tradition attributed to john phenix it has been purloined by fifty different scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed to steal onem  t that a very very wicked soldier died there once and of course went straight to the hottest corner of perdition and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets  there is no doubt about the truth of this statementthere can be no doubt about it  i have seen the place where that soldier used to board  in sacramento it is fiery summer always and you can gather roses and eat strawberries and icecream and wear white linen clothes and pant and perspire at eight or nine oclock in the morning and then take the cars and at noon put on your furs and your skates and go skimming over frozen donner lake seven thousand feet above the valley among snow banks fifteen feet deep and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty crags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea  there is a transition for you  where will you find another like it in the western hemisphere  and some of us have swept around snowwalled curves of the pacific railroad in that vicinity six thousand feet above the sea and looked down as the birds do upon the deathless summer of the sacramento valley with its fruitful fields its feathery foliage its silver streams all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted atmosphere and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distancea dreamy exquisite glimpse of fairyland made all the more charming and striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow and savage crags and precipices     chapter lvii  it was in this sacramento valley just referred to that a deal of the most lucrative of the early gold mining was done and you may still see in places its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered and disfigured by the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago  you may see such disfigurements far and wide over californiaand in some such places where only meadows and forests are visiblenot a living creature not a house no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin and not a sound not even a whisper to disturb the sabbath stillnessyou will find it hard to believe that there stood at one time a fiercelyflourishing little city of two thousand or three thousand souls with its newspaper fire company brass band volunteer militia bank hotels noisy fourth of july processions and speeches gambling hells crammed with tobacco smoke profanity and roughbearded men of all nations and colors with tables heaped with gold dust sufficient for the revenues of a german principalitystreets crowded and rife with businesstown lots worth four hundred dollars a front footlabor laughter music dancing swearing fighting shooting stabbinga bloody inquest and a man for breakfast every morningeverything that delights and adorns existence all the appointments and appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and promising young cityand now nothing is left of it all but a lifeless homeless solitude  the men are gone the houses have vanished even the name of the place is forgotten  in no other land in modern times have towns so absolutely died and disappeared as in the old mining regions of california  it was a driving vigorous restless population in those days  it was a curious population  it was the only population of the kind that the world has ever seen gathered together and it is not likely that the world will ever see its like again  for observe it was an assemblage of two hundred thousand young mennot simpering dainty kidgloved weaklings but stalwart muscular dauntless young braves brimful of push and energy and royally endowed with every attribute that goes to make up a peerless and magnificent manhoodthe very pick and choice of the worlds glorious ones  no women no children no gray and stooping veteransnone but erect brighteyed quickmoving stronghanded young giantsthe strangest population the finest population the most gallant host that ever trooped down the startled solitudes of an unpeopled land and where are they now  scattered to the ends of the earthor prematurely aged and decrepitor shot or stabbed in street affraysor dead of disappointed hopes and broken heartsall gone or nearly all victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calfthe noblest holocaust that ever wafted its sacrificial incense heavenward  it is pitiful to think upon  it was a splendid populationfor all the slow sleepy sluggishbrained sloths staid at homeyou never find that sort of people among pioneers you cannot build pioneers out of that sort of material  it was that population that gave to california a name for getting up astounding enterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent dash and daring and a recklessness of cost or consequences which she bears unto this dayand when she projects a new surprise the grave world smiles as usual and says well that is california all over  but they were rough in those times  they fairly reveled in gold whisky fights and fandangoes and were unspeakably happy  the honest miner raked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day and what with the gambling dens and the other entertainments he hadnt a cent the next morning if he had any sort of luck  they cooked their own bacon and beans sewed on their own buttons washed their own shirts blue woollen ones and if a man wanted a fight on his hands without any annoying delay all he had to do was to appear in public in a white shirt or a stovepipe hat and he would be accommodated  for those people hated aristocrats  they had a particular and malignant animosity toward what they called a biled shirt  it was a wild free disorderly grotesque society  menonly swarming hosts of stalwart mennothing juvenile nothing feminine visible anywhere  in those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that rare and blessed spectacle a woman  old inhabitants tell how in a certain camp the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was come  they had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the campinggroundsign of emigrants from over the great plains  everybody went down there and a shout went up when an actual bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind  the male emigrant was visible  the miners said  fetch her out  he said it is my wife gentlemenshe is sickwe have been robbed of money provisions everything by the indianswe want to rest  fetch her out  weve got to see her  but gentlemen the poor thing she  fetch her out  he fetched her out and they swung their hats and sent up three rousing cheers and a tiger and they crowded around and gazed at her and touched her dress and listened to her voice with the look of men who listened to a memory rather than a present realityand then they collected twentyfive hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man and swung their hats again and gave three more cheers and went home satisfied   once i dined in san francisco with the family of a pioneer and talked with his daughter a young lady whose first experience in san francisco was an adventure though she herself did not remember it as she was only two or three years old at the time  her father said that after landing from the ship they were walking up the street a servant leading the party with the little girl in her arms  and presently a huge miner bearded belted spurred and bristling with deadly weaponsjust down from a long campaign in the mountains evidentlybarred the way stopped the servant and stood gazing with a face all alive with gratification and astonishment  then he said reverently  well if it aint a child and then he snatched a little leather sack out of his pocket and said to the servant  theres a hundred and fifty dollars in dust there and ill give it to you to let me kiss the child  that anecdote is true  but see how things change  sitting at that dinnertable listening to that anecdote if i had offered double the money for the privilege of kissing the same child i would have been refused  seventeen added years have far more than doubled the price  and while upon this subject i will remark that once in star city in the humboldt mountains i took my place in a sort of long postoffice single file of miners to patiently await my chance to peep through a crack in the cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensationa genuine live woman  and at the end of half of an hour my turn came and i put my eye to the crack and there she was with one arm akimbo and tossing flapjacks in a fryingpan with the other  and she was one hundred and sixtyfive being in calmer mood now i voluntarily knock off a hundred from thatmt years old and hadnt a tooth in her head     chapter lviii  for a few months i enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of existencea butterfly idleness nothing to do nobody to be responsible to and untroubled with financial uneasiness  i fell in love with the most cordial and sociable city in the union  after the sagebrush and alkali deserts of washoe san francisco was paradise to me  i lived at the best hotel exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places infested the opera and learned to seem enraptured with music which oftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it if i had had the vulgar honesty to confess it  however i suppose i was not greatly worse than the most of my countrymen in that  i had longed to be a butterfly and i was one at last  i attended private parties in sumptuous evening dress simpered and aired my graces like a born beau and polkad and schottisched with a step peculiar to myselfand the kangaroo  in a word i kept the due state of a man worth a hundred thousand dollars prospectively and likely to reach absolute affluence when that silvermine sale should be ultimately achieved in the east  i spent money with a free hand and meantime watched the stock sales with an interested eye and looked to see what might happen in nevada  something very important happened  the property holders of nevada voted against the state constitution but the folks who had nothing to lose were in the majority and carried the measure over their heads  but after all it did not immediately look like a disaster though unquestionably it was one i hesitated calculated the chances and then concluded not to sell  stocks went on rising speculation went mad bankers merchants lawyers doctors mechanics laborers even the very washerwomen and servant girls were putting up their earnings on silver stocks and every sun that rose in the morning went down on paupers enriched and rich men beggared  what a gambling carnival it was  gould and curry soared to six thousand three hundred dollars a foot  and then all of a sudden out went the bottom and everything and everybody went to ruin and destruction  the wreck was complete  the bubble scarcely left a microscopic moisture behind it  i was an early beggar and a thorough one  my hoarded stocks were not worth the paper they were printed on  i threw them all away  i the cheerful idiot that had been squandering money like water and thought myself beyond the reach of misfortune had not now as much as fifty dollars when i gathered together my various debts and paid them  i removed from the hotel to a very private boarding house  i took a reporters berth and went to work  i was not entirely broken in spirit for i was building confidently on the sale of the silver mine in the east  but i could not hear from dan  my letters miscarried or were not answered  one day i did not feel vigorous and remained away from the office  the next day i went down toward noon as usual and found a note on my desk which had been there twentyfour hours  it was signed marshallthe virginia reporterand contained a request that i should call at the hotel and see him and a friend or two that night as they would sail for the east in the morning  a postscript added that their errand was a big mining speculation  i was hardly ever so sick in my life  i abused myself for leaving virginia and entrusting to another man a matter i ought to have attended to myself i abused myself for remaining away from the office on the one day of all the year that i should have been there and thus berating myself i trotted a mile to the steamer wharf and arrived just in time to be too late  the ship was in the stream and under way  i comforted myself with the thought that may be the speculation would amount to nothingpoor comfort at bestand then went back to my slavery resolved to put up with my thirtyfive dollars a week and forget all about it  a month afterward i enjoyed my first earthquake  it was one which was long called the great earthquake and is doubtless so distinguished till this day  it was just after noon on a bright october day  i was coming down third street  the only objects in motion anywhere in sight in that thickly built and populous quarter were a man in a buggy behind me and a street car wending slowly up the cross street  otherwise all was solitude and a sabbath stillness  as i turned the corner around a frame house there was a great rattle and jar and it occurred to me that here was an itemno doubt a fight in that house  before i could turn and seek the door there came a really terrific shock the ground seemed to roll under me in waves interrupted by a violent joggling up and down and there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses rubbing together i fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow  i knew what it was now and from mere reportorial instinct nothing else took out my watch and noted the time of day at that moment a third and still severer shock came and as i reeled about on the pavement trying to keep my footing i saw a sight  the entire front of a tall fourstory brick building in third street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawling across the street raising a dust like a great volume of smoke  and here came the buggyoverboard went the man and in less time than i can tell it the vehicle was distributed in small fragments along three hundred yards of street  one could have fancied that somebody had fired a charge of chairrounds and rags down the thoroughfare  the street car had stopped the horses were rearing and plunging the passengers were pouring out at both ends and one fat man had crashed half way through a glass window on one side of the car got wedged fast and was squirming and screaming like an impaled madman  every door of every house as far as the eye could reach was vomiting a stream of human beings and almost before one could execute a wink and begin another there was a massed multitude of people stretching in endless procession down every street my position commanded never was solemn solitude turned into teeming life quicker  of the wonders wrought by the great earthquake these were all that came under my eye but the tricks it did elsewhere and far and wide over the town made toothsome gossip for nine days  the destruction of property was triflingthe injury to it was widespread and somewhat serious  the curiosities of the earthquake were simply endless  gentlemen and ladies who were sick or were taking a siesta or had dissipated till a late hour and were making up lost sleep thronged into the public streets in all sorts of queer apparel and some without any at all  one woman who had been washing a naked child ran down the street holding it by the ankles as if it were a dressed turkey  prominent citizens who were supposed to keep the sabbath strictly rushed out of saloons in their shirtsleeves with billiard cues in their hands  dozens of men with necks swathed in napkins rushed from barbershops lathered to the eyes or with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy stubble  horses broke from stables and a frightened dog rushed up a short attic ladder and out on to a roof and when his scare was over had not the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up  a prominent editor flew down stairs in the principal hotel with nothing on but one brief undergarmentmet a chambermaid and exclaimed  oh what shall i do  where shall i go  she responded with naive serenity  if you have no choice you might try a clothingstore  a certain foreign consuls lady was the acknowledged leader of fashion and every time she appeared in anything new or extraordinary the ladies in the vicinity made a raid on their husbands purses and arrayed themselves similarly  one man who had suffered considerably and growled accordingly was standing at the window when the shocks came and the next instant the consuls wife just out of the bath fled by with no other apology for clothing thana bathtowel  the sufferer rose superior to the terrors of the earthquake and said to his wife  now that is something like  get out your towel my dear  the plastering that fell from ceilings in san francisco that day would have covered several acres of ground  for some days afterward groups of eyeing and pointing men stood about many a building looking at long zigzag cracks that extended from the eaves to the ground  four feet of the tops of three chimneys on one house were broken square off and turned around in such a way as to completely stop the draft  a crack a hundred feet long gaped open six inches wide in the middle of one street and then shut together again with such force as to ridge up the meeting earth like a slender grave  a lady sitting in her rocking and quaking parlor saw the wall part at the ceiling open and shut twice like a mouth and thendrop the end of a brick on the floor like a tooth  she was a woman easily disgusted with foolishness and she arose and went out of there  one lady who was coming down stairs was astonished to see a bronze hercules lean forward on its pedestal as if to strike her with its club  they both reached the bottom of the flight at the same timethe woman insensible from the fright  her child born some little time afterward was clubfooted  howeveron second thoughtif the reader sees any coincidence in this he must do it at his own risk  the first shock brought down two or three huge organpipes in one of the churches  the minister with uplifted hands was just closing the services  he glanced up hesitated and said  however we will omit the benedictionand the next instant there was a vacancy in the atmosphere where he had stood  after the first shock an oakland minister said  keep your seats  there is no better place to die than this  and added after the third  but outside is good enough  he then skipped out at the back door  such another destruction of mantel ornaments and toilet bottles as the earthquake created san francisco never saw before  there was hardly a girl or a matron in the city but suffered losses of this kind  suspended pictures were thrown down but oftener still by a curious freak of the earthquakes humor they were whirled completely around with their faces to the wall  there was great difference of opinion at first as to the course or direction the earthquake traveled but water that splashed out of various tanks and buckets settled that  thousands of people were made so seasick by the rolling and pitching of floors and streets that they were weak and bedridden for hours and some few for even days afterwardhardly an individual escaped nausea entirely  the queer earthquakeepisodes that formed the staple of san francisco gossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this and so i will diverge from the subject  by and by in the due course of things i picked up a copy of the enterprise one day and fell under this cruel blow        nevada mines in new yorkg  m  marshall sheba hurs and amos h       rose who left san francisco last july for new york city with ores       from mines in pine wood district humboldt county and on the reese       river range have disposed of a mine containing six thousand feet       and called the pine mountains consolidated for the sum of       3000000  the stamps on the deed which is now on its way to       humboldt county from new york for record amounted to 3000       which is said to be the largest amount of stamps ever placed on one       document  a working capital of 1000000 has been paid into the       treasury and machinery has already been purchased for a large       quartz mill which will be put up as soon as possible  the stock in       this company is all full paid and entirely unassessable  the ores       of the mines in this district somewhat resemble those of the sheba       mine in humboldt  sheba hurst the discoverer of the mines with       his friends corralled all the best leads and all the land and timber       they desired before making public their whereabouts  ores from       there assayed in this city showed them to be exceedingly rich in       silver and goldsilver predominating  there is an abundance of       wood and water in the district  we are glad to know that new york       capital has been enlisted in the development of the mines of this       region  having seen the ores and assays we are satisfied that the       mines of the district are very valuableanything but wildcat  once more native imbecility had carried the day and i had lost a million  it was the blind lead over again  let us not dwell on this miserable matter  if i were inventing these things i could be wonderfully humorous over them but they are too true to be talked of with hearty levity even at this distant day true and yet not exactly as given in the above figures possibly  i saw marshall months afterward and although he had plenty of money he did not claim to have captured an entire million  in fact i gathered that he had not then received 50000  beyond that figure his fortune appeared to consist of uncertain vast expectations rather than prodigious certainties  however when the above item appeared in print i put full faith in it and incontinently wilted and went to seed under it suffice it that i so lost heart and so yielded myself up to repinings and sighings and foolish regrets that i neglected my duties and became about worthless as a reporter for a brisk newspaper  and at last one of the proprietors took me aside with a charity i still remember with considerable respect and gave me an opportunity to resign my berth and so save myself the disgrace of a dismissal     chapter lix  for a time i wrote literary screeds for the golden era c h webb had established a very excellent literary weekly called the californian but high merit was no guaranty of success it languished and he sold out to three printers and bret harte became editor at 20 a week and i was employed to contribute an article a week at 12  but the journal still languished and the printers sold out to captain ogden a rich man and a pleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive luxury without much caring about the cost of it  when he grew tired of the novelty he resold to the printers the paper presently died a peaceful death and i was out of work again  i would not mention these things but for the fact that they so aptly illustrate the ups and downs that characterize life on the pacific coast  a man could hardly stumble into such a variety of queer vicissitudes in any other country  for two months my sole occupation was avoiding acquaintances for during that time i did not earn a penny or buy an article of any kind or pay my board  i became a very adept at slinking  i slunk from back street to back street i slunk away from approaching faces that looked familiar i slunk to my meals ate them humbly and with a mute apology for every mouthful i robbed my generous landlady of and at midnight after wanderings that were but slinkings away from cheerfulness and light i slunk to my bed  i felt meaner and lowlier and more despicable than the worms  during all this time i had but one piece of moneya silver ten cent pieceand i held to it and would not spend it on any account lest the consciousness coming strong upon me that i was entirely penniless might suggest suicide  i had pawned every thing but the clothes i had on so i clung to my dime desperately till it was smooth with handling  however i am forgetting  i did have one other occupation beside that of slinking  it was the entertaining of a collector and being entertained by him who had in his hands the virginia bankers bill for fortysix dollars which i had loaned my schoolmate the prodigal  this man used to call regularly once a week and dun me and sometimes oftener he did it from sheer force of habit for he knew he could get nothing he would get out his bill calculate the interest for me at five per cent a month and show me clearly that there was no attempt at fraud in it and no mistakes and then plead and argue and dun with all his might for any sumany little trifleeven a dollareven half a dollar on account  then his duty was accomplished and his conscience free  he immediately dropped the subject there always got out a couple of cigars and divided put his feet in the window and then we would have a long luxurious talk about everything and everybody and he would furnish me a world of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store in his memory by and by he would clap his hat on his head shake hands and say briskly  well business is businesscant stay with you alwaysand was off in a second  the idea of pining for a dun  and yet i used to long for him to come and would get as uneasy as any mother if the day went by without his visit when i was expecting him  but he never collected that bill at last nor any part of it  i lived to pay it to the banker myself  misery loves company  now and then at night in outofthe way dimly lighted places i found myself happening on another child of misfortune he looked so seedy and forlorn so homeless and friendless and forsaken that i yearned toward him as a brother  i wanted to claim kinship with him and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together  the drawing toward each other must have been mutual at any rate we got to falling together oftener though still seemingly by accident and although we did not speak or evince any recognition i think the dull anxiety passed out of both of us when we saw each other and then for several hours we would idle along contentedly wide apart and glancing furtively in at home lights and fireside gatherings out of the night shadows and very much enjoying our dumb companionship  finally we spoke and were inseparable after that  for our woes were identical almost  he had been a reporter too and lost his berth and this was his experience as nearly as i can recollect it  after losing his berth he had gone down down down with never a halt from a boarding house on russian hill to a boarding house in kearney street from thence to dupont from thence to a low sailor den and from thence to lodgings in goods boxes and empty hogsheads near the wharves  then for a while he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of grain on the piers when that failed he had found food here and there as chance threw it in his way  he had ceased to show his face in daylight now for a reporter knows everybody rich and poor high and low and cannot well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day  this mendicant blucheri call him that for conveniencewas a splendid creature  he was full of hope pluck and philosophy he was well read and a man of cultivated taste he had a bright wit and was a master of satire his kindliness and his generous spirit made him royal in my eyes and changed his curbstone seat to a throne and his damaged hat to a crown  he had an adventure once which sticks fast in my memory as the most pleasantly grotesque that ever touched my sympathies  he had been without a penny for two months  he had shirked about obscure streets among friendly dim lights till the thing had become second nature to him  but at last he was driven abroad in daylight  the cause was sufficient he had not tasted food for fortyeight hours and he could not endure the misery of his hunger in idle hiding  he came along a back street glowering at the loaves in bakeshop windows and feeling that he could trade his life away for a morsel to eat  the sight of the bread doubled his hunger but it was good to look at it any how and imagine what one might do if one only had it  presently in the middle of the street he saw a shining spotlooked againdid not and could not believe his eyesturned away to try them then looked again  it was a verityno vain hungerinspired delusionit was a silver dime  he snatched itgloated over it doubted itbit itfound it genuine choked his heart down and smothered a halleluiah  then he looked aroundsaw that nobody was looking at himthrew the dime down where it was beforewalked away a few steps and approached again pretending he did not know it was there so that he could reenjoy the luxury of finding it  he walked around it viewing it from different points then sauntered about with his hands in his pockets looking up at the signs and now and then glancing at it and feeling the old thrill again finally he took it up and went away fondling it in his pocket  he idled through unfrequented streets stopping in doorways and corners to take it out and look at it  by and by he went home to his lodgingsan empty queensware hogsheadand employed himself till night trying to make up his mind what to buy with it  but it was hard to do  to get the most for it was the idea  he knew that at the miners restaurant he could get a plate of beans and a piece of bread for ten cents or a fishball and some few trifles but they gave no bread with one fishball there  at french petes he could get a veal cutlet plain and some radishes and bread for ten cents or a cup of coffeea pint at leastand a slice of bread but the slice was not thick enough by the eighth of an inch and sometimes they were still more criminal than that in the cutting of it  at seven oclock his hunger was wolfish and still his mind was not made up  he turned out and went up merchant street still ciphering and chewing a bit of stick as is the way of starving men  he passed before the lights of martins restaurant the most aristocratic in the city and stopped  it was a place where he had often dined in better days and martin knew him well  standing aside just out of the range of the light he worshiped the quails and steaks in the show window and imagined that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him to go in there and take whatever he wanted  he chewed his stick with a hungry interest as he warmed to his subject  just at this juncture he was conscious of some one at his side sure enough and then a finger touched his arm  he looked up over his shoulder and saw an apparitiona very allegory of hunger  it was a man six feet high gaunt unshaven hung with rags with a haggard face and sunken cheeks and eyes that pleaded piteously  this phantom said  come with meplease  he locked his arm in bluchers and walked up the street to where the passengers were few and the light not strong and then facing about put out his hands in a beseeching way and said  friendstrangerlook at me  life is easy to youyou go about placid and content as i did once in my dayyou have been in there and eaten your sumptuous supper and picked your teeth and hummed your tune and thought your pleasant thoughts and said to yourself it is a good world but youve never suffered  you dont know what trouble isyou dont know what misery isnor hunger  look at me  stranger have pity on a poor friendless homeless dog  as god is my judge i have not tasted food for eight and forty hourslook in my eyes and see if i lie  give me the least trifle in the world to keep me from starvinganything twentyfive cents  do it strangerdo it please  it will be nothing to you but life to me  do it and i will go down on my knees and lick the dust before you  i will kiss your footprintsi will worship the very ground you walk on  only twentyfive cents  i am famishing perishingstarving by inches  for gods sake dont desert me  blucher was bewilderedand touched toostirred to the depths  he reflected  thought again  then an idea struck him and he said  come with me  he took the outcasts arm walked him down to martins restaurant seated him at a marble table placed the bill of fare before him and said  order what you want friend  charge it to me mr martin  all right mr blucher said martin  then blucher stepped back and leaned against the counter and watched the man stow away cargo after cargo of buckwheat cakes at seventyfive cents a plate cup after cup of coffee and porter house steaks worth two dollars apiece and when six dollars and a halfs worth of destruction had been accomplished and the strangers hunger appeased blucher went down to french petes bought a veal cutlet plain a slice of bread and three radishes with his dime and set to and feasted like a king  take the episode all around it was as odd as any that can be culled from the myriad curiosities of californian life perhaps     chapter lx  by and by an old friend of mine a miner came down from one of the decayed mining camps of tuolumne california and i went back with him we lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside and there were not five other cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest  yet a flourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this grassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years before and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teeming hive the centre of the city  when the mines gave out the town fell into decay and in a few years wholly disappearedstreets dwellings shops everythingand left no sign  the grassy slopes were as green and smooth and desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed  the mere handful of miners still remaining had seen the town spring up spread grow and flourish in its pride and they had seen it sicken and die and pass away like a dream  with it their hopes had died and their zest of life  they had long ago resigned themselves to their exile and ceased to correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes toward their early homes  they had accepted banishment forgotten the world and been forgotten of the world  they were far from telegraphs and railroads and they stood as it were in a living grave dead to the events that stirred the globes great populations dead to the common interests of men isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind it was the most singular and almost the most touching and melancholy exile that fancy can imagineone of my associates in this locality for two or three months was a man who had had a university education but now for eighteen years he had decayed there by inches a bearded roughclad claystained miner and at times among his sighings and soliloquizings he unconsciously interjected vaguely remembered latin and greek sentencesdead and musty tongues meet vehicles for the thoughts of one whose dreams were all of the past whose life was a failure a tired man burdened with the present and indifferent to the future a man without ties hopes interests waiting for rest and the end  in that one little corner of california is found a species of mining which is seldom or never mentioned in print  it is called pocket mining and i am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner  the gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt as in ordinary placer mines but is collected in little spots and they are very wide apart and exceedingly hard to find but when you do find one you reap a rich and sudden harvest  there are not now more than twenty pocket miners in that entire little region  i think i know every one of them personally  i have known one of them to hunt patiently about the hillsides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to make a snuffboxhis grocery bill running up relentlessly all the timeand then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in two dips of his shovel  i have known him to take out three thousand dollars in two hours and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness then enter on a dazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure before the night was gone  and the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills hunting pockets again happy and content  this is the most fascinating of all the different kinds of mining and furnishes a very handsome percentage of victims to the lunatic asylum  pocket hunting is an ingenious process  you take a spadeful of earth from the hillside and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment whatever gold was in that earth has remained because being the heaviest it has sought the bottom  among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pinheads  you are delighted  you move off to one side and wash another pan  if you find gold again you move to one side further and wash a third pan  if you find no gold this time you are delighted again because you know you are on the right scent  you lay an imaginary plan shaped like a fan with its handle up the hillfor just where the end of the handle is you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered  and so you proceed up the hill washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan and at last twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a pointa single foot from that point you cannot find any gold  your breath comes short and quick you are feverish with excitement the dinnerbell may ring its clapper off you pay no attention friends may die weddings transpire houses burn down they are nothing to you you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interestand all at once you strike it  up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold  sometimes that one spadeful is all500  sometimes the nest contains 10000 and it takes you three or four days to get it all out the pocketminers tell of one nest that yielded 60000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks and then sold the ground for 10000 to a party who never got 300 out of it afterward  the hogs are good pocket hunters  all the summer they root around the bushes and turn up a thousand little piles of dirt and then the miners long for the rains for the rains beat upon these little piles and wash them down and expose the gold possibly right over a pocket  two pockets were found in this way by the same man in one day  one had 5000 in it and the other 8000  that man could appreciate it for he hadnt had a cent for about a year  in tuolumne lived two miners who used to go to the neighboring village in the afternoon and return every night with household supplies  part of the distance they traversed a trail and nearly always sat down to rest on a great boulder that lay beside the path  in the course of thirteen years they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth sitting on it  by and by two vagrant mexicans came along and occupied the seat  they began to amuse themselves by chipping off flakes from the boulder with a sledgehammer  they examined one of these flakes and found it rich with gold that boulder paid them 800 afterward  but the aggravating circumstance was that these greasers knew that there must be more gold where that boulder came from and so they went panning up the hill and found what was probably the richest pocket that region has yet produced it took three months to exhaust it and it yielded 120000  the two american miners who used to sit on the boulder are poor yet and they take turn about in getting up early in the morning to curse those mexicansand when it comes down to pure ornamental cursing the native american is gifted above the sons of men  i have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mining because it is a subject that is seldom referred to in print and therefore i judged that it would have for the reader that interest which naturally attaches to novelty     chapter lxi  one of my comrades thereanother of those victims of eighteen years of unrequited toil and blighted hopeswas one of the gentlest spirits that ever bore its patient cross in a weary exile grave and simple dick baker pocketminer of deadhouse gulchhe was fortysix gray as a rat earnest thoughtful slenderly educated slouchily dressed and claysoiled but his heart was finer metal than any gold his shovel ever brought to lightthan any indeed that ever was mined or minted  whenever he was out of luck and a little downhearted he would fall to mourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used to own for where women and children are not men of kindly impulses take up with pets for they must love something  and he always spoke of the strange sagacity of that cat with the air of a man who believed in his secret heart that there was something human about itmay be even supernatural  i heard him talking about this animal once  he said  gentlemen i used to have a cat here by the name of tom quartz which youd a took an interest in i reckonmost any body would  i had him here eight yearand he was the remarkablest cat i ever see  he was a large gray one of the tom specie an he had more hard natchral sense than any man in this campn a power of dignityhe wouldnt let the govner of californy be familiar with him  he never ketched a rat in his lifepeared to be above it  he never cared for nothing but mining he knowed more about mining that cat did than any man i ever ever see you couldnt tell him nothn bout placer digginsn as for pocket mining why he was just born for it  he would dig out after me an jim when we went over the hills prospectn and he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile if we went so fur  an he had the best judgment about mining groundwhy you never see anything like it  when we went to work hed scatter a glance around n if he didnt think much of the indications he would give a look as much as to say well ill have to get you to excuse me n without another word hed hyste his nose into the air n shove for home  but if the ground suited him he would lay low n keep dark till the first pan was washed n then he would sidle up n take a look an if there was about six or seven grains of gold he was satisfiedhe didnt want no better prospect n thatn then he would lay down on our coats and snore like a steamboat till wed struck the pocket an then get up n superintend  he was nearly lightnin on superintending  well bye an bye up comes this yer quartz excitement  every body was into itevery body was pickn n blastn instead of shovelin dirt on the hill sideevery body was putn down a shaft instead of scrapin the surface  nothn would do jim but we must tackle the ledges too n so we did  we commenced putn down a shaft n tom quartz he begin to wonder what in the dickens it was all about  he hadnt ever seen any mining like that before n he was all upset as you may sayhe couldnt come to a right understanding of it no wayit was too many for him  he was down on it too you bet youhe was down on it powerful n always appeared to consider it the cussedest foolishness out  but that cat you know was always agin new fangled arrangementssomehow he never could abideem  you know how it is with old habits  but by an by tom quartz begin to git sort of reconciled a little though he never could altogether understand that eternal sinkin of a shaft an never pannin out any thing  at last he got to comin down in the shaft hisself to try to cipher it out  an when hed git the blues n feel kind oscruffy n aggravated n disgustedknowin as he did that the bills was runnin up all the time an we warnt makin a centhe would curl up on a gunny sack in the corner an go to sleep  well one day when the shaft was down about eight foot the rock got so hard that we had to put in a blastthe first blastn wed ever done since tom quartz was born  an then we lit the fuse n clumb out n got off bout fifty yardsn forgot n left tom quartz sound asleep on the gunny sack  in bout a minute we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole n then everything let go with an awful crash n about four million ton of rocks n dirt n smoke n splinters shot up bout a mile an a half into the air an by george right in the dead centre of it was old tom quartz a goin end over end an a snortin an a sneezn an a clawin an a reachin for things like all possessed  but it warnt no use you know it warnt no use  an that was the last we see of him for about two minutes n a half an then all of a sudden it begin to rain rocks and rubbage an directly he come down kerwhop about ten foot off fm where we stood well i reckon he was praps the orneriest lookin beast you ever see  one ear was sot back on his neck n his tail was stove up n his eyewinkers was swinged off n he was all blacked up with powder an smoke an all sloppy with mud n slush fm one end to the other  well sir it warnt no use to try to apologizewe couldnt say a word he took a sort of a disgusted look at hisself n then he looked at us an it was just exactly the same as if he had saidgents may be you think its smart to take advantage of a cat that aint had no experience of quartz minin but i think differentan then he turned on his heel n marched off home without ever saying another word  that was jest his style  an may be you wont believe it but after that you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz mining as what he was an by an bye when he did get to goin down in the shaft agin youd a been astonished at his sagacity  the minute wed tetch off a blast n the fused begin to sizzle hed give a look as much as to say well ill have to git you to excuse me an it was surprisn the way hed shin out of that hole n go fr a tree  sagacity  it aint no name for it  twas inspiration  i said well mr baker his prejudice against quartzmining was remarkable considering how he came by it  couldnt you ever cure him of it  cure him  no  when tom quartz was sot once he was always sotand you might a blowed him up as much as three million times n youd never a broken him of his cussed prejudice agin quartz mining  the affection and the pride that lit up bakers face when he delivered this tribute to the firmness of his humble friend of other days will always be a vivid memory with me  at the end of two months we had never struck a pocket  we had panned up and down the hillsides till they looked plowed like a field we could have put in a crop of grain then but there would have been no way to get it to market  we got many good prospects but when the gold gave out in the pan and we dug down hoping and longing we found only emptinessthe pocket that should have been there was as barren as our ownat last we shouldered our pans and shovels and struck out over the hills to try new localities  we prospected around angels camp in calaveras county during three weeks but had no success  then we wandered on foot among the mountains sleeping under the trees at night for the weather was mild but still we remained as centless as the last rose of summer  that is a poor joke but it is in pathetic harmony with the circumstances since we were so poor ourselves  in accordance with the custom of the country our door had always stood open and our board welcome to tramping minersthey drifted along nearly every day dumped their paust shovels by the threshold and took pot luck with usand now on our own tramp we never found cold hospitality  our wanderings were wide and in many directions and now i could give the reader a vivid description of the big trees and the marvels of the yo semitebut what has this reader done to me that i should persecute him i will deliver him into the hands of less conscientious tourists and take his blessing  let me be charitable though i fail in all virtues else  note some of the phrases in the above are mining technicalities purely and may be a little obscure to the general reader  in placer diggings the gold is scattered all through the surface dirt in pocket diggings it is concentrated in one little spot in quartz the gold is in a solid continuous vein of rock enclosed between distinct walls of some other kind of stoneand this is the most laborious and expensive of all the different kinds of mining  prospecting is hunting for a placer indications are signs of its presence panning out refers to the washing process by which the grains of gold are separated from the dirt a prospect is what one finds in the first panful of dirtand its value determines whether it is a good or a bad prospect and whether it is worth while to tarry there or seek further     chapter lxii  after a three months absence i found myself in san francisco again without a cent  when my credit was about exhausted for i had become too mean and lazy now to work on a morning paper and there were no vacancies on the evening journals i was created san francisco correspondent of the enterprise and at the end of five months i was out of debt but my interest in my work was gone for my correspondence being a daily one without rest or respite i got unspeakably tired of it i wanted another change  the vagabond instinct was strong upon me fortune favored and i got a new berth and a delightful one  it was to go down to the sandwich islands and write some letters for the sacramento union an excellent journal and liberal with employees  we sailed in the propeller ajax in the middle of winter  the almanac called it winter distinctly enough but the weather was a compromise between spring and summer  six days out of port it became summer altogether  we had some thirty passengers among them a cheerful soul by the name of williams and three seaworn old whaleship captains going down to join their vessels  these latter played euchre in the smoking room day and night drank astonishing quantities of raw whisky without being in the least affected by it and were the happiest people i think i ever saw  and then there was the old admiral  a retired whaleman he was a roaring terrific combination of wind and lightning and thunder and earnest wholesouled profanity  but nevertheless he was tenderhearted as a girl  he was a raving deafening devastating typhoon laying waste the cowering seas but with an unvexed refuge in the centre where all comers were safe and at rest  nobody could know the admiral without liking him and in a sudden and dire emergency i think no friend of his would know which to chooseto be cursed by him or prayed for by a less efficient person  his title of admiral was more strictly official than any ever worn by a naval officer before or since perhapsfor it was the voluntary offering of a whole nation and came direct from the people themselves without any intermediate red tapethe people of the sandwich islands it was a title that came to him freighted with affection and honor and appreciation of his unpretending merit  and in testimony of the genuineness of the title it was publicly ordained that an exclusive flag should be devised for him and used solely to welcome his coming and wave him godspeed in his going  from that time forth whenever his ship was signaled in the offing or he catted his anchor and stood out to sea that ensign streamed from the royal halliards on the parliament house and the nation lifted their hats to it with spontaneous accord  yet he had never fired a gun or fought a battle in his life  when i knew him on board the ajax he was seventytwo years old and had plowed the salt water sixtyone of them  for sixteen years he had gone in and out of the harbor of honolulu in command of a whaleship and for sixteen more had been captain of a san francisco and sandwich island passenger packet and had never had an accident or lost a vessel  the simple natives knew him for a friend who never failed them and regarded him as children regard a father  it was a dangerous thing to oppress them when the roaring admiral was around  two years before i knew the admiral he had retired from the sea on a competence and had sworn a colossal ninejointed oath that he would never go within smelling distance of the salt water again as long as he lived  and he had conscientiously kept it  that is to say he considered he had kept it and it would have been more than dangerous to suggest to him even in the gentlest way that making eleven long sea voyages as a passenger during the two years that had transpired since he retired was only keeping the general spirit of it and not the strict letter  the admiral knew only one narrow line of conduct to pursue in any and all cases where there was a fight and that was to shoulder his way straight in without an inquiry as to the rights or the merits of it and take the part of the weaker sideand this was the reason why he was always sure to be present at the trial of any universally execrated criminal to oppress and intimidate the jury with a vindictive pantomime of what he would do to them if he ever caught them out of the box  and this was why harried cats and outlawed dogs that knew him confidently took sanctuary under his chair in time of trouble  in the beginning he was the most frantic and bloodthirsty union man that drew breath in the shadow of the flag but the instant the southerners began to go down before the sweep of the northern armies he ran up the confederate colors and from that time till the end was a rampant and inexorable secessionist  he hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity than any individual i have ever met of either sex and he was never tired of storming against it and beseeching friends and strangers alike to be wary and drink with moderation  and yet if any creature had been guileless enough to intimate that his absorbing nine gallons of straight whiskey during our voyage was any fraction short of rigid or inflexible abstemiousness in that selfsame moment the old man would have spun him to the uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath  mind i am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs for it did not in even the slightest degree  he was a capacious container but he did not hold enough for that  he took a level tumblerful of whisky every morning before he put his clothes onto sweeten his bilgewater he saidhe took another after he got the most of his clothes on to settle his mind and give him his bearings  he then shaved and put on a clean shirt after which he recited the lords prayer in a fervent thundering bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all conversation in the main cabin  then at this stage being invariably by the head or by the stern or listed to port or starboard he took one more to put him on an even keel so that he would mind his hellum and not miss stays and go about every time he came up in the windand now his stateroom door swung open and the sun of his benignant face beamed redly out upon men and women and children and he roared his shipmets ahoy in a way that was calculated to wake the dead and precipitate the final resurrection and forth he strode a picture to look at and a presence to enforce attention  stalwart and portly not a gray hair broadbrimmed slouch hat semisailor toggery of blue navy flannelroomy and ample a stately expanse of shirtfront and a liberal amount of black silk neckcloth tied with a sailor knot large chain and imposing seals impending from his fob aweinspiring feet and a hand like the hand of providence as his whaling brethren expressed it wristbands and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow out of respect for the warm weather and exposing hairy arms gaudy with red and blue anchors ships and goddesses of liberty tattooed in india ink but these details were only secondary mattershis face was the lodestone that chained the eye  it was a sultry disk glowing determinedly out through a weather beaten mask of mahogany and studded with warts seamed with scars blazed all over with unfailing fresh slips of the razor and with cheery eyes under shaggy brows contemplating the world from over the back of a gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out of the undulating immensity that spread away from its foundations at his heels frisked the darling of his bachelor estate his terrier fan a creature no larger than a squirrel  the main part of his daily life was occupied in looking after fan in a motherly way and doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his imagination  the admiral seldom read newspapers and when he did he never believed anything they said  he read nothing and believed in nothing but the old guard a secession periodical published in new york  he carried a dozen copies of it with him always and referred to them for all required information  if it was not there he supplied it himself out of a bountiful fancy inventing history names dates and every thing else necessary to make his point good in an argument  consequently he was a formidable antagonist in a dispute  whenever he swung clear of the record and began to create history the enemy was helpless and had to surrender  indeed the enemy could not keep from betraying some little spark of indignation at his manufactured historyand when it came to indignation that was the admirals very best hold  he was always ready for a political argument and if nobody started one he would do it himself  with his third retort his temper would begin to rise and within five minutes he would be blowing a gale and within fifteen his smokingroom audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left solitary and alone banging the table with his fist kicking the chairs and roaring a hurricane of profanity  it got so after a while that whenever the admiral approached with politics in his eye the passengers would drop out with quiet accord afraid to meet him and he would camp on a deserted field  but he found his match at last and before a full company  at one time or another everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed except the quiet passenger williams  he had never been able to get an expression of opinion out of him on politics  but now just as the admiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out williams said  admiral are you certain about that circumstance concerning the clergymen you mentioned the other dayreferring to a piece of the admirals manufactured history  every one was amazed at the mans rashness  the idea of deliberately inviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible  the retreat came to a halt then everybody sat down again wondering to await the upshot of it  the admiral himself was as surprised as any one  he paused in the door with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face and contemplated the daring reptile in the corner  certain of it  am i certain of it  do you think ive been lying about it  what do you take me for  anybody that dont know that circumstance dont know anything a child ought to know it  read up your history read it up and dont come asking a man if hes certain about a bit of abc stuff that the very southern niggers know all about  here the admirals fires began to wax hot the atmosphere thickened the coming earthquake rumbled he began to thunder and lighten  within three minutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames and ashes of indignation belching black volumes of foul history aloft and vomiting redhot torrents of profanity from his crater  meantime williams sat silent and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in what the old man was saying  by and by when the lull came he said in the most deferential way and with the gratified air of a man who has had a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably  now i understand it  i always thought i knew that piece of history well enough but was still afraid to trust it because there was not that convincing particularity about it that one likes to have in history but when you mentioned every name the other day and every date and every little circumstance in their just order and sequence i said to myself this sounds something likethis is historythis is putting it in a shape that gives a man confidence and i said to myself afterward i will just ask the admiral if he is perfectly certain about the details and if he is i will come out and thank him for clearing this matter up for me and that is what i want to do nowfor until you set that matter right it was nothing but just a confusion in my mind without head or tail to it  nobody ever saw the admiral look so mollified before and so pleased nobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before its genuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks but here was a man that not only swallowed it all down but was grateful for the dose  he was taken a back he hardly knew what to say even his profanity failed him  now williams continued modestly and earnestly  but admiral in saying that this was the first stone thrown and that this precipitated the war you have overlooked a circumstance which you are perfectly familiar with but which has escaped your memory  now i grant you that what you have stated is correct in every detailto wit that on the 16th of october 1860 two massachusetts clergymen named waite and granger went in disguise to the house of john moody in rockport at dead of night and dragged forth two southern women and their two little children and after tarring and feathering them conveyed them to boston and burned them alive in the state house square and i also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the secession of south carolina on the 20th of december following  very well  here the company were pleasantly surprised to hear williams proceed to come back at the admiral with his own invincible weaponclean pure manufactured history without a word of truth in it  very well i say but admiral why overlook the willis and morgan case in south carolina you are too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance your arguments and your conversations have shown you to be intimately conversant with every detail of this national quarrel  you develop matters of history every day that show plainly that you are no smatterer in it content to nibble about the surface but a man who has searched the depths and possessed yourself of everything that has a bearing upon the great question  therefore let me just recall to your mind that willis and morgan casethough i see by your face that the whole thing is already passing through your memory at this moment  on the 12th of august 1860 two months before the waite and granger affair two south carolina clergymen named john h morgan and winthrop l  willis one a methodist and the other an old school baptist disguised themselves and went at midnight to the house of a planter named thompsonarchibald f thompson vice president under thomas jeffersonand took thence at midnight his widowed aunt a northern woman and her adopted child an orphannamed mortimer highie afflicted with epilepsy and suffering at the time from white swelling on one of his legs and compelled to walk on crutches in consequence and the two ministers in spite of the pleadings of the victims dragged them to the bush tarred and feathered them and afterward burned them at the stake in the city of charleston  you remember perfectly well what a stir it made you remember perfectly well that even the charleston courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant of questionable propriety and scarcely justifiable and likewise that it would not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued  and you remember also that this thing was the cause of the massachusetts outrage  who indeed were the two massachusetts ministers  and who were the two southern women they burned  i do not need to remind you admiral with your intimate knowledge of history that waite was the nephew of the woman burned in charleston that granger was her cousin in the second degree and that the woman they burned in boston was the wife of john h morgan and the still loved but divorced wife of winthrop l willis now admiral it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first provocation came from the southern preachers and that the northern ones were justified in retaliating  in your arguments you never yet have shown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise unfair when authoritative history condemned your position and therefore i have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from the massachusetts ministers in this matter and transfer it to the south carolina clergymen where it justly belongs  the admiral was conquered  this sweet spoken creature who swallowed his fraudulent history as if it were the bread of life basked in his furious blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine found only calm evenhanded justice in his rampart partisanship and flooded him with invented history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no rejecting it was too many for him  he stammered some awkward profane sentences about thewillis and morgan business having escaped his memory but that he remembered it now and then under pretence of giving fan some medicine for an imaginary cough drew out of the battle and went away a vanquished man  then cheers and laughter went up and williams the ships benefactor was a hero  the news went about the vessel champagne was ordered and enthusiastic reception instituted in the smoking room and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the conqueror  the wheelman said afterward that the admiral stood up behind the pilot house and ripped and cursed all to himself till he loosened the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail  the admirals power was broken  after that if he began argument somebody would bring williams and the old man would grow weak and begin to quiet down at once  and as soon as he was done williams in his dulcet insinuating way would invent some history referring for proof to the old mans own excellent memory and to copies of the old guard known not to be in his possession that would turn the tables completely and leave the admiral all abroad and helpless  by and by he came to so dread williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he saw him approach and finally ceased to mention politics altogether and from that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship     chapter lxiii  on a certain bright morning the islands hove in sight lying low on the lonely sea and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look  after two thousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one  as we approached the imposing promontory of diamond head rose up out of the ocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance and presently the details of the land began to make themselves manifest first the line of beach then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics then cabins of the natives then the white town of honolulu said to contain between twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level with streets from twenty to thirty feet wide solid and level as a floor most of them straight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew  the further i traveled through the town the better i liked it every step revealed a new contrastdisclosed something i was unaccustomed to in place of the grand mudcolored brown fronts of san francisco i saw dwellings built of straw adobies and creamcolored pebbleandshellconglomerated coral cut into oblong blocks and laid in cement also a great number of neat white cottages with green windowshutters in place of front yards like billiardtables with iron fences around them i saw these homes surrounded by ample yards thickly clad with green grass and shaded by tall trees through whose dense foliage the sun could scarcely penetrate in place of the customary geranium calla lily etc languishing in dust and general debility i saw luxurious banks and thickets of flowers fresh as a meadow after a rain and glowing with the richest dyes in place of the dingy horrors of san franciscos pleasure grove the willows i saw hugebodied widespreading forest trees with strange names and stranger appearance trees that cast a shadow like a thundercloud and were able to stand alone without being tied to green poles in place of gold fish wiggling around in glass globes assuming countless shades and degrees of distortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses i saw catstomcats mary ann cats longtailed cats bobtailed cats blind cats oneeyed cats walleyed cats crosseyed cats gray cats black cats white cats yellow cats striped cats spotted cats tame cats wild cats singed cats individual cats groups of cats platoons of cats companies of cats regiments of cats armies of cats multitudes of cats millions of cats and all of them sleek fat lazy and sound asleep i looked on a multitude of people some white in white coats vests pantaloons even white cloth shoes made snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning but the majority of the people were almost as dark as negroeswomen with comely features fine black eyes rounded forms inclining to the voluptuous clad in a single bright red or white garment that fell free and unconfined from shoulder to heel long black hair falling loose gypsy hats encircled with wreaths of natural flowers of a brilliant carmine tint plenty of dark men in various costumes and some with nothing on but a battered stovepipe hat tilted on the nose and a very scant breechclout certain smokedried children were clothed in nothing but sunshine a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed  in place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners i saw longhaired saddlecolored sandwich island maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner houses gazing indolently at whatever or whoever happened along instead of wretched cobblestone pavements i walked on a firm foundation of coral built up from the bottom of the sea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name with a light layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral belched up out of fathomless perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that stands dead and harmless in the distance now instead of cramped and crowded streetcars i met dusky native women sweeping by free as the wind on fleet horses and astride with gaudy ridingsashes streaming like banners behind them instead of the combined stenches of chinadom and brannan street slaughterhouses i breathed the balmy fragrance of jessamine oleander and the pride of india in place of the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of san francisco i moved in the midst of a summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the garden of eden in place of the golden citys skirting sand hills and the placid bay i saw on the one side a framework of tall precipitous mountains close at hand clad in refreshing green and cleft by deep cool chasmlike valleysand in front the grand sweep of the ocean a brilliant transparent green near the shore bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing against the reef and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea flecked with white caps and in the far horizon a single lonely sail a mere accentmark to emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that were without sound or limit  when the sun sunk downthe one intruder from other realms and persistent in suggestions of themit was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed air and forget that there was any world but these enchanted islands  it was such ecstacy to dream and dreamtill you got a bite  a scorpion bite  then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and kill the scorpion and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or brandy and the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future  then came an adjournment to the bedchamber and the pastime of writing up the days journal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the othera whole community of them at a slap  then observing an enemy approachinga hairy tarantula on stiltswhy not set the spittoon on him  it is done and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous idea of the magnitude of his reach  then to bed and become a promenade for a centipede with fortytwo legs on a side and every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a rawhide  more soaking with alcohol and a resolution to examine the bed before entering it in future  then wait and suffer till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in under the bar then slip out quickly shut them in and sleep peacefully on the floor till morning  meantime it is comforting to curse the tropics in occasional wakeful intervals  we had an abundance of fruit in honolulu of course  oranges pineapples bananas strawberries lemons limes mangoes guavas melons and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya which is deliciousness itself  then there is the tamarind  i thought tamarinds were made to eat but that was probably not the idea  i ate several and it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year  they pursed up my lips till they resembled the stemend of a tomato and i had to take my sustenance through a quill for twentyfour hours  they sharpened my teeth till i could have shaved with them and gave them a wire edge that i was afraid would stay but a citizen said no it will come off when the enamel doeswhich was comforting at any rate i found afterward that only strangers eat tamarindsbut they only eat them once     chapter lxiv  in my diary of our third day in honolulu i find this  i am probably the most sensitive man in hawaii tonightespecially about sitting down in the presence of my betters  i have ridden fifteen or twenty miles on horseback since 5 pm  and to tell the honest truth i have a delicacy about sitting down at all  an excursion to diamond head and the kings coacoanut grove was planned todaytime 430 pmthe party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies  they all started at the appointed hour except myself i was at the government prison with captain fish and another whaleshipskipper captain phillips and got so interested in its examination that i did not notice how quickly the time was passing somebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five oclock and that woke me up  it was a fortunate circumstance that captain phillips was along with his turn out as he calls a topbuggy that captain cook brought here in 1778 and a horse that was here when captain cook came captain phillips takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of his horse and to his passion for displaying them i owe it that we were only sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the american hotela distance which has been estimated to be over half a mile  but it took some fearful driving  the captains whip came down fast and the blows started so much dust out of the horses hide that during the last half of the journey we rode through an impenetrable fog and ran by a pocket compass in the hands of captain fish a whaler of twentysix years experience who sat there through the perilous voyage as selfpossessed as if he had been on the euchredeck of his own ship and calmly said port your helmport from time to time and hold her a little free steadysoso and luffhard down to starboard and never once lost his presence of mind or betrayed the least anxiety by voice or manner when we came to anchor at last and captain phillips looked at his watch and said sixteen minutesi told you it was in her  thats over three miles an hour i could see he felt entitled to a compliment and so i said i had never seen lightning go like that horse  and i never had  the landlord of the american said the party had been gone nearly an hour but that he could give me my choice of several horses that could overtake them  i said never mindi preferred a safe horse to a fast onei would like to have an excessively gentle horsea horse with no spirit whatevera lame one if he had such a thing  inside of five minutes i was mounted and perfectly satisfied with my outfit  i had no time to label him this is a horse and so if the public took him for a sheep i cannot help it  i was satisfied and that was the main thing  i could see that he had as many fine points as any mans horse and so i hung my hat on one of them behind the saddle and swabbed the perspiration from my face and started  i named him after this island oahu pronounced owawhee  the first gate he came to he started in i had neither whip nor spur and so i simply argued the case with him  he resisted argument but ultimately yielded to insult and abuse  he backed out of that gate and steered for another one on the other side of the street i triumphed by my former process  within the next six hundred yards he crossed the street fourteen times and attempted thirteen gates and in the meantime the tropical sun was beating down and threatening to cave the top of my head in and i was literally dripping with perspiration he abandoned the gate business after that and went along peaceably enough but absorbed in meditation  i noticed this latter circumstance and it soon began to fill me with apprehension  i said to my self this creature is planning some new outrage some fresh deviltry or otherno horse ever thought over a subject so profoundly as this one is doing just for nothing  the more this thing preyed upon my mind the more uneasy i became until the suspense became almost unbearable and i dismounted to see if there was anything wild in his eyefor i had heard that the eye of this noblest of our domestic animals is very expressive  i cannot describe what a load of anxiety was lifted from my mind when i found that he was only asleep  i woke him up and started him into a faster walk and then the villainy of his nature came out again  he tried to climb over a stone wall five or six feet high  i saw that i must apply force to this horse and that i might as well begin first as last  i plucked a stout switch from a tamarind tree and the moment he saw it he surrendered  he broke into a convulsive sort of a canter which had three short steps in it and one long one and reminded me alternately of the clattering shake of the great earthquake and the sweeping plunging of the ajax in a storm  and now there can be no fitter occasion than the present to pronounce a lefthanded blessing upon the man who invented the american saddle there is no seat to speak of about itone might as well sit in a shovel and the stirrups are nothing but an ornamental nuisance  if i were to write down here all the abuse i expended on those stirrups it would make a large book even without pictures  sometimes i got one foot so far through that the stirrup partook of the nature of an anklet sometimes both feet were through and i was handcuffed by the legs and sometimes my feet got clear out and left the stirrups wildly dangling about my shins  even when i was in proper position and carefully balanced upon the balls of my feet there was no comfort in it on account of my nervous dread that they were going to slip one way or the other in a moment  but the subject is too exasperating to write about  a mile and a half from town i came to a grove of tall cocoanut trees with clean branchless stems reaching straight up sixty or seventy feet and topped with a spray of green foliage sheltering clusters of cocoanutsnot more picturesque than a forest of collossal ragged parasols with bunches of magnified grapes under them would be  i once heard a gouty northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree might be poetical possibly it was but it looked like a featherduster struck by lightning  i think that describes it better than a pictureand yet without any question there is something fascinating about a cocoanut treeand graceful too  about a dozen cottages some frame and the others of native grass nestled sleepily in the shade here and there  the grass cabins are of a grayish color are shaped much like our own cottages only with higher and steeper roofs usually and are made of some kind of weed strongly bound together in bundles  the roofs are very thick and so are the walls the latter have square holes in them for windows  at a little distance these cabins have a furry appearance as if they might be made of bear skins  they are very cool and pleasant inside  the kings flag was flying from the roof of one of the cottages and his majesty was probably within  he owns the whole concern thereabouts and passes his time there frequently on sultry days laying off  the spot is called the kings grove  near by is an interesting ruinthe meagre remains of an ancient heathen templea place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old bygone days when the simple child of nature yielding momentarily to sin when sorely tempted acknowledged his error when calm reflection had shown it him and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his grandmother as an atoning sacrificein those old days when the luckless sinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical happiness as long as his relations held out long long before the missionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them permanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a place heaven is and how nearly impossible it is to get there and showed the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what unnecessarily liberal facilities there are for going to it showed him how in his ignorance he had gone and fooled away all his kinfolks to no purpose showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty cents to buy food for next day with as compared with fishing for pastime and lolling in the shade through eternal summer and eating of the bounty that nobody labored to provide but nature  how sad it is to think of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this beautiful island and never knew there was a hell  this ancient temple was built of rough blocks of lava and was simply a roofless inclosure a hundred and thirty feet long and seventy wide nothing but naked walls very thick but not much higher than a mans head  they will last for ages no doubt if left unmolested  its three altars and other sacred appurtenances have crumbled and passed away years ago  it is said that in the old times thousands of human beings were slaughtered here in the presence of naked and howling savages  if these mute stones could speak what tales they could tell what pictures they could describe of fettered victims writhing under the knife of massed forms straining forward out of the gloom with ferocious faces lit up by the sacrificial fires of the background of ghostly trees of the dark pyramid of diamond head standing sentinel over the uncanny scene and the peaceful moon looking down upon it through rifts in the cloudrack  when kamehameha pronounced kamayhamayah the greatwho was a sort of a napoleon in military genius and uniform successinvaded this island of oahu three quarters of a century ago and exterminated the army sent to oppose him and took full and final possession of the country he searched out the dead body of the king of oahu and those of the principal chiefs and impaled their heads on the walls of this temple  those were savage times when this old slaughterhouse was in its prime the king and the chiefs ruled the common herd with a rod of iron made them gather all the provisions the masters needed build all the houses and temples stand all the expenses of whatever kind take kicks and cuffs for thanks drag out lives well flavored with misery and then suffer death for trifling offences or yield up their lives on the sacrificial altars to purchase favors from the gods for their hard rulers  the missionaries have clothed them educated them broken up the tyrannous authority of their chiefs and given them freedom and the right to enjoy whatever their hands and brains produce with equal laws for all and punishment for all alike who transgress them  the contrast is so strongthe benefit conferred upon this people by the missionaries is so prominent so palpable and so unquestionable that the frankest compliment i can pay them and the best is simply to point to the condition of the sandwich islanders of captain cooks time and their condition today  their work speaks for itself     chapter lxv  by and by after a rugged climb we halted on the summit of a hill which commanded a farreaching view  the moon rose and flooded mountain and valley and ocean with a mellow radiance and out of the shadows of the foliage the distant lights of honolulu glinted like an encampment of fireflies  the air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers  the halt was briefgayly laughing and talking the party galloped on and i clung to the pommel and cantered after  presently we came to a place where no grass grewa wide expanse of deep sand  they said it was an old battle ground  all around everywhere not three feet apart the bleached bones of men gleamed white in the moonlight  we picked up a lot of them for mementoes  i got quite a number of arm bones and leg bones of great chiefs may be who had fought savagely in that fearful battle in the old days when blood flowed like wine where we now stoodand wore the choicest of them out on oahu afterward trying to make him go  all sorts of bones could be found except skulls but a citizen said irreverently that there had been an unusual number of skullhunters there latelya species of sportsmen i had never heard of before  nothing whatever is known about this placeits story is a secret that will never be revealed  the oldest natives make no pretense of being possessed of its history  they say these bones were here when they were children  they were here when their grandfathers were childrenbut how they came here they can only conjecture  many people believe this spot to be an ancient battleground and it is usual to call it so and they believe that these skeletons have lain for ages just where their proprietors fell in the great fight  other people believe that kamehameha i  fought his first battle here  on this point i have heard a story which may have been taken from one of the numerous books which have been written concerning these islandsi do not know where the narrator got it  he said that when kamehameha who was at first merely a subordinate chief on the island of hawaii landed here he brought a large army with him and encamped at waikiki  the oahuans marched against him and so confident were they of success that they readily acceded to a demand of their priests that they should draw a line where these bones now lie and take an oath that if forced to retreat at all they would never retreat beyond this boundary  the priests told them that death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated the oath and the march was resumed  kamehameha drove them back step by step the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted them both by voice and inspiriting example to remember their oathto die if need be but never cross the fatal line  the struggle was manfully maintained but at last the chief priest fell pierced to the heart with a spear and the unlucky omen fell like a blight upon the brave souls at his back with a triumphant shout the invaders pressed forwardthe line was crossedthe offended gods deserted the despairing army and accepting the doom their perjury had brought upon them they broke and fled over the plain where honolulu stands nowup the beautiful nuuanu valley paused a moment hemmed in by precipitous mountains on either hand and the frightful precipice of the pari in front and then were driven over a sheer plunge of six hundred feet  the story is pretty enough but mr jarves excellent history says the oahuans were intrenched in nuuanu valley that kamehameha ousted them routed them pursued them up the valley and drove them over the precipice  he makes no mention of our boneyard at all in his book  impressed by the profound silence and repose that rested over the beautiful landscape and being as usual in the rear i gave voice to my thoughts  i said  what a picture is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the moon  how strong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand out against the clear sky  what a snowy fringe marks the bursting of the surf over the long curved reef  how calmly the dim city sleeps yonder in the plain how soft the shadows lie upon the stately mountains that border the dreamhaunted mauoa valley  what a grand pyramid of billowy clouds towers above the storied pari  how the grim warriors of the past seem flocking in ghostly squadrons to their ancient battlefield againhow the wails of the dying well up from the  at this point the horse called oahu sat down in the sand  sat down to listen i suppose  never mind what he heard i stopped apostrophising and convinced him that i was not a man to allow contempt of court on the part of a horse  i broke the backbone of a chief over his rump and set out to join the cavalcade again  very considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 9 oclock at night myself in the leadfor when my horse finally came to understand that he was homeward bound and hadnt far to go he turned his attention strictly to business  this is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information  there is no regular livery stable in honolulu or indeed in any part of the kingdom of hawaii therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy residents who all have good horses you must hire animals of the wretchedest description from the kanakas  ie  natives any horse you hire even though it be from a white man is not often of much account because it will be brought in for you from some ranch and has necessarily been leading a hard life  if the kanakas who have been caring for him inveterate riders they are have not ridden him half to death every day themselves you can depend upon it they have been doing the same thing by proxy by clandestinely hiring him out  at least so i am informed  the result is that no horse has a chance to eat drink rest recuperate or look well or feel well and so strangers go about the islands mounted as i was today  in hiring a horse from a kanaka you must have all your eyes about you because you can rest satisfied that you are dealing with a shrewd unprincipled rascal  you may leave your door open and your trunk unlocked as long as you please and he will not meddle with your property he has no important vices and no inclination to commit robbery on a large scale but if he can get ahead of you in the horse business he will take a genuine delight in doing it  this traits is characteristic of horse jockeys the world over is it not  he will overcharge you if he can he will hire you a finelooking horse at night anybodysmay be the kings if the royal steed be in convenient view and bring you the mate to my oahu in the morning and contend that it is the same animal  if you make trouble he will get out by saying it was not himself who made the bargain with you but his brother who went out in the country this morning  they have always got a brother to shift the responsibility upon  a victim said to one of these fellows one day  but i know i hired the horse of you because i noticed that scar on your cheek  the reply was not bad oh yesyesmy brother all samewe twins  a friend of mine j  smith hired a horse yesterday the kanaka warranting him to be in excellent condition  smith had a saddle and blanket of his own and he ordered the kanaka to put these on the horse  the kanaka protested that he was perfectly willing to trust the gentleman with the saddle that was already on the animal but smith refused to use it  the change was made then smith noticed that the kanaka had only changed the saddles and had left the original blanket on the horse he said he forgot to change the blankets and so to cut the bother short smith mounted and rode away  the horse went lame a mile from town and afterward got to cutting up some extraordinary capers  smith got down and took off the saddle but the blanket stuck fast to the horseglued to a procession of raw places the kanakas mysterious conduct stood explained  another friend of mine bought a pretty good horse from a native a day or two ago after a tolerably thorough examination of the animal  he discovered today that the horse was as blind as a bat in one eye  he meant to have examined that eye and came home with a general notion that he had done it but he remembers now that every time he made the attempt his attention was called to something else by his victimizer  one more instance and then i will pass to something else  i am informed that when a certain mr l a visiting stranger was here he bought a pair of very respectablelooking match horses from a native  they were in a little stable with a partition through the middle of itone horse in each apartment  mr l  examined one of them critically through a window the kanakas brother having gone to the country with the key and then went around the house and examined the other through a window on the other side  he said it was the neatest match he had ever seen and paid for the horses on the spot  whereupon the kanaka departed to join his brother in the country  the fellow had shamefully swindled l  there was only one match horse and he had examined his starboard side through one window and his port side through another  i decline to believe this story but i give it because it is worth something as a fanciful illustration of a fixed factnamely that the kanaka horsejockey is fertile in invention and elastic in conscience  you can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars and a good enough horse for all practical purposes for two dollars and a half  i estimate oahu to be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of thirtyfive cents  a good deal better animal than he is was sold here day before yesterday for a dollar and seventyfive cents and sold again today for two dollars and twentyfive cents williams bought a handsome and lively little pony yesterday for ten dollars and about the best common horse on the island and he is a really good one sold yesterday with mexican saddle and bridle for seventy dollarsa horse which is well and widely known and greatly respected for his speed good disposition and everlasting bottom  you give your horse a little grain once a day it comes from san francisco and is worth about two cents a pound and you give him as much hay as he wants it is cut and brought to the market by natives and is not very good it is baled into long round bundles about the size of a large man one of them is stuck by the middle on each end of a six foot pole and the kanaka shoulders the pole and walks about the streets between the upright bales in search of customers  these hay bales thus carried have a general resemblance to a colossal capital h  the haybundles cost twentyfive cents apiece and one will last a horse about a day  you can get a horse for a song a weeks hay for another song and you can turn your animal loose among the luxuriant grass in your neighbors broad front yard without a song at allyou do it at midnight and stable the beast again before morning  you have been at no expense thus far but when you come to buy a saddle and bridle they will cost you from twenty to thirtyfive dollars  you can hire a horse saddle and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week and the owner will take care of them at his own expense  it is time to close this days recordbed time  as i prepare for sleep a rich voice rises out of the still night and far as this ocean rock is toward the ends of the earth i recognize a familiar home air  but the words seem somewhat out of joint   waikiki lantoni oe kaa hooly hooly wawhoo  translated that means when we were marching through georgia     chapter lxvi  passing through the market place we saw that feature of honolulu under its most favorable auspicesthat is in the full glory of saturday afternoon which is a festive day with the natives  the native girls by twos and threes and parties of a dozen and sometimes in whole platoons and companies went cantering up and down the neighboring streets astride of fleet but homely horses and with their gaudy riding habits streaming like banners behind them  such a troop of free and easy riders in their natural home the saddle makes a gay and graceful spectacle  the riding habit i speak of is simply a long broad scarf like a tavern table cloth brilliantly colored wrapped around the loins once then apparently passed between the limbs and each end thrown backward over the same and floating and flapping behind on both sides beyond the horses tail like a couple of fancy flags then slipping the stirrupirons between her toes the girl throws her chest for ward sits up like a major general and goes sweeping by like the wind  the girls put on all the finery they can on saturday afternoonfine black silk robes flowing red ones that nearly put your eyes out others as white as snow still others that discount the rainbow and they wear their hair in nets and trim their jaunty hats with fresh flowers and encircle their dusky throats with homemade necklaces of the brilliant vermilliontinted blossom of the ohia and they fill the markets and the adjacent street with their bright presences and smell like a rag factory on fire with their offensive cocoanut oil  occasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away down in the south seas with his face and neck tatooed till he looks like the customary mendicant from washoe who has been blown up in a mine  some are tattooed a dead blue color down to the upper lipmasked as it were leaving the natural light yellow skin of micronesia unstained from thence down some with broad marks drawn down from hair to neck on both sides of the face and a strip of the original yellow skin two inches wide down the centera gridiron with a spoke broken out and some with the entire face discolored with the popular mortification tint relieved only by one or two thin wavy threads of natural yellow running across the face from ear to ear and eyes twinkling out of this darkness from under shadowing hatbrims like stars in the dark of the moon  moving among the stirring crowds you come to the poi merchants squatting in the shade on their hams in true native fashion and surrounded by purchasers  the sandwich islanders always squat on their hams and who knows but they may be the old original ham sandwiches the thought is pregnant with interest the poi looks like common flour paste and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of gourd and capable of holding from one to three or four gallons  poi is the chief article of food among the natives and is prepared from the taro plant  the taro root looks like a thick or if you please a corpulent sweet potato in shape but is of a light purple color when boiled  when boiled it answers as a passable substitute for bread  the buck kanakas bake it under ground then mash it up well with a heavy lava pestle mix water with it until it becomes a paste set it aside and let if ferment and then it is poiand an unseductive mixture it is almost tasteless before it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward  but nothing is more nutritious  when solely used however it produces acrid humors a fact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of the kanakas  i think there must be as much of a knack in handling poi as there is in eating with chopsticks  the forefinger is thrust into the mess and stirred quickly round several times and drawn as quickly out thickly coated just as it it were poulticed the head is thrown back the finger inserted in the mouth and the delicacy stripped off and swallowedthe eye closing gently meanwhile in a languid sort of ecstasy  many a different finger goes into the same bowl and many a different kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the virtues of its contents  around a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives buying the awa root  it is said that but for the use of this root the destruction of the people in former times by certain imported diseases would have been far greater than it was and by others it is said that this is merely a fancy  all agree that poi will rejuvenate a man who is used up and his vitality almost annihilated by hard drinking and that in some kinds of diseases it will restore health after all medicines have failed but all are not willing to allow to the awa the virtues claimed for it  the natives manufacture an intoxicating drink from it which is fearful in its effects when persistently indulged in  it covers the body with dry white scales inflames the eyes and causes premature decripitude although the man before whose establishment we stopped has to pay a government license of eight hundred dollars a year for the exclusive right to sell awa root it is said that he makes a small fortune every twelvemonth while saloon keepers who pay a thousand dollars a year for the privilege of retailing whiskey etc only make a bare living  we found the fish market crowded for the native is very fond of fish and eats the article raw and alive  let us change the subject  in old times here saturday was a grand gala day indeed  all the native population of the town forsook their labors and those of the surrounding country journeyed to the city  then the white folks had to stay indoors for every street was so packed with charging cavaliers and cavalieresses that it was next to impossible to thread ones way through the cavalcades without getting crippled  at night they feasted and the girls danced the lascivious hula hulaa dance that is said to exhibit the very perfection of educated notion of limb and arm hand head and body and the exactest uniformity of movement and accuracy of time  it was performed by a circle of girls with no raiment on them to speak of who went through an infinite variety of motions and figures without prompting and yet so true was their time and in such perfect concert did they move that when they were placed in a straight line hands arms bodies limbs and heads waved swayed gesticulated bowed stooped whirled squirmed twisted and undulated as if they were part and parcel of a single individual and it was difficult to believe they were not moved in a body by some exquisite piece of mechanism  of late years however saturday has lost most of its quondam gala features  this weekly stampede of the natives interfered too much with labor and the interests of the white folks and by sticking in a law here and preaching a sermon there and by various other means they gradually broke it up  the demoralizing hula hula was forbidden to be performed save at night with closed doors in presence of few spectators and only by permission duly procured from the authorities and the payment of ten dollars for the same  there are few girls nowadays able to dance this ancient national dance in the highest perfection of the art  the missionaries have christianized and educated all the natives  they all belong to the church and there is not one of them above the age of eight years but can read and write with facility in the native tongue it is the most universally educated race of people outside of china they have any quantity of books printed in the kanaka language and all the natives are fond of reading  they are inveterate churchgoers nothing can keep them away  all this ameliorating cultivation has at last built up in the native women a profound respect for chastityin other people  perhaps that is enough to say on that head  the national sin will die out when the race does but perhaps not earlierbut doubtless this purifying is not far off when we reflect that contact with civilization and the whites has reduced the native population from four hundred thousand captain cooks estimate to fiftyfive thousand in something over eighty years  society is a queer medley in this notable missionary whaling and governmental centre  if you get into conversation with a stranger and experience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are treading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is strike out boldly and address him as captain  watch him narrowly and if you see by his countenance that you are on the wrong tack ask him where he preaches  it is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of a whaler  i am now personally acquainted with seventytwo captains and ninetysix missionaries  the captains and ministers form onehalf of the population the third fourth is composed of common kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their families and the final fourth is made up of high officers of the hawaiian government  and there are just about cats enough for three apiece all around  a solemn stranger met me in the suburbs the other day and said  good morning your reverence  preach in the stone church yonder no doubt  no i dont  im not a preacher  really i beg your pardon captain  i trust you had a good season  how much oil  oil  what do you take me for  im not a whaler  oh i beg a thousand pardons your excellency  major general in the household troops no doubt  minister of the interior likely  secretary of war  first gentleman of the bedchamber commissioner of the royal  stuff  im no official  im not connected in any way with the government  bless my life  then who the mischief are you  what the mischief are you  and how the mischief did you get here and where in thunder did you come from  im only a private personagean unassuming strangerlately arrived from america  no  not a missionary  not a whaler  not a member of his majestys government  not even secretary of the navy  ah heaven  it is too blissful to be true alas i do but dream  and yet that noble honest countenancethose oblique ingenuous eyesthat massive head incapable ofofanything your hand give me your hand bright waif  excuse these tears  for sixteen weary years i have yearned for a moment like this and  here his feelings were too much for him and he swooned away  i pitied this poor creature from the bottom of my heart  i was deeply moved  i shed a few tears on him and kissed him for his mother  i then took what small change he had and shoved     chapter lxvii  i still quote from my journal  i found the national legislature to consist of half a dozen white men and some thirty or forty natives  it was a dark assemblage  the nobles and ministers about a dozen of them altogether occupied the extreme left of the hall with david kalakaua the kings chamberlain and prince william at the head  the president of the assembly his royal highness m kekuanaoa kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal  he derives his princely rank from his wife who was a daughter of kamehameha the great  under other monarchies the male line takes precedence of the female in tracing genealogies but here the opposite is the casethe female line takes precedence  their reason for this is exceedingly sensible and i recommend it to the aristocracy of europe they say it is easy to know who a mans mother was but etc etc and the vice president the latter a white man sat in the pulpit if i may so term it the president is the kings father  he is an erect strongly built massive featured whitehaired tawny old gentleman of eighty years of age or thereabouts  he was simply but well dressed in a blue cloth coat and white vest and white pantaloons without spot dust or blemish upon them  he bears himself with a calm stately dignity and is a man of noble presence  he was a young man and a distinguished warrior under that terrific fighter kamehameha i more than half a century ago  a knowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this this man naked as the day he was born and warclub and spear in hand has charged at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of savages more than a generation and a half ago and reveled in slaughter and carnage has worshipped wooden images on his devout knees has seen hundreds of his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to wooden idols at a time when no missionarys foot had ever pressed this soil and he had never heard of the white mans god has believed his enemy could secretly pray him to death has seen the day in his childhood when it was a crime punishable by death for a man to eat with his wife or for a plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the kingand now look at him an educated christian neatly and handsomely dressed a highminded elegant gentleman a traveler in some degree and one who has been the honored guest of royalty in europe a man practiced in holding the reins of an enlightened government and well versed in the politics of his country and in general practical information  look at him sitting there presiding over the deliberations of a legislative body among whom are white mena grave dignified statesmanlike personage and as seemingly natural and fitted to the place as if he had been born in it and had never been out of it in his life time  how the experiences of this old mans eventful life shame the cheap inventions of romance  the christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened some of their barbarian superstitions much less destroyed them  i have just referred to one of these  it is still a popular belief that if your enemy can get hold of any article belonging to you he can get down on his knees over it and pray you to death  therefore many a native gives up and dies merely because he imagines that some enemy is putting him through a course of damaging prayer  this praying an individual to death seems absurd enough at a first glance but then when we call to mind some of the pulpit efforts of certain of our own ministers the thing looks plausible  in former times among the islanders not only a plurality of wives was customary but a plurality of husbands likewise  some native women of noble rank had as many as six husbands  a woman thus supplied did not reside with all her husbands at once but lived several months with each in turn  an understood sign hung at her door during these months  when the sign was taken down it meant next  in those days woman was rigidly taught to know her place  her place was to do all the work take all the cuffs provide all the food and content herself with what was left after her lord had finished his dinner  she was not only forbidden by ancient law and under penalty of death to eat with her husband or enter a canoe but was debarred under the same penalty from eating bananas pineapples oranges and other choice fruits at any time or in any place  she had to confine herself pretty strictly to poi and hard work  these poor ignorant heathen seem to have had a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in the garden of eden and they did not choose to take any more chances but the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of things they liberated woman and made her the equal of man  the natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their children alive when the family became larger than necessary  the missionaries interfered in this matter too and stopped it  to this day the natives are able to lie down and die whenever they want to whether there is anything the matter with them or not  if a kanaka takes a notion to die that is the end of him nobody can persuade him to hold on all the doctors in the world could not save him  a luxury which they enjoy more than anything else is a large funeral if a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native it is only necessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour and he will be on hand to the minuteat least his remains will  all the natives are christians now but many of them still desert to the great shark god for temporary succor in time of trouble  an irruption of the great volcano of kilauea or an earthquake always brings a deal of latent loyalty to the great shark god to the surface  it is common report that the king educated cultivated and refined christian gentleman as he undoubtedly is still turns to the idols of his fathers for help when disaster threatens  a planter caught a shark and one of his christianized natives testified his emancipation from the thrall of ancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a fashion forbidden by his abandoned creed  but remorse shortly began to torture him  he grew moody and sought solitude brooded over his sin refused food and finally said he must die and ought to die for he had sinned against the great shark god and could never know peace any more  he was proof against persuasion and ridicule and in the course of a day or two took to his bed and died although he showed no symptom of disease his young daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate within the week  superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone and it is only natural that it should crop out in time of distress  wherever one goes in the islands he will find small piles of stones by the wayside covered with leafy offerings placed there by the natives to appease evil spirits or honor local deities belonging to the mythology of former days  in the rural districts of any of the islands the traveler hourly comes upon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams or in the sea without any clothing on and exhibiting no very intemperate zeal in the matter of hiding their nakedness  when the missionaries first took up their residence in honolulu the native women would pay their families frequent friendly visits day by day not even clothed with a blush it was found a hard matter to convince them that this was rather indelicate  finally the missionaries provided them with long loose calico robes and that ended the difficultyfor the women would troop through the town stark naked with their robes folded under their arms march to the missionary houses and then  proceed to dressthe natives soon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing but it was shortly apparent that they only wanted it for grandeur  the missionaries imported a quantity of hats bonnets and other male and female wearing apparel instituted a general distribution and begged the people not to come to church naked next sunday as usual  and they did not but the national spirit of unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors who were not at the distribution and next sabbath the poor preachers could hardly keep countenance before their vast congregations  in the midst of the reading of a hymn a brown stately dame would sweep up the aisle with a world of airs with nothing in the world on but a stovepipe hat and a pair of cheap gloves another dame would follow tricked out in a mans shirt and nothing else another one would enter with a flourish with simply the sleeves of a bright calico dress tied around her waist and the rest of the garment dragging behind like a peacocks tail off duty a stately buck kanaka would stalk in with a womans bonnet on wrong side beforeonly this and nothing more after him would stride his fellow with the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied around his neck the rest of his person untrammeled in his rear would come another gentleman simply gotten up in a fiery necktie and a striped vest  the poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly unconscious of any absurdity in their appearance  they gazed at each other with happy admiration and it was plain to see that the young girls were taking note of what each other had on as naturally as if they had always lived in a land of bibles and knew what churches were made for here was the evidence of a dawning civilization  the spectacle which the congregation presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving that the missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with the services and by and by when the simple children of the sun began a general swapping of garments in open meeting and produced some irresistibly grotesque effects in the course of redressing there was nothing for it but to cut the thing short with the benediction and dismiss the fantastic assemblage  in our country children play keep house and in the same highsounding but miniature way the grown folk here with the poor little material of slender territory and meagre population play empire  there is his royal majesty the king with a new york detectives income of thirty or thirtyfive thousand dollars a year from the royal civil list and the royal domain  he lives in a twostory frame palace  and there is the royal familythe customary hive of royal brothers sisters cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to monarchy all with a spoon in the national papdish and all bearing such titles as his or her royal highness the prince or princess soandso  few of them can carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in carriages however they sport the economical kanaka horse or hoof it with the plebeians  then there is his excellency the royal chamberlaina sinecure for his majesty dresses himself with his own hands except when he is ruralizing at waikiki and then he requires no dressing  next we have his excellency the commanderinchief of the household troops whose forces consist of about the number of soldiers usually placed under a corporal in other lands  next comes the royal steward and the grand equerry in waitinghigh dignitaries with modest salaries and little to do  then we have his excellency the first gentleman of the bedchamberan office as easy as it is magnificent  next we come to his excellency the prime minister a renegade american from new hampshire all jaw vanity bombast and ignorance a lawyer of shyster calibre a fraud by nature a humble worshipper of the sceptre above him a reptile never tired of sneering at the land of his birth or glorifying the tenacre kingdom that has adopted himsalary 4000 a year vast consequence and no perquisites  then we have his excellency the imperial minister of finance who handles a million dollars of public money a year sends in his annual budget with great ceremony talks prodigiously of finance suggests imposing schemes for paying off the national debt of 150000 and does it all for 4000 a year and unimaginable glory  next we have his excellency the minister of war who holds sway over the royal armiesthey consist of two hundred and thirty uniformed kanakas mostly brigadier generals and if the country ever gets into trouble with a foreign power we shall probably hear from them  i knew an american whose copperplate visiting card bore this impressive legend lieutenantcolonel in the royal infantry  to say that he was proud of this distinction is stating it but tamely  the minister of war has also in his charge some venerable swivels on punchbowl hill wherewith royal salutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port  next comes his excellency the minister of the navya nabob who rules the royal fleet a steamtug and a sixtyton schooner  and next comes his grace the lord bishop of honolulu the chief dignitary of the established churchfor when the american presbyterian missionaries had completed the reduction of the nation to a compact condition of christianity native royalty stepped in and erected the grand dignity of an established episcopal church over it and imported a cheap readymade bishop from england to take charge  the chagrin of the missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed to this day profanity not being admissible  next comes his excellency the minister of public instruction  next their excellencies the governors of oahu hawaii etc and after them a string of high sheriffs and other small fry too numerous for computation  then there are their excellencies the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of his imperial majesty the emperor of the french her british majestys minister the minister resident of the united states and some six or eight representatives of other foreign nations all with sounding titles imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state  imagine all this grandeur in a playhouse kingdom whose population falls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls  the people are so accustomed to ninejointed titles and colossal magnates that a foreign prince makes very little more stir in honolulu than a western congressman does in new york  and let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined court costume of so stunning a nature that it would make the clown in a circus look tame and commonplace by comparison and each hawaiian official dignitary has a gorgeous varicolored goldlaced uniform peculiar to his officeno two of them are alike and it is hard to tell which one is the loudest  the king had a drawingroom at stated intervals like other monarchs and when these varied uniforms congregate thereweakeyed people have to contemplate the spectacle through smoked glass  is there not a gratifying contrast between this latterday exhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these magnates afforded the missionaries the sunday after the oldtime distribution of clothing behold what religion and civilization have wrought     chapter lxviii  while i was in honolulu i witnessed the ceremonious funeral of the kings sister her royal highness the princess victoria  according to the royal custom the remains had lain in state at the palace thirty days watched day and night by a guard of honor  and during all that time a great multitude of natives from the several islands had kept the palace grounds well crowded and had made the place a pandemonium every night with their howlings and wailings beating of tomtoms and dancing of the at other times forbidden hulahula by halfclad maidens to the music of songs of questionable decency chanted in honor of the deceased  the printed programme of the funeral procession interested me at the time and after what i have just said of hawaiian grandiloquence in the matter of playing empire i am persuaded that a perusal of it may interest the reader        after reading the long list of dignitaries etc and remembering       the sparseness of the population one is almost inclined to wonder       where the material for that portion of the procession devoted to       hawaiian population generally is going to be procured

force  i resume my journal at the point where the procession arrived at the royal mausoleum        as the procession filed through the gate the military deployed       handsomely to the right and left and formed an avenue through which       the long column of mourners passed to the tomb  the coffin was       borne through the door of the mausoleum followed by the king and       his chiefs the great officers of the kingdom foreign consuls       embassadors and distinguished guests burlingame and general van       valkenburgh  several of the kahilis were then fastened to a       framework in front of the tomb there to remain until they decay       and fall to pieces or forestalling this until another scion of       royalty dies  at this point of the proceedings the multitude set       up such a heartbroken wailing as i hope never to hear again  the soldiers fired three volleys of musketrythe wailing being previously silenced to permit of the guns being heard  his highness prince william in a showy military uniform the true prince this scion of the house overthrown by the present dynastyhe was formerly betrothed to the princess but was not allowed to marry her stood guard and paced back and forth within the door  the privileged few who followed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime but the king soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it  a stranger could have guessed his rank although he was so simply and unpretentiously dressed by the profound deference paid him by all persons in his vicinity by seeing his high officers receive his quiet orders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads and by observing how careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid crowding him although there was room enough in the doorway for a wagon to pass for that matter how respectfully they edged out sideways scraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a front view of their persons to his majesty and never putting their hats on until they were well out of the royal presence  he was dressed entirely in blackdresscoat and silk hatand looked rather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about him  on his breast he wore a large gold star which was half hidden by the lapel of his coat  he remained at the door a half hour and occasionally gave an order to the men who were erecting the kahilis ranks of longhandled mops made of gaudy featherssacred to royalty  they are stuck in the ground around the tomb and left there  before the tomb  he had the good taste to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary hempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the framework with finally he entered his carriage and drove away and the populace shortly began to drop into his wake  while he was in view there was but one man who attracted more attention than himself and that was harris the yankee prime minister  this feeble personage had crape enough around his hat to express the grief of an entire nation and as usual he neglected no opportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the admiration of the simple kanakas  oh noble ambition of this modern richelieu  it is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the princess victoria with those of her noted ancestor kamehameha the conqueror who died fifty years agoin 1819 the year before the first missionaries came        on the 8th of may 1819 at the age of sixtysix he died as he       had lived in the faith of his country  it was his misfortune not       to have come in contact with men who could have rightly influenced       his religious aspirations  judged by his advantages and compared       with the most eminent of his countrymen he may be justly styled not       only great but good  to this day his memory warms the heart and       elevates the national feelings of hawaiians  they are proud of       their old warrior king they love his name his deeds form their       historical age and an enthusiasm everywhere prevails shared even       by foreigners who knew his worth that constitutes the firmest       pillar of the throne of his dynasty        in lieu of human victims the custom of that age a sacrifice of       three hundred dogs attended his obsequiesno mean holocaust when       their national value and the estimation in which they were held are       considered  the bones of kamehameha after being kept for a while       were so carefully concealed that all knowledge of their final       resting place is now lost  there was a proverb current among the       common people that the bones of a cruel king could not be hid they       made fishhooks and arrows of them upon which in using them they       vented their abhorrence of his memory in bitter execrations  the account of the circumstances of his death as written by the native historians is full of minute detail but there is scarcely a line of it which does not mention or illustrate some bygone custom of the country in this respect it is the most comprehensive document i have yet met with  i will quote it entire        when kamehameha was dangerously sick and the priests were unable       to cure him they said be of good courage and build a house for       the god his own private god or idol that thou mayest recover       the chiefs corroborated this advice of the priests and a place of       worship was prepared for kukailimoku and consecrated in the       evening  they proposed also to the king with a view to prolong his       life that human victims should be sacrificed to his deity upon       which the greater part of the people absconded through fear of       death and concealed themselves in hiding places till the tabu tabu       pronounced tahboo means prohibition we have borrowed it or       sacred  the tabu was sometimes permanent sometimes temporary and       the person or thing placed under tabu was for the time being sacred       to the purpose for which it was set apart  in the above case the       victims selected under the tabu would be sacred to the sacrifice       in which destruction impended was past  it is doubtful whether       kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and priests to       sacrifice men as he was known to say the men are sacred for the       king meaning that they were for the service of his successor       this information was derived from liholiho his son        after this his sickness increased to such a degree that he had not       strength to turn himself in his bed  when another season       consecrated for worship at the new temple heiau arrived he said       to his son liholiho go thou and make supplication to thy god i       am not able to go and will offer my prayers at home  when his       devotions to his feathered god kukailimoku were concluded a       certain religiously disposed individual who had a bird god       suggested to the king that through its influence his sickness might       be removed  the name of this god was pua its body was made of a       bird now eaten by the hawaiians and called in their language alae       kamehameha was willing that a trial should be made and two houses       were constructed to facilitate the experiment but while dwelling in       them he became so very weak as not to receive food  after lying       there three days his wives children and chiefs perceiving that he       was very low returned him to his own house  in the evening he was       carried to the eating house  where he took a little food in his       mouth which he did not swallow also a cup of water  the chiefs       requested him to give them his counsel but he made no reply and       was carried back to the dwelling house but when near midnightten       oclock perhapshe was carried again to the place to eat but as       before he merely tasted of what was presented to him  then       kaikioewa addressed him thus here we all are your younger       brethren your son liholiho and your foreigner impart to us your       dying charge that liholiho and kaahumanu may hear then kamehameha       inquired what do you say kaikioewa repeated your counsels for       us        he then said move on in my good way and he could proceed no       further  the foreigner mr young embraced and kissed him       hoapili also embraced him whispering something in his ear after       which he was taken back to the house  about twelve he was carried       once more to the house for eating into which his head entered       while his body was in the dwelling house immediately adjoining  it       should be remarked that this frequent carrying of a sick chief from       one house to another resulted from the tabu system then in force       there were at that time six houses huts connected with an       establishmentone was for worship one for the men to eat in an       eating house for the women a house to sleep in a house in which to       manufacture kapa native cloth and one where at certain intervals       the women might dwell in seclusion        the sick was once more taken to his house when he expired this       was at two oclock a circumstance from which leleiohoku derived his       name  as he breathed his last kalaimoku came to the eating house       to order those in it to go out  there were two aged persons thus       directed to depart one went the other remained on account of love       to the king by whom he had formerly been kindly sustained  the       children also were sent away  then kalaimoku came to the house and       the chiefs had a consultation  one of them spoke thus this is my       thoughtwe will eat him raw this sounds suspicious in view of       the fact that all sandwich island historians white and black       protest that cannibalism never existed in the islands  however       since they only proposed to eat him raw we wont count that       but it would certainly have been cannibalism if they had cooked       himm  t  kaahumanu one of the dead kings widows replied       perhaps his body is not at our disposal that is more properly with       his successor  our part in himhis breathhas departed his       remains will be disposed of by liholiho        after this conversation the body was taken into the consecrated       house for the performance of the proper rites by the priest and the       new king  the name of this ceremony is uko and when the sacred hog       was baked the priest offered it to the dead body and it became a       god the king at the same time repeating the customary prayers        then the priest addressing himself to the king and chiefs said       i will now make known to you the rules to be observed respecting       persons to be sacrificed on the burial of this body  if you obtain       one man before the corpse is removed one will be sufficient but       after it leaves this house four will be required  if delayed until       we carry the corpse to the grave there must be ten but after it is       deposited in the grave there must be fifteen  tomorrow morning       there will be a tabu and if the sacrifice be delayed until that       time forty men must die        then the high priest hewahewa inquired of the chiefs where       shall be the residence of king liholiho  they replied where       indeed  you of all men ought to know  then the priest observed       there are two suitable places one is kau the other is kohala       the chiefs preferred the latter as it was more thickly inhabited       the priest added these are proper places for the kings residence       but he must not remain in kona for it is polluted  this was       agreed to  it was now break of day  as he was being carried to the       place of burial the people perceived that their king was dead and       they wailed  when the corpse was removed from the house to the       tomb a distance of one chain the procession was met by a certain       man who was ardently attached to the deceased  he leaped upon the       chiefs who were carrying the kings body he desired to die with him       on account of his love  the chiefs drove him away  he persisted in       making numerous attempts which were unavailing  kalaimoka also had       it in his heart to die with him but was prevented by hookio        the morning following kamehamehas death liholiho and his train       departed for kohala according to the suggestions of the priest to       avoid the defilement occasioned by the dead  at this time if a       chief died the land was polluted and the heirs sought a residence       in another part of the country until the corpse was dissected and       the bones tied in a bundle which being done the season of       defilement terminated  if the deceased were not a chief the house       only was defiled which became pure again on the burial of the body       such were the laws on this subject        on the morning on which liholiho sailed in his canoe for kohala       the chiefs and people mourned after their manner on occasion of a       chiefs death conducting themselves like madmen and like beasts       their conduct was such as to forbid description the priests also       put into action the sorcery apparatus that the person who had       prayed the king to death might die for it was not believed that       kamehamehas departure was the effect either of sickness or old age       when the sorcerers set up by their fireplaces sticks with a strip       of kapa flying at the top the chief keeaumoku kaahumauns brother       came in a state of intoxication and broke the flagstaff of the       sorcerers from which it was inferred that kaahumanu and her friends       had been instrumental in the kings death  on this account they       were subjected to abuse  you have the contrast now and a strange one it is  this great queen kaahumanu who was subjected to abuse during the frightful orgies that followed the kings death in accordance with ancient custom afterward became a devout christian and a steadfast and powerful friend of the missionaries  dogs were and still are reared and fattened for food by the natives hence the reference to their value in one of the above paragraphs  forty years ago it was the custom in the islands to suspend all law for a certain number of days after the death of a royal personage and then a saturnalia ensued which one may picture to himself after a fashion but not in the full horror of the reality  the people shaved their heads knocked out a tooth or two plucked out an eye sometimes cut bruised mutilated or burned their flesh got drunk burned each others huts maimed or murdered one another according to the caprice of the moment and both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbridled licentiousness  and after it all came a torpor from which the nation slowly emerged bewildered and dazed as if from a hideous halfremembered nightmare they were not the salt of the earth those gentle children of the sun  the natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which cannot be comforting to an invalid  when they think a sick friend is going to die a couple of dozen neighbors surround his hut and keep up a deafening wailing night and day till he either dies or gets well  no doubt this arrangement has helped many a subject to a shroud before his appointed time  they surround a hut and wail in the same heartbroken way when its occupant returns from a journey  this is their dismal idea of a welcome a very little of it would go a great way with most of us     chapter lxix  bound for hawaii a hundred and fifty miles distant to visit the great volcano and behold the other notable things which distinguish that island above the remainder of the group we sailed from honolulu on a certain saturday afternoon in the good schooner boomerang  the boomerang was about as long as two street cars and about as wide as one  she was so small though she was larger than the majority of the interisland coasters that when i stood on her deck i felt but little smaller than the colossus of rhodes must have felt when he had a manofwar under him  i could reach the water when she lay over under a strong breeze  when the captain and my comrade a mr billings myself and four other persons were all assembled on the little after portion of the deck which is sacred to the cabin passengers it was fullthere was not room for any more quality folks  another section of the deck twice as large as ours was full of natives of both sexes with their customary dogs mats blankets pipes calabashes of poi fleas and other luxuries and baggage of minor importance  as soon as we set sail the natives all lay down on the deck as thick as negroes in a slavepen and smoked conversed and spit on each other and were truly sociable  the little lowceiled cabin below was rather larger than a hearse and as dark as a vault  it had two coffins on each sidei mean two bunks a small table capable of accommodating three persons at dinner stood against the forward bulkhead and over it hung the dingiest whale oil lantern that ever peopled the obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly shapes the floor room unoccupied was not extensive  one might swing a cat in it perhaps but not a long cat  the hold forward of the bulkhead had but little freight in it and from morning till night a portly old rooster with a voice like baalams ass and the same disposition to use it strutted up and down in that part of the vessel and crowed  he usually took dinner at six oclock and then after an hour devoted to meditation he mounted a barrel and crowed a good part of the night he got hoarser all the time but he scorned to allow any personal consideration to interfere with his duty and kept up his labors in defiance of threatened diphtheria  sleeping was out of the question when he was on watch  he was a source of genuine aggravation and annoyance  it was worse than useless to shout at him or apply offensive epithets to himhe only took these things for applause and strained himself to make more noise  occasionally during the day i threw potatoes at him through an aperture in the bulkhead but he only dodged and went on crowing  the first night as i lay in my coffin idly watching the dim lamp swinging to the rolling of the ship and snuffing the nauseous odors of bilge water i felt something gallop over me  i turned out promptly however i turned in again when i found it was only a rat  presently something galloped over me once more  i knew it was not a rat this time and i thought it might be a centipede because the captain had killed one on deck in the afternoon  i turned out  the first glance at the pillow showed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of itcockroaches as large as peach leavesfellows with long quivering antennae and fiery malignant eyes  they were grating their teeth like tobacco worms and appeared to be dissatisfied about something  i had often heard that these reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping sailors toe nails down to the quick and i would not get in the bunk any more  i lay down on the floor  but a rat came and bothered me and shortly afterward a procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair  in a few moments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas were throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest disorder and taking a bite every time they struck  i was beginning to feel really annoyed  i got up and put my clothes on and went on deck  the above is not overdrawn it is a truthful sketch of interisland schooner life  there is no such thing as keeping a vessel in elegant condition when she carries molasses and kanakas  it was compensation for my sufferings to come unexpectedly upon so beautiful a scene as met my eyeto step suddenly out of the sepulchral gloom of the cabin and stand under the strong light of the moonin the centre as it were of a glittering sea of liquid silverto see the broad sails straining in the gale the ship heeled over on her side the angry foam hissing past her lee bulwarks and sparkling sheets of spray dashing high over her bows and raining upon her decks to brace myself and hang fast to the first object that presented itself with hat jammed down and coat tails whipping in the breeze and feel that exhilaration that thrills in ones hair and quivers down his back bone when he knows that every inch of canvas is drawing and the vessel cleaving through the waves at her utmost speed  there was no darkness no dimness no obscurity there  all was brightness every object was vividly defined every prostrate kanaka every coil of rope every calabash of poi every puppy every seam in the flooring every bolthead every object however minute showed sharp and distinct in its every outline and the shadow of the broad mainsail lay black as a pall upon the deck leaving billingss white upturned face glorified and his body in a total eclipse monday morning we were close to the island of hawaii  two of its high mountains were in viewmauna loa and hualaiai  the latter is an imposing peak but being only ten thousand feet high is seldom mentioned or heard of  mauna loa is said to be sixteen thousand feet high  the rays of glittering snow and ice that clasped its summit like a claw looked refreshing when viewed from the blistering climate we were in  one could stand on that mountain wrapped up in blankets and furs to keep warm and while he nibbled a snowball or an icicle to quench his thirst he could look down the long sweep of its sides and see spots where plants are growing that grow only where the bitter cold of winter prevails lower down he could see sections devoted to production that thrive in the temperate zone alone and at the bottom of the mountain he could see the home of the tufted cocoapalms and other species of vegetation that grow only in the sultry atmosphere of eternal summer  he could see all the climes of the world at a single glance of the eye and that glance would only pass over a distance of four or five miles as the bird flies  by and by we took boat and went ashore at kailua designing to ride horseback through the pleasant orange and coffee region of kona and rejoin the vessel at a point some leagues distant  this journey is well worth taking  the trail passes along on high groundsay a thousand feet above sea leveland usually about a mile distant from the ocean which is always in sight save that occasionally you find yourself buried in the forest in the midst of a rank tropical vegetation and a dense growth of trees whose great bows overarch the road and shut out sun and sea and everything and leave you in a dim shady tunnel haunted with invisible singing birds and fragrant with the odor of flowers  it was pleasant to ride occasionally in the warm sun and feast the eye upon the everchanging panorama of the forest beyond and below us with its many tints its softened lights and shadows its billowy undulations sweeping gently down from the mountain to the sea  it was pleasant also at intervals to leave the sultry sun and pass into the cool green depths of this forest and indulge in sentimental reflections under the inspiration of its brooding twilight and its whispering foliage we rode through one orange grove that had ten thousand tree in it they were all laden with fruit  at one farmhouse we got some large peaches of excellent flavor this fruit as a general thing does not do well in the sandwich islands it takes a sort of almond shape and is small and bitter  it needs frost they say and perhaps it does if this be so it will have a good opportunity to go on needing it as it will not be likely to get it the trees from which the fine fruit i have spoken of came had been planted and replanted sixteen times and to this treatment the proprietor of the orchard attributed hissuccess  we passed several sugar plantationsnew ones and not very extensive the crops were in most cases third rattoons  notethe first crop is called plant cane subsequent crops which spring from the original roots without replanting are called rattoons almost everywhere on the island of hawaii sugarcane matures in twelve months both rattoons and plant and although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels no doubt it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four months afterward  in kona the average yield of an acre of ground is two tons of sugar they say  this is only a moderate yield for these islands but would be astounding for louisiana and most other sugar growing countries the plantations in kona being on pretty high groundup among the light and frequent rainsno irrigation whatever is required     chapter lxx  we stopped some time at one of the plantations to rest ourselves and refresh the horses  we had a chatty conversation with several gentlemen present but there was one person a middle aged man with an absent look in his face who simply glanced up gave us goodday and lapsed again into the meditations which our coming had interrupted  the planters whispered us not to mind himcrazy  they said he was in the islands for his health was a preacher his home michigan  they said that if he woke up presently and fell to talking about a correspondence which he had some time held with mr greeley about a trifle of some kind we must humor him and listen with interest and we must humor his fancy that this correspondence was the talk of the world  it was easy to see that he was a gentle creature and that his madness had nothing vicious in it  he looked pale and a little worn as if with perplexing thought and anxiety of mind  he sat a long time looking at the floor and at intervals muttering to himself and nodding his head acquiescingly or shaking it in mild protest  he was lost in his thought or in his memories  we continued our talk with the planters branching from subject to subject  but at last the word circumstance casually dropped in the course of conversation attracted his attention and brought an eager look into his countenance  he faced about in his chair and said  circumstance  what circumstance  ah i knowi know too well  so you have heard of it too  with a sigh well no matterall the world has heard of it  all the world  the whole world  it is a large world too for a thing to travel so far innow isnt it  yes yesthe greeley correspondence with erickson has created the saddest and bitterest controversy on both sides of the oceanand still they keep it up  it makes us famous but at what a sorrowful sacrifice  i was so sorry when i heard that it had caused that bloody and distressful war over there in italy  it was little comfort to me after so much bloodshed to know that the victors sided with me and the vanquished with greeleyit is little comfort to know that horace greeley is responsible for the battle of sadowa and not me  queen victoria wrote me that she felt just as i did about itshe said that as much as she was opposed to greeley and the spirit he showed in the correspondence with me she would not have had sadowa happen for hundreds of dollars  i can show you her letter if you would like to see it  but gentlemen much as you may think you know about that unhappy correspondence you cannot know the straight of it till you hear it from my lips  it has always been garbled in the journals and even in history  yes even in historythink of it  let meplease let me give you the matter exactly as it occurred  i truly will not abuse your confidence  then he leaned forward all interest all earnestness and told his storyand told it appealingly too and yet in the simplest and most unpretentious way indeed in such a way as to suggest to one all the time that this was a faithful honorable witness giving evidence in the sacred interest of justice and under oath  he said  mrs beazeleymrs jackson beazeley widow of the village of campbellton kansaswrote me about a matter which was near her heart a matter which many might think trivial but to her it was a thing of deep concern  i was living in michigan thenserving in the ministry she was and is an estimable womana woman to whom poverty and hardship have proven incentives to industry in place of discouragements her only treasure was her son william a youth just verging upon manhood religious amiable and sincerely attached to agriculture  he was the widows comfort and her pride  and so moved by her love for him she wrote me about a matter as i have said before which lay near her heart because it lay near her boys  she desired me to confer with mr greeley about turnips  turnips were the dream of her childs young ambition  while other youths were frittering away in frivolous amusements the precious years of budding vigor which god had given them for useful preparation this boy was patiently enriching his mind with information concerning turnips  the sentiment which he felt toward the turnip was akin to adoration  he could not think of the turnip without emotion he could not speak of it calmly he could not contemplate it without exaltation  he could not eat it without shedding tears  all the poetry in his sensitive nature was in sympathy with the gracious vegetable  with the earliest pipe of dawn he sought his patch and when the curtaining night drove him from it he shut himself up with his books and garnered statistics till sleep overcame him  on rainy days he sat and talked hours together with his mother about turnips  when company came he made it his loving duty to put aside everything else and converse with them all the day long of his great joy in the turnip  and yet was this joy rounded and complete  was there no secret alloy of unhappiness in it  alas there was  there was a canker gnawing at his heart the noblest inspiration of his soul eluded his endeavorviz he could not make of the turnip a climbing vine  months went by the bloom forsook his cheek the fire faded out of his eye sighings and abstraction usurped the place of smiles and cheerful converse  but a watchful eye noted these things and in time a motherly sympathy unsealed the secret  hence the letter to me  she pleaded for attentionshe said her boy was dying by inches  i was a stranger to mr greeley but what of that  the matter was urgent  i wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem if possible and save the students life  my interest grew until it partook of the anxiety of the mother  i waited in much suspenseat last the answer came  i found that i could not read it readily the handwriting being unfamiliar and my emotions somewhat wrought up  it seemed to refer in part to the boys case but chiefly to other and irrelevant matterssuch as pavingstones electricity oysters and something which i took to be absolution or agrarianism i could not be certain which still these appeared to be simply casual mentions nothing more friendly in spirit without doubt but lacking the connection or coherence necessary to make them usefuli judged that my understanding was affected by my feelings and so laid the letter away till morning  in the morning i read it again but with difficulty and uncertainty still for i had lost some little rest and my mental vision seemed clouded  the note was more connected now but did not meet the emergency it was expected to meet  it was too discursive  it appeared to read as follows though i was not certain of some of the words        polygamy dissembles majesty extracts redeem polarity causes       hitherto exist  ovations pursue wisdom or warts inherit and       condemn  boston botany cakes folony undertakes but who shall       allay  we fear not  yrxwly                                hevace eveeloj  but there did not seem to be a word about turnips  there seemed to be no suggestion as to how they might be made to grow like vines  there was not even a reference to the beazeleys  i slept upon the matter i ate no supper neither any breakfast next morning  so i resumed my work with a brain refreshed and was very hopeful  now the letter took a different aspectall save the signature which latter i judged to be only a harmless affectation of hebrew  the epistle was necessarily from mr greeley for it bore the printed heading of the tribune and i had written to no one else there  the letter i say had taken a different aspect but still its language was eccentric and avoided the issue  it now appeared to say        bolivia extemporizes mackerel borax esteems polygamy sausages       wither in the east  creation perdu is done for woes inherent one       can damn  buttons buttons corks geology underrates but we shall       allay  my beers out  yrxwly                                          hevace eveeloj  i was evidently overworked  my comprehension was impaired  therefore i gave two days to recreation and then returned to my task greatly refreshed  the letter now took this form        poultices do sometimes choke swine tulips reduce posterity causes       leather to resist  our notions empower wisdom her lets afford       while we can  butter but any cakes fill any undertaker well wean       him from his filly  we feel hot                                     yrxwly hevace eveeloj  i was still not satisfied  these generalities did not meet the question  they were crisp and vigorous and delivered with a confidence that almost compelled conviction but at such a time as this with a human life at stake they seemed inappropriate worldly and in bad taste  at any other time i would have been not only glad but proud to receive from a man like mr greeley a letter of this kind and would have studied it earnestly and tried to improve myself all i could but now with that poor boy in his far home languishing for relief i had no heart for learning  three days passed by and i read the note again  again its tenor had changed  it now appeared to say        potations do sometimes wake wines turnips restrain passion causes       necessary to state  infest the poor widow her lords effects will       be void  but dirt bathing etc etc followed unfairly will       worm him from his follyso swear not                                               yrxwly hevace eveeloj  this was more like it  but i was unable to proceed  i was too much worn  the word turnips brought temporary joy and encouragement but my strength was so much impaired and the delay might be so perilous for the boy that i relinquished the idea of pursuing the translation further and resolved to do what i ought to have done at first  i sat down and wrote mr greeley as follows        dear sir i fear i do not entirely comprehend your kind note  it       cannot be possible sir that turnips restrain passionat least       the study or contemplation of turnips cannotfor it is this very       employment that has scorched our poor friends mind and sapped his       bodily strengthbut if they do restrain it will you bear with us       a little further and explain how they should be prepared  i observe       that you say causes necessary to state but you have omitted to       state them        under a misapprehension you seem to attribute to me interested       motives in this matterto call it by no harsher term  but i assure       you dear sir that if i seem to be infesting the widow it is all       seeming and void of reality  it is from no seeking of mine that i       am in this position  she asked me herself to write you  i never       have infested herindeed i scarcely know her  i do not infest       anybody  i try to go along in my humble way doing as near right       as i can never harming anybody and never throwing out       insinuations  as for her lord and his effects they are of no       interest to me  i trust i have effects enough of my ownshall       endeavor to get along with them at any rate and not go mousing       around to get hold of somebodys that are void  but do you not       seethis woman is a widowshe has no lord  he is deador       pretended to be when they buried him  therefore no amount of       dirt bathing etc etc howsoever unfairly followed will be       likely to worm him from his follyif being dead and a ghost is       folly  your closing remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for       and if report says true you might have applied it to yourself sir       with more point and less impropriety                                very truly yours simon erickson  in the course of a few days mr greely did what would have saved a world of trouble and much mental and bodily suffering and misunderstanding if he had done it sooner  to wit he sent an intelligible rescript or translation of his original note made in a plain hand by his clerk  then the mystery cleared and i saw that his heart had been right all the time  i will recite the note in its clarified form        translation       potatoes do sometimes make vines turnips remain passive cause       unnecessary to state  inform the poor widow her lads efforts will       be vain  but diet bathing etc  etc followed uniformly will       wean him from his follyso fear not                                          yours horace greeley  but alas it was too late gentlementoo late  the criminal delay had done its workyoung beazely was no more  his spirit had taken its flight to a land where all anxieties shall be charmed away all desires gratified all ambitions realized  poor lad they laid him to his rest with a turnip in each hand  so ended erickson and lapsed again into nodding mumbling and abstraction  the company broke up and left him so  but they did not say what drove him crazy  in the momentary confusion i forgot to ask     chapter lxxi  at four oclock in the afternoon we were winding down a mountain of dreary and desolate lava to the sea and closing our pleasant land journey  this lava is the accumulation of ages one torrent of fire after another has rolled down here in old times and built up the island structure higher and higher  underneath it is honeycombed with caves it would be of no use to dig wells in such a place they would not hold wateryou would not find any for them to hold for that matter consequently the planters depend upon cisterns  the last lava flow occurred here so long ago that there are none now living who witnessed it  in one place it enclosed and burned down a grove of cocoanut trees and the holes in the lava where the trunks stood are still visible their sides retain the impression of the bark the trees fell upon the burning river and becoming partly submerged left in it the perfect counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf and even nut for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon and wonder at  there were doubtless plenty of kanaka sentinels on guard hereabouts at that time but they did not leave casts of their figures in the lava as the roman sentinels at herculaneum and pompeii did  it is a pity it is so because such things are so interesting but so it is  they probably went away  they went away early perhaps  however they had their merits the romans exhibited the higher pluck but the kanakas showed the sounder judgment  shortly we came in sight of that spot whose history is so familiar to every schoolboy in the wide worldkealakekua baythe place where captain cook the great circumnavigator was killed by the natives nearly a hundred years ago  the setting sun was flaming upon it a summer shower was falling and it was spanned by two magnificent rainbows  two men who were in advance of us rode through one of these and for a moment their garments shone with a more than regal splendor why did not captain cook have taste enough to call his great discovery the rainbow islands  these charming spectacles are present to you at every turn they are common in all the islands they are visible every day and frequently at night alsonot the silvery bow we see once in an age in the states by moonlight but barred with all bright and beautiful colors like the children of the sun and rain  i saw one of them a few nights ago  what the sailors call raindogslittle patches of rainbow are often seen drifting about the heavens in these latitudes like stained cathedral windows  kealakekua bay is a little curve like the last kink of a snailshell winding deep into the land seemingly not more than a mile wide from shore to shore  it is bounded on one sidewhere the murder was doneby a little flat plain on which stands a cocoanut grove and some ruined houses a steep wall of lava a thousand feet high at the upper end and three or four hundred at the lower comes down from the mountain and bounds the inner extremity of it  from this wall the place takes its name kealakekua which in the native tongue signifies the pathway of the gods  they say and still believe in spite of their liberal education in christianity that the great god lono who used to live upon the hillside always traveled that causeway when urgent business connected with heavenly affairs called him down to the seashore in a hurry  as the red sun looked across the placid ocean through the tall clean stems of the cocoanut trees like a blooming whiskey bloat through the bars of a city prison i went and stood in the edge of the water on the flat rock pressed by captain cooks feet when the blow was dealt which took away his life and tried to picture in my mind the doomed man struggling in the midst of the multitude of exasperated savagesthe men in the ship crowding to the vessels side and gazing in anxious dismay toward the shorethebut i discovered that i could not do it  it was growing dark the rain began to fall we could see that the distant boomerang was helplessly becalmed at sea and so i adjourned to the cheerless little box of a warehouse and sat down to smoke and think and wish the ship would make the landfor we had not eaten much for ten hours and were viciously hungry  plain unvarnished history takes the romance out of captain cooks assassination and renders a deliberate verdict of justifiable homicide wherever he went among the islands he was cordially received and welcomed by the inhabitants and his ships lavishly supplied with all manner of food  he returned these kindnesses with insult and illtreatment  perceiving that the people took him for the long vanished and lamented god lono he encouraged them in the delusion for the sake of the limitless power it gave him but during the famous disturbance at this spot and while he and his comrades were surrounded by fifteen thousand maddened savages he received a hurt and betrayed his earthly origin with a groan  it was his deathwarrant  instantly a shout went up he groanshe is not a god so they closed in upon him and dispatched him  his flesh was stripped from the bones and burned except nine pounds of it which were sent on board the ships  the heart was hung up in a native hut where it was found and eaten by three children who mistook it for the heart of a dog  one of these children grew to be a very old man and died in honolulu a few years ago  some of cooks bones were recovered and consigned to the deep by the officers of the ships  small blame should attach to the natives for the killing of cook they treated him well  in return he abused them  he and his men inflicted bodily injury upon many of them at different times and killed at least three of them before they offered any proportionate retaliation  near the shore we found cooks monumentonly a cocoanut stump four feet high and about a foot in diameter at the butt  it had lava boulders piled around its base to hold it up and keep it in its place and it was entirely sheathed over from top to bottom with rough discolored sheets of copper such as ships bottoms are coppered with  each sheet had a rude inscription scratched upon itwith a nail apparentlyand in every case the execution was wretched  most of these merely recorded the visits of british naval commanders to the spot but one of them bore this legend       near this spot fell       captain james cook       the distinguished circumnavigator       who discovered these islands       a d  1778  after cooks murder his second in command on board the ship opened fire upon the swarms of natives on the beach and one of his cannon balls cut this cocoanut tree short off and left this monumental stump standing it looked sad and lonely enough to us out there in the rainy twilight but there is no other monument to captain cook  true up on the mountain side we had passed by a large inclosure like an ample hogpen built of lava blocks which marks the spot where cooks flesh was stripped from his bones and burned but this is not properly a monument since it was erected by the natives themselves and less to do honor to the circumnavigator than for the sake of convenience in roasting him a thing like a guideboard was elevated above this pen on a tall pole and formerly there was an inscription upon it describing the memorable occurrence that had there taken place but the sun and the wind have long ago so defaced it as to render it illegible  toward midnight a fine breeze sprang up and the schooner soon worked herself into the bay and cast anchor  the boat came ashore for us and in a little while the clouds and the rain were all gone  the moon was beaming tranquilly down on land and sea and we two were stretched upon the deck sleeping the refreshing sleep and dreaming the happy dreams that are only vouchsafed to the weary and the innocent     chapter lxxii  in the breezy morning we went ashore and visited the ruined temple of the last god lono  the high chief cook of this templethe priest who presided over it and roasted the human sacrificeswas uncle to obookia and at one time that youth was an apprenticepriest under him  obookia was a young native of fine mind who together with three other native boys was taken to new england by the captain of a whaleship during the reign of kamehameha i and they were the means of attracting the attention of the religious world to their country  this resulted in the sending of missionaries there  and this obookia was the very same sensitive savage who sat down on the church steps and wept because his people did not have the bible  that incident has been very elaborately painted in many a charming sunday school bookaye and told so plaintively and so tenderly that i have cried over it in sunday school myself on general principles although at a time when i did not know much and could not understand why the people of the sandwich islands needed to worry so much about it as long as they did not know there was a bible at all  obookia was converted and educated and was to have returned to his native land with the first missionaries had he lived  the other native youths made the voyage and two of them did good service but the third william kanui fell from grace afterward for a time and when the gold excitement broke out in california he journeyed thither and went to mining although he was fifty years old  he succeeded pretty well but the failure of page bacon  co relieved him of six thousand dollars and then to all intents and purposes he was a bankrupt in his old age and he resumed service in the pulpit again  he died in honolulu in 1864  quite a broad tract of land near the temple extending from the sea to the mountain top was sacred to the god lono in olden timesso sacred that if a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it it was judicious for him to make his will because his time had come  he might go around it by water but he could not cross it  it was well sprinkled with pagan temples and stocked with awkward homely idols carved out of logs of wood  there was a temple devoted to prayers for rainand with fine sagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side that if you prayed there twentyfour times a day for rain you would be likely to get it every time  you would seldom get to your amen before you would have to hoist your umbrella  and there was a large temple near at hand which was built in a single night in the midst of storm and thunder and rain by the ghastly hands of dead men  tradition says that by the weird glare of the lightning a noiseless multitude of phantoms were seen at their strange labor far up the mountain side at dead of nightflitting hither and thither and bearing great lavablocks clasped in their nerveless fingersappearing and disappearing as the pallid lustre fell upon their forms and faded away again  even to this day it is said the natives hold this dread structure in awe and reverence and will not pass by it in the night  at noon i observed a bevy of nude native young ladies bathing in the sea and went and sat down on their clothes to keep them from being stolen i begged them to come out for the sea was rising and i was satisfied that they were running some risk  but they were not afraid and presently went on with their sport  they were finished swimmers and divers and enjoyed themselves to the last degree  they swam races splashed and ducked and tumbled each other about and filled the air with their laughter  it is said that the first thing an islander learns is how to swim learning to walk being a matter of smaller consequence comes afterward  one hears tales of native men and women swimming ashore from vessels many miles at seamore miles indeed than i dare vouch for or even mention  and they tell of a native diver who went down in thirty or fortyfoot waters and brought up an anvil i think he swallowed the anvil afterward if my memory serves me however i will not urge this point  i have spoken several times of the god lonoi may as well furnish two or three sentences concerning him  the idol the natives worshipped for him was a slender unornamented staff twelve feet long  tradition says he was a favorite god on the island of hawaiia great king who had been deified for meritorious servicesjust our own fashion of rewarding heroes with the difference that we would have made him a postmaster instead of a god no doubt  in an angry moment he slew his wife a goddess named kaikilani aiii  remorse of conscience drove him mad and tradition presents us the singular spectacle of a god traveling on the shoulder for in his gnawing grief he wandered about from place to place boxing and wrestling with all whom he met  of course this pastime soon lost its novelty inasmuch as it must necessarily have been the case that when so powerful a deity sent a frail human opponent to grass he never came back any more  therefore he instituted games called makahiki and ordered that they should be held in his honor and then sailed for foreign lands on a threecornered raft stating that he would return some dayand that was the last of lono he was never seen any more his raft got swamped perhaps  but the people always expected his return and thus they were easily led to accept captain cook as the restored god  some of the old natives believed cook was lono to the day of their death but many did not for they could not understand how he could die if he was a god  only a mile or so from kealakekua bay is a spot of historic interestthe place where the last battle was fought for idolatry  of course we visited it and came away as wise as most people do who go and gaze upon such mementoes of the past when in an unreflective mood  while the first missionaries were on their way around the horn the idolatrous customs which had obtained in the island as far back as tradition reached were suddenly broken up  old kamehameha i was dead and his son liholiho the new king was a free liver a roystering dissolute fellow and hated the restraints of the ancient tabu  his assistant in the government kaahumanu the queen dowager was proud and highspirited and hated the tabu because it restricted the privileges of her sex and degraded all women very nearly to the level of brutes so the case stood  liholiho had half a mind to put his foot down kaahumahu had a whole mind to badger him into doing it and whiskey did the rest  it was probably the rest  it was probably the first time whiskey ever prominently figured as an aid to civilization  liholiho came up to kailua as drunk as a piper and attended a great feast the determined queen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch and then while all the multitude stared in blank dismay he moved deliberately forward and sat down with the women  they saw him eat from the same vessel with them and were appalled terrible moments drifted slowly by and still the king ate still he lived still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld then conviction came like a revelationthe superstitions of a hundred generations passed from before the people like a cloud and a shout went up the tabu is broken  the tabu is broken  thus did king liholiho and his dreadful whiskey preach the first sermon and prepare the way for the new gospel that was speeding southward over the waves of the atlantic  the tabu broken and destruction failing to follow the awful sacrilege the people with that childlike precipitancy which has always characterized them jumped to the conclusion that their gods were a weak and wretched swindle just as they formerly jumped to the conclusion that captain cook was no god merely because he groaned and promptly killed him without stopping to inquire whether a god might not groan as well as a man if it suited his convenience to do it and satisfied that the idols were powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once and pulled them downhacked them to piecesapplied the torchannihilated them  the pagan priests were furious  and well they might be they had held the fattest offices in the land and now they were beggared they had been greatthey had stood above the chiefsand now they were vagabonds they raised a revolt they scared a number of people into joining their standard and bekuokalani an ambitious offshoot of royalty was easily persuaded to become their leader  in the first skirmish the idolaters triumphed over the royal army sent against them and full of confidence they resolved to march upon kailua the king sent an envoy to try and conciliate them and came very near being an envoy short by the operation the savages not only refused to listen to him but wanted to kill him  so the king sent his men forth under major general kalaimoku and the two host met a kuamoo  the battle was long and fiercemen and women fighting side by side as was the customand when the day was done the rebels were flying in every direction in hopeless panic and idolatry and the tabu were dead in the land  the royalists marched gayly home to kailua glorifying the new dispensation  there is no power in the gods said they they are a vanity and a lie  the army with idols was weak the army without idols was strong and victorious  the nation was without a religion  the missionary ship arrived in safety shortly afterward timed by providential exactness to meet the emergency and the gospel was planted as in a virgin soil     chapter lxxiii  at noon we hired a kanaka to take us down to the ancient ruins at honaunan in his canoeprice two dollarsreasonable enough for a sea voyage of eight miles counting both ways  the native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance  i cannot think of anything to liken it to but a boys sled runner hollowed out and that does not quite convey the correct idea  it is about fifteen feet long high and pointed at both ends is a foot and a half or two feet deep and so narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out again  it sits on top of the water like a duck but it has an outrigger and does not upset easily if you keep still  this outrigger is formed of two long bent sticks like plow handles which project from one side and to their outer ends is bound a curved beam composed of an extremely light wood which skims along the surface of the water and thus saves you from an upset on that side while the outriggers weight is not so easily lifted as to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly feared  still until one gets used to sitting perched upon this knifeblade he is apt to reason within himself that it would be more comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other side also i had the bow seat and billings sat amidships and faced the kanaka who occupied the stern of the craft and did the paddling  with the first stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from the shore like an arrow there was not much to see  while we were on the shallow water of the reef it was pastime to look down into the limpid depths at the large bunches of branching coralthe unique shrubbery of the sea  we lost that though when we got out into the dead blue water of the deep but we had the picture of the surf then dashing angrily against the cragbound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the air  there was interest in this beetling border too for it was honeycombed with quaint caves and arches and tunnels and had a rude semblance of the dilapidated architecture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of the restless sea  when this novelty ceased to be a novelty we turned our eyes shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green forests stretching up into the curtaining clouds and at the specks of houses in the rearward distance and the diminished schooner riding sleepily at anchor  and when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into the midst of a school of huge beastly porpoises engaged at their eternal game of arching over a wave and disappearing and then doing it over again and keeping it upalways circling over in that way like so many wellsubmerged wheels  but the porpoises wheeled themselves away and then we were thrown upon our own resources  it did not take many minutes to discover that the sun was blazing like a bonfire and that the weather was of a melting temperature  it had a drowsing effect too in one place we came upon a large company of naked natives of both sexes and all ages amusing themselves with the national pastime of surfbathing each heathen would paddle three or four hundred yards out to sea taking a short board with him then face the shore and wait for a particularly prodigious billow to come along at the right moment he would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell  it did not seem that a lightning express train could shoot along at a more hairlifting speed  i tried surfbathing once subsequently but made a failure of it  i got the board placed right and at the right moment too but missed the connection myselfthe board struck the shore in three quarters of a second without any cargo and i struck the bottom about the same time with a couple of barrels of water in me  none but natives ever master the art of surfbathing thoroughly  at the end of an hour we had made the four miles and landed on a level point of land upon which was a wide extent of old ruins with many a tall cocoanut tree growing among them  here was the ancient city of refugea vast inclosure whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the base and fifteen feet high an oblong square a thousand and forty feet one way and a fraction under seven hundred the other  within this inclosure in early times has been three rude temples each two hundred and ten feet long by one hundred wide and thirteen high  in those days if a man killed another anywhere on the island the relatives were privileged to take the murderers life and then a chase for life and liberty beganthe outlawed criminal flying through pathless forests and over mountain and plain with his hopes fixed upon the protecting walls of the city of refuge and the avenger of blood following hotly after him  sometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the temple and the panting pair sped through long files of excited natives who watched the contest with flashing eye and dilated nostril encouraging the hunted refugee with sharp inspiriting ejaculations and sending up a ringing shout of exultation when the saving gates closed upon him and the cheated pursuer sank exhausted at the threshold  but sometimes the flying criminal fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door when one more brave stride one more brief second of time would have brought his feet upon the sacred ground and barred him against all harm  where did these isolated pagans get this idea of a city of refugethis ancient oriental custom  this old sanctuary was sacred to alleven to rebels in arms and invading armies  once within its walls and confession made to the priest and absolution obtained the wretch with a price upon his head could go forth without fear and without dangerhe was tabu and to harm him was death the routed rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this place to claim sanctuary and many were thus saved  close to the corner of the great inclosure is a round structure of stone some six or eight feet high with a level top about ten or twelve in diameter  this was the place of execution  a high palisade of cocoanut piles shut out the cruel scenes from the vulgar multitude  here criminals were killed the flesh stripped from the bones and burned and the bones secreted in holes in the body of the structure  if the man had been guilty of a high crime the entire corpse was burned  the walls of the temple are a study  the same food for speculation that is offered the visitor to the pyramids of egypt he will find herethe mystery of how they were constructed by a people unacquainted with science and mechanics  the natives have no invention of their own for hoisting heavy weights they had no beasts of burden and they have never even shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever  yet some of the lava blocks quarried out brought over rough broken ground and built into this wall six or seven feet from the ground are of prodigious size and would weigh tons  how did they transport and how raise them  both the inner and outer surfaces of the walls present a smooth front and are very creditable specimens of masonry  the blocks are of all manner of shapes and sizes but yet are fitted together with the neatest exactness  the gradual narrowing of the wall from the base upward is accurately preserved  no cement was used but the edifice is firm and compact and is capable of resisting storm and decay for centuries  who built this temple and how was it built and when are mysteries that may never be unraveled outside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffinshaped stone eleven feet four inches long and three feet square at the small end it would weigh a few thousand pounds which the high chief who held sway over this district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day to use as a lounge  this circumstance is established by the most reliable traditions  he used to lie down on it in his indolent way and keep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no soldiering done  and no doubt there was not any done to speak of because he was a man of that sort of build that incites to attention to business on the part of an employee  he was fourteen or fifteen feet high  when he stretched himself at full length on his lounge his legs hung down over the end and when he snored he woke the dead  these facts are all attested by irrefragable tradition  on the other side of the temple is a monstrous seventon rock eleven feet long seven feet wide and three feet thick  it is raised a foot or a foot and a half above the ground and rests upon half a dozen little stony pedestals  the same old fourteenfooter brought it down from the mountain merely for fun he had his own notions about fun and propped it up as we find it now and as others may find it a century hence for it would take a score of horses to budge it from its position  they say that fifty or sixty years ago the proud queen kaahumanu used to fly to this rock for safety whenever she had been making trouble with her fierce husband and hide under it until his wrath was appeased  but these kanakas will lie and this statement is one of their ablest effortsfor kaahumanu was six feet highshe was bulkyshe was built like an oxand she could no more have squeezed herself under that rock than she could have passed between the cylinders of a sugar mill  what could she gain by it even if she succeeded  to be chased and abused by a savage husband could not be otherwise than humiliating to her high spirit yet it could never make her feel so flat as an hours repose under that rock would  we walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width a road paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable degree of engineering skill  some say that that wise old pagan kamehameha i planned and built it but others say it was built so long before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out of the traditions  in either case however as the handiwork of an untaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest  the stones are worn and smooth and pushed apart in places so that the road has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of rome which one sees in pictures  the object of our tramp was to visit a great natural curiosity at the base of the foothillsa congealed cascade of lava  some old forgotten volcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountain side here and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff some fifty feet high to the ground below  the flaming torrent cooled in the winds from the sea and remains there today all seamed and frothed and rippled a petrified niagara  it is very picturesque and withal so natural that one might almost imagine it still flowed  a smaller stream trickled over the cliff and built up an isolated pyramid about thirty feet high which has the semblance of a mass of large gnarled and knotted vines and roots and stems intricately twisted and woven together  we passed in behind the cascade and the pyramid and found the bluff pierced by several cavernous tunnels whose crooked courses we followed a long distance  two of these winding tunnels stand as proof of natures mining abilities their floors are level they are seven feet wide and their roofs are gently arched  their height is not uniform however  we passed through one a hundred feet long which leads through a spur of the hill and opens out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests in the waves of the sea  it is a commodious tunnel except that there are occasional places in it where one must stoop to pass under  the roof is lava of course and is thickly studded with little lavapointed icicles an inch long which hardened as they dripped  they project as closely together as the iron teeth of a cornsheller and if one will stand up straight and walk any distance there he can get his hair combed free of charge     chapter lxxiv  we got back to the schooner in good time and then sailed down to kau where we disembarked and took final leave of the vessel  next day we bought horses and bent our way over the summerclad mountainterraces toward the great volcano of kilauea kelowwayah  we made nearly a two days journey of it but that was on account of laziness  toward sunset on the second day we reached an elevation of some four thousand feet above sea level and as we picked our careful way through billowy wastes of lava long generations ago stricken dead and cold in the climax of its tossing fury we began to come upon signs of the near presence of the volcanosigns in the nature of ragged fissures that discharged jets of sulphurous vapor into the air hot from the molten ocean down in the bowels of the mountain  shortly the crater came into view  i have seen vesuvius since but it was a mere toy a childs volcano a soupkettle compared to this mount vesuvius is a shapely cone thirtysix hundred feet high its crater an inverted cone only three hundred feet deep and not more than a thousand feet in diameter if as much as that its fires meagre modest and docilebut here was a vast perpendicular walled cellar nine hundred feet deep in some places thirteen hundred in others levelfloored and ten miles in circumference  here was a yawning pit upon whose floor the armies of russia could camp and have room to spare  perched upon the edge of the crater at the opposite end from where we stood was a small lookout housesay three miles away  it assisted us by comparison to comprehend and appreciate the great depth of the basin it looked like a tiny martinbox clinging at the eaves of a cathedral after some little time spent in resting and looking and ciphering we hurried on to the hotel  by the path it is half a mile from the volcano house to the lookouthouse  after a hearty supper we waited until it was thoroughly dark and then started to the crater  the first glance in that direction revealed a scene of wild beauty  there was a heavy fog over the crater and it was splendidly illuminated by the glare from the fires below  the illumination was two miles wide and a mile high perhaps and if you ever on a dark night and at a distance beheld the light from thirty or forty blocks of distant buildings all on fire at once reflected strongly against overhanging clouds you can form a fair idea of what this looked like  a colossal column of cloud towered to a great height in the air immediately above the crater and the outer swell of every one of its vast folds was dyed with a rich crimson luster which was subdued to a pale rose tint in the depressions between  it glowed like a muffled torch and stretched upward to a dizzy height toward the zenith  i thought it just possible that its like had not been seen since the children of israel wandered on their long march through the desert so many centuries ago over a path illuminated by the mysterious pillar of fire  and i was sure that i now had a vivid conception of what the majestic pillar of fire was like which almost amounted to a revelation  arrived at the little thatched lookout house we rested our elbows on the railing in front and looked abroad over the wide crater and down over the sheer precipice at the seething fires beneath us  the view was a startling improvement on my daylight experience  i turned to see the effect on the balance of the company and found the reddestfaced set of men i almost ever saw  in the strong light every countenance glowed like redhot iron every shoulder was suffused with crimson and shaded rearward into dingy shapeless obscurity  the place below looked like the infernal regions and these men like halfcooled devils just come up on a furlough  i turned my eyes upon the volcano again  the cellar was tolerably well lighted up  for a mile and a half in front of us and half a mile on either side the floor of the abyss was magnificently illuminated beyond these limits the mists hung down their gauzy curtains and cast a deceptive gloom over all that made the twinkling fires in the remote corners of the crater seem countless leagues removedmade them seem like the campfires of a great army far away  here was room for the imagination to work  you could imagine those lights the width of a continent awayand that hidden under the intervening darkness were hills and winding rivers and weary wastes of plain and desertand even then the tremendous vista stretched on and on and onto the fires and far beyond  you could not compass itit was the idea of eternity made tangibleand the longest end of it made visible to the naked eye  the greater part of the vast floor of the desert under us was as black as ink and apparently smooth and level but over a mile square of it was ringed and streaked and striped with a thousand branching streams of liquid and gorgeously brilliant fire  it looked like a colossal railroad map of the state of massachusetts done in chain lightning on a midnight sky  imagine itimagine a coalblack sky shivered into a tangled network of angry fire  here and there were gleaming holes a hundred feet in diameter broken in the dark crust and in them the melted lavathe color a dazzling white just tinged with yellowwas boiling and surging furiously and from these holes branched numberless bright torrents in many directions like the spokes of a wheel and kept a tolerably straight course for a while and then swept round in huge rainbow curves or made a long succession of sharp wormfence angles which looked precisely like the fiercest jagged lightning  these streams met other streams and they mingled with and crossed and recrossed each other in every conceivable direction like skate tracks on a popular skating ground  sometimes streams twenty or thirty feet wide flowed from the holes to some distance without dividing and through the operaglasses we could see that they ran down small steep hills and were genuine cataracts of fire white at their source but soon cooling and turning to the richest red grained with alternate lines of black and gold  every now and then masses of the dark crust broke away and floated slowly down these streams like rafts down a river occasionally the molten lava flowing under the superincumbent crust broke throughsplit a dazzling streak from five hundred to a thousand feet long like a sudden flash of lightning and then acre after acre of the cold lava parted into fragments turned up edgewise like cakes of ice when a great river breaks up plunged downward and were swallowed in the crimson cauldron  then the wide expanse of the thaw maintained a ruddy glow for a while but shortly cooled and became black and level again during a thaw every dismembered cake was marked by a glittering white border which was superbly shaded inward by aurora borealis rays which were a flaming yellow where they joined the white border and from thence toward their points tapered into glowing crimson then into a rich pale carmine and finally into a faint blush that held its own a moment and then dimmed and turned black  some of the streams preferred to mingle together in a tangle of fantastic circles and then they looked something like the confusion of ropes one sees on a ships deck when she has just taken in sail and dropped anchorprovided one can imagine those ropes on fire  through the glasses the little fountains scattered about looked very beautiful  they boiled and coughed and spluttered and discharged sprays of stringy red fireof about the consistency of mush for instancefrom ten to fifteen feet into the air along with a shower of brilliant white sparksa quaint and unnatural mingling of gouts of blood and snowflakes  we had circles and serpents and streaks of lightning all twined and wreathed and tied together without a break throughout an area more than a mile square that amount of ground was covered though it was not strictly square and it was with a feeling of placid exultation that we reflected that many years had elapsed since any visitor had seen such a splendid displaysince any visitor had seen anything more than the now snubbed and insignificant north and south lakes in action  we had been reading old files of hawaiian newspapers and the record book at the volcano house and were posted  i could see the north lake lying out on the black floor away off in the outer edge of our panorama and knitted to it by a webwork of lava streams  in its individual capacity it looked very little more respectable than a schoolhouse on fire  true it was about nine hundred feet long and two or three hundred wide but then under the present circumstances it necessarily appeared rather insignificant and besides it was so distant from us  i forgot to say that the noise made by the bubbling lava is not great heard as we heard it from our lofty perch  it makes three distinct soundsa rushing a hissing and a coughing or puffing sound and if you stand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine that you are sweeping down a river on a large lowpressure steamer and that you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers the puffing from her escapepipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her wheels  the smell of sulphur is strong but not unpleasant to a sinner  we left the lookout house at ten oclock in a half cooked condition because of the heat from peles furnaces and wrapping up in blankets for the night was cold we returned to our hotel     chapter lxxv  the next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater for we desired to traverse its floor and see the north lake of fire which lay two miles away toward the further wall  after dark half a dozen of us set out with lanterns and native guides and climbed down a crazy thousandfoot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall and reached the bottom in safety  the irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the floor looked black and cold but when we ran out upon it we found it hot yet to the feet and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed the underlying fires gleaming vindictively  a neighboring cauldron was threatening to overflow and this added to the dubiousness of the situation  so the native guides refused to continue the venture and then every body deserted except a stranger named marlette  he said he had been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could find his way through it at night  he thought that a run of three hundred yards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our shoesoles  his pluck gave me backbone  we took one lantern and instructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the lookout house to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost and then the party started back up the precipice and marlette and i made our run we skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk dispatch and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet  then we took things leisurely and comfortably jumping tolerably wide and probably bottomless chasms and threading our way through picturesque lava upheavals with considerable confidence  when we got fairly away from the cauldrons of boiling fire we seemed to be in a gloomy desert and a suffocatingly dark one surrounded by dim walls that seemed to tower to the sky  the only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high overhead  by and by marlette shouted stop i never stopped quicker in my life i asked what the matter was  he said we were out of the path  he said we must not try to go on till we found it again for we were surrounded with beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge down a thousand feet  i thought eight hundred would answer for me and was about to say so when marlette partly proved his statement by accidentally crushing through and disappearing to his armpits  he got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern  he said there was only one path and that it was but vaguely defined  we could not find it  the lava surface was all alike in the lantern light  but he was an ingenious man  he said it was not the lantern that had informed him that we were out of the path but his feet  he had noticed a crisp grinding of fine lavaneedles under his feet and some instinct reminded him that in the path these were all worn away  so he put the lantern behind him and began to search with his boots instead of his eyes  it was good sagacity  the first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind under it he announced that the trail was found again and after that we kept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us in time  it was a long tramp but an exciting one  we reached the north lake between ten and eleven oclock and sat down on a huge overhanging lavashelf tired but satisfied  the spectacle presented was worth coming double the distance to see  under us and stretching away before us was a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent  the glare from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear to look upon it steadily  it was like gazing at the sun at noonday except that the glare was not quite so white  at unequal distances all around the shores of the lake were nearly whitehot chimneys or hollow drums of lava four or five feet high and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of lavagouts and gem spangles some white some red and some goldena ceaseless bombardment and one that fascinated the eye with its unapproachable splendor  the mere distant jets sparkling up through an intervening gossamer veil of vapor seemed miles away and the further the curving ranks of fiery fountains receded the more fairylike and beautiful they appeared  now and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm down ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise and then all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary dwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon then burst asunder and out of its heart would flit a palegreen film of vapor and float upward and vanish in the darknessa released soul soaring homeward from captivity with the damned no doubt  the crashing plunge of the ruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows lashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch  by and by a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the lake jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a suggestion that may have been intended for a hint and may not  we did not wait to see  we got lost again on our way back and were more than an hour hunting for the path  we were where we could see the beacon lantern at the lookout house at the time but thought it was a star and paid no attention to it we reached the hotel at two oclock in the morning pretty well fagged out  kilauea never overflows its vast crater but bursts a passage for its lava through the mountain side when relief is necessary and then the destruction is fearful  about 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and sent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea which swept away forests huts plantations and every thing else that lay in its path the stream was five miles broad in places and two hundred feet deep and the distance it traveled was forty miles  it tore up and bore away acrepatches of land on its bosom like raftsrocks trees and all intact  at night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea and at a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight  the atmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling ashes pumice stones and cinders countless columns of smoke rose up and blended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed with a ruddy flush reflected from the fires below here and there jets of lava sprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into rocketsprays that returned to earth in a crimson rain and all the while the laboring mountain shook with natures great palsy and voiced its distress in moanings and the muffled booming of subterranean thunders  fishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore where the lava entered the sea  the earthquakes caused some loss of human life and a prodigious tidal wave swept inland carrying every thing before it and drowning a number of natives  the devastation consummated along the route traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable  only a pompeii and a herculaneum were needed at the foot of kilauea to make the story of the irruption immortal     chapter lxxvi  we rode horseback all around the island of hawaii the crooked road making the distance two hundred miles and enjoyed the journey very much  we were more than a week making the trip because our kanaka horses would not go by a house or a hut without stoppingwhip and spur could not alter their minds about it and so we finally found that it economized time to let them have their way  upon inquiry the mystery was explained the natives are such thoroughgoing gossips that they never pass a house without stopping to swap news and consequently their horses learn to regard that sort of thing as an essential part of the whole duty of man and his salvation not to be compassed without it  however at a former crisis of my life i had once taken an aristocratic young lady out driving behind a horse that had just retired from a long and honorable career as the moving impulse of a milk wagon and so this present experience awoke a reminiscent sadness in me in place of the exasperation more natural to the occasion  i remembered how helpless i was that day and how humiliated how ashamed i was of having intimated to the girl that i had always owned the horse and was accustomed to grandeur how hard i tried to appear easy and even vivacious under suffering that was consuming my vitals how placidly and maliciously the girl smiled and kept on smiling while my hot blushes baked themselves into a permanent bloodpudding in my face how the horse ambled from one side of the street to the other and waited complacently before every third house two minutes and a quarter while i belabored his back and reviled him in my heart how i tried to keep him from turning corners and failed how i moved heaven and earth to get him out of town and did not succeed how he traversed the entire settlement and delivered imaginary milk at a hundred and sixtytwo different domiciles and how he finally brought up at a dairy depot and refused to budge further thus rounding and completing the revealment of what the plebeian service of his life had been how in eloquent silence i walked the girl home and how when i took leave of her her parting remark scorched my soul and appeared to blister me all over she said that my horse was a fine capable animal and i must have taken great comfort in him in my timebut that if i would take along some milktickets next time and appear to deliver them at the various halting places it might expedite his movements a little there was a coolness between us after that  in one place in the island of hawaii we saw a laced and ruffled cataract of limpid water leaping from a sheer precipice fifteen hundred feet high but that sort of scenery finds its stanchest ally in the arithmetic rather than in spectacular effect  if one desires to be so stirred by a poem of nature wrought in the happily commingled graces of picturesque rocks glimpsed distances foliage color shifting lights and shadows and failing water that the tears almost come into his eyes so potent is the charm exerted he need not go away from america to enjoy such an experience  the rainbow fall in watkins glen ny on the erie railway is an example  it would recede into pitiable insignificance if the callous tourist drew on arithmetic on it but left to compete for the honors simply on scenic grace and beautythe grand the august and the sublime being barred the contestit could challenge the old world and the new to produce its peer  in one locality on our journey we saw some horses that had been born and reared on top of the mountains above the range of running water and consequently they had never drank that fluid in their lives but had been always accustomed to quenching their thirst by eating dewladen or showerwetted leaves  and now it was destructively funny to see them sniff suspiciously at a pail of water and then put in their noses and try to take a bite out of the fluid as if it were a solid  finding it liquid they would snatch away their heads and fall to trembling snorting and showing other evidences of fright  when they became convinced at last that the water was friendly and harmless they thrust in their noses up to their eyes brought out a mouthful of water and proceeded to chew it complacently  we saw a man coax kick and spur one of them five or ten minutes before he could make it cross a running stream  it spread its nostrils distended its eyes and trembled all over just as horses customarily do in the presence of a serpentand for aught i know it thought the crawling stream was a serpent  in due course of time our journey came to an end at kawaehae usually pronounced toahiand before we find fault with this elaborate orthographical method of arriving at such an unostentatious result let us lop off the ugh from our word though  i made this horseback trip on a mule  i paid ten dollars for him at kau kahoo added four to get him shod rode him two hundred miles and then sold him for fifteen dollars  i mark the circumstance with a white stone in the absence of chalkfor i never saw a white stone that a body could mark anything with though out of respect for the ancients i have tried it often enough for up to that day and date it was the first strictly commercial transaction i had ever entered into and come out winner  we returned to honolulu and from thence sailed to the island of maui and spent several weeks there very pleasantly  i still remember with a sense of indolent luxury a picnicing excursion up a romantic gorge there called the iao valley  the trail lay along the edge of a brawling stream in the bottom of the gorgea shady route for it was well roofed with the verdant domes of forest trees  through openings in the foliage we glimpsed picturesque scenery that revealed ceaseless changes and new charms with every step of our progress  perpendicular walls from one to three thousand feet high guarded the way and were sumptuously plumed with varied foliage in places and in places swathed in waving ferns passing shreds of cloud trailed their shadows across these shining fronts mottling them with blots billowy masses of white vapor hid the turreted summits and far above the vapor swelled a background of gleaming green crags and cones that came and went through the veiling mists like islands drifting in a fog sometimes the cloudy curtain descended till half the canon wall was hidden then shredded gradually away till only airy glimpses of the ferny front appeared through itthen swept aloft and left it glorified in the sun again  now and then as our position changed rocky bastions swung out from the wall a mimic ruin of castellated ramparts and crumbling towers clothed with mosses and hung with garlands of swaying vines and as we moved on they swung back again and hid themselves once more in the foliage  presently a verdureclad needle of stone a thousand feet high stepped out from behind a corner and mounted guard over the mysteries of the valley  it seemed to me that if captain cook needed a monument here was one ready madetherefore why not put up his sign here and sell out the venerable cocoanut stump  but the chief pride of maui is her dead volcano of haleakalawhich means translated the house of the sun  we climbed a thousand feet up the side of this isolated colossus one afternoon then camped and next day climbed the remaining nine thousand feet and anchored on the summit where we built a fire and froze and roasted by turns all night  with the first pallor of dawn we got up and saw things that were new to us mounted on a commanding pinnacle we watched nature work her silent wonders  the sea was spread abroad on every hand its tumbled surface seeming only wrinkled and dimpled in the distance  a broad valley below appeared like an ample checkerboard its velvety green sugar plantations alternating with dun squares of barrenness and groves of trees diminished to mossy tufts  beyond the valley were mountains picturesquely grouped together but bear in mind we fancied that we were looking up at these thingsnot down  we seemed to sit in the bottom of a symmetrical bowl ten thousand feet deep with the valley and the skirting sea lifted away into the sky above us  it was curious and not only curious but aggravating for it was having our trouble all for nothing to climb ten thousand feet toward heaven and then have to look up at our scenery however we had to be content with it and make the best of it for all we could do we could not coax our landscape down out of the clouds formerly when i had read an article in which poe treated of this singular fraud perpetrated upon the eye by isolated great altitudes i had looked upon the matter as an invention of his own fancy  i have spoken of the outside viewbut we had an inside one too  that was the yawning dead crater into which we now and then tumbled rocks half as large as a barrel from our perch and saw them go careering down the almost perpendicular sides bounding three hundred feet at a jump kicking up castclouds wherever they struck diminishing to our view as they sped farther into distance growing invisible finally and only betraying their course by faint little puffs of dust and coming to a halt at last in the bottom of the abyss two thousand five hundred feet down from where they started  it was magnificent sport  we wore ourselves out at it  the crater of vesuvius as i have before remarked is a modest pit about a thousand feet deep and three thousand in circumference that of kilauea is somewhat deeper and ten miles in circumference  but what are either of them compared to the vacant stomach of haleakala  i will not offer any figures of my own but give official onesthose of commander wilkes usn who surveyed it and testifies that it is twentyseven miles in circumference  if it had a level bottom it would make a fine site for a city like london  it must have afforded a spectacle worth contemplating in the old days when its furnaces gave full rein to their anger  presently vagrant white clouds came drifting along high over the sea and the valley then they came in couples and groups then in imposing squadrons gradually joining their forces they banked themselves solidly together a thousand feet under us and totally shut out land and ocean not a vestige of anything was left in view but just a little of the rim of the crater circling away from the pinnacle whereon we sat for a ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts without had drifted through a chasm in the crater wall and filed round and round and gathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was stored to the brim with a fleecy fog  thus banked motion ceased and silence reigned  clear to the horizon league on league the snowy floor stretched without a breaknot level but in rounded folds with shallow creases between and with here and there stately piles of vapory architecture lifting themselves aloft out of the common plainsome near at hand some in the middle distances and others relieving the monotony of the remote solitudes  there was little conversation for the impressive scene overawed speech  i felt like the last man neglected of the judgment and left pinnacled in midheaven a forgotten relic of a vanished world  while the hush yet brooded the messengers of the coming resurrection appeared in the east  a growing warmth suffused the horizon and soon the sun emerged and looked out over the cloudwaste flinging bars of ruddy light across it staining its folds and billowcaps with blushes purpling the shaded troughs between and glorifying the massy vaporpalaces and cathedrals with a wasteful splendor of all blendings and combinations of rich coloring  it was the sublimest spectacle i ever witnessed and i think the memory of it will remain with me always     chapter lxxvii  i stumbled upon one curious character in the island of mani  he became a sore annoyance to me in the course of time  my first glimpse of him was in a sort of public room in the town of lahaina  he occupied a chair at the opposite side of the apartment and sat eyeing our party with interest for some minutes and listening as critically to what we were saying as if he fancied we were talking to him and expecting him to reply  i thought it very sociable in a stranger  presently in the course of conversation i made a statement bearing upon the subject under discussionand i made it with due modesty for there was nothing extraordinary about it and it was only put forth in illustration of a point at issue  i had barely finished when this person spoke out with rapid utterance and feverish anxiety  oh that was certainly remarkable after a fashion but you ought to have seen my chimneyyou ought to have seen my chimney sir  smoke i wish i may hang ifmr jones you remember that chimneyyou must remember that chimney  no noi recollect now you warnt living on this side of the island then  but i am telling you nothing but the truth and i wish i may never draw another breath if that chimney didnt smoke so that the smoke actually got caked in it and i had to dig it out with a pickaxe  you may smile gentlemen but the high sheriffs got a hunk of it which i dug out before his eyes and so its perfectly easy for you to go and examine for yourselves  the interruption broke up the conversation which had already begun to lag and we presently hired some natives and an outrigger canoe or two and went out to overlook a grand surfbathing contest  two weeks after this while talking in a company i looked up and detected this same man boring through and through me with his intense eye and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to speak  the moment i paused he said  beg your pardon sir beg your pardon but it can only be considered remarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation  sir contrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience it instantly becomes commonplace  no not thatfor i will not speak so discourteously of any experience in the career of a stranger and a gentlemanbut i am obliged to say that you could not and you would not ever again refer to this tree as a large one if you could behold as i have the great yakmatack tree in the island of ounaska sea of kamtchatkaa tree sir not one inch less than four hundred and fifteen feet in solid diameterand i wish i may die in a minute if it isnt so oh you neednt look so questioning gentlemen heres old cap saltmarsh can say whether i know what im talking about or not  i showed him the tree  captain saltmarshcome now cat your anchor ladyoure heaving too taut  you promised to show me that stunner and i walked more than eleven mile with you through the cussedest jungle i ever see a hunting for it but the tree you showed me finally warnt as big around as a beer cask and you know that your own self markiss  hear the man talk  of course the tree was reduced that way but didnt i explain it  answer me didnt i  didnt i say i wished you could have seen it when i first saw it  when you got up on your ear and called me names and said i had brought you eleven miles to look at a sapling didnt i explain to you that all the whaleships in the north seas had been wooding off of it for more than twentyseven years  and did you spose the tree could last forever confound it  i dont see why you want to keep back things that way and try to injure a person thats never done you any harm  somehow this mans presence made me uncomfortable and i was glad when a native arrived at that moment to say that muckawow the most companionable and luxurious among the rude warchiefs of the islands desired us to come over and help him enjoy a missionary whom he had found trespassing on his grounds  i think it was about ten days afterward that as i finished a statement i was making for the instruction of a group of friends and acquaintances and which made no pretence of being extraordinary a familiar voice chimed instantly in on the heels of my last word and said  but my dear sir there was nothing remarkable about that horse or the circumstance eithernothing in the world  i mean no sort of offence when i say it sir but you really do not know anything whatever about speed  bless your heart if you could only have seen my mare margaretta there was a beastthere was lightning for you  trot  trot is no name for itshe flew  how she could whirl a buggy along  i started her out once sircolonel bilgewater you recollect that animal perfectly well i started her out about thirty or thirtyfive yards ahead of the awfullest storm i ever saw in my life and it chased us upwards of eighteen miles  it did by the everlasting hills  and im telling you nothing but the unvarnished truth when i say that not one single drop of rain fell on menot a single drop sir  and i swear to it  but my dog was aswimming behind the wagon all the way  for a week or two i stayed mostly within doors for i seemed to meet this person everywhere and he had become utterly hateful to me  but one evening i dropped in on captain perkins and his friends and we had a sociable time  about ten oclock i chanced to be talking about a merchant friend of mine and without really intending it the remark slipped out that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his workmen  instantly through the steam of a hot whiskey punch on the opposite side of the room a remembered voice shotand for a moment i trembled on the imminent verge of profanity  oh my dear sir really you expose yourself when you parade that as a surprising circumstance  bless your heart and hide you are ignorant of the very a b c of meanness ignorant as the unborn babe ignorant as unborn twins  you dont know anything about it  it is pitiable to see you sir a wellspoken and prepossessing stranger making such an enormous powwow here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is perfectly humiliating  look me in the eye if you please look me in the eye  john james godfrey was the son of poor but honest parents in the state of mississippiboyhood friend of minebosom comrade in later years  heaven rest his noble spirit he is gone from us now  john james godfrey was hired by the hayblossom mining company in california to do some blasting for themthe incorporated company of mean men the boys used to call it  well one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep and put in an awful blast of powder and was standing over it ramming it down with an iron crowbar about nine foot long when the cussed thing struck a spark and fired the powder and scat away john godfrey whizzed like a skyrocket him and his crowbar  well sir he kept on going up in the air higher and higher till he didnt look any bigger than a boyand he kept going on up higher and higher till he didnt look any bigger than a dolland he kept on going up higher and higher till he didnt look any bigger than a little small beeand then he went out of sight  presently he came in sight again looking like a little small beeand he came along down further and further till he looked as big as a doll againand down further and further till he was as big as a boy againand further and further till he was a fullsized man once more and then him and his crowbar came a whizzing down and lit right exactly in the same old tracks and went to rramming down and rramming down and rramming down again just the same as if nothing had happened  now do you know that poor cuss warnt gone only sixteen minutes and yet that incorporated company of mean men docked him for the lost time  i said i had the headache and so excused myself and went home  and on my diary i entered another night spoiled by this offensive loafer and a fervent curse was set down with it to keep the item company  and the very next day i packed up out of all patience and left the island  almost from the very beginning i regarded that man as a liar  the line of points represents an interval of years  at the end of which time the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be gratifyingly and remarkably endorsed and by wholly disinterested persons  the man markiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his own bedroom the doors and windows securely fastened on the inside dead and on his breast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging his friends to suspect no innocent person of having any thing to do with his death for that it was the work of his own hands entirely  yet the jury brought in the astounding verdict that deceased came to his death by the hands of some person or persons unknown  they explained that the perfectly undeviating consistency of markisss character for thirty years towered aloft as colossal and indestructible testimony that whatever statement he chose to make was entitled to instant and unquestioning acceptance as a lie  and they furthermore stated their belief that he was not dead and instanced the strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he was deadand beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long as possible which was done  and so in the tropical climate of lahaina the coffin stood open for seven days and then even the loyal jury gave him up  but they sat on him again and changed their verdict to suicide induced by mental aberrationbecause said they with penetration he said he was dead and he was dead and would he have told the truth if he had been in his right mind  no sir     chapter lxxviii  after half a years luxurious vagrancy in the islands i took shipping in a sailing vessel and regretfully returned to san franciscoa voyage in every way delightful but without an incident unless lying two long weeks in a dead calm eighteen hundred miles from the nearest land may rank as an incident  schools of whales grew so tame that day after day they played about the ship among the porpoises and the sharks without the least apparent fear of us and we pelted them with empty bottles for lack of better sport  twentyfour hours afterward these bottles would be still lying on the glassy water under our noses showing that the ship had not moved out of her place in all that time  the calm was absolutely breathless and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle for a whole day and part of a night we lay so close to another ship that had drifted to our vicinity that we carried on conversations with her passengers introduced each other by name and became pretty intimately acquainted with people we had never heard of before and have never heard of since  this was the only vessel we saw during the whole lonely voyage  we had fifteen passengers and to show how hard pressed they were at last for occupation and amusement i will mention that the gentlemen gave a good part of their time every day during the calm to trying to sit on an empty champagne bottle lying on its side and thread a needle without touching their heels to the deck or falling over and the ladies sat in the shade of the mainsail and watched the enterprise with absorbing interest  we were at sea five sundays and yet but for the almanac we never would have known but that all the other days were sundays too  i was home again in san francisco without means and without employment i tortured my brain for a saving scheme of some kind and at last a public lecture occurred to me  i sat down and wrote one in a fever of hopeful anticipation  i showed it to several friends but they all shook their heads  they said nobody would come to hear me and i would make a humiliating failure of it  they said that as i had never spoken in public i would break down in the delivery anyhow  i was disconsolate now  but at last an editor slapped me on the back and told me to go ahead  he said take the largest house in town and charge a dollar a ticket  the audacity of the proposition was charming it seemed fraught with practical worldly wisdom however  the proprietor of the several theatres endorsed the advice and said i might have his handsome new operahouse at half price fifty dollars  in sheer desperation i took iton credit for sufficient reasons  in three days i did a hundred and fifty dollars worth of printing and advertising and was the most distressed and frightened creature on the pacific coast  i could not sleepwho could under such circumstances  for other people there was facetiousness in the last line of my posters but to me it was plaintive with a pang when i wrote it             doors open at 7 12  the trouble will begin at 8  that line has done good service since  showmen have borrowed it frequently  i have even seen it appended to a newspaper advertisement reminding school pupils in vacation what time next term would begin  as those three days of suspense dragged by i grew more and more unhappy i had sold two hundred tickets among my personal friends but i feared they might not come  my lecture which had seemed humorous to me at first grew steadily more and more dreary till not a vestige of fun seemed left and i grieved that i could not bring a coffin on the stage and turn the thing into a funeral  i was so panicstricken at last that i went to three old friends giants in stature cordial by nature and stormyvoiced and said  this thing is going to be a failure the jokes in it are so dim that nobody will ever see them i would like to have you sit in the parquette and help me through  they said they would  then i went to the wife of a popular citizen and said that if she was willing to do me a very great kindness i would be glad if she and her husband would sit prominently in the lefthand stagebox where the whole house could see them  i explained that i should need help and would turn toward her and smile as a signal when i had been delivered of an obscure jokeand then i added dont wait to investigate but respond  she promised  down the street i met a man i never had seen before  he had been drinking and was beaming with smiles and good nature  he said  my names sawyer  you dont know me but that dont matter  i havent got a cent but if you knew how bad i wanted to laugh youd give me a ticket  come now what do you say  is your laugh hung on a hairtriggerthat is is it critical or can you get it off easy  my drawling infirmity of speech so affected him that he laughed a specimen or two that struck me as being about the article i wanted and i gave him a ticket and appointed him to sit in the second circle in the centre and be responsible for that division of the house  i gave him minute instructions about how to detect indistinct jokes and then went away and left him chuckling placidly over the novelty of the idea  i ate nothing on the last of the three eventful daysi only suffered i had advertised that on this third day the boxoffice would be opened for the sale of reserved seats  i crept down to the theater at four in the afternoon to see if any sales had been made  the ticket seller was gone the boxoffice was locked up  i had to swallow suddenly or my heart would have got out  no sales i said to myself i might have known it  i thought of suicide pretended illness flight  i thought of these things in earnest for i was very miserable and scared  but of course i had to drive them away and prepare to meet my fate  i could not wait for halfpast seveni wanted to face the horror and end it the feeling of many a man doomed to hang no doubt  i went down back streets at six oclock and entered the theatre by the back door i stumbled my way in the dark among the ranks of canvas scenery and stood on the stage  the house was gloomy and silent and its emptiness depressing  i went into the dark among the scenes again and for an hour and a half gave myself up to the horrors wholly unconscious of everything else  then i heard a murmur it rose higher and higher and ended in a crash mingled with cheers  it made my hair raise it was so close to me and so loud  there was a pause and then another presently came a third and before i well knew what i was about i was in the middle of the stage staring at a sea of faces bewildered by the fierce glare of the lights and quaking in every limb with a terror that seemed like to take my life away  the house was full aisles and all  the tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before i could gain any command over myself  then i recognized the charity and the friendliness in the faces before me and little by little my fright melted away and i began to talk within three or four minutes i was comfortable and even content  my three chief allies with three auxiliaries were on hand in the parquette all sitting together all armed with bludgeons and all ready to make an onslaught upon the feeblest joke that might show its head  and whenever a joke did fall their bludgeons came down and their faces seemed to split from ear to ear  sawyer whose hearty countenance was seen looming redly in the centre of the second circle took it up and the house was carried handsomely inferior jokes never fared so royally before  presently i delivered a bit of serious matter with impressive unction it was my pet and the audience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me more than any applause and as i dropped the last word of the clause i happened to turn and catch mrss intent and waiting eye my conversation with her flashed upon me and in spite of all i could do i smiled  she took it for the signal and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched off the whole audience and the explosion that followed was the triumph of the evening  i thought that that honest man sawyer would choke himself and as for the bludgeons they performed like piledrivers  but my poor little morsel of pathos was ruined  it was taken in good faith as an intentional joke and the prize one of the entertainment and i wisely let it go at that  all the papers were kind in the morning my appetite returned i had a abundance of money  alls well that ends well     chapter lxxix  i launched out as a lecturer now with great boldness  i had the field all to myself for public lectures were almost an unknown commodity in the pacific market  they are not so rare now i suppose  i took an old personal friend along to play agent for me and for two or three weeks we roamed through nevada and california and had a very cheerful time of it two days before i lectured in virginia city two stagecoaches were robbed within two miles of the town  the daring act was committed just at dawn by six masked men who sprang up alongside the coaches presented revolvers at the heads of the drivers and passengers and commanded a general dismount  everybody climbed down and the robbers took their watches and every cent they had  then they took gunpowder and blew up the express specie boxes and got their contents  the leader of the robbers was a small quickspoken man and the fame of his vigorous manner and his intrepidity was in everybodys mouth when we arrived  the night after instructing virginia i walked over the desolate divide and down to gold hill and lectured there  the lecture done i stopped to talk with a friend and did not start back till eleven  the divide was high unoccupied ground between the towns the scene of twenty midnight murders and a hundred robberies  as we climbed up and stepped out on this eminence the gold hill lights dropped out of sight at our backs and the night closed down gloomy and dismal  a sharp wind swept the place too and chilled our perspiring bodies through  i tell you i dont like this place at night said mike the agent  well dont speak so loud i said  you neednt remind anybody that we are here  just then a dim figure approached me from the direction of virginiaa man evidently  he came straight at me and i stepped aside to let him pass he stepped in the way and confronted me again  then i saw that he had a mask on and was holding something in my facei heard a clickclick and recognized a revolver in dim outline  i pushed the barrel aside with my hand and said  dont  he ejaculated sharply  your watch  your money  i said  you can have them with pleasurebut take the pistol away from my face please  it makes me shiver  no remarks  hand out your money  certainlyi  put up your hands  dont you go for a weapon  put em up  higher  i held them above my head  a pause  then  are you going to hand out your money or not  i dropped my hands to my pockets and said  certainly  i  put up your hands  do you want your head blown off  higher  i put them above my head again  another pause  are you going to hand out your money or not  ahahagain  put up your hands  by george you want the head shot off you awful bad  well friend im trying my best to please you  you tell me to give up my money and when i reach for it you tell me to put up my hands  if you would only  oh nowdont  all six of you at me  that other man will get away whilenow please take some of those revolvers out of my facedo if you please  every time one of them clicks my liver comes up into my throat  if you have a motherany of youor if any of you have ever had a motheror agrandmotheror a  cheese it  will you give up your money or have we got to  there therenone of that  put up your hands  gentlemeni know you are gentlemen by your  silence  if you want to be facetious young man there are times and places more fitting  this is a serious business  you prick the marrow of my opinion  the funerals i have attended in my time were comedies compared to it  now i think  curse your palaver  your moneyyour moneyyour money  holdput up your hands  gentlemen listen to reason  you see how i am situatednow dont put those pistols so closei smell the powder  you see how i am situated  if i had four handsso that i could hold up two and  throttle him  gag him  kill him  gentlemen dont  nobodys watching the other fellow  why dont some of you  ouch  take it away please  gentlemen you see that ive got to hold up my hands and so i cant take out my moneybut if youll be so kind as to take it out for me i will do as much for you some  search him beauregardand stop his jaw with a bullet quick if he wags it again  help beauregard stonewall  then three of them with the small spry leader adjourned to mike and fell to searching him  i was so excited that my lawless fancy tortured me to ask my two men all manner of facetious questions about their rebel brothergenerals of the south but considering the order they had received it was but common prudence to keep still  when everything had been taken from mewatch money and a multitude of trifles of small valuei supposed i was free and forthwith put my cold hands into my empty pockets and began an inoffensive jig to warm my feet and stir up some latent couragebut instantly all pistols were at my head and the order came again  they stood mike up alongside of me with strict orders to keep his hands above his head too and then the chief highwayman said  beauregard hide behind that boulder phil sheridan you hide behind that other one stonewall jackson put yourself behind that sagebush there  keep your pistols bearing on these fellows and if they take down their hands within ten minutes or move a single peg let them have it  then three disappeared in the gloom toward the several ambushes and the other three disappeared down the road toward virginia  it was depressingly still and miserably cold  now this whole thing was a practical joke and the robbers were personal friends of ours in disguise and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the whole operation listening  mike knew all this and was in the joke but i suspected nothing of it  to me it was most uncomfortably genuine when we had stood there in the middle of the road five minutes like a couple of idiots with our hands aloft freezing to death by inches mikes interest in the joke began to wane  he said  the times up now aint it  no you keep still  do you want to take any chances with these bloody savages  presently mike said  now the times up anyway  im freezing  well freeze  better freeze than carry your brains home in a basket maybe the time is up but how do we knowgot no watch to tell by i mean to give them good measure  i calculate to stand here fifteen minutes or die  dont you move  so without knowing it i was making one joker very sick of his contract when we took our arms down at last they were aching with cold and fatigue and when we went sneaking off the dread i was in that the time might not yet be up and that we would feel bullets in a moment was not sufficient to draw all my attention from the misery that racked my stiffened body  the joke of these highwayman friends of ours was mainly a joke upon themselves for they had waited for me on the cold hilltop two full hours before i came and there was very little fun in that they were so chilled that it took them a couple of weeks to get warm again  moreover i never had a thought that they would kill me to get money which it was so perfectly easy to get without any such folly and so they did not really frighten me bad enough to make their enjoyment worth the trouble they had taken  i was only afraid that their weapons would go off accidentally  their very numbers inspired me with confidence that no blood would be intentionally spilled  they were not smart they ought to have sent only one highwayman with a doublebarrelled shot gun if they desired to see the author of this volume climb a tree  however i suppose that in the long run i got the largest share of the joke at last and in a shape not foreseen by the highwaymen for the chilly exposure on the divide while i was in a perspiration gave me a cold which developed itself into a troublesome disease and kept my hands idle some three months besides costing me quite a sum in doctors bills since then i play no practical jokes on people and generally lose my temper when one is played upon me  when i returned to san francisco i projected a pleasure journey to japan and thence westward around the world but a desire to see home again changed my mind and i took a berth in the steamship bade goodbye to the friendliest land and livest heartiest community on our continent and came by the way of the isthmus to new yorka trip that was not much of a picnic excursion for the cholera broke out among us on the passage and we buried two or three bodies at sea every day  i found home a dreary place after my long absence for half the children i had known were now wearing whiskers or waterfalls and few of the grown people i had been acquainted with remained at their hearthstones prosperous and happysome of them had wandered to other scenes some were in jail and the rest had been hanged  these changes touched me deeply and i went away and joined the famous quaker city european excursion and carried my tears to foreign lands  thus after seven years of vicissitudes ended a pleasure trip to the silver mines of nevada which had originally been intended to occupy only three months  however i usually miss my calculations further than that   moral  if the reader thinks he is done now and that this book has no moral to it he is in error  the moral of it is this if you are of any account stay at home and make your way by faithful diligence but if you are no account go away from home and then you will have to work whether you want to or not  thus you become a blessing to your friends by ceasing to be a nuisance to themif the people you go among suffer by the operation     appendix a  brief sketch of mormon history  mormonism is only about forty years old but its career has been full of stir and adventure from the beginning and is likely to remain so to the end  its adherents have been hunted and hounded from one end of the country to the other and the result is that for years they have hated all gentiles indiscriminately and with all their might  joseph smith the finder of the book of mormon and founder of the religion was driven from state to state with his mysterious copperplates and the miraculous stones he read their inscriptions with  finally he instituted his church in ohio and brigham young joined it  the neighbors began to persecute and apostasy commenced  brigham held to the faith and worked hard  he arrested desertion  he did morehe added converts in the midst of the trouble  he rose in favor and importance with the brethren he was made one of the twelve apostles of the church  he shortly fought his way to a higher post and a more powerfulpresident of the twelve the neighbors rose up and drove the mormons out of ohio and they settled in missouri  brigham went with them  the missourians drove them out and they retreated to nauvoo illinois  they prospered there and built a temple which made some pretensions to architectural grace and achieved some celebrity in a section of country where a brick courthouse with a tin dome and a cupola on it was contemplated with reverential awe but the mormons were badgered and harried again by their neighbors all the proclamations joseph smith could issue denouncing polygamy and repudiating it as utterly antimormon were of no avail the people of the neighborhood on both sides of the mississippi claimed that polygamy was practised by the mormons and not only polygamy but a little of everything that was bad  brigham returned from a mission to england where he had established a mormon newspaper and he brought back with him several hundred converts to his preaching  his influence among the brethren augmented with every move he made  finally nauvoo was invaded by the missouri and illinois gentiles and joseph smith killed  a mormon named rigdon assumed the presidency of the mormon church and government in smiths place and even tried his hand at a prophecy or two  but a greater than he was at hand  brigham seized the advantage of the hour and without other authority than superior brain and nerve and will hurled rigdon from his high place and occupied it himself  he did more he launched an elaborate curse at rigdon and his disciples and he pronounced rigdons prophecies emanations from the devil and ended by handing the false prophet over to the buffetings of satan for a thousand yearsprobably the longest term ever inflicted in illinois  the people recognized their master  they straightway elected brigham young president by a prodigious majority and have never faltered in their devotion to him from that day to this  brigham had forecasta quality which no other prominent mormon has probably ever possessed he recognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than be moved by his command the people gathered together their meagre effects turned their backs upon their homes and their faces toward the wilderness and on a bitter night in february filed in sorrowful procession across the frozen mississippi lighted on their way by the glare from their burning temple whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired  they camped several days afterward on the western verge of iowa and poverty want hunger cold sickness grief and persecution did their work and many succumbed and diedmartyrs fair and true whatever else they might have been  two years the remnant remained there while brigham and a small party crossed the country and founded great salt lake city purposely choosing a land which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the hated american nation  note that  this was in 1847  brigham moved his people there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall again  for the war closed and mexico ceded brighams refuge to the enemythe united states  in 1849 the mormons organized a free and independent government and erected the state of deseret with brigham young as its head  but the very next year congress deliberately snubbed it and created the territory of utah out of the same accumulation of mountains sagebrush alkali and general desolationbut made brigham governor of it  then for years the enormous migration across the plains to california poured through the land of the mormons and yet the church remained staunch and true to its lord and master  neither hunger thirst poverty grief hatred contempt nor persecution could drive the mormons from their faith or their allegiance and even the thirst for gold which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many nations was not able to entice them  that was the final test  an experiment that could survive that was an experiment with some substance to it somewhere  great salt lake city throve finely and so did utah  one of the last things which brigham young had done before leaving iowa was to appear in the pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet smith and confer the prophetic succession with all its dignities emoluments and authorities upon president brigham young  the people accepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm and brighams power was sealed and secured for all time  within five years afterward he openly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a revelation which he pretended had been received nine years before by joseph smith albeit joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to the day of his death  now was brigham become a second andrew johnson in the small beginning and steady progress of his official grandeur  he had served successively as a disciple in the ranks home missionary foreign missionary editor and publisher apostle president of the board of apostles president of all mormondom civil and ecclesiastical successor to the great joseph by the will of heaven prophet seer revelator  there was but one dignity higher which he could aspire to and he reached out modestly and took thathe proclaimed himself a god  he claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter and that he will be its god and his wives and children its goddesses princes and princesses  into it all faithful mormons will be admitted with their families and will take rank and consequence according to the number of their wives and children  if a disciple dies before he has had time to accumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in the next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children for him after he is dead and they are duly credited to his account and his heavenly status advanced accordingly  let it be borne in mind that the majority of the mormons have always been ignorant simple of an inferior order of intellect unacquainted with the world and its ways and let it be borne in mind that the wives of these mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their children likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction and then let it be remembered that for forty years these creatures have been driven driven driven relentlessly  and mobbed beaten and shot down cursed despised expatriated banished to a remote desert whither they journeyed gaunt with famine and disease disturbing the ancient solitudes with their lamentations and marking the long way with graves of their deadand all because they were simply trying to live and worship god in the way which they believed with all their hearts and souls to be the true one  let all these things be borne in mind and then it will not be hard to account for the deathless hatred which the mormons bear our people and our government  that hatred has fed fat its ancient grudge ever since mormon utah developed into a selfsupporting realm and the church waxed rich and strong  brigham as territorial governor made it plain that mormondom was for the mormons  the united states tried to rectify all that by appointing territorial officers from new england and other antimormon localities but brigham prepared to make their entrance into his dominions difficult  three thousand united states troops had to go across the plains and put these gentlemen in office  and after they were in office they were as helpless as so many stone images  they made laws which nobody minded and which could not be executed  the federal judges opened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday spectacles for insolent crowds to gape atfor there was nothing to try nothing to do nothing on the dockets  and if a gentile brought a suit the mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict and when the judgment of the court was rendered no mormon cared for it and no officer could execute it  our presidents shipped one cargo of officials after another to utah but the result was always the samethey sat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day by day they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its reward in darker and darker looks and in secret threats and warnings of a more and more dismal natureand at last they either succumbed and became despised tools and toys of the mormons or got scared and discomforted beyond all endurance and left the territory  if a brave officer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven some pliant buchanan or pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place in 1857 general harney came very near being appointed governor of utah and so it came very near being harney governor and cradlebaugh judge two men who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky comprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the dictionary  simply if for nothing else for the variety they would have made in a rather monotonous history of federal servility and helplessness it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together in utah  up to the date of our visit to utah such had been the territorial record  the territorial government established there had been a hopeless failure and brigham young was the only real power in the land  he was an absolute monarcha monarch who defied our presidenta monarch who laughed at our armies when they camped about his capitala monarch who received without emotion the news that the august congress of the united states had enacted a solemn law against polygamy and then went forth calmly and married twentyfive or thirty more wives     b the mountain meadows massacre  the persecutions which the mormons suffered so longand which they consider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern themselves they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay  the now almost forgotten mountain meadows massacre was their work  it was very famous in its day  the whole united states rang with its horrors  a few items will refresh the readers memory  a great emigrant train from missouri and arkansas passed through salt lake city and a few disaffected mormons joined it for the sake of the strong protection it afforded for their escape  in that matter lay sufficient cause for hot retaliation by the mormon chiefs  besides these one hundred and fortyfive or one hundred and fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from arkansas where a noted mormon missionary had lately been killed and in part from missouri a state remembered with execrations as a bitter persecutor of the saints when they were few and poor and friendless here were substantial additional grounds for lack of love for these wayfarers and finally this train was rich very rich in cattle horses mules and other propertyand how could the mormons consistently keep up their coveted resemblance to the israelitish tribes and not seize the spoil of an enemy when the lord had so manifestly delivered it into their hand  wherefore according to mrs c v waites entertaining book the mormon prophet it transpired that  a revelation from brigham young as great grand archee or god was dispatched to president j c haight bishop higbee and j d lee adopted son of brigham commanding them to raise all the forces they could muster and trust follow those cursed gentiles so read the revelation attack them disguised as indians and with the arrows of the almighty make a clean sweep of them and leave none to tell the tale and if they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the indians as their allies promising them a share of the booty  they were to be neither slothful nor negligent in their duty and to be punctual in sending the teams back to him before winter set in for this was the mandate of almighty god  the command of the revelation was faithfully obeyed  a large party of mormons painted and tricked out as indians overtook the train of emigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of salt lake city and made an attack  but the emigrants threw up earthworks made fortresses of their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for five days  your missouri or arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the sort of scurvy apologies for indians which the southern part of utah affords  he would stand up and fight five hundred of them  at the end of the five days the mormons tried military strategy  they retired to the upper end of the meadows resumed civilized apparel washed off their paint and then heavily armed drove down in wagons to the beleaguered emigrants bearing a flag of truce  when the emigrants saw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with cheer after cheer  and all unconscious of the poetry of it no doubt they lifted a little child aloft dressed in white in answer to the flag of truce  the leaders of the timely white deliverers were president haight and bishop john d lee of the mormon church  mr cradlebaugh who served a term as a federal judge in utah and afterward was sent to congress from nevada tells in a speech delivered in congress how these leaders next proceeded  they professed to be on good terms with the indians and represented them as being very mad  they also proposed to intercede and settle the matter with the indians  after several hours parley they having apparently visited the indians gave the ultimatum of the savages which was that the emigrants should march out of their camp leaving everything behind them even their guns  it was promised by the mormon bishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to the settlements  the terms were agreed to the emigrants being desirous of saving the lives of their families  the mormons retired and subsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men  the emigrants were marched out the women and children in front and the men behind the mormon guard being in the rear  when they had marched in this way about a mile at a given signal the slaughter commenced  the men were almost all shot down at the first fire from the guard  two only escaped who fled to the desert and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before they were overtaken and slaughtered  the women and children ran on two or three hundred yards further when they were overtaken and with the aid of the indians they were slaughtered  seventeen individuals only of all the emigrant party were spared and they were little children the eldest of them being only seven years old  thus on the 10th day of september 1857 was consummated one of the most cruel cowardly and bloody murders known in our history  the number of persons butchered by the mormons on this occasion was one hundred and twenty  with unheardof temerity judge cradlebaugh opened his court and proceeded to make mormondom answer for the massacre  and what a spectacle it must have been to see this grim veteran solitary and alone in his pride and his pluck glowering down on his mormon jury and mormon auditory deriding them by turns and by turns breathing threatenings and slaughter  an editorial in the territorial enterprise of that day says of him and of the occasion  he spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a jackson but the jury failed to indict or even report on the charges while threats of violence were heard in every quarter and an attack on the us troops intimated if he persisted in his course  finding that nothing could be done with the juries they were discharged with a scathing rebuke from the judge  and then sitting as a committing magistrate he commenced his task alone  he examined witnesses made arrests in every quarter and created a consternation in the camps of the saints greater than any they had ever witnessed before since mormondom was born  at last accounts terrified elders and bishops were decamping to save their necks and developments of the most starling character were being made implicating the highest church dignitaries in the many murders and robberies committed upon the gentiles during the past eight years  had harney been governor cradlebaugh would have been supported in his work and the absolute proofs adduced by him of mormon guilt in this massacre and in a number of previous murders would have conferred gratuitous coffins upon certain citizens together with occasion to use them  but cumming was the federal governor and he under a curious pretense of impartiality sought to screen the mormons from the demands of justice  on one occasion he even went so far as to publish his protest against the use of the us troops in aid of cradlebaughs proceedings  mrs c v waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre with the following remark and accompanying summary of the testimonyand the summary is concise accurate and reliable  for the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of young and his mormons in this transaction the testimony is here collated and circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to fasten conviction upon them by confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ  1  the evidence of mormons themselves engaged in the affair as shown by the statements of judge cradlebaugh and deputy us  marshall rodgers  2  the failure of brigham young to embody any account of it in his report as superintendent of indian affairs  also his failure to make any allusion to it whatever from the pulpit until several years after the occurrence  3  the flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the mormon church and state when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a judicial investigation  4  the failure of the deseret news the church organ and the only paper then published in the territory to notice the massacre until several months afterward and then only to deny that mormons were engaged in it  5  the testimony of the children saved from the massacre  6  the children and the property of the emigrants found in possession of the mormons and that possession traced back to the very day after the massacre  7  the statements of indians in the neighborhood of the scene of the massacre these statements are shown not only by cradlebaugh and rodgers but by a number of military officers and by j forney who was in 1859 superintendent of indian affairs for the territory  to all these were such statements freely and frequently made by the indians  8  the testimony of r p campbell capt  2d dragoons who was sent in the spring of 1859 to santa clara to protect travelers on the road to california and to inquire into indian depredations     c concerning a frightful assassination that was never consummated  if ever there was a harmless man it is conrad wiegand of gold hill nevada  if ever there was a gentle spirit that thought itself unfired gunpowder and latent ruin it is conrad wiegand  if ever there was an oyster that fancied itself a whale or a jackolantern confined to a swamp that fancied itself a planet with a billionmile orbit or a summer zephyr that deemed itself a hurricane it is conrad wiegand therefore what wonder is it that when he says a thing he thinks the world listens that when he does a thing the world stands still to look and that when he suffers there is a convulsion of nature  when i met conrad he was superintendent of the gold hill assay officeand he was not only its superintendent but its entire force  and he was a street preacher too with a mongrel religion of his own invention whereby he expected to regenerate the universe  this was years ago  here latterly he has entered journalism and his journalism is what it might be expected to be colossal to ear but pigmy to the eye  it is extravagant grandiloquence confined to a newspaper about the size of a double letter sheet  he doubtless edits sets the type and prints his paper all alone but he delights to speak of the concern as if it occupies a block and employs a thousand men  something less than two years ago conrad assailed several people mercilessly in his little peoples tribune and got himself into trouble  straightway he airs the affair in the territorial enterprise in a communication over his own signature and i propose to reproduce it here in all its native simplicity and more than human candor  long as it is it is well worth reading for it is the richest specimen of journalistic literature the history of america can furnish perhaps  from the territorial enterprise jan 20 1870  seeming plot for assassination miscarried  to the editor of the enterprise months ago when mr sutro incidentally exposed mining management on the comstock and among others roused me to protest against its continuance in great kindness you warned me that any attempt by publications by public meetings and by legislative action aimed at the correction of chronic mining evils in storey county must entail upon me a business ruin b the burden of all its costs c personal violence and if my purpose were persisted in then d assassination and after all nothing would be effected  your prophecy fulfilling in large part at least your prophecies have been fulfilled for a assaying which was well attended to in the gold hill assay office of which i am superintendent in consequence of my publications has been taken elsewhere so the president of one of the companies assures me with no reason assigned other work has been taken away  with but one or two important exceptions our assay business now consists simply of the gleanings of the vicinity  b though my own personal donations to the peoples tribune association have already exceeded 1500 outside of our own numbers we have received in money less than 300 as contributions and subscriptions for the journal  c on thursday last on the main street in gold hill near noon with neither warning nor cause assigned by a powerful blow i was felled to the ground and while down i was kicked by a man who it would seem had been led to believe that i had spoken derogatorily of him  by whom he was so induced to believe i am as yet unable to say  on saturday last i was again assailed and beaten by a man who first informed me why he did so and who persisted in making his assault even after the erroneous impression under which he also was at first laboring had been clearly and repeatedly pointed out  this same man after failing through intimidation to elicit from me the names of our editorial contributors against giving which he knew me to be pledged beat himself weary upon me with a raw hide i not resisting and then pantingly threatened me with permanent disfiguring mayhem if ever again i should introduce his name into print and who but a few minutes before his attack upon me assured me that the only reason i was permitted to reach home alive on wednesday evening last at which time the peoples tribune was issued was that he deems me only halfwitted and be it remembered the very next morning i was knocked down and kicked by a man who seemed to be prepared for flight  he sees doom impending  when will the circle join how long before the whole of your prophecy will be fulfilled i cannot say but under the shadow of so much fulfillment in so short a time and with such threats from a man who is one of the most prominent exponents of the san francisco miningring staring me and this whole community defiantly in the face and pointing to a completion of your augury do you blame me for feeling that this communication is the last i shall ever write for the press especially when a sense alike of personal selfrespect of duty to this moneyoppressed and fearridden community and of american fealty to the spirit of true liberty all command me and each more loudly than love of life itself to declare the name of that prominent man to be john b winters president of the yellow jacket company a political aspirant and a military general  the name of his partially duped accomplice and abettor in this last marvelous assault is no other than philip lynch editor and proprietor of the gold hill news  despite the insult and wrong heaped upon me by john b winters on saturday afternoon only a glimpse of which i shall be able to afford your readers so much do i deplore clinching by publicity a serious mistake of any one man or woman committed under natural and not selfwrought passion in view of his great apparent excitement at the time and in view of the almost perfect privacy of the assault i am far from sure that i should not have given him space for repentance before exposing him were it not that he himself has so far exposed the matter as to make it the common talk of the town that he has horsewhipped me that fact having been made public all the facts in connection need to be also or silence on my part would seem more than singular and with many would be proof either that i was conscious of some unworthy aim in publishing the article or else that my noncombatant principles are but a convenient cloak alike of physical and moral cowardice  i therefore shall try to present a graphic but truthful picture of this whole affair but shall forbear all comments presuming that the editors of our own journal if others do not will speak freely and fittingly upon this subject in our next number whether i shall then be dead or living for my death will not stop though it may suspend the publication of the peoples tribune the noncombatant sticks to principle but takes along a friend or two of a conveniently different stripe  the trap set on saturday morning john b winters sent verbal word to the gold hill assay office that he desired to see me at the yellow jacket office though such a request struck me as decidedly cool in view of his own recent discourtesies to me there alike as a publisher and as a stockholder in the yellow jacket mine and though it seemed to me more like a summons than the courteous request by one gentleman to another for a favor hoping that some conference with sharon looking to the betterment of mining matters in nevada might arise from it i felt strongly inclined to overlook what possibly was simply an oversight in courtesy  but as then it had only been two days since i had been bruised and beaten under a hasty and false apprehension of facts my caution was somewhat aroused  moreover i remembered sensitively his contemptuousness of manner to me at my last interview in his office  i therefore felt it needful if i went at all to go accompanied by a friend whom he would not dare to treat with incivility and whose presence with me might secure exemption from insult  accordingly i asked a neighbor to accompany me  the trap almost detected although i was not then aware of this fact it would seem that previous to my request this same neighbor had heard dr zabriskie state publicly in a saloon that mr winters had told him he had decided either to kill or to horsewhip me but had not finally decided on which  my neighbor therefore felt unwilling to go down with me until he had first called on mr winters alone  he therefore paid him a visit  from that interview he assured me that he gathered the impression that he did not believe i would have any difficulty with mr winters and that he winters would call on me at four oclock in my own office  my own precautions as sheriff cummings was in gold hill that afternoon and as i desired to converse with him about the previous assault i invited him to my office and he came  although a half hour had passed beyond four oclock mr winters had not called and we both of us began preparing to go home just then philip lynch publisher of the gold hill news came in and said blandly and cheerily as if bringing good news  hello john b winters wants to see you  i replied indeed  why he sent me word that he would call on me here this afternoon at four oclock  o well it dont do to be too ceremonious just now hes in my office and that will do as wellcome on in winters wants to consult with you alone  hes got something to say to you  though slightly uneasy at this change of programme yet believing that in an editors house i ought to be safe and anyhow that i would be within hail of the street i hurriedly and but partially whispered my dim apprehensions to mr cummings and asked him if he would not keep near enough to hear my voice in case i should call  he consented to do so while waiting for some other parties and to come in if he heard my voice or thought i had need of protection  on reaching the editorial part of the news office which viewed from the street is dark i did not see mr winters and again my misgivings arose had i paused long enough to consider the case i should have invited sheriff cummings in but as lynch went down stairs he said this way wiegandits best to be private or some such remark  i do not desire to strain the readers fancy hurtfully and yet it would be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle or the duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committeem  t  i followed and without mr cummings and without arms which i never do or will carry unless as a soldier in war or unless i should yet come to feel i must fight a duel or to join and aid in the ranks of a necessary vigilance committee  but by following i made a fatal mistake  following was entering a trap and whatever animal suffers itself to be caught should expect the common fate of a caged rat as i fear events to come will prove  traps commonly are not set for benevolence his bodyguard is shut out  the trap inside i followed lynch down stairs  at their foot a door to the left opened into a small room  from that room another door opened into yet another room and once entered i found myself inveigled into what many will ever henceforth regard as a private subterranean gold hill den admirably adapted in proper hands to the purposes of murder raw or disguised for from it with both or even one door closed when too late i saw that i could not be heard by sheriff cummings and from it by violence and by force i was prevented from making a peaceable exit when i thought i saw the studious object of this consultation was no other than to compass my killing in the presence of philip lynch as a witness as soon as by insult a proverbially excitable man should be exasperated to the point of assailing mr winters so that mr lynch by his conscience and by his well known tenderness of heart toward the rich and potent would be compelled to testify that he saw gen john b winters kill conrad wiegand in selfdefence  but i am going too fast  our host mr lynch was present during the most of the time say a little short of an hour but three times he left the room  his testimony therefore would be available only as to the bulk of what transpired  on entering this carpeted den i was invited to a seat near one corner of the room mr lynch took a seat near the window  j b winters sat at first near the door and began his remarks essentially as follows  i have come here to exact of you a retraction in black and white of those damnably false charges which you have preferred against me in thatinfamous lying sheet of yours and you must declare yourself their author that you published them knowing them to be false and that your motives were malicious  hold mr winters  your language is insulting and your demand an enormity  i trust i was not invited here either to be insulted or coerced  i supposed myself here by invitation of mr lynch at your request  nor did i come here to insult you  i have already told you that i am here for a very different purpose  yet your language has been offensive and even now shows strong excitement  if insult is repeated i shall either leave the room or call in sheriff cummings whom i just left standing and waiting for me outside the door  no you wont sir  you may just as well understand it at once as not here you are my man and ill tell you why  months ago you put your property out of your hands boasting that you did so to escape losing it on prosecution for libel  it is true that i did convert all my immovable property into personal property such as i could trust safely to others and chiefly to escape ruin through possible libel suits  very good sir  having placed yourself beyond the pale of the law may god help your soul if you dont make precisely such a retraction as i have demanded  ive got you now and bybefore you can get out of this room youve got to both write and sign precisely the retraction i have demanded and before you go anyhowyoulowlivedlying ill teach you what personal responsibility is outside of the law and by sheriff cummings and all the friends youve got in the world besides cant save you you etc  no sir  im alone now and im prepared to be shot down just here and now rather than be villified by you as i have been and suffer you to escape me after publishing those charges not only here where i am known and universally respected but where i am not personally known and may be injured  i confess this speech with its terrible and but too plainly implied threat of killing me if i did not sign the paper he demanded terrified me especially as i saw he was working himself up to the highest possible pitch of passion and instinct told me that any reply other than one of seeming concession to his demands would only be fuel to a raging fire so i replied  well if ive got to sign and then i paused some time  resuming i said but mr winters you are greatly excited  besides i see you are laboring under a total misapprehension  it is your duty not to inflame but to calm yourself  i am prepared to show you if you will only point out the article that you allude to that you regard as charges what no calm and logical mind has any right to regard as such show me the charges and i will try at all events and if it becomes plain that no charges have been preferred then plainly there can be nothing to retract and no one could rightly urge you to demand a retraction  you should beware of making so serious a mistake for however honest a man may be every one is liable to misapprehend besides you assume that i am the author of some certain article which you have not pointed out  it is hasty to do so  he then pointed to some numbered paragraphs in a tribune article headed whats the matter with yellow jacket saying thats what i refer to  to gain time for general reflection and resolution i took up the paper and looked it over for awhile he remaining silent and as i hoped cooling  i then resumed saying as i supposed  i do not admit having written that article nor have you any right to assume so important a point and then base important action upon your assumption  you might deeply regret it afterwards  in my published address to the people i notified the world that no information as to the authorship of any article would be given without the consent of the writer  i therefore cannot honorably tell you who wrote that article nor can you exact it  if you are not the author then i do demand to know who is  i must decline to say  then by i brand you as its author and shall treat you accordingly  passing that point the most important misapprehension which i notice is that you regard them as charges at all when their context both at their beginning and end show they are not  these words introduce them such an investigation just before indicated we think might result in showing some of the following points then follow eleven specifications and the succeeding paragraph shows that the suggested investigation might exonerate those who are generally believed guilty you see therefore the context proves they are not preferred as charges and this you seem to have overlooked  while making those comments mr winters frequently interrupted me in such a way as to convince me that he was resolved not to consider candidly the thoughts contained in my words  he insisted upon it that they were charges and by he would make me take them back as charges and he referred the question to philip lynch to whom i then appealed as a literary man as a logician and as an editor calling his attention especially to the introductory paragraph just before quoted he replied if they are not charges they certainly are insinuations whereupon mr winters renewed his demands for retraction precisely such as he had before named except that he would allow me to state who did write the article if i did not myself and this time shaking his fist in my face with more cursings and epithets  when he threatened me with his clenched fist instinctively i tried to rise from my chair but winters then forcibly thrust me down as he did every other time at least seven or eight when under similar imminent danger of bruising by his fist or for aught i could know worse than that after the first stunning blow which he could easily and safely to himself have dealt me so long as he kept me down and stood over me  this fact it was which more than anything else convinced me that by plan and plot i was purposely made powerless in mr winters hands and that he did not mean to allow me that advantage of being afoot which he possessed  moreover i then became convinced that philip lynch and for what reason i wondered would do absolutely nothing to protect me in his own house  i realized then the situation thoroughly  i had found it equally vain to protest or argue and i would make no unmanly appeal for pity still less apologize  yet my life had been by the plainest possible implication threatened  i was a weak man  i was unarmed  i was helplessly down and winters was afoot and probably armed  lynch was the only witness  the statements demanded if given and not explained would utterly sink me in my own selfrespect in my familys eyes and in the eyes of the community  on the other hand should i give the authors name how could i ever expect that confidence of the people which i should no longer deserve and how much dearer to me and to my family was my life than the life of the real author to his friends  yet life seemed dear and each minute that remained seemed precious if not solemn  i sincerely trust that neither you nor any of your readers and especially none with families may ever be placed in such seeming direct proximity to death while obliged to decide the one question i was compelled to viz what should i doi a man of family and not as mr winters is alone the reader is requested not to skip the followingm  t  strategy and mesmerism to gain time for further reflection and hoping that by a seeming acquiescence i might regain my personal liberty at least till i could give an alarm or take advantage of some momentary inadvertence of winters and then without a cowardly flight escape i resolved to write a certain kind of retraction but previously had inwardly decided  firstthat i would studiously avoid every action which might be construed into the drawing of a weapon even by a selfinfuriated man no matter what amount of insult might be heaped upon me for it seemed to me that this great excess of compound profanity foulness and epithet must be more than a mere indulgence and therefore must have some object surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird  therefore as before without thought i thereafter by intent kept my hands away from my pockets and generally in sight and spread upon my knees  secondi resolved to make no motion with my arms or hands which could possibly be construed into aggression  thirdi resolved completely to govern my outward manner and suppress indignation  to do this i must govern my spirit  to do that by force of imagination i was obliged like actors on the boards to resolve myself into an unnatural mental state and see all things through the eyes of an assumed character  fourthi resolved to try on winters silently and unconsciously to himself a mesmeric power which i possess over certain kinds of people and which at times i have found to work even in the dark over the lower animals  does any one smile at these last counts  god save you from ever being obliged to beat in a game of chess whose stake is your life you having but four poor pawns and pieces and your adversary with his full force unshorn  but if you are provided you have any strength with breadth of will do not despair  though mesmeric power may not save you it may help you try it at all events  in this instance i was conscious of power coming into me and by a law of nature i know winters was correspondingly weakened  if i could have gained more time i am sure he would not even have struck me  it takes time both to form such resolutions and to recite them  that time however i gained while thinking of my retraction which i first wrote in pencil altering it from time to time till i got it to suit me my aim being to make it look like a concession to demands while in fact it should tersely speak the truth into mr winters mind  when it was finished i copied it in ink and if correctly copied from my first draft it should read as follows  in copying i do not think i made any material change  copy to philip lynch editor of the gold hill news i learn that gen john b winters believes the following pasted on clipping from the peoples tribune of january to contain distinct charges of mine against him personally and that as such he desires me to retract them unqualifiedly  in compliance with his request permit me to say that although mr winters and i see this matter differently in view of his strong feelings in the premises i hereby declare that i do not know those charges if such they are to be true and i hope that a critical examination would altogether disprove them                               conrad wiegand                          gold hill january 15 1870   i then read what i had written and handed it to mr lynch whereupon mr winters said  thats not satisfactory and it wont do and then addressing himself to mr lynch he further said how does it strike you  well i confess i dont see that it retracts anything  nor do i said winters in fact i regard it as adding insult to injury  mr wiegand youve got to do better than that  you are not the man who can pull wool over my eyes  that sir is the only retraction i can write  no it isnt sir and if you so much as say so again you do it at your peril for ill thrash you to within an inch of your life and by sir i dont pledge myself to spare you even that inch either  i want you to understand i have asked you for a very different paper and that paper youve got to sign  mr winters i assure you that i do not wish to irritate you but at the same time it is utterly impossible for me to write any other paper than that which i have written  if you are resolved to compel me to sign something philip lynchs hand must write at your dictation and if when written i can sign it i will do so but such a document as you say you must have from me i never can sign  i mean what i say  well sir whats to be done must be done quickly for ive been here long enough already  ill put the thing in another shape and then pointing to the paper dont you know those charges to be false  i do not  do you know them to be true  of my own personal knowledge i do not  why then did you print them  because rightly considered in their connection they are not charges but pertinent and useful suggestions in answer to the queries of a correspondent who stated facts which are inexplicable  dont you know that i know they are false  if you do the proper course is simply to deny them and court an investigation  and do you claim the right to make me come out and deny anything you may choose to write and print  to that question i think i made no reply and he then further said  come now weve talked about the matter long enough  i want your final answerdid you write that article or not  i cannot in honor tell you who wrote it  did you not see it before it was printed  most certainly sir  and did you deem it a fit thing to publish  most assuredly sir or i would never have consented to its appearance of its authorship i can say nothing whatever but for its publication i assume full sole and personal responsibility  and do you then retract it or not  mr winters if my refusal to sign such a paper as you have demanded must entail upon me all that your language in this room fairly implies then i ask a few minutes for prayer  prayeryou this is not your hour for prayeryour time to pray was when you were writing thoselying charges  will you sign or not  you already have my answer  what  do you still refuse  i do sir  take that then and to my amazement and inexpressible relief he drew only a rawhide instead of what i expecteda bludgeon or pistol  with it as he spoke he struck at my left ear downwards as if to tear it off and afterwards on the side of the head  as he moved away to get a better chance for a more effective shot for the first time i gained a chance under peril to rise and i did so pitying him from the very bottom of my soul to think that one so naturally capable of true dignity power and nobility could by the temptations of this state and by unfortunate associations and aspirations be so deeply debased as to find in such brutality anything which he could call satisfactionbut the great hope for us all is in progress and growth and john b  winters i trust will yet be able to comprehend my feelings  he continued to beat me with all his great force until absolutely weary exhausted and panting for breath  i still adhered to my purpose of nonaggressive defence and made no other use of my arms than to defend my head and face from further disfigurement  the mere pain arising from the blows he inflicted upon my person was of course transient and my clothing to some extent deadened its severity as it now hides all remaining traces  when i supposed he was through taking the butt end of his weapon and shaking it in my face he warned me if i correctly understood him of more yet to come and furthermore said if ever i again dared introduce his name to print in either my own or any other public journal he would cut off my left ear and i do not think he was jesting and send me home to my family a visibly mutilated man to be a standing warning to all lowlived puppies who seek to blackmail gentlemen and to injure their good names  and when he did so operate he informed me that his implement would not be a whip but a knife  when he had said this unaccompanied by mr lynch as i remember it he left the room for i sat down by mr lynch exclaiming the man is mad he is utterly madthis step is his ruinit is a mistakeit would be ungenerous in me despite of all the ill usage i have here received to expose him at least until he has had an opportunity to reflect upon the matter  i shall be in no haste  winters is very mad just now replied mr lynch but when he is himself he is one of the finest men i ever met  in fact he told me the reason he did not meet you upstairs was to spare you the humiliation of a beating in the sight of others  i submit that that unguarded remark of philip lynch convicts him of having been privy in advance to mr winters intentions whatever they may have been or at least to his meaning to make an assault upon me but i leave to others to determine how much censure an editor deserves for inveigling a weak noncombatant man also a publisher to a pen of his own to be horsewhipped if no worse for the simple printing of what is verbally in the mouth of nine out of ten men and women too upon the street  while writing this account two theories have occurred to me as possibly true respecting this most remarkable assault  firstthe aim may have been simply to extort from me such admissions as in the hands of money and influence would have sent me to the penitentiary for libel  this however seems unlikely because any statements elicited by fear or force could not be evidence in law or could be so explained as to have no force  the statements wanted so badly must have been desired for some other purpose  secondthe other theory has so dark and wilfully murderous a look that i shrink from writing it yet as in all probability my death at the earliest practicable moment has already been decreed i feel i should do all i can before my hour arrives at least to show others how to break up that aristocratic rule and combination which has robbed all nevada of true freedom if not of manhood itself  although i do not prefer this hypothesis as a charge i feel that as an american citizen i still have a right both to think and to speak my thoughts even in the land of sharon and winters and as much so respecting the theory of a brutal assault especially when i have been its subject as respecting any other apparent enormity  i give the matter simply as a suggestion which may explain to the proper authorities and to the people whom they should represent a well ascertained but notwithstanding a darkly mysterious fact  the scheme of the assault may have been  firstto terrify me by making me conscious of my own helplessness after making actual though not legal threats against my life  secondto imply that i could save my life only by writing or signing certain specific statements which if not subsequently explained would eternally have branded me as infamous and would have consigned my family to shame and want and to the dreadful compassion and patronage of the rich  thirdto blow my brains out the moment i had signed thereby preventing me from making any subsequent explanation such as could remove the infamy  fourthphilip lynch to be compelled to testify that i was killed by john b  winters in selfdefence for the conviction of winters would bring him in as an accomplice  if that was the programme in john b  winters mind nothing saved my life but my persistent refusal to sign when that refusal seemed clearly to me to be the choice of death  the remarkable assertion made to me by mr winters that pity only spared my life on wednesday evening last almost compels me to believe that at first he could not have intended me to leave that room alive and why i was allowed to unless through mesmeric or some other invisible influence i cannot divine  the more i reflect upon this matter the more probable as true does this horrible interpretation become  the narration of these things i might have spared both to mr winters and to the public had he himself observed silence but as he has both verbally spoken and suffered a thoroughly garbled statement of facts to appear in the gold hill news i feel it due to myself no less than to this community and to the entire independent press of america and great britain to give a true account of what even the gold hill news has pronounced a disgraceful affair and which it deeply regrets because of some alleged telegraphic mistake in the account of it  who received the erroneous telegrams  though he may not deem it prudent to take my life just now the publication of this article i feel sure must compel gen winters with his peculiar views about his right to exemption from criticism by me to resolve on my violent death though it may take years to compass it notwithstanding i bear him no ill will and if w c ralston and william sharon and other members of the san francisco mining and milling ring feel that he above all other men in this state and california is the most fitting man to supervise and control yellow jacket matters until i am able to vote more than half their stock i presume he will be retained to grace his present post  meantime i cordially invite all who know of any sort of important villainy which only can be cured by exposure and who would expose it if they felt sure they would not be betrayed under bullying threats to communicate with the peoples tribune for until i am murdered so long as i can raise the means to publish i propose to continue my efforts at least to revive the liberties of the state to curb oppression and to benefit mans world and gods earth                                conrad wiegand   it does seem a pity that the sheriff was shut out since the good sense of a general of militia and of a prominent editor failed to teach them that the merited castigation of this weak halfwitted child was a thing that ought to have been done in the street where the poor thing could have a chance to run  when a journalist maligns a citizen or attacks his good name on hearsay evidence he deserves to be thrashed for it even if he is a noncombatant weakling but a generous adversary would at least allow such a lamb the use of his legs at such a timem  t
