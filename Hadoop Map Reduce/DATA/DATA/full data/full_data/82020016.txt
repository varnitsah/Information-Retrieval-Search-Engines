semaphore  an esmeralda of rocky canyon  dick spindlers family christmas  when the waters were up at jules  the boom in the calaveras clarion  the secret of sobrientes well  liberty joness discovery     mr jack hamlins mediation   at nightfall it began to rain the wind arose too and also began to buffet a small struggling nondescript figure creeping along the trail over the rocky upland meadow towards rylandss rancho at times its head was hidden in what appeared to be wings thrown upward from its shoulders at times its broadbrimmed hat was cocked jauntily on one side and again the brim was fixed over the face like a visor at one moment a drifting misshapen mass of drapery at the next its vague garments beaten back hard against the figure revealed outlines far too delicate for that rude enwrapping for it was mrs rylands herself in her husbands hat and her hired mans old blue army overcoat returning from the postoffice two miles away the wind continued its aggression until she reached the front door of her newly plastered farmhouse and then a heavier blast shook the pines above the lowpitched shingled roof and sent a shower of arrowy drops after her like a parthian parting as she entered she threw aside the overcoat and hat and somewhat inconsistently entered the sittingroom to walk to the window and look back upon the path she had just traversed the wind and the rain swept down a slope half meadow half clearinga mile awayto a fringe of sycamores a mile further lay the stage road where three hours later her husband would alight on his return from sacramento it would be a long wet walk for joshua rylands as their only horse had been borrowed by a neighbor  in that fading light mrs rylandss oval cheek was shining still from the raindrops but there was something in the expression of her worried face that might have as readily suggested tears she was strikingly handsome yet quite as incongruous an ornament to her surroundings as she had been to her outer wrappings a moment ago even the clothes she now stood in hinted an inadaptibility to the weatherthe housethe position she occupied in it a figured silk dress spoiled rather than overworn was still of a quality inconsistent with her evident habits and the laceedged petticoat that peeped beneath it was draggled with mud and unaccustomed usage her glossy black hair which had been tossed into curls in some foreign fashion was now windblown into a burlesque of it this incongruity was still further accented by the appearance of the room she had entered it was coldly and severely furnished making the chill of the yet damp white plaster unpleasantly obvious a black harmonium organ stood in one corner set out with black and white hymnbooks a trestlelike table contained a large bible half a dozen black horsehaircushioned chairs stood geometrically distant against the walls from which hung four engravings of paradise lost in black mourning frames some dried ferns and autumn leaves stood in a vase on the mantelpiece as if the chill of the room had prematurely blighted them the coldly glittering grate below was also decorated with withered sprays as if an attempt had been made to burn them but was frustrated through damp suddenly recalled to a sense of her wet boots and the new carpet she hurriedly turned away crossed the hall into the diningroom and thence passed into the kitchen the hired girl a largeboned missourian a daughter of a neighboring woodman was peeling potatoes at the table mrs rylands drew a chair before the kitchen stove and put her wet feet on the hob  ill bet a cooky mess rylands youve done forgot the vanillar said the girl with a certain domestic and confidential familiarity  mrs rylands started guiltily she made a miserable feint of looking in her lap and on the table im afraid i did jane if i didnt bring it in here  that you didnt returned jane and i reckon ye forgot that ar peppersauce for yer husband  mrs rylands looked up with piteous contrition i really dont know whats the matter with me i certainly went into the shop and had it on my listandreally  jane evidently knew her mistress and smiled with superior toleration its kinder bewilderin goin in them big shops and lookin round them stuffed shelves the shop at the cross roads and postoffice was 14 x 14 but jane was nurtured on the plains anyhow she added goodhumoredly the expressman is sure to look in as he goes by and youve time to give him the order  but is he sure to come asked mrs rylands anxiously mr rylands will be so put out without his peppersauce  hes sure to come ef he knows youre here ye kin always kalkilate on that  why said mrs rylands abstractedly  why cause he just cant keep his eyes off ye thats why he comes every daytaint jest for trade  this was quite true not only of the expressman but of the butcher and baker and the candlestickmaker had there been so advanced a vocation at the cross roads all were equally and curiously attracted by her picturesque novelty mrs rylands knew this herself but without vanity or coquettishness possibly that was why the other woman told her she only slightly deepened the lines of discontent in her cheek and said abstractedly well when he comes you ask him  she dried her shoes put on a pair of slippers that had a faded splendor about them and went up to her bedroom here she hesitated for some time between the sewingmachine and her knittingneedles but finally settled upon the latter and a pair of socks for her husband which she had begun a year ago but she presently despaired of finishing them before he returned three hours hence and so applied herself to the sewingmachine for a little while its singing hum was heard between the blasts that shook the house but the thread presently snapped and the machine was put aside somewhat impatiently with a discontented drawing of the lines around her handsome mouth then she began to tidy the room putting a great many things away and bringing out a great many more a process that was necessarily slow owing to her falling into attitudes of minute inspection of certain articles of dress with intervals of trying them on and observing their effect in her mirror this kind of interruption also occurred while she was putting away some books that were lying about on chairs and tables stopping midway to open their pages becoming interested and quite finishing one chapter with the book held close against the window to catch the fading light of day the feminine reader will gather from this that mrs rylands though charming was not facile in domestic duties she had just glanced at the clock and lit the candle to again set herself to work and thus bridge over the two hours more of waiting when there came a tap at the door she opened it to jane  theres an entire stranger downstairs ez hez got a lame hoss and wants to borry a fresh one  we have none you know said mrs rylands a little impatiently  thets what i told him then he wanted to know ef he could lie by here till he could get one or fix up his own hoss  as you like you know if you can manage it said mrs rylands a little uneasily when mr rylands comes you can arrange it between you where is he now  in the kitchen  the kitchen echoed mrs rylands  yes maam i showed him into the parlor but he kinder shivered his shoulders and reckoned ez how hed go inter the kitchen ye see maam he was all wet and his shiny big boots was sloppy but he aint one o the stuckup kind and hes willin to make hisself cowfble before the kitchen stove  well then he dont want me said mrs rylands with a relieved voice  yesm said jane apparently equally relieved only i thought id just tell you  a few minutes later in crossing the upper hall mrs rylands heard janes voice from the kitchen raised in rustic laughter had she been satirically inclined she might have understood janes willingness to relieve her mistress of the duty of entertaining the stranger had she been philosophical she might have considered the girls dreary monotonous life at the rancho and made allowance for her joy at this rare interruption of it but i fear that mrs rylands was neither satirical nor philosophical and presently when jane reentered with color in her alkaline face and light in her huckleberry eyes and said she was going over to the cattlesheds in the far pasture to see if the hired man didnt know of some horse that could be got for the stranger mrs rylands felt a little bitterness in the thought that the girl would have scarcely volunteered to go all that distance in the rain for her yet in a few moments she forgot all about it and even the presence of her guest in the house and in one of her fitful abstracted employments passed through the diningroom into the kitchen and had opened the door with an oh jane before she remembered her absence  the kitchen lit by a single candle could be only partly seen by her as she stood with her hand on the lock although she herself was plainly visible there was a pause and then a quiet selfpossessed yet amused voice answered  my name isnt jane and if youre the lady of the house i reckon yours wasnt always rylands  at the sound of the voice mrs rylands threw the door wide open and as her eyes fell upon the speakerher unknown guestshe recoiled with a little cry and a white startled face yet the stranger was young and handsome dressed with a scrupulousness and elegance which even the stress of travel had not deranged and he was looking at her with a smile of recognition mingled with that careless audacity and selfpossession which seemed to be the characteristic of his face  jack hamlin she gasped  thats me all the time he responded easily and youre nell montgomery  how did you know i was here who told you she said impetuously  nobody never was so surprised in my life when you opened that door just now you might have knocked me down with a feather yet he spoke lazily with an amused face and looked at her without changing his position  but you must have known something it was no mere accident she went on vehemently glancing around the room  thats where you slip up nell said hamlin imperturbably it was an accident and a bad one my horse lamed himself coming down the grade i sighted the nearest shanty where i thought i might get another horse it happened to be this for the first time he changed his attitude and leaned back contemplatively in his chair  she came towards him quickly you didnt use to lie jack she said hesitatingly  couldnt afford it in my businessand cant now said jack cheerfully but he added curiously as if recognizing something in his companions agitation and lifting his brown lashes to her the window and the ceiling whats all this about whats your little game here  im married she said with nervous intensitymarried and this is my husbands house  not married straight outregularly fixed  yes she said hurriedly  one of the boys dont remember any rylands spelter used to be very sweet on youbut spelter mightnt have been his real name  none of our lot no one you ever knew aa straight out square man she said quickly  i say nell look here you ought to have shown up your cards without even a call you ought to have told him that you danced at the casino  i did  before he asked you to marry him  before  jack got up from his chair put his hands in his pockets and looked at her curiously this nell montgomery this musichall dance and song girl this girl of whom so much had been said and so little proved well this was becoming interesting  you dont understand she said with nervous feverishness you remember after that row i had with jim that night the manager gave us a supperwhen he treated me like a dog  he did that interrupted jack  i felt fit for anything she said with a halfhysterical laugh that seemed voiced however to check some slumbering memory id have cut my throat or his it didnt matter which  it mattered something to us nell put in jack again with polite parenthesis dont leave us out in the cold  i started from frisco that night on the boat ready to fling myself into anythingor the river she went on hurriedly there was a man in the cabin who noticed me and began to hang around i thought he knew who i washad seen me on the posters and as i didnt feel like foolin i told him so but he wasnt that kind he said he saw i was in trouble and wanted me to tell him all  mr hamlin regarded her cheerfully and you told him he said how you had once run away from your childhoods happy home to go on the stage how you always regretted it and would have gone back but that the doors were shut forever against you how you longed to leave but the wicked men and women around you always  i didnt she burst out with sudden passion you know i didnt i told him everything who i was what i had done what i expected to do again i pointed out the menwho were sitting there whispering and grinning at us as if they were in the front row of the theatreand said i knew them all and they knew me i never spared myself a thing i said what people said of me and didnt even care to say it wasnt true  oh come protested jack in perfunctory politeness  he said he liked me for telling the truth and not being ashamed to do it he said the sin was in the false shame and the hypocrisy for thats the sort of man he is you see and thats like him always he asked if i would marry himout of handand do my best to be his lawful wife he said he wanted me to think it over and sleep on it and tomorrow he would come and see me for an answer i slipped off the boat at frisco and went alone to a hotel where i wasnt known in the morning i didnt know whether hed keep his word or id keep mine but he came he said hed marry me that very day and take me to his farm in santa clara i agreed i thought it would take me out of everybodys knowledge and theyd think me dead we were married that day before a regular clergyman i was married under my own nameshe stopped and looked at jack with a hysterical laughbut he made me write underneath it known as nell montgomery for he said he wasnt ashamed of it nor should i be  does he wear long hair and stick straws in it said hamlin gravely does he hear voices and have visions  hes a shrewd sensible hardworking manno more mad than you are nor as mad as i was the day i married him hes lived up to everything hes said she stopped hesitated in her quick nervous speech her lip quivered slightly but she recalled herself and looking imploringly yet hopelessly at jack gasped and thats whats the matter  jack fixed his eyes keenly upon her and you he said curtly  i she repeated wonderingly  yes what have you done he said with sudden sharpness  the wonder was so apparent in her eyes that his keen glance softened why she said bewilderingly i have been his dog his slaveas far as he would let me i have done everything i have not been out of the house until he almost drove me out i have never wanted to go anywhere or see any one but he has always insisted upon it i would have been willing to slave here day and night and have been happy but he said i must not seem to be ashamed of my past when he is not i would have worn common homespun clothes and calico frocks and been glad of it but he insists upon my wearing my best things even my theatre things and as he cant afford to buy more i wear these things i had i know they look beastly here and that im a laughingstock and when i go out i wear almost anything to try and hide them but her lip quivered dangerously again he wants me to do it and it pleases him  jack looked down after a pause he lifted his lashes towards her draggled skirt and said in an easier conversational tone yes i thought i knew that dress i gave it to you for that walking scene in high life didnt i  no she said quickly it was the blue one with silver trimmingdont you remember i tried to turn it the first year i was married but it never looked the same  it was sweetly pretty said jack encouragingly and with that blue hat lined with silver it was just fetching somehow i dont quite remember this one and he looked at it critically  i had it at the races in 58 and that supper judge boompointer gave us at frisco where colonel fish upset the table trying to get at jim do you know she said with a little laugh its got the stains of the champagne on it yet it never would come off see and she held the candle with great animation to the breadth of silk before her  and theres more of it on the sleeve said jack isnt there  mrs rylands looked reproachfully at jack  that isnt champagne dont you know what it is  no  its blood she said gravely when that mexican cut poor ned so baddont you remember i held his head upon my arm while you bandaged him she heaved a little sigh and then added with a faint laugh thats the worst thing about the clothes of a girl in the profession they get spoiled or stained before they wear out  this large truth did not seem to impress mr hamlin why did you leave santa clara he said abruptly in his previous critical tone  because of the folks there they were standoffish and ugly you see josh  who  josh rylandshim he told everybody who i was even those who had never seen me in the billshow good i was to marry him how he had faith in me and wasnt ashameduntil they didnt believe we were married at all so they looked another way when they met us and didnt call and all the while i was glad they didnt but he wouldnt believe it and allowed i was pining on account of it  and were you  i swear to god jack id have been content and more to have been just there with him seein nobody letting every one believe i was dead and gone but he said it was wrong and weak maybe it was she added with a shy interrogating look at jack of which however he took no notice then when he found they wouldnt call what do you think he did  beat you perhaps suggested jack cheerfully  he never did a thing to me that wasnt straight out square and kind she said half indignantly half hopelessly he thought if his kind of people wouldnt see me i might like to see my own sort so without saying anything to me he brought down of all things tinkie clifford she that used to dance in the cheap variety shows at frisco and her particular friend captain sykes it would have just killed you jack she said with a sudden hysteric burst of laughter to have seen josh in his square straightout way trying to be civil and help things along but she went on as suddenly relapsing into her former attitude of worried appeal i couldnt stand it and when she got to talking free and easy before josh and captain sykes to guzzling champagne she and me had a row she allowed i was putting on airs and i made her walk in spite of josh  and josh seemed to like it said hamlin carelessly has he seen her since  no i reckon hes cured of asking that kind of company for me and then we came here but i persuaded him not to begin by going round telling people who i wasas he did the last timebut to leave it to folks to find out if they wanted to and he gave in then he let me fix up this house and furnish it my own way and i did  do you mean to say that you fixed up that family vault of a sittingroom said jack in horror  yes i didnt want any fancy furniture or lookingglasses and such like to attract folks nor anything to look like the old times i dont think any of the boys would care to come here and i got rid of a lot of sporting travelers wildcat managers and that kind of tramp in this way butshe hesitated and her face fell again  but what said jack  i dont think that josh likes it either he brought home the other day my johnny is a shoemakiyure and wanted me to try it on the organ but it reminded me how we used to get just sick of singing it on and off the boards and i couldnt touch it he wanted me to go to the circus that was touring over at the cross roads but it was the old flanigins circus you know the one gussie riggs used to ride in with its old clown and its old ringmaster and the old wheezes and i chucked it  look here said jack rising and surveying mrs rylands critically if you go on at this gait ill tell you what that man of yours will do hell bolt with some of your old friends  she turned a quick scared face upon him for an instant but only for an instant her hysteric little laugh returned at once followed by her weary worried look no jack you dont know him if it was only that he cares only for me in his own wayand she stammered as she went on ive no luck in making him happy  she stopped the wind shook the house and fired a volley of rain against the windows she took advantage of it to draw a torn laceedged handkerchief from her pocket behind and keeping the tail of her eyes in a frightened fashion on jack applied the handkerchief furtively first to her nose and then to her eyes  dont do that said jack fastidiously its wet enough outside nevertheless he stood up and gazed at her  well he began  she timidly drew nearer to him and took a seat on the kitchen table looking up wistfully into his eyes  well resumed jack argumentatively if he wont chuck you why dont you chuck him  she turned quite white and suddenly dropped her eyes yes she said almost inaudibly lots of girls would do that  i dont mean go back to your old life continued jack i reckon youve had enough of that but get into some business you know like other women a bonnet shop or a candy shop for children see ill help start you ive got a couple of hundred if not in my own pocket in somebodys else just burning to be used and then you can look about you and perhaps some square business man will turn up and you can marry him you know you cant live this way nohow its killing you it aint fair on you nor on rylands either  no she said quickly it aint fair on him i know it i know it isnt i know it isnt she repeated onlyshe stopped  only what said jack impatiently  she did not speak after a pause she picked up the rollingpin from the table and began absently rolling it down her lap to her knee as if pressing out the stained silk skirt only she stammered slowly rolling the pin handles in her open palms ii cant leave josh  why cant you said jack quickly  becausebecausei she went on with a quivering lip working the rollingpin heavily down her knee as if she were crushing her answer out of itbecauseilove him  there was a pause a dash of rain against the window and another dash from her eyes upon her hands the rollingpin and the skirts she had gathered up hastily as she cried o jack jack i never loved anybody like him i never knew what love was i never knew a man like him before there never was one before  to this large comprehensive and passionate statement mr jack hamlin made no reply an audacity so supreme had conquered his he walked to the window looked out upon the dark rainfilmed pane that however reflected no equal change in his own dark eyes and then returned and walked round the kitchen table when he was at her back without looking at her he reached out his hand took her passive one that lay on the table in his grasped it heartily for a single moment laid it gently down and returned around the table where he again confronted her cheerfully face to face  youll make the riffle yet he said quietly just now i dont see what i could do or where i could chip in your little game but if i do or you do count me in and let me know you know where to writemy old address at sacramento he walked to the corner took up his still wet serape threw it over his shoulders and picked up his broadbrimmed ridinghat  youre not going jack she said hesitatingly as she rubbed her wet eyes into a consciousness of his movements youll wait to see him hell be here in an hour  ive been here too long already said jack and the less you say about my calling even accidentally the better nobody will believe ityou didnt yourself in fact unless you see how i can help you the sooner you consider us all dead and buried the sooner your luck will change tell your girl ive found my own horse so much better that i have pushed on with him and give her that  he threw a gold coin on the table  but your horse is still lame she said wonderingly what will you do in this storm  get into the cover of the next wood and camp out ive done it before  but jack  he suddenly made a slight gesture of warning his quick ear had caught the approach of footsteps along the wet gravel outside a mischievous light slid into his dark eyes as he coolly moved backward to the door and holding it open said in a remarkably clear and distinct voice  yes as you say society is becoming very mixed and frivolous everywhere and youd scarcely know san francisco now so delighted however to have made your acquaintance and regret my business prevents my waiting to see your good husband so odd that i should have known your aunt jemima but as you say the world is very small after all i shall tell the deacon how well you are lookingin spite of the kitchen smoke in your eyes goodby a thousand thanks for your hospitality  and jack bowing profoundly to the ground backed out upon jane the hired man and the expressman treading i grieve to say with some deliberation upon the toes of the two latter in order possibly that in their momentary pain and discomposure they might not scan too closely the face of this ingenious gentleman as he melted into the night and the storm  jane entered with a slight toss of her head  heres your expressmanef youre wantin him now  mrs rylands was too preoccupied to notice her handmaidens significant emphasis as she indicated a freshlooking bashful young fellow whose confusion was evidently heightened by the unexpected egress of mr hamlin and the pointblank presence of the handsome mrs rylands  oh certainly said mrs rylands quickly so kind of him to oblige us give him the order jane please  she turned to escape from the kitchen and these new intruders when her eye fell upon the coin left by mr hamlin the gentleman wished you to take that for your trouble jane she said hastily pointing to it and passed out  jane cast a withering look after her retreating skirts and picking the coin from the table turned to the hired man run to the stable after that dandified young feller dick and hand that back to him ye kin say that jane mackinnon dont run arrants fur money nor play gooseberry to other folks fur fun   part ii   mr joshua rylands had according to the vocabulary of his class found grace at the age of sixteen while still in the spiritual state of original sin and the political one of missouri he had not indeed found it by persistent youthful seeking or spiritual insight but somewhat violently and turbulently at a campmeeting a village boy naturally gentle and impressible with an original characterlimited however in education and experiencehe had after his first rustic debauch with some vulgar companions fallen upon the campmeeting in reckless audacity and instead of being handed over to the district constable was taken in and placed upon the anxious bench rastled with and exhorted by a strong revivalist preacher convicted of sin andconverted it is doubtful if the shame of a public arrest and legal punishment would have impressed his youthful spirit as much as did this spiritual examination and trial in which he himself became accuser howbeit its effect though punitive was also exemplary he at once cast off his evil companions remaining faithful to his conversion in spite of their later backslidings when after the western fashion the time came for him to forsake his fathers farm and seek a new quarter section on some more remote frontier he carried into that secluded lonely halfmonkish celibacy of pioneer lifewhich has been the foundation of so much strong western charactermore than the usual religious feeling at once industrious and adventurous he lived by the word as he called it and nature as he knew ittempted by none of the vices or sentiments of civilization when he finally joined the californian emigration it was not as a goldseeker but as a discoverer of new agricultural fields if the hardship was as great and the rewards fewer he nevertheless knew that he retained his safer isolation and independence of spirit vice and civilization were to him synonymous terms it was the natural condition of the worldly and unregenerate such was the man who chanced to meet nell montgomery the pearl of the variety stage on the sacramento boat in one of his forced visits to civilization without knowing her in her profession her frank exposition of herself did not startle him he recognized it accepted it and strove to convert it and as long as this daughter of folly forsook her evil ways for him it was a triumph in which there was no shame and might be proclaimed from the housetop when his neighbors thought differently and avoided them he saw no inconsistency in bringing his wifes old friends to divert her she might in time convert them he had no more fear of her returning to their ways than he had of himself backsliding narrow as was his creed he had none of the harshness nor pessimism of the bigot with the keenest selfscrutiny his credulity regarding others was touching  the storm was still raging when he alighted that evening from the up coach at the trail nearest his house although incumbered with a heavy carpetbag he started resignedly on his twomile tramp without begrudging the neighborly act of his wife which had deprived him of his horse it was like her to do these things in her goodhumored abstraction an abstraction however that sometimes worried him from the fear that it indicated some unhappiness with her present lot he was longing to rejoin her after his absence of three days the longest time they had been separated since their marriage and he hurried on with a certain loverlike excitement quite new to his usually calm and temperate blood  struggling with the storm and darkness but always with the happy consciousness of drawing nearer to her in that struggle he labored on finding his perilous way over the indistinguishable trail by certain landmarks in the distance visible only to his pioneer eye that heavier shadow to the right was not the hillside but the slope to the distant hill that low regular line immediately before him was not a fence or wall but the line of distant gigantic woods a mile from his home yet as he began to descend the slope towards the wood he stopped and rubbed his eyes there was distinctly a light in it his first idea was that he had lost the trail and was nearing the woodman mackinnons cabin but a more careful scrutiny revealed to him that it was really the wood and the light was a campfire it was a rough night for camping out but they were probably some belated prospectors  when he had reached the fringe of woodland he could see quite plainly that the fire was built beside one of the large pines and that the little encampment which looked quite comfortable and secluded from the stormbeaten trail was occupied apparently by a single figure by the good glow of the leaping fire that figure standing erect before it elegantly shaped in the graceful folds of a serape looked singularly romantic and picturesque and reminded joshua rylandswhose ideas of art were purely reminiscent of boyish readingof some picture in a novel the heavy black columns of the pines glancing out of the concave shadow also seemed a fitting background to what might have been a scene in a play so strongly was he impressed by it that but for his anxiety to reach his home still a mile distant and the fact that he was already late he would have penetrated the wood and the seclusion of the stranger with an offer of hospitality for the night the man however was evidently capable of taking care of himself and the outline of a tethered horse was faintly visible under another tree it might be a surveyor or engineerthe only men of a better class who were itinerant  but another and even greater surprise greeted him as he toiled up the rocky slope towards his farmhouse the windows of the sittingroom which were usually blank and black by night were glittering with unfamiliar light like most farmers he seldom used the room except for formal company his wife usually avoiding it and even he himself now preferred the diningroom or the kitchen his first suggestion that his wife had visitors gave him a sense of pleasure on her account mingled however with a slight uneasiness of his own which he could not account for more than that as he approached nearer he could hear the swell of the organ above the roar of the swaying pines and the cadences were not of a devotional character he hesitated for a moment as he had hesitated at the fire in the woods yet it was surely his own house he hurried to the door opened it not only the light of the sittingroom streamed into the hall but the ruddier glow of an actual fire in the disused grate the familiar dark furniture had been rearranged to catch some of the glow and relieve its sombreness and his wife rising from the musicstool was the rooms only occupant  mrs rylands gazed anxiously and timidly at her husbands astonished face as he threw off his waterproof and laid down his carpetbag her own face was a little flurried with excitement and his half hidden in his tawny beard and possibly owing to his selfintrospective nature never spontaneously sympathetic still expressed only wonder mrs rylands was a little frightened it is sometimes dangerous to meddle with a mans habits even when he has grown weary of them  i thought she began hesitatingly that it would be more cheerful for you in here this stormy evening i thought you might like to put your wet things to dry in the kitchen and we could sit here together after supper alone  i am afraid that mrs rylands did not offer all her thoughts ever since mr hamlins departure she had been uneasy and excited sometimes falling into fits of dejection and again lighting up into hysterical levity at other times carefully examining her wardrobe and then with a sudden impulse rushing downstairs again to give orders for her husbands supper and to make the extraordinary changes in the sittingroom already noted only a few moments before he arrived she had covertly brought down a piece of music and put aside the hymnbooks and taken with a little laugh a pack of cards from her pocket which she placed behind the already dismantled vase on the chimney  i reckoned you had company ellen he said gravely kissing her  no she said quickly that is she stopped with a sudden surge of color in her face that startled her there wasa manhere in the kitchenwho had a lame horse and who wanted to get a fresh one but he went away an hour ago and he wasnt in this roomat least after it was fixed up so ive had no company  she felt herself again blushing at having blushed and a little terrified there was no reason for it but for jacks warning she would have been quite ready to tell her husband all she had never blushed before him over her past life why she should now blush over seeing jack of all people made her utter a little hysterical laugh i am afraid that this experienced little woman took it for granted that her husband knew that if jack or any man had been there as a clandestine lover she would not have blushed at all yet with all her experience she did not know that she had blushed simply because it was to jack that she had confessed that she loved the man before her her husband noted the blush as part of her general excitement he permitted her to drag him into the room and seat him before the hearth where she sank down on one knee to pull off his heavy rubber boots but he waved her aside at this pulled them off with his own hands and let her take them to the kitchen and bring back his slippers by this time a smile had lighted up his hard face the room was certainly more comfortable and cheerful still he was a little worried was there not in these changes a falling away from the grace of selfabnegation which she had so sedulously practiced  when supper was served by jane in the dull diningroom mr rylands had he not been more engaged in these late domestic changes might have noticed that the missouri girl waited upon him with a certain commiserating air that was remarkable by its contrast with the frigid ceremonious politeness with which she attended her mistress it had not escaped mrs rylands however who ever since jacks abrupt departure had noticed this change in the girls demeanor to herself and with a womans intuitive insight of another woman had fathomed it the comfortable teteatete with jack which jane had looked forward to mrs rylands had anticipated herself and then sent him off when joshua thanked his wife for remembering the peppersauce and mrs rylands pathetically admitted her forgetfulness the headtoss which jane gave as she left the room was too marked to be overlooked by him mrs rylands gave a hysterical little laugh i am afraid jane doesnt like my sending away the expressman just after i had also dismissed the stranger whom she had taken a fancy to and left her without company she said unwisely  mr rylands did not laugh i reckon he returned slowly that jane must feel kinder lonely she bears all the burden of our bein outer the world without any of our glory in the cause of it  nevertheless when supper was over and the pair were seated in the sittingroom before the fire this episode was forgotten mrs rylands produced her husbands pipe and tobaccopouch he looked around the formal walls and hesitated he had been in the habit of smoking in the kitchen  why not here said mrs rylands with a sudden little note of decision why should we keep this room only for company that dont come i call it silly  this struck mr rylands as logical besides undoubtedly the fire had mellowed the room after a puff or two he looked at his wife musingly couldnt you make yourself one of them cigarettys as they call em heres the tobacco and ill get you the paper  i could she said tentatively then suddenly what made you think of it you never saw me smoke  no said rylands but that lady your old friend miss clifford does and i thought you might be hankering after it  how do you know tinkie clifford smokes said mrs rylands quickly  she lit a cigaretty that day she called  i hate it said mrs rylands shortly  mr rylands nodded approval and puffed meditatively  josh have you seen that girl since  no said joshua  nor any other girl like her  no said joshua wonderingly you see i only got to know her on your account ellen that she might see you  well dont you do it any more none of em promise me she leaned forward eagerly in her chair  but ellenher husband began gravely  i know what youre going to say but they cant do me any good and you cant do them any good as you did me so there  mr rylands was silent and smiled meditatively  josh  yes  when you met me that night on the sacramento boat and looked at me did youdid i she hesitateddid you look at me because i had been crying  i thought you were troubled in spirit and looked so  i suppose i looked worried of course i had no time to change or even fix my hair i had on that green dress and it never was becoming and you only spoke to me on account of my awful looks  i saw only your wrestling soul ellen and i thought you needed comfort and help  she was silent for a moment and then leaning forward picked up the poker and began to thrust it absently between the bars  and if it had been some other girl crying and looking awful youd have spoken to her all the same  this was a new idea to mr rylands but with most men logic is supreme i suppose i would he said slowly  and married her she rattled the bars of the grate with the poker as if to drown the inevitable reply  mr rylands loved the woman before him but it pleased him to think that he loved truth better if it had been necessary to her salvation yes he said  not tinkie she said suddenly  she never would have been in your contrite condition  much you know girls like that can cry as well as laugh just as they want to well i suppose i did look horrid nevertheless she seemed to gain some gratification from her husbands reply and changed the subject as if fearful of losing that satisfaction by further questioning  i tried some of those songs you brought but i dont think they go well with the harmonium she said pointing to some music on its rack except one just listen she rose and with the same nervous quickness she had shown before went to the instrument and began to sing and play there was a hopeless incongruity between the character of the instrument and the spirit of the song mrs rylandss voice was rather forced and crudely trained but joshua rylands sitting there comfortably slippered by the fire and conscious of the sheeted rain against the window felt it good presently he arose and lounging heavily over to the fair performer leaned down and imprinted a kiss on the labyrinthine fringes of her hair at which mrs rylands caught blindly at his hand nearest her and without lifting her other hand from the keys or her eyes from the music said tentatively  you know theres a chorus just here why cant you try it with me  mr rylands hesitated a moment then with a preliminary cough lifted a voice as crude as hers but powerful through much campmeeting exercise and roared a chorus which was remarkable chiefly for requiring that archness and playfulness in execution which he lacked as the whole house seemed to dilate with the sound and the wind outside to withhold its fury mr rylands felt that physical delight which children feel in personal outcry and was grateful to his wife for the opportunity laying his hand affectionately on her shoulder he noticed for the first time that she was in a kind of eveningdress and that her delicate white shoulder shone through the black lace that enveloped it  for an instant mr rylands was shocked at this unwonted exposure he had never seen his wife in eveningdress before it was true they were alone and in their own sittingroom but the room was still invested with that formality and publicity which seemed to accent this indiscretion the simpleminded frontier mans mind went back to jane to the hired man to the expressman the stranger all of whom might have noticed it also  you have a new dress he said slowly have you worn it all day  no she said with a timid smile i only put it on just before you came its the one i used to wear in the ballroom scene in gay times in frisco you dont know it i know i thought i would wear it tonight and then she suddenly grasped his hand youll let me put all these things away forever wont you josh ive seen such nice pretty calico at the store today and i can make up one or two home dresses like janes only better fitting of course in fact i asked them to send the roll up here tomorrow for you to see  mr rylands felt relieved perhaps his views had changed about the moral effect of her retaining these symbols of her past for he consented to the calico dresses not however without an inward suspicion that she would not look so well in them and that the one she had on was more becoming  meantime she tried another piece of music it was equally incongruous and slightly bacchantic  there used to be a mighty pretty dance went to that she said nodding her head in time with the music and assisting the heavily spasmodic attempts of the instrument with the pleasant levity of her voice i used to do it  ye might try it now ellen suggested her husband with a halffrightened halfamused tolerance  you play then said mrs rylands quickly offering her seat to him  mr rylands sat down to the harmonium as mrs rylands briskly moved the table and chairs against the wall mr rylands played slowly and strenuously as from a conscientious regard of the instrument mrs rylands stood in the centre of the floor making a rather pretty animated picture as she again stimulated the heavy harmonium swell not only with her voice but her hands and feet presently she began to skip  i should warn the reader here that this was before the shawl or skirt dancing was in vogue and i am afraid that pretty mrs rylandss performances would now be voted slow her silk skirt and frilled petticoat were lifted just over her small ankles and tiny bronzekid shoes in the course of a pirouette or two there was a slight further revelation of blue silk stockings and some delicate embroidery but really nothing more than may be seen in the sweep of a modern waltz suddenly the music ceased mr rylands had left the harmonium and walked over to the hearth mrs rylands stopped and came towards him with a flushed anxious face  it dont seem to go right does it she said with her nervous laugh i suppose im getting too old now and i dont quite remember it  better forget it altogether he replied gravely he stopped at seeing a singular change in her face and added awkwardly when i told you i didnt want you to be ashamed of your past nor to try to forget what you were i didnt mean such things as that  what did you mean she said timidly  the truth was that mr rylands did not know he had known this sort of thing only in the abstract he had never had the least acquaintance with the class to which his wife had belonged nor known anything of their methods it was a revelation to him now in the woman he loved and who was his wife he was not shocked so much as he was frightened  you shall have the dress tomorrow ellen he said gently and you can put away these gewgaws you dont need to look like tinkie clifford  he did not see the look of triumph that lit up her eye but added go on and play  she sat down obediently to the instrument he watched her for a few moments from the toe of her kid slipper on the pedals to the swell of her shoulders above the keyboard with a strange abstracted face presently she stopped and came over to him  and when ive got these nice calico frocks and you cant tell me from jane and im a good housekeeper and settle down to be a farmers wife maybe ill have a secret to tell you  a secret he repeated gravely why not now  her face was quite aglow with excitement and a certain timid mischief as she laughed not while you are so solemn it can wait  he looked at his watch i must give some orders to jim about the stock before he turns in he said  hes gone to the stables already said mrs rylands  no matter i can go there and find him  shall i bring your boots she said quickly  ill put them on when i pass through the kitchen i wont be long away now go to bed you are looking tired he said gently as he gazed at the drawn lines about her eyes and mouth her former pretty color struck him also as having changed of late and as being irregular and inharmonious  as mrs rylands obediently ascended the stairs she heaved a faint sigh her only recognition of her husbands criticism he turned and passed quickly into the kitchen he wanted to be alone to collect his thoughts but he was surprised to find jane still there sitting bolt upright in a chair in the corner apparently she had been expecting him for as he entered she stood up and wiped her cheek and mouth with one hand as if to compress her lips the more tightly  i reckoned she began that unless you war for forgettin everythin in these yer goings on yed be passin through here to tend to your stock ive got a word to say to ye mr rylands when i first kem over here to help i got word from the folks around that your wife afore you married her was just one o them bally dancers well that was your lookout not mine jane mackinnon aint the kind to take everybodys sayin as gospil but she kalkilates to treat folks ez she finds em when she finds em lyin and deceivin when she finds em purtendin one thing and doin another when she finds em makin fools tumble to em playing soots on their own husbands and turnin an honest house into a musichall and a fandango shop she kicks you hear me jane mackinnon kicks  what do you mean said mr rylands sternly  i mean said miss mackinnon striking her hips with the back of her hands smartly and accenting each word that dropped like a bullet from her mouth with an additional blowimeanthatyourwifehad oneofheroldhangersonfromfriscohereinthis verykitchenallthearternoon there i mean that whiles she was waitin here for you she was canoodlin and cryin over old times with him i saw her myself through the winder thats what i mean mr joshua rylands  its false she had some poor stranger here with a lame horse she told me so herself  jane mackinnon laughed shrilly  did she tell you that the poor stranger was young and prettyfaced with black moustarches that his store clothes must have cost a fortin saying nothing of his goldlined broadcloth sarrapper did she say that his horse was so lame that when i went to get another he wouldnt wait for it did she tell you who he was  no she did not know said rylands sternly but with a whitening face  well ill tell you the gambler the shooterthe man whose name is black enough to stain any woman he knows jim recognized him like a shot he sez the moment he clapped eyes on him at the door dod blasted if it aint jack hamlin  little as mr rylands knew of the world he had heard that name but it was not that he was thinking of he was thinking of the campfire in the wood the handsome figure before it the tethered horse he was thinking of the lighted sittingroom the fire his wifes bare shoulders her slippers stockings and the dance he saw it alla lightningflash to his dull imagination the room seemed to expand and then grow smaller the figure of jane to sway backwards and forwards before him he murmured the name of god with lips that were voiceless caught at the kitchen table to steady himself held it till he felt his arms grow rigid and then recovered himselfwhite cold and sane  speak a word of this to her he said deliberately enter her room while im gone even leave the kitchen before i come back and ill throw you into the road tell that hired man if he dares to breathe it to a soul ill strangle him  the unlookedfor rage of this quiet godfearing man and dupe as she believed was terrible but convincing she shrank back into the corner as he coolly drew on his boots and waterproof and without another word left the house  he knew what he was going to do as well as if it had been ordained for him he knew he would find the young man in the wood for whatever were the truth of the other stories he and the visitor were identical he had seen him with his own eyes he would confront him face to face and know all and until then he could not see his wife again he walked on rapidly but without feverishness or mental confusion he saw his duty plainlyif ellen had backslidden he must give her another trial these were his articles of faith he should not put her away but she should nevermore be wife to him it was he who had tempted her it was true perhaps god would forgive her for that reason but he could never love her again  the fury of the storm had somewhat abated as he reached the wood the fire was still there but no longer a leaping flame a dull glow in the darkness of the forest aisles was all that indicated its position rylands at once plunged in that direction he was near enough to see the red embers when he heard a sharp click and a voice called  hold up  mr hamlin was a light sleeper the crackle of underbrush had been enough to disturb him the voice was his the click was the cocking of his revolver  rylands was no coward but halted diplomatically  now then said mr hamlins voice a little more this way in the light if you please  rylands moved as directed and saw mr hamlin lying before the fire resting easily on one hand with his revolver in the other  thank you said jack excuse my precautions but it is night and this is for the present my bedroom  my name is rylands you called at my house this afternoon and saw my wife said rylands slowly  i did said hamlin it was mighty kind of you to return my call so soon but i didnt expect it  i reckon not but i know who you are and that you are an old associate of hers in the days of her sin and unregeneration i want you to answer me before god and man what was your purpose in coming there today  look here i dont think its necessary to drag in strangers to hear my answer said jack lying down again but i came to borrow a horse  is that the truth  jack got upon his feet very solemnly put on his hat drew down his waistcoat and approached mr rylands with his hands in his pockets  mr rylands he said with great suavity of manner this is the second time today that i have had the honor of having my word doubted by your family your wife was good enough to question my assertion that i didnt know that she was living here but that was a womans vanity you have no such excuse there is my horse yonder lame as you may see i didnt lame him for the sake of seeing your wife nor you  there was that in mr hamlins audacity and perfect selfpossession which even while it irritated never suggested deceit he was too reckless of consequence to lie mr rylands was staggered and half convinced nevertheless he hesitated  dare you tell me everything that happened between my wife and you  dare you listen said mr hamlin quietly  mr rylands turned a little white after a moment he said  yes  good said mr hamlin i like your grit though i dont mind telling you its the only thing i like about you sit down well i havent seen nell montgomery for three years until i met her as your wife at your house she was surprised as i was and frightened as i wasnt she spent the whole interview in telling me the history of her marriage and her life with you and nothing more i cannot say that it was remarkably entertaining or that she was as amusing as your wife as she was as nell montgomery the variety actress when she had finished i came away  mr rylands who had seated himself made a movement as if to rise but mr hamlin laid his hand on his knee  i asked you if you dared to listen i have something myself to say of that interview i found your wife wearing the old dresses that other men had given her and she said she wore them because she thought it pleased you i found that you who are questioning my calling upon her had already got the worst of her old chums to visit her without asking her consent i found that instead of being the first one to lie for her and hide her you were the first one to tell anybody her history just because you thought it was to the glory of god generally and of joshua rylands in particular  a mans motives are his own stammered rylands  sorry you didnt see it when you questioned mine just now said jack coolly  then she complained to you said rylands hesitatingly  i didnt say that said jack shortly  but you found her unhappy  damnably  and you advised hersaid rylands tentatively  i advised her to chuck you and try to get a better husband he paused and then added with a disgusted laugh but she didnt tumble to it for a dd silly reason  what reason said rylands hurriedly  said she loved you returned jack kicking a brand back into the fire mr rylandss white cheeks flamed out suddenly like the brand seeing which jack turned upon him deliberately  mr joshua rylands ive seen many fools in my time ive seen men holding four aces backed down because they thought they knew the other man had a royal flush ive seen a man sell his claim for a wildcat share with the gold lying a foot below him in the ground he walked on ive seen a dead shot shoot wild because he thought he saw something in the other mans eye ive seen a heap of godforsaken fools but i never saw one before who claimed god as a pal youve got a wife a dd sight truer to you for what you call her sin than youve ever been to her with all your dd salvation and as you couldnt make her otherwise though youve tried to hard enough it seems to me that for square downright chuckleheadedness you can take the cake goodnight now run away and play youre making me tired  one moment said mr rylands awkwardly and hurriedly i may have wronged you i was mistaken wont you come back with me and accept myourhospitality  not much said jack i left your house because i thought it better for you and her that no one should know of my being there  but you were already recognized said mr rylands it was jane who lied about you and your return with me will confute her slanders  who asked jack  jane our hired girl  mr hamlin uttered an indescribable laugh  thats just as well you simply tell jane you saw me that i was greatly shocked at what she said but that i forgive her i dont think shell say any more   strange to add mr hamlins surmise was correct mr rylands found jane still in the kitchen alone terrified remorseful yet ever after silent on the subject stranger still the hired man became equally uncommunicative mrs rylands attributing her husbands absence only to care of the stock had gone to bed in a feverish condition and mr rylands did not deem it prudent to tell her of his interview the next day she sent for the doctor and it was deemed necessary for her to keep her bed for a few days her husband was singularly attentive and considerate during that time and it was probable that mrs rylands seized that opportunity to tell him the secret she spoke of the night before whatever it wasfor it was not generally known for a few months laterit seemed to draw them closer together imparted a protecting dignity to joshua rylands which took the place of his former selfish austerity gave them a future to talk of confidentially hopefully and sometimes foolishly which took the place of their more foolish past and when the roll of calico came from the cross roads it contained also a quantity of fine linen laces small caps and other trifles somewhat in contrast to the more homely materials ordered  and when three months were past the sittingroom was often lit up and made cheerful particularly on that supreme occasion when with a great deal of enthusiasm all the women of the countryside flocked to see mrs rylands and her first baby and a more considerate and devoted couple than the father and mother they had never known     the man at the semaphore   in the early days of the californian immigration on the extremest point of the sandy peninsula where the bay of san francisco debouches into the pacific there stood a semaphore telegraph tossing its black arms against the skywith its back to the golden gate and that vast expanse of sea whose nearest shore was japanit signified to another semaphore further inland the rigs of incoming vessels by certain uncouth signs which were again passed on to telegraph hill san francisco where they reappeared on a third semaphore and read to the initiated schooner brig ship or steamer but all homesick san francisco had learned the last sign and on certain days of the month every eye was turned to welcome those gaunt arms widely extended at right angles which meant sidewheel steamer the only steamer which carried the mails and letters from home in the joyful reception accorded to that herald of glad tidings very few thought of the lonely watcher on the sand dunes who dispatched them or even knew of that desolate station  for desolate it was beyond description the presidio with its voiceless dismounted cannon and empty embrasures hidden in a hollow and the mission dolores with its crumbling walls and belfry tower lost in another made the ultima thule of all san francisco wandering the cliff house and fort point did not then exist from black point the curving line of shore of yerba buenaor san franciscoshowed only a stretch of glittering windswept sand dunes interspersed with straggling gullies of halfburied black scrub oak the long six months summer sun fiercely beat upon it from the cloudless sky above the long six months trade winds fiercely beat upon it from the west the monotonous rollcall of the long pacific surges regularly beat upon it from the sea almost impossible to face by day through sliding sands and buffeting winds at night it was impracticable through the dense seafog that stole softly through the golden gate at sunset thence until morning sea and shore were a trackless waste bounded only by the warning thunders of the unseen sea the station itself a rudely built cabin with two windowsone furnished with a telescopelooked like a heap of driftwood or a stranded wreck left by the retiring sea the semaphorethe only object for leagueslifted above the undulating dunes took upon itself various shapes more or less gloomy according to the hour or weathera blasted tree the masts and clinging spars of a beached ship a dismantled gallows or with the background of a golden sunset across the gate and its arms extended at right angles to a more hopeful fancy it might have seemed the missionary cross which the enthusiast portala lifted on that heathen shore a hundred years before  not that dick jarmanthe solitary station keeperever indulged this fancy an escaped convict from one of her britannic majestys penal colonies a stowaway in the hold of an australian ship he had landed penniless in san francisco fearful of contact with his more honest countrymen already there and liable to detection at any moment luckily for him the english immigration consisted mainly of goldseekers en route to sacramento and the southern mines he was prudent enough to resist the temptation to follow them and accepted the post of semaphore keeperthe first work offered himwhich the meanest immigrant filled with dreams of gold would have scorned his employers asked him no questions and demanded no references his post could be scarcely deemed one of trustthere was no property for him to abscond with but the telescope he was removed from temptation and evil company in his lonely waste his duties were as mechanical as the instrument he worked and interruption of them would be instantly known at san francisco for this he would receive his board and lodging and seventyfive dollars a montha sum to be ridiculed in those flush days but which seemed to the brokenspirited and halffamished stowaway a princely independence  and then there was rest and security he was free from that torturing anxiety and fear of detection which had haunted him night and day for three months the ceaseless vigilance and watchful dread he had known since his escape he could lay aside now the rude cabin on the sand dune was to him as the longsought cave to some hunted animal it seemed impossible that any one would seek him there he was spared alike the contact of his enemies or the shame of recognizing even a friendly face until by each he would be forgotten from his coign of vantage on that desolate waste and with the aid of his telescope no stranger could approach within two or three miles of his cabin without undergoing his scrutiny and at the worst if he was pursued here before him was the trackless shore and the boundless sea  and at times there was a certain satisfaction in watching unseen and in perfect security the decks of passing ships with the aid of his glass he could mingle again with the world from which he was debarred and gloomily wonder who among those passengers knew their solitary watcher or had heard of his deeds it might have made him gloomier had he known that in those eager faces turned towards the golden haven there was little thought of anything but themselves he tried to read in faces on board the few outgoing ships the record of their success with a strange envy they were returning home home for sometimesbut seldomhe thought of his own home and his past it was a miserable past of forgery and embezzlement that had culminated a career of youthful dissipation and selfindulgence and shut him out forever from the staid old english cathedral town where he was born he knew that his relations believed and wished him dead he thought of this past with little pleasure but with little remorse like most of his stamp he believed it was illluck chance somebody elses fault but never his own responsible action he would not repent he would be wiser only and he would not be retakenalive  two or three months passed in this monotonous duty in which he partly recovered his strength and his nerves he lost his furtive restless watchful look the bracing sea air and the burning sun put into his face the healthy tan and the uplifted frankness of a sailor his eyes grew keener from long scanning of the horizon he knew where to look for sails from the creeping coastwise schooner to the farrounding merchantman from cape horn he knew the faint line of haze that indicated the steamer long before her masts and funnels became visible he saw no soul except the solitary boatman of the little plunger who landed his weekly provisions at a small cove hard by the boatman thought his secretiveness and reticence only the surliness of his nation and cared little for a man who never asked for the news and to whom he brought no letters the long nights which wrapped the cabin in seafog and at first seemed to heighten the exiles sense of security by degrees however became monotonous and incited an odd restlessness which he was wont to oppose by whiskeyallowed as a part of his storeswhich while it dulled his sensibilities he however never permitted to interfere with his mechanical duties  he had been there five months and the hills on the opposite shore between tamalpais were already beginning to show their russet yellow sides one bright morning he was watching the little fleet of italian fishingboats hovering in the bay this was always a picturesque spectacle perhaps the only one that relieved the general monotony of his outlook the quaint lateen sails of dull red or yellow showing against the sparkling waters and the red caps or handkerchiefs of the fishermen might have attracted even a more abstracted man suddenly one of the larger boats tacked and made directly for the little cove where his weekly plunger used to land in an instant he was alert and suspicious but a close examination of the boat through his glass satisfied him that it contained in addition to the crew only two or three women apparently the family of the fishermen as it ran up on the beach and the entire party disembarked he could see it was merely a careless peaceable invasion and he thought no more about it the strangers wandered about the sands gesticulating and laughing they brought a pot ashore built a fire and cooked a homely meal he could see that from time to time the semaphoreevidently a novelty to themhad attracted their attention and having occasion to signal the arrival of a bark the working of the uncouth arms of the instrument drew the children in halffrightened curiosity towards it although the others held aloof as if fearful of trespassing upon some work of the government no doubt secretly guarded by the police a few mornings later he was surprised to see upon the beach near the same locality a small heap of lumber which had evidently been landed in the early morning fog the next day an old tent appeared on the spot and the men evidently fishermen began the erection of a rude cabin beside it jarman had been long enough there to know that it was government land and that these manifestly humble squatters upon it would not be interfered with for some time to come he began to be uneasy again it was true they were fully half a mile from him and they were foreigners but might not their reckless invasion of the law attract others in this lawless country to do the same it ought to be stopped for once richard jarman sided with legal authority  but when the cabin was completed it was evident from what he saw of its rude structure that it was only a temporary shelter for the fishermans family and the stores and refitting of the fishingboat more convenient to them than the san francisco wharves the beach was utilized for the mending of nets and sails and thus became half picturesque in spite of the keen northwestern trades the cloudless sunshiny mornings tempted these southerners back to their native al fresco existence they not only basked in the sun but many of their household duties and even the mysteries of their toilet were performed in the open air they did not seem to care to penetrate into the desolate region behind them their halfamphibious habit kept them near the waters edge and richard jarman after taking his limited walks for the first few mornings in another direction found it no longer necessary to avoid the locality and even forgot their propinquity  but one morning as the fog was clearing away and the sparkle of the distant sea was beginning to show from his window he rose from his belated breakfast to fetch water from the breaker outside which had to be replenished weekly from sancelito as there was no spring in his vicinity as he opened the door he was inexpressibly startled by the figure of a young woman standing in front of it who however half fearfully half laughingly withdrew before him but his own manifest disturbance apparently gave her courage  i jess was looking at that thing she said bashfully pointing to the semaphore  he was still more astonished for looking at her dark eyes and olive complexion he had expected her to speak italian or broken english and possibly because for a long time he had seen and known little of women he was quite struck with her good looks he hesitated stammered and then said  wont you come in  she drew back still farther and made a rapid gesture of negation with her head her hand and even her whole lithe figure then she said with a decided american intonation  no sir  why not said jarman mechanically  the girl sidled up against the cabin keeping her eyes fixed on jarman with a certain youthful shrewdness  oh you know she said  i really do not tell me why  she drew herself up against the wall a little proudly though still youthfully with her hands behind her  i aint that kind of girl she said simply  the blood rushed to jarmans checks dissipated and abandoned as his life had been small respecter of women as he was he was shocked and shamed knowing too as he did how absorbed he was in other things he was indignant because not guilty  do as you please then he said shortly and reentered the cabin but the next moment he saw his error in betraying an irritation that was open to misconstruction he came out again scarcely looking at the girl who was lounging away  do you want me to explain to you how the thing works he said indifferently i cant show you unless a ship comes in  the girls eyes brightened softly as she turned to him  do tell me she said with an anticipatory smile and flash of white teeth wont you  she certainly was very pretty and simple in spite of her late speech jarman briefly explained to her the movements of the semaphore arms and their different significance she listened with her capped head a little on one side like an attentive bird and her arms unconsciously imitating the signs certainly for all that she spoke like an american her gesticulation was italian  and then she said triumphantly when he paused when the sailors see that sign up they know they are coming in the harbor  jarman smiled as he had not smiled since he had been there he corrected this mistake of her eager haste to show her intelligence and taking the telescope pointed out the other semaphorea thin black outline on a distant inland hill he then explained how his signs were repeated by that instrument to san francisco  my why i always allowed that was only the cross stuck up in the lone mountain cemetery she said  you are a catholic  i reckon  and you are an italian  father is but mother was a merikan same as me mothers dead  and your father is the fisherman yonder  yesbut with a look of pride hes got the biggest boat of any  and only you and your family are ashore here  yes and sometimes mark she laughed an odd little laugh  mark whos he he asked quickly  he had not noticed the sudden coquettish pose and halfaffected bashfulness of the girl he was thinking only of the possibility of detection by strangers  oh he is marco franti but i call him mark its the same name you know and it makes him mad said the girl with the same suggestion of archness and coquetry  but all this was lost on jarman  oh another italian he said relieved she turned away a little awkwardly when he added but you havent told me your name you know  cara  carathats dear in italian isnt it he said with a reminiscence of the opera and a half smile  yes she said a little scornfully but it means carlottacharlotte you know some girls call me charley she said hurriedly  i seecaraor carlotta franti  to his surprise she burst into a peal of laughter  i reckon not yet franti is marks name not mine mine is muranocarlotta murano goodby she moved away then stopped suddenly and said im comin again some time when the thing is working and with a nod of her head ran away he looked after her could see the outlines of her youthful figure in her slim cotton gownlimp and clinging in the damp sea air and the sudden revelation of her bare ankles thrust stockingless into canvas shoes  he went back into his cabin when presently his attention was engrossed by an incoming vessel he made the signals half expecting almost hoping that the girl would return to watch him but her figure was already lost in the sand dunes yet he fancied he still heard the echoes of her voice and his own in this cabin which had so long been dumb and voiceless and he now started at every sound for the first time he became aware of the dreadful disorder and untidiness of its uninvaded privacy he could scarcely believe he had been living with his stove his bed and cooking utensils all in one corner of the barnlike room and he began to put them to rights in a rough hard formality strongly suggestive of his convict experience he rolled up his blankets into a hard cylinder at the head of his cot he scraped out his kettles and saucepans and even washed down the floor afterwards sprinkling clean dry sand hot with the noonday sunshine on its halfdried boards in arranging these domestic details he had to change the position of a little mirror and glancing at it for the first time in many days he was dissatisfied with his straggling beardgrown during his voyage from australiaand although he had retained it as a disguise he at once shaved it off leaving only a mustache and revealing a face from which a healthier life and outofdoor existence had removed the last traces of vice and dissipation but he did not know it  all the next day he thought of his fair visitor and found himself often repeating her odd remark that she was not that kind of girl with a smile that was alternately significant or vacant evidently she could take care of herself he thought although her very good looks no doubt had exposed her to the rude attentions of fishermen or the common drift of san francisco wharves perhaps this was why her father brought her here when the day passed and she came not he began vaguely to wonder if he had been rude to her perhaps he had taken her simple remark too seriously perhaps she had expected he would only laugh and had found him dull and stupid perhaps he had thrown away an opportunity an opportunity for what to renew his old life and habits no no the horrors of his recent imprisonment and escape were still too fresh in his memory he was not safe yet then he wondered if he had not grown spiritless and pigeonlivered in his solitude and loneliness the next day he searched for her with his glass and saw her playing with one of the children on the beacha very picture of child or nymphlike innocence perhaps it was because she was not that kind of girl that she had attracted him he laughed bitterly yes that was very funny he an escaped convict drawn towards honest simple innocence yet he knewhe was positivehe had not thought of any ill when he spoke to her he took a singular a ridiculous pride in and credit to himself for that he repeated it incessantly to himself then what made her angry himself the devil did he carry then the record of his past life forever in his facein his speechin his manners the thought made him sullen the next day he would not look towards the shore it was wonderful what excitement and satisfaction he got out of that strange act of selfdenial it made the day seem full that had been so vacant before yet he could not tell why or wherefore he felt injured but he rather liked it yet in the night he was struck with the idea that she might have gone back to san francisco and he lay awake longing for the morning light to satisfy him yet when the fog cleared and from a nearer point behind a sand dune he discovered by the aid of his glass that she was seated on the sunwarmed sands combing out her long hair like a mermaid he immediately returned to the cabin and that morning looked no more that way in the afternoon there being no sails in sight he turned aside from the bay and walked westward towards the ocean halting only at the leaguelong line of foam which marked the breaking pacific surges here he was surprised to see a little child halfnaked following barefooted the creeping line of spume or running after the detached and quivering scraps of foam that chased each other over the wet sand and only a little further on to come upon cara herself sitting with her elbows on her knees and her round chin in her hands apparently gazing over the waste of waters before her a sudden and inexplicable shyness overtook him he hesitated and stepped halfhidden in a gully between the sand dunes  as yet he had not been observed the young girl called to the child and suddenly rising threw off her red cap and shawl and quietly began to disrobe herself a couple of coarse towels were at her feet jarman instantly comprehended that she was going to bathe with the child she undoubtedly knew as well as he did that she was safe in that solitude that no one could intrude upon her privacy from the bay shore nor from the desolate inland trail to the sea without her knowledge of his own contiguity she had evidently taken no thought believing him safely housed in his cabin beside the semaphore she lifted her hands and with a sudden movement shook out her long hair and let it fall down her back at the same moment that her unloosened blouse began to slip from her shoulders richard jarman turned quickly and walked noiselessly and rapidly away until the little hillock had shut out the beach  his retreat was as sudden unreasoning and unpremeditated as his intrusion it was not like himself he knew and yet it was as perfectly instinctive and natural as if he had intruded upon a sister in the south seas he had seen native girls diving beside the vessels for coins but they had provoked no such instinct as that which possessed him now more than that he swept a quick wrathful glance along the horizon on either side and then mounting a remote hillock which still hid him from the beach he sat there and kept watch and ward from time to time the strong seabreeze brought him the sound of infantine screams and shouts of girlish laughter from the unseen shore he only looked the more keenly and suspiciously for any wandering trespasser and did not turn his head he lay there nearly half an hour and when the sounds had ceased rose and made his way slowly back to the cabin he had not gone many yards before he heard the twitter of voices and smothered laughter behind him he turned it was cara and the childa girl of six or seven caras face was rosypossibly from her bath and possibly from some shamefaced consciousness he slackened his pace and as they ranged beside him said goodmorning  lord said cara stifling another laugh we didnt know you were around we thought you were always tending your telegraph didnt we lucy to the child who was convulsed with mirth and sheepishness why weve been taking a wash in the sea she tried to gather up her long hair which had been left to stray over her shoulders and dry in the sunlight and even made a slight pretense of trying to conceal the wet towels they were carrying  jarman did not laugh if you had told me he said gravely i could have kept watch for you with my glass while you were there i could see further than you  tould you see us asked the little girl with hopeful vivacity  no said jarman with masterly evasion there are little sandhills between this and the beach  then how tould other people see us persisted the child  jarman could see that the older girl was evidently embarrassed and changed the subject i sometimes go out he said when i can see there are no vessels in sight and i take ray glass with me i can always get back in time to make signals i thought in fact he said glancing at caras brightening face that i might get as far as your house on the shore some day to his surprise her embarrassment suddenly seemed to increase although she had looked relieved before and she did not reply after a moment she said abruptly  did you ever see the sealions  no said jarman  not the big ones on seal rock beyond the cliffs continued the girl in real astonishment  no repeated jarman i never walked in that direction he vaguely remembered that they were a curiosity which sometimes attracted parties thither and for that reason he had avoided the spot  why i have sailed all around the rock in fathers boat continued cara with importance thats the best way to see em and folks from frisco sometimes takes a sail out there just on purposeits too sandy to walk or drive there but its only a step from here look here she said suddenly and frankly opening her fine eyes upon him im going to take lucy there tomorrow and ill show you jarman felt his cheeks flush quickly with a pleasure that embarrassed him it wont take long added cara mistaking his momentary hesitation and you can leave your telegraph alone nobody will be there so no one will see you and nobody know it  he would have gone then anyway he knew yet in his absurd selfconsciousness he was glad that her last suggestion had relieved him of a sense of reckless compliance he assented eagerly when with a wave of her hand a flash of her white teeth and the same abruptness she had shown at their last parting she caught lucy by the arm and darted away in a romping race to her dwelling jarman started after her he had not wanted to go to her fathers house particularly but why was she evidently as averse to it with the subtle pleasure that this admission gave him there was a faint stirring of suspicion  it was gone when he found her and lucy the next morning radiant with the sunshine before his door the restraint of their previous meetings had been removed in some mysterious way and they chatted gayly as they walked towards the cliffs she asked him frankly many questions about himself why he had come there and if he wasnt lonely she answered franklyi fear much more frankly than he answered herthe many questions he asked her about herself and her friends when they reached the cliffs they descended to the beach which they found deserted before themit seemed scarce a pistol shot from the shore arose a high broad rock beaten at its base by the long pacific surf on which a number of shapeless animals were uncouthly disporting this was seal rock the goal of their journey  yet after a few moments they no longer looked at it but seated on the sand with lucy gathering shells at the waters edge they continued their talk presently the talk became eager confidences and thenthere were long and dangerous lapses of silence when both were fain to make perfunctory talk with lucy on the beach after one of those silences jarman said  do you know i rather thought yesterday you didnt want me to come to your fathers house why was that  because marco was there said the girl frankly  what had he to do with it said jarman abruptly  he wants to marry me  and do you want to marry him said jarman quickly  no said the girl passionately  why dont you get rid of him then  i cant hes hiding herehes fathers friend  hiding whats he been doing  stealing stealing golddust from miners i never cared for him anyway and i hate a thief  she looked up quickly jarman had risen to his feet his face turned to sea  what are you looking at she said wonderingly  a ship said jarman in a strange hoarse voice i must hurry back and signal im afraid i havent even time to walk with youi must run for it goodby  he turned without offering his hand and ran hurriedly in the direction of the semaphore  cara discomfited turned her black eyes to the sea but it seemed empty as before no sail no ship on the horizon line only a little schooner slowly beating out of the gate ah well it no doubt was therethat sailthough she could not see it how keen and farseeing his handsome honest eyes were she heaved a little sigh and calling lucy to her side began to make her way homeward but she kept her eyes on the semaphore it seemed to her the next thing to seeing himthis man she was beginning to love she waited for the gaunt arms to move with the signal of the vessel he had seen but strange to say it was motionless he must have been mistaken  all this however was driven from her mind in the excitement that she found on her return thrilling her own family they had been warned that a police boat with detectives on board had been dispatched from san francisco to the cove luckily they had managed to convey the fugitive franti on board a coastwise schoonercara started as she remembered the one she had seen beating out of the gateand he was now safe from pursuit cara felt relieved at the same time she felt a strange joy at her heart which sent the conscious blood to her cheek she was not thinking of the escaped marco but of jarman later when the police boat arrivedwhether the detectives had been forewarned of marcos escape or notthey contented themselves with a formal search of the little fishinghut and departed but their boat remained lying off the shore  that night cara tossed sleeplessly on her bed she was sorry she had ever spoken of marco to jarman it was unnecessary now perhaps he disbelieved her and thought she loved marco perhaps that was the reason of his strange and abrupt leavetaking that afternoon she longed for the next day she could tell him everything now  towards morning she slept fitfully but was awakened by the sound of voices on the sands outside the hut its flimsy structure already warped by the fierce daylong sun allowed her through chinks and crevices not only to recognize the voices of the detectives but to hear distinctly what they said suddenly the name of jarman struck upon her ear she sat upright in bed breathless  are you sure its the same man asked a second voice  perfectly answered the first he was tracked to frisco but disappeared the day he landed we knew from our agents that he never left the bay and when we found that somebody answering his description got the post of telegraph operator out here we knew that we had spotted our man and the l250 sterling offered for his capture  but that was five months ago why didnt you take him then  couldnt for we couldnt hold him without the extradition papers from australia we sent for em theyre due today or tomorrow on the mail steamer  but he might have got away at any time  he couldnt without our knowing it dont you see every time the signals went up we in san francisco knew he was at his post we had him safe out here on these sandhills as if hed been under lock and key in frisco he was his own keeper and reported to us  but since youre here and expect the papers tomorrow why dont you cop him now  because there isnt a judge in san francisco that would hold him a moment unless he had those extradition papers before him hed be discharged and escape  then what are you going to do  as soon as the steamer is signaled in frisco well board her in the bay get the papers and drop down upon him  i see and as hes the signal man the darned fool  will give the signal himself  the laugh that followed was so cruel that the young girl shuddered but the next moment she slipped from the bed erect pale and determined  the voices seemed gradually to retreat she dressed herself hurriedly and passed noiselessly through the room of her still sleeping parent and passed out a gray fog was lifting slowly over the sands and sea and the police boat was gone she no longer hesitated but ran quickly in the direction of jarmans cabin as she ran her mind seemed to be swept clear of all illusion and fancy she saw plainly everything that had happened she knew the mystery of jarmans presence herethe secret of his lifethe dreadful cruelty of her remark to himthe man that she knew now she loved the sun was painting the black arms of the semaphore as she toiled over the last stretch of sand and knocked loudly at the door there was no reply she knocked again the cabin was silent had he already fledand without seeing her and knowing all she tried the handle of the door it yielded she stepped boldly into the room with his name upon her lips he was lying fully dressed upon his couch she ran eagerly to his side and stopped it needed only a single glance at his congested face his lips parted with his heavy breath to see that the man was hopelessly helplessly drunk  yet even then without knowing that it was her thoughtless speech which had driven him to seek this foolish oblivion of remorse and sorrow she saw only his helplessness she tried in vain to rouse him he only muttered a few incoherent words and sank back again she looked despairingly around something must be done the steamer might be visible at any moment ah yesthe telescope she seized it and swept the horizon there was a faint streak of haze against the line of sea and sky abreast the golden gate he had once told her what it meant it was the steamer a sudden thought leaped into her clear and active brain if the police boat should chance to see that haze too and saw no warning signal from the semaphore they would suspect something that signal must be made but not the right one she remembered quickly how he had explained to her the difference between the signals for a coasting steamer and the one that brought the mails at that distance the police boat could not detect whether the semaphores arms were extended to perfect right angles for the mail steamer or if the left arm slightly deflected for a coasting steamer she ran out to the windlass and seized the crank for a moment it defied her strength she redoubled her efforts it began to creak and groan the great arms were slowly uplifted and the signal made  but the familiar sounds of the moving machinery had pierced through jarmans sluggish consciousness as no other sound in heaven or earth could have done and awakened him to the one dominant sense he had leftthe habit of duty she heard him roll from the bed with an oath stumble to the door and saw him dash forward with an affrighted face and plunge his head into a bucket of water he emerged from it pale and dripping but with the full light of reason and consciousness in his eyes he started when he saw her even then she would have fled but he caught her firmly by the wrist  then with a hurried trembling voice she told him all and everything he listened in silence and only at the end raised her hand gravely to his lips  and now she added tremulously you must flyquickat once or it will be too late  but richard jarman walked slowly to the door of his cabin still holding her hand and said quietly pointing to his only chair  sit down we must talk first  what they said was never known but a few moments later they left the cabin jarman carrying in a small bag all his possessions and cara leaning on his arm an hour later the priest of the mission dolores was called upon to unite in matrimony a frank honestlooking sailor and an italian gypsylooking girl there were many hasty unions in those days and the holy church was only too glad to be able to give them its legal indorsement but the good padre was a little sorry for the honest sailor and gave the girl some serious advice  the san francisco papers the next morning threw some dubious light upon the matter in a paragraph headed another police fiasco  we understand that the indefatigable police of san francisco after ascertaining that marco franti the noted golddust thief was hiding on the shore near the presidio proceeded there with great solemnity and arrived as usual a few hours after their man had escaped but the climax of incapacity was reached when as it is alleged the sweetheart of the absconding franti and daughter of a brother fisherman eloped still later and joined her lover under the very noses of the police the attempt of the detectives to excuse themselves at headquarters by reporting that they were also on the track of an alleged escaped sydney duck was received with the derision and skepticism it deserved as it seemed that these worthies mistook the mail steamer which they should have boarded to get certain extradition papers for a coasting steamer    it was not until four years later that murano was delighted to recognize in the husband of his longlost daughter a very rich cattleowner in southern california called jarman but he never knew that he had been an escaped convict from sydney who had lately received a full pardon through the instrumentality of divers distinguished people in australia     an esmeralda of rocky canyon   it is to be feared that the hero of this chronicle began life as an impostor he was offered to the credulous and sympathetic family of a san francisco citizen as a lamb who unless bought as a playmate for the children would inevitably pass into the butchers hands a combination of refined sensibility and urban ignorance of nature prevented them from discerning certain glaring facts that betrayed his caprid origin so a ribbon was duly tied round his neck and in pleasing emulation of the legendary mary he was taken to school by the confiding children here alas the fraud was discovered and history was reversed by his being turned out by the teacher because he was not a lamb at school nevertheless the kindhearted mother of the family persisted in retaining him on the plea that he might yet become useful to her husbands feeble suggestion of gloves she returned a scornful negative and spoke of the weakly infant of a neighbor who might later receive nourishment from this providential animal but even this hope was destroyed by the eventual discovery of his sex nothing remained now but to accept him as an ordinary kid and to find amusement in his accomplishmentseating climbing and butting it must be confessed that these were of a superior quality a capacity to eat everything from a cambric handkerchief to an election poster an agility which brought him even to the roofs of houses and a power of overturning by a single push the chubbiest child who opposed him made him a fearful joy to the nursery this last quality was incautiously developed in him by a negro boyservant who later was hurriedly propelled down a flight of stairs by his too proficient scholar having once tasted victory billy needed no further incitement to his performances the small wagon which he sometimes consented to draw for the benefit of the children never hindered his attempts to butt the passerby on the contrary on wellknown scientific principles he added the impact of the bodies of the children projected over his head in his charge and the infelicitous pedestrian found himself not only knocked off his legs by billy but bombarded by the whole nursery  delightful as was this recreation to juvenile limbs it was felt to be dangerous to the adult public indignant protestations were made and as billy could not be kept in the house he may be said to have at last butted himself out of that sympathetic family and into a hard and unfeeling world one morning he broke his tether in the small back yard for several days thereafter he displayed himself in guilty freedom on the tops of adjacent walls and outhouses the san francisco suburb where his credulous protectors lived was still in a volcanic state of disruption caused by the grading of new streets through rocks and sandhills in consequence the roofs of some houses were on the level of the doorsteps of others and were especially adapted to billys performances one afternoon to the admiring and perplexed eyes of the nursery he was discovered standing on the apex of a neighbors new elizabethan chimney on a space scarcely larger than the crown of a hat calmly surveying the world beneath him high infantile voices appealed to him in vain baby arms were outstretched to him in hopeless invitation he remained exalted and obdurate like miltons hero probably by his own merit raised to that bad eminence indeed there was already something satanic in his budding horns and pointed mask as the smoke curled softly around him then he appropriately vanished and san francisco knew him no more at the same time however one owen mginnis a neighboring sandhill squatter also disappeared leaving san francisco for the southern mines and he was said to have taken billy with himfor no conceivable reason except for companionship howbeit it was the turningpoint of billys career such restraint as kindness civilization or even policemen had exercised upon his nature was gone he retained i fear a certain wicked intelligence picked up in san francisco with the newspapers and theatrical and election posters he had consumed he reappeared at rocky canyon among the miners as an exceedingly agile chamois with the low cunning of a satyr that was all that civilization had done for him  if mr mginnis had fondly conceived that he would make billy useful as well as companionable he was singularly mistaken horses and mules were scarce in rocky canyon and he attempted to utilize billy by making him draw a small cart laden with auriferous earth from his claim to the river billy rapidly gaining strength was quite equal to the task but alas not his inborn propensity an incautious gesture from the first passing miner billy chose to construe into the usual challenge lowering his head from which his budding horns had been already pruned by his master he instantly went for his challenger cart and all again the scientific law already pointed out prevailed with the shock of the onset the entire contents of the cart arose and poured over the astonished miner burying him from sight in any other but a californian miningcamp such a propensity in a draught animal would have been condemned on account of the damage and suffering it entailed but in rocky canyon it proved unprofitable to the owner from the very amusement and interest it excited miners lay in wait for billy with a greenhorn or newcomer whom they would put up to challenge the animal by some indiscreet gesture in this way hardly a cartload of paygravel ever arrived safely at its destination and the unfortunate mginnis was compelled to withdraw billy as a beast of burden it was whispered that so great had his propensity become under repeated provocation that mginnis himself was no longer safe going ahead of his cart one day to remove a fallen bough from the trail billy construed the act of stooping into a playful challenge from his masterwith the inevitable result  the next day mginnis appeared with a wheelbarrow but without billy from that day he was relegated to the rocky crags above the camp from whence he was only lured occasionally by the mischievous miners who wished to exhibit his peculiar performances for although billy had ample food and sustenance among the crags he had still a civilized longing for posters and whenever a circus a concert or a political meeting was billed in the settlement he was on hand while the paste was yet fresh and succulent in this way it was averred that he once removed a gigantic theatre bill setting forth the charms of the sacramento pet and being caught in the act by the advance agent was pursued through the main street carrying the damp bill on his horns eventually affixing it after his own peculiar fashion on the back of judge boompointer who was standing in front of his own courthouse  in connection with the visits of this young lady another story concerning billy survives in the legends of rocky canyon colonel starbottle was at that time passing through the settlement on election business and it was part of his chivalrous admiration for the sex to pay a visit to the pretty actress the single waitingroom of the little hotel gave upon the veranda which was also level with the street after a brief yet gallant interview in which he oratorically expressed the gratitude of the settlement with oldfashioned southern courtesy colonel starbottle lifted the chubby little hand of the pet to his lips and with a low bow backed out upon the veranda but the pet was astounded by his instant reappearance and by his apparently casting himself passionately and hurriedly at her feet it is needless to say that he was followed closely by billy who from the street had casually noticed him and construed his novel exit into an ungentlemanly challenge  billys visits however became less frequent and as rocky canyon underwent the changes incidental to mining settlements he was presently forgotten in the invasion of a few southwestern families and the adoption of amusements less practical and turbulent than he had afforded it was alleged that he was still seen in the more secluded fastnesses of the mountains having reverted to a wild state and it was suggested by one or two of the more adventurous that he might yet become edible and a fair object of chase a traveler through the upper pass of the canyon related how he had seen a savagelooking hairy animal like a small elk perched upon inaccessible rocks but always out of gunshot but these and other legends were set at naught and overthrown by an unexpected incident  the pioneer coach was toiling up the long grade towards skinners pass when yuba bill suddenly pulled up with his feet on the brake  jimminy he ejaculated drawing a deep breath  the startled passenger beside him on the box followed the direction of his eyes through an opening in the wayside pines he could see a few hundred yards away a cuplike hollow in the hillside of the vividest green in the centre a young girl of fifteen or sixteen was dancing and keeping step to the castanet click of a pair of bones such as negro minstrels use held in her hands above her head but more singular still a few paces before her a large goat with its neck roughly wreathed with flowers and vines was taking ungainly bounds and leaps in imitation of its companion the wild background of the sierras the pastoral hollow the incongruousness of the figures and the vivid color of the girls red flannel petticoat showing beneath her calico skirt that had been pinned around her waist made a striking picture which by this time had attracted all eyes perhaps the dancing of the girl suggested a negro breakdown rather than any known sylvan measure but all this and even the clatter of the bones was made gracious by the distance  esmeralda by the living harry shouted the excited passenger on the box  yuba bill took his feet off the brake and turned a look of deep scorn upon his companion as he gathered the reins again  its that blanked goat outer rocky canyon beyond and polly harkness how did she ever come to take up with him  nevertheless as soon as the coach reached rocky canyon the story was quickly told by the passengers corroborated by yuba bill and highly colored by the observer on the boxseat harkness was known to be a newcomer who lived with his wife and only daughter on the other side of skinners pass he was a logger and charcoalburner who had eaten his way into the serried ranks of pines below the pass and established in these efforts an almost insurmountable cordon of fallen trees stripped bark and charcoal pits around the clearing where his rude log hut stoodwhich kept his seclusion unbroken he was said to be a halfsavage mountaineer from georgia in whose rude fastnesses he had distilled unlawful whiskey and that his tastes and habits unfitted him for civilization his wife chewed and smoked he was believed to make a fiery brew of his own from acorns and pine nuts he seldom came to rocky canyon except for provisions his logs were slipped down a shoot or slide to the river where they voyaged once a month to a distant mill but he did not accompany them the daughter seldom seen at rocky canyon was a halfgrown girl brown as autumn fern wildeyed disheveled in a homespun skirt sunbonnet and boys brogans such were the plain facts which skeptical rocky canyon opposed to the passengers legends nevertheless some of the younger miners found it not out of their way to go over skinners pass on the journey to the river but with what success was not told it was said however that a celebrated new york artist making a tour of california was on the coach one day going through the pass and preserved the memory of what he saw there in a wellknown picture entitled dancing nymph and satyr said by competent critics to be replete with the study of greek life this did not affect rocky canyon where the study of mythology was presumably displaced by an experience of more wonderful fleshandblood people but later it was remembered with some significance  among the improvements already noted a zinc and wooden chapel had been erected in the main street where a certain popular revivalist preacher of a peculiar southwestern sect regularly held exhortatory services his rude emotional power over his ignorant fellowsectarians was well known while curiosity drew others his effect upon the females of his flock was hysterical and sensational women prematurely aged by frontier drudgery and childbearing girls who had known only the rigors and pains of a halfequipped illnourished youth in their battling with the hard realities of nature around them all found a strange fascination in the extravagant glories and privileges of the unseen world he pictured to them which they might have found in the fairy tales and nursery legends of civilized children had they known them personally he was not attractive his thin pointed face and bushy hair rising on either side of his square forehead in two rounded knots and his long straggling wiry beard dropping from a strong neck and shoulders were indeed of a common southwestern type yet in him they suggested something more this was voiced by a miner who attended his first service and as the reverend mr withholder rose in the pulpit the former was heard to audibly ejaculate dod blastedif it aint billy but when on the following sunday to everybodys astonishment polly harkness in a new white muslin frock and broadbrimmed leghorn hat appeared before the church door with the real billy and exchanged conversation with the preacher the likeness was appalling  i grieve to say that the goat was at once christened by rocky canyon as the reverend billy and the minister himself was billys brother more than that when an attempt was made by outsiders during the service to inveigle the tethered goat into his old butting performances and he took not the least notice of their insults and challenges the epithet blanked hypocrite was added to his title  had he really reformed had his pastoral life with his nymphlike mistress completely cured him of his pugnacious propensity or had he simply found it was inconsistent with his dancing and seriously interfered with his fancy steps had he found tracts and hymnbooks were as edible as theatre posters these were questions that rocky canyon discussed lightly although there was always the more serious mystery of the relations of the reverend mr withholder polly harkness and the goat towards each other the appearance of polly at church was no doubt due to the ministers active canvass of the districts but had he ever heard of pollys dancing with the goat and where in this plain angular badly dressed polly was hidden that beautiful vision of the dancing nymph which had enthralled so many and when had billy ever given any suggestion of his terpsichorean abilitiesbefore or since were there any points of the kind to be discerned in him now none was it not more probable that the reverend mr withholder had himself been dancing with polly and been mistaken for the goat passengers who could have been so deceived with regard to pollys beauty might have as easily mistaken the minister for billy about this time another incident occurred which increased the mystery  the only male in the settlement who apparently dissented from the popular opinion regarding polly was a newcomer jack filgee while discrediting her performance with the goatwhich he had never seenhe was evidently greatly prepossessed with the girl herself unfortunately he was equally addicted to drinking and as he was exceedingly shy and timid when sober and quite unpresentable at other times his wooing if it could be so called progressed but slowly yet when he found that polly went to church he listened so far to the exhortations of the reverend mr withholder as to promise to come to bible class immediately after the sunday service it was a hot afternoon and jack who had kept sober for two days incautiously fortified himself for the ordeal by taking a drink before arriving he was nervously early and immediately took a seat in the empty church near the open door the quiet of the building the drowsy buzzing of flies and perhaps the soporific effect of the liquor caused his eyes to close and his head to fall forward on his breast repeatedly he was recovering himself for the fourth time when he suddenly received a violent cuff on the ear and was knocked backward off the bench on which he was sitting that was all he knew  he picked himself up with a certain dignity partly new to him and partly the result of his condition and staggered somewhat bruised and disheveled to the nearest saloon here a few frequenters who had seen him pass who knew his errand and the devotion to polly which had induced it exhibited a natural concern  hows things down at the gospel shop said one look as ef youd been wrastlin with the sperit jack  old man must hev exhorted powful said another glancing at his disordered sunday attire  aint ben hevin a row with polly im told she slings an awful left  jack instead of replying poured out a dram of whiskey drank it and putting down his glass leaned heavily against the counter as he surveyed his questioners with a sorrow chastened by reproachful dignity  im a stranger here gentlemen he said slowly yeve known me only a little but ez yeve seen me both blind drunk and sober i reckon yeve caught on to my ginral gait now i wanter put it to you ez fairminded men ef you ever saw me strike a parson  no said a chorus of sympathetic voices the barkeeper however with a swift recollection of polly and the reverend withholder and some possible contingent jealousy in jack added prudently not yet  the chorus instantly added reflectively well no not yet  did ye ever continued jack solemnly know me to cuss sass bullyrag or say anything agin parsons or the church  no said the crowd overthrowing prudence in curiosity ye never didwe swear it and now whats up  i aint what you call a member in good standin he went on artistically protracting his climax i aint ben convicted o sin i aint a meek an lowly follower i aint ben exactly what i orter ben i hevnt lived anywhere up to my lights but is thet a reason why a parson should strike me  why what when did he who did asked the eager crowd with one voice  jack then painfully related how he had been invited by the reverend mr withholder to attend the bible class how he had arrived early and found the church empty how he had taken a seat near the door to be handy when the parson came how he just felt kinder kam and good listenin to the flies buzzing and must have fallen asleeponly he pulled himself up every timethough after all it warnt no crime to fall asleep in an empty church how all of a suddent the parson came in give him a clip side o the head and knocked him off the bench and left him there  but what did he say queried the crowd  nuthin afore i could get up he got away  are you sure it was him they asked you know you say you was asleep  am i sure repeated jack scornfully dont i know thet face and beard didnt i feel it hangin over me  what are you going to do about it continued the crowd eagerly  wait till he comes outand youll see said jack with dignity  this was enough for the crowd they gathered excitedly at the door where jack was already standing looking towards the church the moments dragged slowly it might be a long meeting suddenly the church door opened and a figure appeared looking up and down the street jack coloredhe recognized pollyand stepped out into the road the crowd delicately but somewhat disappointedly drew back in the saloon they did not care to interfere in that sort of thing  polly saw him and came hurriedly towards him she was holding something in her hand  i picked this up on the church floor she said shyly so i reckoned you had ben therethough the parson said you hadntand i just excused myself and ran out to give it ye its yourn aint it she held up a gold specimen pin which he had put on in honor of the occasion i had a harder time though to git this yerits yourn toofor billy was laying down in the yard back o the church and just comfbly swallerin it  who said jack quickly  billymy goat  jack drew a long breath and glanced back at the saloon ye aint goin back to class now are ye he said hurriedly ef you aint illill see ye home  i dont mind said polly demurely if it aint takin ye outer yur way  jack offered his arm and hurrying past the saloon the happy pair were soon on the road to skinners pass   jack did not i regret to say confess his blunder but left the reverend mr withholder to remain under suspicion of having committed an unprovoked assault and battery it was characteristic of rocky canyon however that this suspicion far from injuring his clerical reputation incited a respect that had been hitherto denied him a man who could hit out straight from the shoulder had in the language of the critics suthin in him oddly enough the crowd that had at first sympathized with jack now began to admit provocations his subsequent silence a disposition when questioned on the subject to smile inanely and later when insidiously asked if he had ever seen polly dancing with the goat his bursting into uproarious laughter completely turned the current of opinion against him the public mind however soon became engrossed by a more interesting incident  the reverend mr withholder had organized a series of biblical tableaux at skinnerstown for the benefit of his church illustrations were to be given of rebecca at the well the finding of moses joseph and his brethren but rocky canyon was more particularly excited by the announcement that polly harkness would personate jephthahs daughter on the evening of the performance however it was found that this tableau had been withdrawn and another substituted for reasons not given rocky canyon naturally indignant at this omission to represent native talent indulged in a hundred wild surmises but it was generally believed that jack filgees revengeful animosity to the reverend mr withholder was at the bottom of it jack as usual smiled inanely but nothing was to be got from him it was not until a few days later when another incident crowned the climax of these mysteries that a full disclosure came from his lips  one morning a flaming poster was displayed at rocky canyon with a charming picture of the sacramento pet in the briefest of skirts disporting with a tambourine before a goat garlanded with flowers who bore however an undoubted likeness to billy the text in enormous letters and bristling with points of admiration stated that the pet would appear as esmeralda assisted by a performing goat especially trained by the gifted actress the goat would dance play cards and perform those tricks of magic familiar to the readers of victor hugos beautiful story of the hunchback of notre dame and finally knock down and overthrow the designing seducer captain phoebus the marvelous spectacle would be produced under the patronage of the hon colonel starbottle and the mayor of skinnerstown  as all rocky canyon gathered openmouthed around the poster jack demurely joined the group every eye was turned upon him  it dont look as if yer polly was in this show any more than she was in the tablows said one trying to conceal his curiosity under a slight sneer she dont seem to be doin any dancin  she never did any dancin said jack with a smile  never did then what was all these yarns about her dancin up at the pass  it was the sacramento pet who did all the dancin polly only lent the goat ye see the pet kinder took a shine to billy arter he bowled starbottle over thet day at the hotel and she thought she might teach him tricks so she did doing all her teachin and stagerehearsin up there at the pass sos to be outer sight and keep this thing dark she bribed polly to lend her the goat and keep her secret and polly never let on a word to anybody but me  then it was the pet that yuba bill saw dancin from the coach  yes  and that yer artist from new york painted as an imp and satire  yes  then thats how polly didnt show up in them tablows at skinnerstown it was withholder who kinder smelt a rat eh and found out it was only a theayter gal all along that did the dancin  well you see said jack with affected hesitation thets another yarn i dont know mebbe ez i oughter tell it et aint got anything to do with this advertisement o the pet and might be rough on old man withholder ye mustnt ask me boys  but there was that in his eye and above all in this lazy procrastination of the true humorist when he is approaching his climax which rendered the crowd clamorous and unappeasable they would have the story  seeing which jack leaned back against a rock with great gravity put his hands in his pockets looked discontentedly at the ground and began you see boys old parson withholder had heard all these yarns about polly and thet trickgoat and he kinder reckoned that she might do for some one of his tablows so he axed her if shed mind standin with the goat and a tambourine for jephthahs daughter at about the time when old jeph comes home sailin in and vowin hell kill the first thing he seesjest as it is in the bible story well polly didnt like to say it wasnt her that performed with the goat but the pet for thet would give the pet dead away so polly agrees to come thar with the goat and rehearse the tablow well pollys thar a little shy and billyyou bet hes all there and ready for the fun but the darned fool who plays jephthah aint worth shucks and when he comes in he does nothin but grin at polly and seem skeert at the goat this makes old withholder jest wild and at last he goes on the platform hisself to show them how the thing oughter be done so he comes bustlin and prancin in and ketches sight o polly dancin in with the goat to welcome him and then he clasps his handssoand drops on his knees and hangs down his headsoand sez me chyld me vow oh heavens but jest then billywhos gettin rather tired o all this foolishnesskinder slues round on his hind legs and ketches sight o the parson jack paused a moment and thrusting his hands still deeper in his pockets said lazily i dont know if you fellers have noticed how much old withholder looks like billy  there was a rapid and impatient chorus of yes yes and go on  well continued jack when billy sees withholder kneelin thar with his head down he gives a kind o joyous leap and claps his hoofs together ez much ez to say im on in this scene drops his own head and jest lights out for the parson  and butts him clean through the side scenes into the street interrupted a delighted auditor  but jacks face never changed ye think so he said gravely but thets jest whar ye slip up and thets jest whar billy slipped up he added slowly mebbe yeve noticed too thet the parsons built kinder solid about the head and shoulders it mought hev ben thet or thet billy didnt get a fair start but thet goat went down on his fore legs like a shot and the parson gave one heave and jest scooted him off the platform then the parson reckoned thet this yer tablow had better be left out as thar didnt seem to be any other man who could play jephthah and it wasnt dignified for him to take the part but the parson allowed thet it might be a great moral lesson to billy  and it was for from that moment billy never attempted to butt again he performed with great docility later on in the pets engagement at skinnerstown he played a distinguished role throughout the provinces he had had the advantages of art from the pet and of simplicity from polly but only rocky canyon knew that his real education had come with his first rehearsal with the reverend mr withholder     dick spindlers family christmas   there was surprise and sometimes disappointment in rough and ready when it was known that dick spindler intended to give a family christmas party at his own house that he should take an early opportunity to celebrate his good fortune and show hospitality was only expected from the man who had just made a handsome strike on his claim but that it should assume so conservative oldfashioned and respectable a form was quite unlookedfor by rough and ready and was thought by some a trifle pretentious there were not halfadozen families in rough and ready nobody ever knew before that spindler had any relations and this ringing in of strangers to the settlement seemed to indicate at least a lack of public spirit he might urged one of his critics hev given the boysthat had worked alongside o him in the ditches by day and slung lies with him around the campfire by nighthe might hev given them a square blow out and kep the leavins for his old spindler crew just as other families do why when old man scudder had his houseraisin last year his family lived for a week on what was left over arter the boys had waltzed through the house that nightand the scudders warnt strangers either it was also evident that there was an uneasy feeling that spindlers action indicated an unhallowed leaning towards the minority of respectability and exclusiveness and a desertionwithout the excuse of matrimonyof the convivial and independent bachelor majority of rough and ready  ef he was stuck after some gal and was kinder looking ahead id hev understood it argued another critic  dont ye be too sure he aint said uncle jim starbuck gloomily yell find that some blamed woman is at the bottom of this yer family gathering that and trouble ez almost all theyre made for  there happened to be some truth in this dark prophecy but none of the kind that the misogynist supposed in fact spindler had called a few evenings before at the house of the rev mr saltover and mrs saltover having one of her saleratus headaches had turned him over to her widow sister mrs huldy price who obediently bestowed upon him that practical and critical attention which she divided with the stocking she was darning she was a woman of thirtyfive of singular nerve and practical wisdom who had once smuggled her wounded husband home from a border affray calmly made coffee for his deceived pursuers while he lay hidden in the loft walked four miles for that medical assistance which arrived too late to save him buried him secretly in his own quarter section with only one other witness and mourner and so saved her position and property in that wild community who believed he had fled there was very little of this experience to be traced in her round freshcolored brunette cheek her calm black eyes set in a prickly hedge of stiff lashes her plump figure or her frank courageous laugh the latter appeared as a smile when she welcomed mr spindler she hadnt seen him for a coons age but reckoned he was busy fixin up his new house  well yes said spindler with a slight hesitation ye see im reckonin to hev a kinder christmas gatherin of myhe was about to say folks but dismissed it for relations and finally settled upon relatives as being more correct in a preachers house  mrs price thought it a very good idea christmas was the natural season for the family to gather to see whos here and whos there whos gettin on and who isnt and whos dead and buried it was lucky for them who were so placed that they could do so and be joyful her invincible philosophy probably carried her past any dangerous recollections of the lonely grave in kansas and holding up the stocking to the light she glanced cheerfully along its level to mr spindlers embarrassed face by the fire  well i cant say much ez to that responded spindler still awkwardly for you see i dont know much about it anyway  how long since youve seen em asked mrs price apparently addressing herself to the stocking  spindler gave a weak laugh well you see ef it comes to that ive never seen em  mrs price put the stocking in her lap and opened her direct eyes on spindler never seen em she repeated then theyre not near relations  there are three cousins said spindler checking them off on his fingers a halfuncle a kind of brotherinlawthat is the brother of my sisterinlaws second husbandand a niece thats six  but if youve not seen them i suppose theyve corresponded with you said mrs price  theyve nearly all of em written to me for money seeing my name in the paper ez hevin made a strike returned spindler simply and hevin sent it i jest know their addresses  oh said mrs price returning to the stocking  something in the tone of her ejaculation increased spindlers embarrassment but it also made him desperate you see mrs price he blurted out i oughter tell ye that i reckon they are the folks that hevnt got on dont you see and so it seemed only the square thing for me ez had got on to give them a sort o christmas festival suthin dont ye know like what your brotherinlaw was sayin last sunday in the pulpit about this yer peace and goodwill twixt man and man  mrs price looked again at the man before her his sallow perplexed face exhibited some doubt yet a certain determination regarding the prospect the quotation had opened to him a very good idea mr spindler and one that does you great credit she said gravely  im mighty glad to hear you say so mrs price he said with an accent of great relief for i reckoned to ask you a great favor you see he fell into his former hesitation that isthe fact isthat this sort o thing is rather suddent to mea little outer my line dont you see and i was goin to ask ye ef youd mind takin the hull thing in hand and runnin it for me  running it for you said mrs price with a quick eyeshot from under the edge of her lashes man alive what are you thinking of  bossin the whole job for me hurried on spindler with nervous desperation gettin together all the things and makin ready for emorderin in everythin thats wanted and fixin up the roomsi kin step out while youre doin itand then helpin me receivin em and sittin at the head o the table you knowlike ez ef you was the mistress  but said mrs price with her frank laugh thats the duty of one of your relationsyour niece for instanceor cousin if one of them is a woman  but persisted spindler you see theyre strangers to me i dont know em and i do you youd make it easy for emand for medont you see kinder introduce emdont you know a woman of your ginral experience would smooth down all them little difficulties continued spindler with a vague recollection of the kansas story and put everybody on velvet dont say no mrs price im just kalkilatin on you  sincerity and persistency in a man goes a great way with even the best of women mrs price who had at first received spindlers request as an amusing originality now began to incline secretly towards it and of course began to suggest objections  im afraid it wont do she said thoughtfully awakening to the fact that it would do and could be done you see ive promised to spend christmas at sacramento with my nieces from baltimore and then theres mrs saltover and my sister to consult  but here spindlers simple face showed such signs of distress that the widow declared she would think it overa process which the sanguine spindler seemed to consider so nearly akin to talking it over that mrs price began to believe it herself as he hopefully departed  she thought it over sufficiently to go to sacramento and excuse herself to her nieces but here she permitted herself to talk it over to the infinite delight of those baltimore girls who thought this extravaganza of spindlers so californian and eccentric so that it was not strange that presently the news came back to rough and ready and his old associates learned for the first time that he had never seen his relatives and that they would be doubly strangers this did not increase his popularity neither i grieve to say did the intelligence that his relatives were probably poor and that the reverend mr saltover had approved of his course and had likened it to the rich mans feast to which the halt and blind were invited indeed the allusion was supposed to add hypocrisy and a bid for popularity to spindlers defection for it was argued that he might have feasted walleyed joe or tanglefoot billywho had once been chawed by a bear while prospectingif he had been sincere howbeit spindlers faith was oblivious to these criticisms in his joy at mr saltovers adhesion to his plans and the loan of mrs price as a hostess in fact he proposed to her that the invitation should also convey that information in the expression by the kind permission of the rev mr saltover as a guarantee of good faith but the widow would have none of it the invitations were duly written and dispatched  suppose suggested spindler with a sudden lugubrious apprehensionsuppose they shouldnt come  have no fear of that said mrs price with a frank laugh  or ef they was dead continued spindler  they couldnt all be dead said the widow cheerfully  ive written to another cousin by marriage said spindler dubiously in case of accident i didnt think of him before because he was rich  and have you ever seen him either mr spindler asked the widow with a slight mischievousness  lordy no he responded with unaffected concern  only one mistake was made by mrs price in her arrangements for the party she had noticed what the simpleminded spindler could never have conceivedthe feeling towards him held by his old associates and had tactfully suggested that a general invitation should be extended to them in the evening  you can have refreshments you know too after the dinner and games and music  but said the unsophisticated host wont the boys think im playing it rather low down on them so to speak givin em a kind o second table as ef it was the tailings after a strike  nonsense said mrs price with decision its quite fashionable in san francisco and just the thing to do  to this decision spindler in his blind faith in the widows management weakly yielded an announcement in the weekly banner that on christmas evening richard spindler esq proposed to entertain his friends and fellow citizens at an at home in his own residence not only widened the breach between him and the boys but awakened an active resentment that only waited for an outlet it was understood that they were all coming but that they should have some fun out of it which might not coincide with spindlers nor his relatives sense of humor seemed a foregone conclusion  unfortunately too subsequent events lent themselves to this irony of the situation  he was so obviously sincere in his intent and above all seemed to place such a pathetic reliance on her judgment that she hesitated to let him know the shock his revelation had given her and what might his other relations prove to be good lord yet oddly enough she was so prepossessed by him and so fascinated by his very quixotism that it was perhaps for these complex reasons that she said a little stiffly  one of these cousins i see is a lady and then there is your niece do you know anything about them mr spindler  his face grew serious no more than i know of the others he said apologetically after a moments hesitation he went on now you speak of it it seems to me ive heard that my niece was divorced but he added brightening up ive heard that she was popular  mrs price gave a short laugh and was silent for a few minutes then this sublime little woman looked up at him what he might have seen in her eyes was more than he expected or i fear deserved cheer up mr spindler she said manfully ill see you through this thing dont you mind but dont you say anything aboutaboutthis vigilance committee business to anybody nor about your nieceit was your niece wasnt itbeing divorced charley the late mr price had a queer sort of sister whobut thats neither here nor there and your niece maynt come you know or if she does you aint bound to bring her out to the general company  at parting spindler in sheer gratefulness pressed her hand and lingered so long over it that a little color sprang into the widows brown cheek perhaps a fresh courage sprang into her heart too for she went to sacramento the next day previously enjoining spindler on no account to show any answers he might receive at sacramento her nieces flew to her with confidences  we so wanted to see you aunt huldy for weve heard something so delightful about your funny christmas party mrs prices heart sank but her eyes snapped only think of it one of mr spindlers longlost relativesa mr wragglives in this hotel and papa knows him hes a sort of halfuncle i believe and hes just furious that spindler should have invited him he showed papa the letter said it was the greatest piece of insolence in the world that spindler was an ostentatious fool who had made a little money and wanted to use him to get into society and the fun of the whole thing was that this halfuncle and whole brute is himself a parvenua vulgar ostentatious creature who was only a  never mind what he was kate interrupted mrs price hastily i call his conduct a shame  so do we said both girls eagerly after a pause kate clasped her knees with her locked fingers and rocking backwards and forwards said milly and i have got an idea and dont you say no to it weve had it ever since that brute talked in that way now through him we know more about this mr spindlers family connections than you do and we know all the trouble you and hell have in getting up this party you understand now we first want to know what spindlers like is he a savage bearded creature like the miners we saw on the boat  mrs price said that on the contrary he was very gentle softspoken and rather goodlooking  young or old  youngin fact a mere boy as you may judge from his actions returned mrs price with a suggestive matronly air  kate here put up a longhandled eyeglass to her fine gray eyes fitted it ostentatiously over her aquiline nose and then said in a voice of simulated horror aunt huldythis revelation is shocking  mrs price laughed her usual frank laugh albeit her brown cheek took upon it a faint tint of indian red if thats the wonderful idea you girls have got i dont see how its going to help matters she said dryly  no thats not it we really have an idea now look here  mrs price looked here this process seemed to the superficial observer to be merely submitting her waist and shoulders to the arms of her nieces and her ears to their confidential and coaxing voices  twice she said it couldnt be thought of and it was impossible once addressed kate as you limb and finally said that she wouldnt promise but might write    it was two days before christmas there was nothing in the air sky or landscape of that sierran slope to suggest the season to the eastern stranger a soft rain had been dropping for a week on laurel pine and buckeye and the blades of springing grasses and shyly opening flowers sedate and silent hillsides that had grown dumb and parched towards the end of the dry season became gently articulate again there were murmurs in hushed and forgotten canyons the leap and laugh of water among the dry bones of dusty creeks and the full song of the larger forks and rivers southwest winds brought the warm odor of the pine sap swelling in the forest or the faint faroff spice of wild mustard springing in the lower valleys but as if by some irony of nature this gentle invasion of spring in the wild wood brought only disturbance and discomfort to the haunts and works of man the ditches were overflowed the fords of the fork impassable the sluicing adrift and the trails and wagon roads to rough and ready kneedeep in mud the stagecoach from sacramento entering the settlement by the mountain highway its wheels and panels clogged and crusted with an unctuous pigment like mud and blood passed out of it through the overflowed and dangerous ford and emerged in spotless purity leaving its stains behind with rough and ready a week of enforced idleness on the river bar had driven the miners to the more comfortable recreation of the saloon bar its mirrors its florid paintings its armchairs and its stove the steam of their wet boots and the smoke of their pipes hung over the latter like the sacrificial incense from an altar but the attitude of the men was more critical and censorious than contented and showed little of the gentleness of the weather or season  did you hear if the stage brought down any more relations of spindlers  the barkeeper to whom this question was addressed shifted his lounging position against the bar and said i reckon not ez far ez i know  and that old bloat of a second cousinthat crimson beakwhat kem down yesterdayhe aint bin hangin round here today for his reglar pizon  no said the barkeeper thoughtfully i reckon spindlers got him locked up and is settin on him to keep him sober till after christmas and prevent you boys gettin at him  hell have the jimjams before that returned the first speaker and how about that dead beat of a halfnephew who borrowed twenty dollars of yuba bill on the way down and then wanted to get off at shootersvilie but bill wouldnt let him and scooted him down to spindlers and collected the money from spindler himself afore hed give him up  hes up thar with the rest of the menagerie said the barkeeper but i reckon that mrs price hez bin feedin him up and ye know the old womanthat fiftyfifth cousin by marriagewhom joe chandler swears he remembers ez an old cook for a chinese restaurant in stocktondarn my skin ef that mrs price hasnt rigged her out in some fancy duds of her own and made her look quite decent  a deep groan here broke from uncle jim starbuck  didnt i tell ye he said turning appealingly to the others its that darned widow thats at the bottom of it all she first put spindler up to givin the party and now darn my skin ef she aint goin to fix up these ragamuffins and drill em so we cant get any fun outer em after all and its bein a woman thats bossin the job and not spindler weve got to draw things mighty fine and not cut up too rough or some of the boys will kick  you bet said a surly but decided voice in the crowd  and said another voice mrs price didnt live in bleeding kansas for nothing  wots the programme youve settled on uncle jim said the barkeeper lightly to check what seemed to promise a dangerous discussion  well said starbuck we kalkilate to gather early christmas night in hoopers hollow and rig ourselves up injun fashion and then start for spindlers with pitchpine torches and have a torchlight dance around the house them who does the dancin and yellin outside takin their turn at goin in and hevin refreshment jake cooledge of boston sez if anybody objects to it weve only got to say were mummers of the olden times sabe then later well have them sabbath evening bells performed on prospectin pans by the band then at the finish jake cooledge is goin to give one of his surkastic speecheskinder welcomin spindlers family to the free openin o spindlers almshouse and reformatory he paused possibly for that approbation which however did not seem to come spontaneously it aint much he added apologetically for were hampered by women but well add to the programme ez we see how things pan out ye see from what we can hear all of spindlers relations aint on hand yet weve got to wait like in elckshun times for returns from the back counties hello whats that  it was the swish and splutter of hoofs on the road before the door the sacramento coach in an instant every man was expectant and starbuck darted outside on the platform then there was the usual greeting and bustle the hurried ingress of thirsty passengers into the saloon and a pause uncle jim returned excitedly and pantingly look yer boys ef this aint the richest thing out they say theres two more relations o spindlers on the coach come down as express freight consigneddye hearconsigned to spindler  stiffs in coffins suggested an eager voice  i didnt get to hear more but here they are  there was the sudden irruption of a laughing curious crowd into the barroom led by yuba bill the driver then the crowd parted and out of their midst stepped two children a boy and a girl the oldest apparently of not more than six years holding each others hands they were coarsely yet cleanly dressed and with a certain uniform precision that suggested formal charity but more remarkable than all around the neck of each was a little steel chain from which depended the regular check and label of the powerful express company wells fargo  co and the words to richard spindler fragile with great care collect on delivery occasionally their little hands went up automatically and touched their labels as if to show them they surveyed the crowd the floor the gilded bar and yuba bill without fear and without wonder there was a pathetic suggestion that they were accustomed to this observation  now bobby said yuba bill leaning back against the bar with an air halfpaternal halfmanagerial tell these gents how you came here  by wellth fargoth expreth lisped bobby  whar from  wed hill owegon  red hill oregon why its a thousand miles from here said a bystander  i reckon said yuba bill coolly they kem by stage to portland by steamer to frisco steamer again to stockton and then by stage over the whole line allers by wells fargo  cos express from agent to agent and from messenger to messenger fact they aint bin tetched or handled by any one but the kempanys agents they aint had a line or direction except them checks around their necks and theyve wanted for nothin else why ive carried heaps o treasure before gentlemen and once a hundred thousand dollars in greenbacks but i never carried anythin that was watched and guarded as them kids why the division inspector at stockton wanted to go with em over the line but jim bracy the messenger said hed call it a reflection on himself and resign ef they didnt give em to him with the other packages ye had a pretty good time bobby didnt ye plenty to eat and drink eh  the two children laughed a little weak laugh turned each other bashfully around and then looked up shyly at yuba bill and said yeth  do you know where you are goin asked starbuck in a constrained voice  it was the little girl who answered quickly and eagerly  yes to krissmass and sandy claus  to what asked starbuck  here the boy interposed with a superior air  thee meanth couthin dick heth got krithmath  wheres your mother  dead  and your father  in orthpittal  there was a laugh somewhere on the outskirts of the crowd every one faced angrily in that direction but the laugher had disappeared yuba bill however sent his voice after him yes in hospital funny aint itamoosin place try it step over here and in five minutes by the living hoky ill qualify you for admission and not charge you a cent he stopped gave a sweeping glance of dissatisfaction around him and then leaning back against the bar beckoned to some one near the door and said in a disgusted tone you tell these galoots how it happened bracy they make me sick  thus appealed to bracy the express messenger stepped forward in yuba bills place  its nothing particular gentlemen he said with a laugh only it seems that some man called spindler who lives about here sent an invitation to the father of these children to bring his family to a christmas party it wasnt a bad sort of thing for spindler to do considering that they were his poor relations though they didnt know him from adamwas it he paused several of the bystanders cleared their throats but said nothing at least resumed bracy thats what the boys up at red hill oregon thought when they heard of it well as the father was in hospital with a broken leg and the mother only a few weeks dead the boys thought it mighty rough on these poor kids if they were done out of their fun because they had no one to bring them the boys couldnt afford to go themselves but they got a little money together and then got the idea of sendin em by express our agent at red hill tumbled to the idea at once but he wouldnt take any money in advance and said he would send em c o d like any other package and he did and here they are thats all and now gentlemen as ive got to deliver them personally to this spindler and get his receipt and take off their checks i reckon we must toddle come bill help take em up  hold on said a dozen voices a dozen hands were thrust into a dozen pockets i grieve to say some were regretfully withdrawn empty for it was a hard season in rough and ready but the expressman stepped before them with warning uplifted hand  not a cent boysnot a cent wells fargos express company dont undertake to carry bullion with those kids at least on the same contract he laughed and then looking around him said confidentially in a lower voice which however was quite audible to the children theres as much as three bags of silver in quarter and half dollars in my treasure box in the coach that has been poured yes just showered upon them ever since they started and have been passed over from agent to agent and messenger to messengerenough to pay their passage from here to china its time to say quits now but bet your life they are not going to that christmas party poor  he caught up the boy as yuba bill lifted the little girl to his shoulder and both passed out then one by one the loungers in the barroom silently and awkwardly followed and when the barkeeper turned back from putting away his decanters and glasses to his astonishment the room was empty    spindlers house or spindlers splurge as rough and ready chose to call it stood above the settlement on a deforested hillside which however revenged itself by producing not enough vegetation to cover even the few stumps that were ineradicable a large wooden structure in the pseudoclassic style affected by westerners with an incongruous cupola it was oddly enough relieved by a still more incongruous veranda extending around its four sides upheld by wooden doric columns which were already picturesquely covered with flowering vines and sunloving roses mr spindler had trusted the furnishing of its interior to the same contractor who had upholstered the gilded barroom of the eureka saloon and who had apparently bestowed the same design and material impartially on each there were gilded mirrors all over the house and chilly marbletopped tables gilt plaster cupids in the corners and stuccoed lions in the way everywhere the tactful hands of mrs price had screened some of these with seasonable laurels fir boughs and berries and had imparted a slight christmas flavor to the house but the greater part of her time had been employed in trying to subdue the eccentricities of spindlers amazing relations in tranquilizing mrs aunt martha spindlerthe elderly cook before alluded towho was inclined to regard the gilded splendors of the house as indicative of dangerous immorality in restraining cousin morley hewlett from considering the diningroom buffet as a bar for intermittent refreshment and in keeping the weakminded nephew phinney spindler from shooting at bottles from the veranda wearing his uncles clothes or running up an account in his uncles name for various articles at the general stores yet the unlookedfor arrival of the two children had been the one great compensation and diversion for her she wrote at once to her nieces a brief account of her miraculous deliverance i think these poor children dropped from the skies here to make our christmas party possible to say nothing of the sympathy they have created in rough and ready for spindler he is going to keep them as long as he can and is writing to the father think of the poor little tots traveling a thousand miles to krissmass as they call itthough they were so well cared for by the messengers that their little bodies were positively stuffed like quails so you see dear we will be able to get along without airing your famous idea im sorry for i know youre just dying to see it all  whatever kates idea might have been there certainly seemed now no need of any extraneous aid to mrs prices management christmas came at last and the dinner passed off without serious disaster but the ordeal of the reception of rough and ready was still to come for mrs price well knew that although the boys were more subdued and indeed inclined to sympathize with their hosts uncouth endeavor there was still much in the aspect of spindlers relations to excite their sense of the ludicrous  but here fortune again favored the house of spindler with a dramatic surprise even greater than the advent of the children had been in the change that had come over rough and ready the boys had decided out of deference to the women and children to omit the first part of their programme and had approached and entered the house as soberly and quietly as ordinary guests but before they had shaken hands with the host and hostess and seen the relations the clatter of wheels was heard before the open door and its lights flashed upon a carriage and pairan actual private carriagethe like of which had not been seen since the governor of the state had come down to open the new ditch then there was a pause the flash of the carriage lamps upon white silk the light tread of a satin foot on the veranda and in the hall and the entrance of a vision of loveliness middleaged men and old dwellers of cities remembered their youth younger men bethought themselves of cinderella and the prince there was a thrill and a hush as this last guesta beautiful girl radiant with youth and adornmentput a dainty glass to her sparkling eye and advanced familiarly with outstretched hand to dick spindler mrs price gave a single gasp and drew back speechless  uncle dick said a laughing contralto voice which indeed somewhat recalled mrs prices own in its courageous frankness i am so delighted to come even if a little late and so sorry that mr mkenna could not come on account of business  everybody listened eagerly but none more eagerly and surprisingly than the host himself mkenna the rich cousin who had never answered the invitation and uncle dick this then was his divorced niece yet even in his astonishment he remembered that of course no one but himself and mrs price knew itand that lady had glanced discreetly away  yes continued the halfniece brightly i came from sacramento with some friends to shootersville and from thence i drove here and though i must return tonight i could not forego the pleasure of coming if it was only for an hour or two to answer the invitation of the uncle i have not seen for years she paused and raising her glasses turned a politely questioning eye towards mrs price one of our relations she said smilingly to spindler  no said spindler with some embarrassment aa friend  the halfniece extended her hand mrs price took it  but the fair strangerwhat she did and said were the only things remembered in rough and ready on that festive occasion no one thought of the other relations no one recalled them nor their eccentricities spindler himself was forgotten people only recollected how spindlers lovely niece lavished her smiles and courtesies on every one and brought to her feet particularly the misogynist starbuck and the sarcastic cooledge oblivious of his previous speech how she sat at the piano and sang like an angel hushing the most hilarious and excited into sentimental and even maudlin silence how graceful as a nymph she led with uncle dick a virginia reel until the whole assembly joined eager for a passing touch of her dainty hand in its changes how when two hours had passedall too swiftly for the gueststhey stood with bared heads and glistening eyes on the veranda to see the fairy coach whirl the fairy princess away howbut this incident was never known to rough and ready  it happened in the sacred dressingroom where mrs price was cloaking with her own hands the departing halfniece of mr spindler taking that opportunity to seize the lovely relative by the shoulders and shake her violently she said oh yes and its all very well for you kate you limb for youre going away and will never see rough and ready and poor spindler again but what am i to do miss how am i to face it out for you know ive got to tell him at least that youre no halfniece of his  have you said the young lady  have i repeated the widow impatiently have i of course i have what are you thinking of  i was thinking aunty said the girl audaciously that from what ive seen and heard tonight if im not his halfniece now its only a question of time so youd better wait goodnight dear  and reallyit turned out that she was right     when the waters were up at jules   when the waters were up at jules there was little else up on that monotonous level for the few inhabitants who calmly and methodically moved to higher ground camping out in tents until the flood had subsided left no distracting wreckage behind them a dozen halfsubmerged log cabins dotted the tranquil surface of the waters without ripple or disturbance looking in the moonlight more like the ruins of centuries than of a few days there was no current to sap their slight foundations or sweep them away nothing stirred that silent lake but the occasional shotlike indentations of a passing raindrop or still more rarely a raft made of a single log propelled by some citizen on a tour of inspection of his cabin rooftree where some of his goods were still stored there was no sense of terror in this bland obliteration of the little settlement the ruins of a single burntup cabin would have been more impressive than this stupid and even grotesquely placid effect of the rival destroying element people took it naturally the water went as it had comeslowly impassively noiselessly a few days of fervid californian sunshine dried the cabins and in a week or two the red dust lay again as thickly before their doors as the winter mud had lain the waters of rattlesnake creek dropped below its banks the stagecoach from marysville no longer made a detour of the settlement there was even a singular compensation to this amicable invasion the inhabitants sometimes found gold in those breaches in the banks made by the overflow to wait for the old rattlesnake sluicing was a vernal hope of the trusting miner  the history of jules however was once destined to offer a singular interruption of this peaceful and methodical process the winter of 185960 was an exceptional one but little rain had fallen in the valleys although the snow lay deep in the high sierras passes were choked ravines filled and glaciers found on their slopes and when the tardy rains came with the withheld southwesterly trades the regular phenomenon recurred jules flat silently noiselessly and peacefully went under water the inhabitants moved to the higher ground perhaps a little more expeditiously from an impatience born of the delay the stagecoach from marysville made its usual detour and stopped before the temporary hotel express offices and general store of jules under canvas bark and the limp leaves of a spreading alder it deposited a single passengermiles hemmingway of san francisco but originally of bostonthe young secretary of a mining company dispatched to report upon the alleged auriferous value of jules of this he had been by no means impressed as he looked down upon the submerged cabins from the boxseat of the coach and listened to the drivers lazy recital of the flood and of the singularly patient acceptance of it by the inhabitants  it was the old story of the southwestern miners indolence and incompetencyutterly distasteful to his northern habits of thought and education here was their old fatuous endurance of natures wild caprices without that struggle against them which brought others strength and success here was the old philosophy which accepted the prairie fire and cyclone and survived them without advancement yet without repining perhaps in different places and surroundings a submission so stoic might have impressed him in gentlemen who tucked their dirty trousers in their muddy boots and lived only for the gold they dug it did not seem to him heroic nor was he mollified as he stood beside the rude refreshment bara few planks laid on trestlesand drank his coffee beneath the dripping canvas roof with an odd recollection of his boyhood and an inclement sundayschool picnic yet these men had been living in this shiftless fashion for three weeks it exasperated him still more to think that he might have to wait there a few days longer for the water to subside sufficiently for him to make his examination and report as he took a proffered seat on a candlebox which tilted under him and another survey of the feeble makeshifts around him his irascibility found vent  why in the name of god didnt you after you had been flooded out once build your cabins permanently on higher ground  although the tone of his voice was more disturbing than his question it pleased one of the loungers to affect to take it literally  well ez youve put it that wayin the name of godreturned the man lazily it mout hev struck us that ez he was bossin the job so to speak and handlin things round here generally we might leave it to him it wasnt our flood to monkey with  and as he didnt covenant so to speak to look arter this higher ground speshally and make an ararat of it for us ez far ez we could see we didnt see any reason for settlin yer put in a second speaker with equal laziness  the secretary saw his mistake instantly and had experience enough of western humor not to prolong the disadvantage of his unfortunate adjuration he colored slightly and said with a smile you know what i mean you could have protected yourselves better a levee on the bank would have kept you clear of the highest watermark  hey you ever heard what the highest watermark was said the first speaker turning to another of the loungers without looking at the secretary  never heard itdidnt know there was a limit before responded the man  the first speaker turned back to the secretary did you ever know what happened at bulgers on the north fork they had one o them levees  no what happened asked the secretary impatiently  they was fixed suthin like us returned the first speaker they allowed theyd build a levee above their highest watermark and did it worked like a charm at first but the water hed to go somewhere and it kinder collected at the first bend then it sorter raised itself on its elbows one day and looked over the levee down upon whar some of the boys was washin quite comfble then it paid no sorter attention to the limit o that high watermark but went six inches better not slow and quiet like ez it useter to ez it does here kinder fillin up from below but went over with a rush and a current hevin of course the whole height of the levee to fall on tother side where the boys were sluicing he paused and amidst a profound silence added they say that bulgers was scattered promiscuouslike all along the fort for five miles i only know that one of his mules and a section of sluicing was picked up at red flat eight miles away  mr hemmingway felt that there was an answer to this but being wise also felt that it would be unavailing he smiled politely and said nothing at which the first speaker turned to him  thar aint anything to see today but tomorrow ez things go the water oughter be droppin mebbe youd like to wash up now and clean yourself he added with a glance at hemmingways small portmanteau ez we thought youd likely be crowded here weve rigged up a corner for you at stantons shanty with the women  the young mans cheek flushed slightly at some possible irony in this and he protested with considerable stress that he was quite ready to rough it where he was  i reckon its already fixed returned the man decisively so youd better come and ill show you the way  one moment said hemmingway with a smile my credentials are addressed to the manager of the boone ditch company at jules perhaps i ought to see him first  all right hes stanton  andhesitated the secretary you who appear to understand the locality so welli trust i may have the pleasure  oh im jules  the secretary was a little startled and amused so jules was a person and not a place  then youre a pioneer asked hemmingway a little less dictatorially as they passed out under the dripping trees  i struck this creek in the fall of 49 comin over livermores pass with stanton returned jules with great brevity of speech and deliberate tardiness of delivery sent for my wife and two children the next year wife died same winter change bein too sudden for her and contractin chills and fever at sweetwater when i kem here first thar wasnt six inches o water in the creek out there was a heap of it over there where you see them yallowishgreen patches and strips o brush and grass all that war water then and all that growth hez sprung up since  hemmingway looked around him the higher ground where they stood was in reality only a moundlike elevation above the dead level of the flat and the few trees were merely recent young willows and alders the area of actual depression was much greater than he had imagined and its resemblance to the bed of some prehistoric inland sea struck him forcibly a previous larger inundation than jules brief experience had ever known had been by no means improbable his cheek reddened at his previous hasty indictment of the settlers ignorance and shiftlessness and the thought that he had probably committed his employers to his own rash confidence and superiority of judgment however there was no evidence that this diluvial record was not of the remote past he smiled again with greater security as he thought of the geological changes that had since tempered these cataclysms and the amelioration brought by settlement and cultivation nevertheless he would make a thorough examination tomorrow  stantons cabin was the furthest of these temporary habitations and was partly on the declivity which began to slope to the rivers bank it was like the others a rough shanty of unplaned boards but unlike the others it had a base of logs laid lengthwise on the ground and parallel with each other on which the flooring and structure were securely fastened this gave it the appearance of a box slid on runners or a noahs ark whose bulk had been reduced jules explained that the logs laid in that manner kept the shanty warmer and free from damp in reply to hemmingways suggestion that it was a great waste of material jules simply replied that the logs were the flotsam and jetsam of the creek from the overflowed mills below  hemmingway again smiled it was again the old story of western waste and prodigality accompanied by jules however he climbed up the huge slippery logs which made a platform before the door and entered  the single room was unequally divided the larger part containing three beds by day rolled in a single pile in one corner to make room for a table and chairs a few dresses hanging from nails on the wall showed that it was the womens room the smaller compartment was again subdivided by a hanging blanket behind which was a rude bunk or berth against the wall a table made of a packingbox containing a tin basin and a can of water this was his apartment  the womenfolks are down the creek bakin today said jules explanatorily but i reckon that one of em will be up here in a jiffy to make supper so you just take it easy till they come ive got to meander over to the claim afore i turn in but you just lie by tonight and take a rest  he turned away leaving hemmingway standing in the doorway still distraught and hesitating nor did the young man recognize the delicacy of jules leavetaking until he had unstrapped his portmanteau and found himself alone free to make his toilet unembarrassed by company but even then he would have preferred the rough companionship of the miners in the common dormitory of the general store to this intrusion upon the halfcivilization of the women their pitiable little comforts and secret makeshifts his disgust of his own indecision which brought him there naturally recoiled in the direction of his host and hostesses and after a hurried ablution a change of linen and an attempt to remove the stains of travel from his clothes he strode out impatiently into the open air again  it was singularly mild even for the season the southwest trades blew softly and whispered to him of san francisco and the distant pacific with its long steady swell he turned again to the overflowed flat beneath him and the sluggish yellow water that scarcely broke a ripple against the walls of the halfsubmerged cabins and this was the water for whose going down they were waiting with an immobility as tranquil as the waters themselves what marvelous incompetencyor what infinite patience he knew of course their expected compensation in this ground sluicing at natures own hand the long rifts in the banks of the creek which so often showed the color in the sparkling scales of river gold disclosed by the action of the water the heaps of reddish mud left after its subsidence around the walls of the cabinsa deposit that often contained a treasure a dozen times more valuable than the cabin itself and then he heard behind him a laugh a short and panting breath and turning beheld a young woman running towards him  in his first astounded sight of her in her limp nankeen sunbonnet thrown back from her head by the impetus of her flight he saw only too much hair two much white teeth too much eyeflash and above allas it appeared to himtoo much confidence in the power of these qualities even as she ran it seemed to him that she was pulling down ostentatiously the rolledup sleeves of her pink calico gown over her shapely arms i am inclined to think that the young gentlemans temper was at fault and his conclusion hasty a calmer observer would have detected nothing of this in her frankly cheerful voice nevertheless her evident pleasure in the meeting seemed to him only obtrusive coquetry  lordy i reckoned to git here afore youd get through fixin up and in time to do a little prinkin myself and here youre out already she laughed glancing at his clean shirt and damp hair but all the same we kin have a talk and you kin tell me all the news afore the other wimmen get up here its a coons age since i was at sacramento and saw anybody or anything she stopped and instinctively detecting some vague reticence in the man before her said still laughing youre mr hemmingway aint you  hemmingway took off his hat quickly with a slight start at his forgetfulness i beg your pardon yes certainly  aunty stanton thought it was hummingbird said the girl with a laugh but i reckoned not im jinney jules you know folks call me j j it wouldnt do for a hummingbird and a jay jay to be in the same camp would it it would be just too funny  hemmingway did not find the humor of this so singularly exhaustive but he was already beginning to be ashamed of his attitude towards her im very sorry to be giving you all this trouble by my intrusion for i was quite willing to stay at the store yonder indeed he added with a burst of frankness quite as sincere as her own if you think your father will not be offended i would gladly go there now  if he still believed in her coquetry and vanity he would have been undeceived and crushed by the equal and sincere frankness with which she met this ungallant speech  no i reckon he wouldnt care if youd be as comfble and fit for tomorrow but ye wouldnt she said reflectively the boys thar sit up late over euchre and swear a heap and simpson whod sleep alongside of ye snores powful ive heard aunty stanton kin do her level at that too and they saywith a laughthat i kin too but youre away off in that corner and it wont reach you so takin it all by the large youd better stay whar ye are we wimmen that is the most of us will be off and away down to rattlesnake bar shoppin afore sun up so yell sleep ez long ez ye want to and find yer breakfast ready when ye wake so ill jest set to and get ye some supper and ye kin tell me all the doins in sacramento and frisco while im workin  in spite of her unconscious rebuff to his own vanity hemmingway felt a sense of relief and less constraint in his relations to this decidedly provincial hostess  can i help you in any way he asked eagerly  well ye might bring me an armful o wood from the pile under the alders ef ye aint afraid o dirtyin your coat she said tentatively  mr hemmingway was not afraid he declared himself delighted he brought a generous armful of small cut willow boughs and deposited them before a small stove which seemed a temporary substitute for the usual large adobe chimney that generally occupied the entire gable of a miners cabin an elbow and short length of stovepipe carried the smoke through the cabin side but he also noticed that his fair companion had used the interval to put on a pair of white cuffs and a collar however she brushed the green moss from his sleeve with some toweling and although this operation brought her so near to him that her breathas soft and warm as the southwest tradesstirred his hair it was evident that this contiguity was only frontier familiarity as far removed from conscious coquetry as it was perhaps from educated delicacy  the boys ginrally kem to take up enough wood for me to begin with she said but i reckon they didnt know i was comin up so soon  hemmingways distrust returned a little at this obvious suggestion that he was only a substitute for their general gallantry but he smiled and said somewhat bluntly i dont suppose you lack for admirers here  the girl however took him literally lordy no me and mamie robinson are the only girls for fifteen miles along the creek admirin i call it jest pesterin sometimes i reckon ill hev to keep a dog  hemmingway shivered yes she was not only conscious but spoilt already he pictured to himself the uncouth gallantries of the settlement the provincial badinage the feeble rivalries of the young men whom he had seen at the general store undoubtedly this was what she was expecting in him  well she said turning from the fire she had kindled while im settin the table tell me whats adoin in sacramento i reckon youve got heaps of lady friends tharim told theres lots of fashions just from the states  im afraid i dont know enough of them to interest you he said dryly  go on and talk she replied why when tom flynn kem back from sacramento and he warnt thar more nor a week he jest slung yarns about his doins thar to last the hull rainy season  half amused and half annoyed hemmingway seated himself on the little platform beside the open door and began a conscientious description of the progress of sacramento its new buildings hotels and theatres as it had struck him on his last visit for a while he was somewhat entertained by the girls vivacity and eager questioning but presently it began to pall he continued however with a grim sense of duty and partly as a reason for watching her in her household duties certainly she was graceful her tall lithe but beautifully moulded figure even in its characteristic southwestern indolence fell into poses as picturesque as they were unconscious she lifted the big molassescan from its shelf on the rafters with the attitude of a greek waterbearer she upheaved the heavy floursack to the same secure shelf with the upraised palms of an egyptian caryatid suddenly she interrupted hemmingways perfunctory talk with a hearty laugh he started looked up from his seat on the platform and saw that she was standing over him and regarding him with a kind of mischievous pity  look here she said i reckon thatll do you kin pull up short i kin see whats the matter with you youre jest plumb tired tuckered out and want to turn in so jest you sit that quiet until i get supper ready and never mind me in vain hemmingway protested with a rising color the girl only shook her head dont tell me you aint keering to talk and youre only playin sacramento statistics on me she retorted with unfeigned cheerfulness anyhow heres the wimmen comin and supper is ready  there was a sound of weary resigned ejaculations and pantings and three gaunt women in lustreless alpaca gowns appeared before the cabin they seemed prematurely aged and worn with labor anxiety and ill nourishment doubtless somewhere in these ruins a flower like jay jules had once flourished doubtless somewhere in that graceful nymph herself the germ of this dreary maturity was hidden hemmingway welcomed them with a seriousness equal to their own the supper was partaken with the kind of joyless formality which in the southwest is supposed to indicate deep respect even the cheerful jay falling under the influence and it was with a feeling of relief that at last the young man retired to his fencedoff corner for solitude and repose he gathered however that before sun up the next morning the elder women were going to rattlesnake bar for the weekly shopping leaving jay as before to prepare his breakfast and then join them later it was already a change in his sentiments to find himself looking forward to that teteatete with the young girl as a chance of redeeming his character in her eyes he was beginning to feel he had been stupid unready and withal prejudiced he undressed himself in his seclusion broken only by the monotonous voices in the adjoining apartment from time to time he heard fragments and scraps of their conversation always in reference to affairs of the household and settlement but never of himselfnot even the suggestion of a prudent lowering of their voicesand fell asleep he woke up twice in the night with a sensation of cold so marked and distinct from his experience of the early evening that he was fain to pile his clothes over his blankets to keep warm he fell asleep again coming once more to consciousness with a sense of a slight jar but relapsing again into slumber for he knew not how long then he was fully awakened by a voice calling him and opening his eyes beheld the blanket partition put aside and the face of jay thrust forward to his surprise it wore a look of excited astonishment dominated by irrepressible laughter  get up quick as you kin she said gaspingly this is about the killingest thing that ever happened  she disappeared but he could still hear her laughing and to his utter astonishment with her disappearance the floor seemed to change its level a giddy feeling seized him he put his feet to the floor it was unmistakably wet and oozing he hurriedly clothed himself still accompanied by the strange feeling of oscillation and giddiness and passed though the opening into the next room again his step produced the same effect upon the floor and he actually stumbled against her shaking figure as she wiped the tears of uncontrollable mirth from her eyes with her apron the contact seemed to upset her remaining gravity she dropped into a chair and pointing to the open door gasped look thar lordy hows that for high threw her apron over her head and gave way to an uproarious fit of laughter  hemmingway turned to the open door a lake was before him on the level of the cabin he stepped forward on the platform the water was right and left all around him the platform dipped slightly to his step the cabin was afloatafloat upon its base of logs like a raft the whole structure upheld by the floor on which the logs were securely fastened the high ground had disappearedthe riverits banks the green area beyond they and they alone were afloat upon an inland sea  he turned an astounded and serious face upon her mirth when did it happen he demanded she checked her laugh more from a sense of polite deference to his mood than any fear and said quietly that gets me everything was all right two hours ago when the wimmen left it was too early to get your breakfast and rouse ye out and i felt asleep i reckon until i felt a kind o slump and a jar hemmingway remembered his own halfconscious sensation then i got up and saw we was adrift i didnt waken ye for i thought it was only a sort of wave that would pass it wasnt until i saw we were movin and the hull rising ground gettin away that i thought o callin ye  he thought of the vanished general store of her father the workers on the bank the helpless women on their way to the bar and turned almost savagely on her  but the otherswhere are they he said indignantly do you call that a laughing matter  she stopped at the sound of his voice as at a blow her face hardened into immobility yet when she replied it was with the deliberate indolence of her father the wimmen are up on the hills by this time the boys hev bin drowned out many times afore this and got clear off on sluice boxes and timber without squealing tom flynn went down ten miles to sayers once on two barls and i never heard that he was cryin when they picked him up  a flush came to hemmingways cheek but with it a gleam of intelligence of course the inundation was known to them first and there was the wreckage to support them they had clearly saved themselves if they had abandoned the cabin it was because they knew its security perhaps had even seen it safely adrift  has this ever happened to the cabin before he asked as he thought of its peculiar base  no  he looked at the water again there was a decided current the overflow was evidently no part of the original inundation he put his hand in the water it was icy cold yes he understood it now it was the sudden melting of snow in the sierras which had brought this volume down the canyon but was there more still to come  have you anything like a long pole or stick in the cabin  nary said the girl opening her big eyes and shaking her head with a simulation of despair which was however flatly contradicted by her laughing mouth  nor any cord or twine he continued  she handed him a ball of coarse twine  may i take a couple of these hooks he asked pointing to some rough iron hooks in the rafters on which bacon and jerked beef were hanging  she nodded he dislodged the hooks greased them with the bacon rind and affixed them to the twine  fishin she asked demurely  exactly he replied gravely  he threw the line in the water it slackened at about six feet straightened and became taut at an angle and then dragged after one or two sharp jerks he pulled it up a few leaves and grasses were caught in the hooks he examined them attentively  were not in the creek he said nor in the old overflow theres no mud or gravel on the hooks and these grasses dont grow near water  now thats mighty cute of you she said admiringly as she knelt beside him on the platform lets see what youve caught look yer she added suddenly lifting a limp stalk thats old man and thar aint a scrap of it grows nearer than springers risefour miles from home  are you sure he asked quickly  sure as pop i used to go huntin it for smellidge  for what he said with a bewildered smile  for thisshe thrust the leaves to his nose and then to her own pink nostrils forforshe hesitated and then with a mischievous simulation of correctness added for the perfume  he looked at her admiringly for all her five feet ten inches what a mere child she was after all what a fool he was to have taken a resentful attitude towards her how charming and graceful she looked kneeling there beside him  tell me he said suddenly in a gentler voice what were you laughing at just now  her brown eyes wavered for a moment and then brimmed with merriment she threw herself sideways in a leaning posture supporting herself on one arm while with her other hand she slowly drew out her apron string as she said in a demure voice  well i reckoned it was jest too killin to think of you who didnt want to talk to me and would hev given your hull pile to hev skipped out o this jest stuck here alongside o me whether you would or no for lord knows how long  but that was last night he said in a tone of raillery i was tired and you said so yourself you know but im ready to talk now what shall i tell you  anything said the girl with a laugh  what i am thinking of he said with frankly admiring eyes  yes  everything  yes everything she stopped and leaning forward suddenly caught the brim of his soft felt hat and drawing it down smartly over his audacious eyes said everything but that  it was with some difficulty and some greater embarrassment that he succeeded in getting his eyes free again when he did so she had risen and entered the cabin disconcerted as he was he was relieved to see that her expression of amusement was unchanged was her act a piece of rustic coquetry or had she resented his advances nor did her next words settle the question  ye kin do yer nice talk and philanderin after weve settled whar we are what were goin and whats goin to happen jest now it pears to me that ez these yere logs are the only thing betwixt us and kingdom come yed better be hustlin round with a few spikes to clinch em to the floor  she handed him a hammer and a few spikes he obediently set to work with little confidence however in the security of the fastening there was neither rope nor chain for lashing the logs together a stronger current and a collision with some submerged stump or wreckage would loosen them and wreck the cabin but he said nothing it was the girl who broke the silence  whats your front name  miles  milesthats a funny name i reckon thats why you war so far off and distant at first  mr hemmingway thought this very witty and said so but he added when i was a little nearer a moment ago you stopped me  but you was moving faster than the shanty was i reckon you dont take that gait with your lady friends at sacramento however you kin talk now  but you forget i dont know where we are nor whats going to happen  but i do she said quietly in a couple of hours well be picked up so youll be free again  something in the confidence of her manner made him go to the door again and look out there was scarcely any current now and the cabin seemed motionless even the wind which might have acted upon it was wanting they were apparently in the same position as before but his soundingline showed that the water was slightly falling he came back and imparted the fact with a certain confidence born of her previous praise of his knowledge to his surprise she only laughed and said lazily well be all right and youll be free in about two hours  i see no sign of it he said looking through the door again  thats because youre looking in the water and the sky and the mud for it she said with a laugh i reckon youve been trained to watch them things a heap better than to study the folks about here  i daresay youre right said hemmingway cheerfully but i dont clearly see what the folks about here have to do with our situation just now  youll see she said with a smile of mischievous mystery all the same she added with a sudden and dangerous softness in her eyes i aint sayin that you aint kinder right neither  an hour ago he would have laughed at the thought that a mere look and sentence like this from the girl could have made his heart beat then i may go on and talk  she smiled but her eyes said yes plainly  he turned to take a chair near her suddenly the cabin trembled there was a sound of scraping a bump and then the whole structure tilted to one side and they were both thrown violently towards the corner with a swift inrush of water hemmingway quickly caught the girl by the waist she clung to him instinctively yet still laughing as with a desperate effort he succeeded in dragging her to the upper side of the slanting cabin and momentarily restoring its equilibrium they remained for an instant breathless but in that instant he had drawn her face to his and kissed her  she disengaged herself gently with neither excitement nor emotion and pointing to the open door said look there  two of the logs which formed the foundation of their floor were quietly floating in the water before the cabin the submerged obstacle or snag which had torn them from their fastening was still holding the cabin fast hemmingway saw the danger he ran along the narrow ledge to the point of contact and unhesitatingly leaped into the icy cold water it reached his armpits before his feet struck the obstacleevidently a stump with a projecting branch bracing himself against it he shoved off the cabin but when he struck out to follow it he found that the log nearest him was loose and his grasp might tear it away at the same moment however a pink calico arm fluttered above his head and a strong grasp seized his coat collar the cabin half revolved as the girl dragged him into the open door  you bantam she said with a laugh why didnt you let me do that im taller than you but she added looking at his dripping clothes and dragging out a blanket from the corner i couldnt dry myself as quick as you kin to her surprise however hemmingway tossed the blanket aside and pointing to the floor which was already filmed with water ran to the still warm stove detached it from its pipe and threw it overboard the sack of flour bacon molasses and sugar and all the heavier articles followed it into the stream relieved of their weight the cabin base rose an inch or two higher then he sat down and said there that may keep us afloat for that couple of hours you speak of so i suppose i may talk now  ye havent no time she said in a graver voice it wont be as long as a couple of hours now look over thar  he looked where she pointed across the gray expanse of water at first he could see nothing presently he saw a mere dot on its face which at times changed to a single black line  its a log like these he said  its no log its an injun dugoutcomin for me        a canoe made from a hollowed log  your father he said joyfully  she smiled pityingly its tom flynn fathers got suthin else to look arter tom flynn hasnt  and whos tom flynn he asked with an odd sensation  the man im engaged to she said gravely with a slight color  the rose that blossomed on her cheek faded in his there was a moment of silence then he said frankly i owe you some apology forgive my folly and impertinence a moment ago how could i have known this  you took no more than you deserved or that tom would have objected to she said with a little laugh youve been mighty kind and handy  she held out her hand their fingers closed together in a frank pressure then his mind went back to his work which he had forgottento his first impressions of the camp and of her they both stood silent watching the canoe now quite visible and the man that was paddling it with an intensity that both felt was insincere  im afraid he said with a forced laugh that i was a little too hasty in disposing of your goods and possessions we could have kept afloat a little longer  its all the same she said with a slight laugh its jest as well we didnt look too comfbleto him  he did not reply he did not dare to look at her yes it was the same coquette he had seen last night his first impressions were correct  the canoe came on rapidly now propelled by a powerful arm in a few moments it was alongside and its owner leaped on the platform it was the gentleman with his trousers tucked in his boots the second voice in the gloomy discussion in the general store last evening he nodded simply to the girl and shook hemmingways hand warmly  then he made a hurried apology for his delay it was so difficult to find the lay of the drifted cabin he had struck out first for the most dangerous spotthe old clearing on the right bank with its stumps and new growthsand it seemed he was right and all the rest were safe and nobody was hurt  all the same tom she said when they were seated and paddling off again you dont know how near you came to losing me then she raised her beautiful eyes and looked significantly not at him but at hemmingway  when the water was down at jules the next day they found certain curious changes and some gold and the secretary was able to make a favorable report but he made none whatever of his impressions when the water was up at jules though he often wondered if they were strictly trustworthy     the boom in the calaveras clarion   the editorial sanctum of the calaveras clarion opened upon the composingroom of that paper on the one side and gave apparently upon the rest of calaveras county upon the other for situated on the very outskirts of the settlement and the summit of a very steep hill the pines sloped away from the editorial windows to the long valley of the south fork andinfinity the little wooden building had invaded nature without subduing it it was filled night and day with the murmur of pines and their fragrance squirrels scampered over its roof when it was not preoccupied by woodpeckers and a printers devil had once seen a nestbuilding blue jay enter the composing window flutter before one of the slanting typecases with an air of deliberate selection and then fly off with a vowel in its bill  amidst these sylvan surroundings the temporary editor of the clarion sat at his sanctum reading the proofs of an editorial as he was occupying that position during a six weeks absence of the bona fide editor and proprietor he was consequently reading the proof with some anxiety and responsibility it had been suggested to him by certain citizens that the clarion needed a firmer and more aggressive policy towards the bill before the legislature for the wagon road to the south fork several assembly men had been got at by the rival settlement of liberty hill and a scathing exposure and denunciation of such methods was necessary the interests of their own township were also to be whooped up all this had been vigorously explained to him and he had grasped the spirit if not always the facts of his informants it is to be feared therefore that he was perusing his article more with reference to its vigor than his own convictions and yet he was not so greatly absorbed as to be unmindful of the murmur of the pines without his halfsavage environment and the lazy talk of his sole companionsthe foreman and printer in the adjoining room  bet your life ive always said that a man inside a newspaper office could hold his own agin any outsider that wanted to play rough or tried to raid the office thars the press and thars the printin ink and roller folks talk a heap o the power o the pressi tell ye ye dont half know it why when old kernel fish was editin the sierra banner one o them bullies that hed lampooned in the banner fought his way past the kernel in the office into the composinroom to wreck everythin and pye all the types spoffrelye dont remember spoffrellittle redhaired manwas foreman spoffrel fended him off with the roller and got one good dab inter his eyes that

agin it and he throws out his hand and ketches hold o the form to steady himself when spoffrel just runs the form and the hand under the press and down with the lever and that held the feller fast as grim death and when at last he begs off and spoff lets him loose the hull o that ere lampooning article he objected to was printed right onto the skin o his hand fact and it wouldnt come off either  gosh but id like to hev seen it said the printer there aint any chance i reckon o such a sight here the boss dont take no risks lampoonin and he the editor knew he was being indicated by some unseen gesture of the unseen workman aint that style  ye never kin tell said the foreman didactically what might happen ive known editors to get into a fight jest for a little innercent bedevilin o the opposite party sometimes for a misprint old man pritchard of the argus oncet had a hole blown through his arm because his proofreader had called colonel starbottles speech an ignominious defense when the old man hed written ingenuous defense  the editor paused in his proofreading he had just come upon the sentence we cannot congratulate liberty hillin its superior elevationupon the ignominious silence of the representative of all calaveras when this infamous bill was introduced he referred to his copy yes he had certainly written ignominiousthat was what his informants had suggested but was he sure they were right he had a vague recollection also that the representative alluded tosenator bradleyhad fought two duels and was a good though somewhat impulsive shot he might alter the word to ingenuous or ingenious either would be finely sarcastic but thenthere was his foreman who would detect it he would wait until he had finished the entire article in that occupation he became oblivious of the next room of a silence a whispered conversation which ended with a rapping at the door and the appearance of the foreman in the doorway  theres a man in the office who wants to see the editor he said  show him in replied the editor briefly he was however conscious that there was a singular significance in his foremans manner and an eager apparition of the other printer over the foremans shoulder  hes carryin a shotgun and is a man twice as big as you be said the foreman gravely  the editor quickly recalled his own brief and as yet blameless record in the clarion perhaps he said tentatively with a gentle smile hes looking for captain brush the absent editor  i told him all that said the foreman grimly and he said he wanted to see the man in charge  in proportion as the editors heart sank his outward crest arose show him in he said loftily  we kin keep him out suggested the foreman lingering a moment me and him indicating the expectant printer behind him is enough for that  show him up repeated the editor firmly  the foreman withdrew the editor seated himself and again took up his proof the doubtful word ignominious seemed to stand out of the paragraph before him it certainly was a strong expression he was about to run his pencil through it when he heard the heavy step of his visitor approaching a sudden instinct of belligerency took possession of him and he wrathfully threw the pencil down  the burly form of the stranger blocked the doorway he was dressed like a miner but his build and general physiognomy were quite distinct from the local variety his upper lip and chin were cleanshaven still showing the blueblack roots of the beard which covered the rest of his face and depended in a thick fleece under his throat he carried a small bundle tied up in a silk handkerchief in one hand and a shotgun in the other perilously at halfcock entering the sanctum he put down his bundle and quietly closed the door behind him he then drew an empty chair towards him and dropped heavily into it with his gun on his knees the editors heart dropped almost as heavily although he quite composedly held out his hand  shall i relieve you of your gun  thank ye ladnoa its moor coomfortable wi me and its main dangersome to handle on the halfcock thats why i didnt leave im on the horse outside  at the sound of his voice and occasional accent a flash of intelligence relieved the editors mind he remembered that twenty miles away in the illimitable vista from his windows lay a settlement of english northcountry miners who while faithfully adopting the methods customs and even slang of the californians retained many of their native peculiarities the gun he carried on his knee however was evidently part of the californian imitation  can i do anything for you said the editor blandly  ay ive coom here to bill ma woife  idont think i understand hesitated the editor with a smile  ive coom here to get ye to put into your paaper a warnin a notiss that onless she returns to my house in four weeks ill have nowt to do wi her again  oh said the editor now perfectly reassured you want an advertisement thats the business of the foreman ill call him he was rising from his seat when the stranger laid a heavy hand on his shoulder and gently forced him down again  noa lad i dont want noa foreman nor understrappers to take this job i want to talk it over wi you sabe my woife she bin up and awaa these six months we had a bit of difference that aint here nor there but she skedaddled outer my house i want to give her fair warning and let her know i aint payin any debts o hers arter this notiss and i aint takin her back arter four weeks from date  i see said the editor glibly whats your wifes name  eliza jane dimmidge  good continued the editor scribbling on the paper before him something like this will do whereas my wife eliza jane dimmidge having left my bed and board without just cause or provocation this is to give notice that i shall not be responsible for any debts of her contracting on or after this date  ye must be a lawyer said mr dimmidge admiringly  it was an old enough form of advertisement and the remark showed incontestably that mr dimmidge was not a native but the editor smiled patronizingly and went on and i further give notice that if she does not return within the period of four weeks from this date i shall take such proceedings for relief as the law affords  coom lad i didnt say that  but you said you wouldnt take her back  ay  and you cant prevent her without legal proceedings shes your wife but you neednt take proceedings you know its only a warning  mr dimmidge nodded approvingly thats so  youll want it published for four weeks until date asked the editor  mebbe longer lad  the editor wrote till forbid in the margin of the paper and smiled  how big will it be said mr dimmidge  the editor took up a copy of the clarion and indicated about an inch of space mr dimmidges face fell  i want it biggerin large letters like a playcard he said thats no good for a warning  you can have half a column or a whole column if you like said the editor airily  ill take a whole one said mr dimmidge simply  the editor laughed why it would cost you a hundred dollars  ill take it repeated mr dimmidge  but said the editor gravely the same notice in a small space will serve your purpose and be quite legal  never you mind that lad its the looks of the thing im arter and not the expense ill take that column  the editor called in the foreman and showed him the copy can you display that so as to fill a column  the foreman grasped the situation promptly it would be big business for the paper yes he said meditatively that boldfaced election type will do it  mr dimmidges face brightened the expression boldfaced pleased him thats it i told you i want to bill her in a portion of the paper  i might put in a cut said the foreman suggestively something like this he took a venerable woodcut from the case i grieve to say it was one which until the middle of the present century was common enough in the newspaper offices in the southwest it showed the running figure of a negro woman carrying her personal property in a knotted handkerchief slung from a stick over her shoulder and was supposed to represent a fugitive slave  mr dimmidges eyes brightened ill take that too its a little darkcomplected for mrs p but it will do now roon away lad he said to the foreman as he quietly pushed him into the outer office again and closed the door then facing the surprised editor he said theers another notiss i want ye to put in your paper but thats atween us not a word to them he indicated the banished foreman with a jerk of his thumb sabe i want you to put this in another part o your paper quite innocentlike ye know he drew from his pocket a gray wallet and taking out a slip of paper read from it gravely if this should meet the eye of r b look out for m j d he is on your track when this you see write a line to e j d elktown post office i want this to go in as personal and privatesabelike them notisses in the big frisco papers  i see said the editor laying it aside it shall go in the same issue in another column  apparently mr dimmidge expected something more than this reply for after a moments hesitation he said with an odd smile  ye aint seein the meanin o that lad  no said the editor lightly but i suppose r b does and it isnt intended that any one else should  mebbe it is and mebbe it isnt said mr dimmidge with a selfsatisfied air i dont mind saying atween us that r b is the man as ive suspicioned as havin something to do with my wife goin away and ye see if he writes to e j dthats my wifes initialsat elktown ill get that letter and so make sure  but suppose your wife goes there first or sends  then ill ketch her or her messenger ye see  the editor did not see fit to oppose any argument to this phenomenal simplicity and mr dimmidge after settling his bill with the foreman and enjoining the editor to the strictest secrecy regarding the origin of the personal notice took up his gun and departed leaving the treasury of the clarion unprecedentedly enriched and the editor to his proofs  the paper duly appeared the next morning with the column advertisement the personal notice and the weighty editorial on the wagon road there was a singular demand for the paper the edition was speedily exhausted and the editor was proportionately flattered although he was surprised to receive neither praise nor criticism from his subscribers before evening however he learned to his astonishment that the excitement was caused by the column advertisement nobody knew mr dimmidge nor his domestic infelicities and the editor and foreman being equally in the dark took refuge in a mysterious and impressive evasion of all inquiry never since the last san francisco vigilance committee had the office been so besieged the editor foreman and even the apprentice were buttonholed and treated at the bar but to no effect all that could be learned was that it was a bona fide advertisement for which one hundred dollars had been received there were great discussions and conflicting theories as to whether the value of the wife or the husbands anxiety to get rid of her justified the enormous expense and ostentatious display she was supposed to be an exceedingly beautiful woman by some by others a perfect sycorax in one breath mr dimmidge was a weak uxorious spouse wasting his substance on a creature who did not care for him and in another a maddened distracted henpecked man content to purchase peace and rest at any price certainly never was advertisement more effective in its publicity or cheaper in proportion to the circulation it commanded it was copied throughout the whole pacific slope mighty san francisco papers described its size and setting under the attractive headline how they advertise a wife in the mountains it reappeared in the eastern journals under the title of whimsicalities of the western press it was believed to have crossed to england as a specimen of transatlantic savagery the real editor of the clarion awoke one morning in san francisco to find his paper famous its advertising columns were eagerly sought for he at once advanced the rates people bought successive issues to gaze upon this monumental record of extravagance a singular idea which however brought further fortune to the paper was advanced by an astute critic at the eureka saloon my opinion gentlemen is that the whole blamed thing is a bluff there aint no mr dimmidge there aint no mrs dimmidge there aint no desertion the whole rotten thing is an advertisement o suthin yell find afore ye get through with it that that there wife wont come back until that blamed husband buys somebodys soap or treats her to somebodys particular starch or patent medicine ye jest watch and see the idea was startling and seized upon the mercantile mind the principal merchant of the town and purveyor to the mining settlements beyond appeared the next morning at the office of the clarion ye wouldnt mind puttin this ad in a column alongside o the dimmidge one would ye the young editor glanced at it and then with a serpentlike sagacity veiled however by the suavity of the dove pointed out that the original advertiser might think it called his bona fides into question and withdraw his advertisement but if we secured you by an offer of double the amount per column urged the merchant that responded the locum tenens was for the actual editor and proprietor in san francisco to determine he would telegraph he did so the response was put it in whereupon in the next issue side by side with mr dimmidges protracted warning appeared a column with the announcement in large letters we havent lost any wife but we are prepared to furnish the following goods at a lower rate than any other advertiser in the county followed by the usual price list of the merchants wares there was an unprecedented demand for that issue the reputation of the clarion both as a shrewd advertising medium and a comic paper was established at once for a few days the editor waited with some apprehension for a remonstrance from the absent dimmidge but none came whether mr dimmidge recognized that this new advertisement gave extra publicity to his own or that he was already on the track of the fugitive the editor did not know the few curious citizens who had early in the excitement penetrated the settlement of the english miners twenty miles away in search of information found that mr dimmidge had gone away and that mrs dimmidge had never resided there with him  six weeks passed the limit of mr dimmidges advertisement had been reached and as it was not renewed it had passed out of the pages of the clarion and with it the merchants advertisement in the next column the excitement had subsided although its influence was still felt in the circulation of the paper and its advertising popularity the temporary editor was also nearing the limit of his incumbency but had so far participated in the good fortune of the clarion as to receive an offer from one of the san francisco dailies  it was a warm night and he was alone in his sanctum the rest of the building was dark and deserted and his solitary light flashing out through the open window fell upon the nearer pines and was lost in the dark indefinable slope below he had reached the sanctum by the rear and a door which he also left open to enjoy the freshness of the aromatic air nor did it in the least mar his privacy rather the solitude of the great woods without seemed to enter through that door and encompassed him with its protecting loneliness there was occasionally a faint peep in the scant eaves or a patpat ending in a frightened scurry across the roof or the slow flap of a heavy wing in the darkness below these gentle disturbances did not however interrupt his work on the true functions of the county newspaper the editorial on which he was engaged  presently a more distinct rustling against the straggling blackberry bushes beside the door attracted his attention it was followed by a light tapping against the side of the house the editor started and turned quickly towards the open door two outside steps led to the ground standing upon the lower one was a woman the upper part of her figure illuminated by the light from the door was thrown into greater relief by the dark background of the pines her face was unknown to him but it was a pleasant one marked by a certain goodhumored determination  may i come in she said confidently  certainly said the editor i am working here alone because it is so quiet he thought he would precipitate some explanation from her by excusing himself  thats the reason why i came she said with a quiet smile  she came up the next step and entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed and now that her figure was revealed he saw that she was wearing a linseywoolsey ridingskirt and carried a serviceable rawhide whip in her cottongauntleted hand she took the chair he offered her and sat down sideways on it her whip hand now also holding up her skirt and permitting a hem of clean white petticoat and a smart wellshaped boot to be seen  i dont remember to have had the pleasure of seeing you in calaveras before said the editor tentatively  no i never was here before she said composedly but youve heard enough of me i reckon im mrs dimmidge she threw one hand over the back of the chair and with the other tapped her ridingwhip on the floor  the editor started mrs dimmidge then she was not a myth an absurd similarity between her attitude with the whip and her husbands entrance with his gun six weeks before forced itself upon him and made her an invincible presence  then you have returned to your husband he said hesitatingly  not much she returned with a slight curl of her lip  but you read his advertisement  i saw that column of fool nonsense he put in your paperef thats what you mean she said with decision but i didnt come here to see himbut you  the editor looked at her with a forced smile but a vague misgiving he was alone at night in a deserted part of the settlement with a plump selfpossessed woman who had a contralto voice a horsewhip andhe could not help feelingan evident grievance  to see me he repeated with a faint attempt at gallantry you are paying me a great compliment but really  when i tell you ive come three thousand miles from kansas straight here without stopping ye kin reckon its so she replied firmly  three thousand miles echoed the editor wonderingly  yes three thousand miles from my own folks home in kansas where six years ago i married mr dimmidgea british furriner as could scarcely make himself understood in any christian language well he got round me and dad allowin he was a reglar outandout profeshnal minerhad lived in mines ever since he was a boy and so not knowin what kind o mines and dad just bilin over with the gold fever we were married and kem across the plains to californy he was a good enough man to look at but it warnt three months before i discovered that he allowed a wife was no better nor a nigger slave and he the master that made me open my eyes but then as he didnt drink and didnt gamble and didnt swear and was a good provider and laid by money why i shifted along with him as best i could we drifted down the first year to sonora at red dog where there wasnt another woman well i did the nigger slave businessnever stirring out o the settlement never seein a town or a crowd o decent peopleand he did the lord and master we played that game for two years and i got tired but when at last he allowed hed go up to elktown hill where there was a passel o his countrymen at work with never a sign o any other folks and leave me alone at red dog until he fixed up a place for me at elktown hilli kicked i gave him fair warning i did as other nigger slaves didi ran away  a recollection of the wretched woodcut which mr dimmidge had selected to personify his wife flashed upon the editor with a new meaning yet perhaps she had not seen it and had only read a copy of the advertisement what could she want the calaveras clarion although a palladium and a sentinel upon the heights of freedom in reference to wagon roads was not a redresser of domestic wrongsexcept through its advertising columns her next words intensified that suggestion  ive come here to put an advertisement in your paper  the editor heaved a sigh of relief as once before certainly he said briskly but thats another department of the paper and the printers have gone home come tomorrow morning early  tomorrow morning i shall be miles away she said decisively and what i want done has got to be done now i dont want to see no printers i dont want anybody to know ive been here but you thats why i kem here at night and rode all the way from sawyers station and wouldnt take the stagecoach and when weve settled about the advertisement im going to mount my horse out thar in the bushes and scoot outer the settlement  very good said the editor resignedly of course i can deliver your instructions to the foreman and nowlet me seei suppose you wish to intimate in a personal notice to your husband that youve returned  nothin o the kind said mrs dimmidge coolly i want to placard him as he did me ive got it all written out here sabe  she took from her pocket a folded paper and spreading it out on the editors desk with a certain pride of authorship read as follows  whereas my husband micah j dimmidge having given out that i have left his bed and boardthe same being a bunk in a log cabin and pork and molasses three times a dayand having advertised that hed pay no debts of my contractinwhich as thar aint any might be easier collected than debts of his own contractinthis is to certify that unless he returns from elktown hill to his only home in sonora in one week from date payin the cost of this advertisement ill know the reason whyeliza jane dimmidge  thar she added drawing a long breath put that in a column of the clarion same size as the last and let it work and thats all i want of you  a column repeated the editor do you know the cost is very expensive and i could put it in a single paragraph  i reckon i kin pay the same as mr dimmidge did for his said the lady complacently i didnt see your paper myself but the paper as copied itone of them big new york dailiessaid that it took up a whole column  the editor breathed more freely she had not seen the infamous woodcut which her husband had selected at the same moment he was struck with a sense of retribution justice and compensation  would you he asked hesitatinglywould you like it illustratedby a cut  with which  wait a moment ill show you  he went into the dark composingroom lit a candle and rummaging in a drawer sacred to weatherbeaten oldfashioned electrotyped advertising symbols of various trades finally selected one and brought it to mrs dimmidge it represented a bare and exceedingly stalwart arm wielding a large hammer  your husband being a minera quartz minerwould that do he asked it had been previously used to advertise a blacksmith a goldbeater and a stonemason  the lady examined it critically  it does look a little like micahs arm she said meditatively wellyou kin put it in  the editor was so well pleased with his success that he must needs make another suggestion i suppose he said ingenuously that you dont want to answer the personal  personal she repeated quickly whats that i aint seen no personal the editor saw his blunder she of course had never seen mr dimmidges artful personal that the big dailies naturally had not noticed nor copied but it was too late to withdraw now he brought out a file of the clarion and snipping out the paragraph with his scissors laid it before the lady  she stared at it with wrinkled brows and a darkening face  and this was in the same paperput in by mr dimmidge she asked breathlessly  the editor somewhat alarmed stammered yes but the next moment he was reassured the wrinkles disappeared a dozen dimples broke out where they had been and the determined matteroffact mrs dimmidge burst into a fit of rosy merriment again and again she laughed shaking the building startling the sedate melancholy woods beyond until the editor himself laughed in sheer vacant sympathy  lordy she said at last gasping and wiping the laughter from her wet eyes i never thought of that  no explained the editor smilingly of course you didnt dont you see the papers that copied the big advertisement never saw that little paragraph or if they did they never connected the two together  oh it aint that said mrs dimmidge trying to regain her composure and holding her sides its that blessed dear old dunderhead of a dimmidge im thinking of that gets me i see it all now only sakes alive i never thought that of him oh its just too much and she again relapsed behind her handkerchief  then i suppose you dont want to reply to it said the editor  her laughter instantly ceased dont i she said wiping her face into its previous complacent determination well young man i reckon thats just what i want to do now wait a moment lets see what he said she went on taking up and reperusing the personal paragraph well then she went on after a moments silent composition with moving lips you just put these lines in  the editor took up his pencil  to mr j d dimmidgehope youre still on r bs tracks keep theree j d  the editor wrote down the line and then remembering mr dimmidges voluntary explanation of his personal waited with some confidence for a like frankness from mrs dimmidge but he was mistaken  you think that her bor mr dimmidgewill understand this he at last asked tentatively is it enough  quite enough said mrs dimmidge emphatically she took a roll of greenbacks from her pocket selected a hundreddollar bill and then a five and laid them before the editor young man she said with a certain demure gravity youve done me a heap o good i never spent money with more satisfaction than this i never thought much o the power o the press as you call it afore but this has been a right comfortable visit and im glad i ketched you alone but you understand one thing this yer visit and who i am is betwixt you and me only  of course i must say that the advertisement was authorized returned the editor im only the temporary editor the proprietor is away  so much the better said the lady complacently you just say you found it on your desk with the money but dont you give me away  i can promise you that the secret of your personal visit is safe with me said the young man with a bow as mrs dimmidge rose let me see you to your horse he added its quite dark in the woods  i can see well enough alone and its just as well you shouldnt know how i kem or how i went away enough for you to know that ill be miles away before that paper comes out so stay where you are  she pressed his hand frankly and firmly gathered up her ridingskirt slipped backwards to the door and the next moment rustled away into the darkness  early the next morning the editor handed mrs dimmidges advertisement and the woodcut he had selected to his foreman he was purposely brief in his directions so as to avoid inquiry and retired to his sanctum in the space of a few moments the foreman entered with a slight embarrassment of manner  youll excuse my speaking to you sir he said with a singular mixture of humility and cunning its no business of mine i know but i thought i ought to tell you that this yer kind o thing wont pay any moreits about played out  i dont think i understand you said the editor loftily but with an inward misgiving you dont mean to say that a regular actual advertisement  of course i know all that said the foreman with a peculiar smile and im ready to back you up in it and sos the boy but it wont pay  it has paid a hundred and five dollars said the editor taking the notes from his pocket so id advise you to simply attend to your duty and set it up  a look of surprise followed however by a kind of pitying smile passed over the foremans face of course sir thats all right and you know your own business but if you think that the new advertisement will pay this time as the other one did and whoop up another column from an advertiser im afraid youll slip up its a little off color nownot up to dateif it aint a regular back number as youll see  meantime ill dispense with your advice said the editor curtly and i think you had better let our subscribers and advertisers do the same or the clarion might also be obliged to dispense with your services  i aint no blab said the foreman in an aggrieved manner and i dont intend to give the show away even if it dont pay but i thought id tell you because i know the folks round here better than you do  he was right no sooner had the advertisement appeared than the editor found that everybody believed it to be a sheer invention of his own to once more boom the clarion if they had doubted mr dimmidge they utterly rejected mrs dimmidge as an advertiser it was a stale joke that nobody would follow up and on the heels of this came a letter from the editorinchief   my dear boyyou meant well i know but the second dimmidge ad was a mistake still it was a big bluff of yours to show the money and i send you back your hundred dollars hoping you wont do it again of course youll have to keep the advertisement in the paper for two issues just as if it were a real thing and its lucky that theres just now no pressure in our columns you might have told a better story than that hogwash about your finding the ad and a hundred dollars lying loose on your desk one morning it was rather thin and i dont wonder the foreman kicked   the young editor was in despair at first he thought of writing to mrs dimmidge at the elktown postoffice asking her to relieve him of his vow of secrecy but his pride forbade there was a humorous concern not without a touch of pity in the faces of his contributors as he passed a few affected to believe in the new advertisement and asked him vague perfunctory questions about it his position was trying and he was not sorry when the term of his engagement expired the next week and he left calaveras to take his new position on the san francisco paper  he was standing in the saloon of the sacramento boat when he felt a sudden heavy pressure on his shoulder and looking round sharply beheld not only the blackbearded face of mr dimmidge lit up by a smile but beside it the beaming buxom face of mrs dimmidge overflowing with goodhumor still a little sore from his past experience he was about to address them abruptly when he was utterly vanquished by the hearty pressure of their hands and the unmistakable look of gratitude in their eyes  i was just saying to lizy jane began mr dimmidge breathlessly if i could only meet that young man o the clarion what brought us together again  youd be willin to pay four times the amount we both paid him interpolated the laughing mrs dimmidge  but i didnt bring you together burst out the dazed young man and id like to know in the name of heaven what brought you together now  dont you see lad said the imperturbable mr dimmidge lizy jane and myself had qualled and we just unpacked our fool nonsense in your paper and let the hull world know it and we both felt kinder skeert and shamed like and it looked such small hogwash and of so little account for all the talk it made that we kinder felt lonely as two separated fools that really ought to share their foolishness together  and that aint all said mrs dimmidge with a sly glance at her spouse for i found out from that personal you showed me that this particular old fool was actooally jealousjealous  and then said the editor impatiently  and then i knew he loved me all the time     the secret of sobrientes well   even to the eye of the most inexperienced traveler there was no doubt that buena vista was a playedout mining camp there seamed and scarred by hydraulic engines was the old hillside over whose denuded surface the grass had begun to spring again in fitful patches there were the abandoned heaps of tailings already blackened by sun and rain and worn into mounds like ruins of masonry there were the waterless ditches like giant graves and the pools of slumgullion now dried into shining glazed cement there were two or three wooden stores from which the windows and doors had been taken and conveyed to the newer settlement of wynyards gulch four or five buildings that still were inhabitedthe blacksmiths shop the postoffice a pioneers cabin and the old hotel and stageofficeonly accented the general desolation the latter building had a remoteness of prosperity far beyond the others having been a wayside spanishamerican posada with adobe walls of two feet in thickness that shamed the later shells of halfinch plank which were slowly warping and cracking like dried pods in the ovenlike heat  the proprietor of this building colonel swinger had been looked upon by the community as a person quite as remote oldfashioned and inconsistent with present progress as the house itself he was an old virginian who had emigrated from his decaying plantation on the james river only to find the slaves which he had brought with him freed men when they touched californian soil to be driven by northern progress and smartness out of the larger cities into the mountains to fix himself at last with the hopeless fatuity of his race upon an already impoverished settlement to sink his scant capital in hopeless shafts and ledges and finally to take over the decaying hostelry of buena vista with its desultory custom and few lingering impecunious guests here too his old virginian ideas of hospitality were against his financial success he could not dun nor turn from his door those unfortunate prospectors whom the ebbing fortunes of buena vista had left stranded by his side  colonel swinger was sitting in a wickerwork rockingchair on the veranda of his hotelsipping a mint julep which he held in his hand while he gazed into the dusty distance nothing could have convinced him that he was not performing a serious part of his duty as hotelkeeper in this attitude even though there were no travelers expected and the road at this hour of the day was deserted on a bench at his side larry hawkins stretched his lazy lengthone foot dropped on the veranda and one arm occasionally groping under the bench for his own tumbler of refreshment apart from this community of occupation there was apparently no interchange of sentiment between the pair the silence had continued for some moments when the colonel put down his glass and gazed earnestly into the distance  seein anything remarked the man on the bench who had sleepily regarded him  no said the colonel that isits only dick ruggles crossin the road  thought you looked a little startled ez if youd seen that ar wanderin stranger  when i see that wandering stranger sah said the colonel decisively i wont be sittin long in this yer chyar ill let him know in about ten seconds that i dont harbor any vagrants prowlin about like poor whites or free niggers on my propahty sah  all the same i kinder wish ye did see him for youd be settled in your mind and id be easier in mine ef you found out what he was doin round yer or ye had to admit that it wasnt no livin man  what do you mean said the colonel testily facing around in his chair  his companion also altered his attitude by dropping his other foot to the floor sitting up and leaning lazily forward with his hands clasped  look yer colonel when you took this place i felt i didnt have no call to tell ye all i know about it nor to pizen yer mind by any darned fool yarns i mout hev heard ye know it was one o them old spanish haciendas  i know said the colonel loftily that it was held by a grant from charles the fifth of spain just as my propahty on the james river was given to my people by king james of england sah  that ez as may be returned his companion in lazy indifference though i reckon that charles the fifth of spain and king james of england aint got much to do with what im goin to tell ye ye see i was here long afore your time or any of the boys that hev now cleared out and at that time the hacienda belonged to a man named juan sobriente he was that kind o fool that he took no stock in mining when the boys were whoopin up the place and finding the color everywhere and there was a hundred men working down there in the gulch he was either ridin round lookin up the wild horses he owned or sittin with two or three lazy peons and injins that was fed and looked arter by the priests gosh now i think of it it was mighty like you when you first kem here with your niggers thats curious too aint it  he had stopped gazing with an odd superstitious wonderment at the colonel as if overcome by this not very remarkable coincidence the colonel overlooking or totally oblivious to its somewhat uncomplimentary significance simply said go on what about him  well ez i was sayin he warnt in it nohow but kept on his reglar way when the boom was the biggest some of the boys allowed it was mighty oncivil for him to stand off like that and otherswhen he refused a big pile for his hacienda and the garden that ran right into the goldbearing ledgewar for lynching him and driving him outer the settlement but as he had a pretty darter or niece livin with him and except for his partickler cussedness towards mining was kinder peaceable and perlite they thought better of it things went along like this until one day the boys noticedparticklerly the boys that had slipped up on their luckthat old man sobriente was gettin richhad stocked a ranch over on the divide and had given some gold candlesticks to the mission church that would have been only human nature and business ef hed had any during them flush times but he hadnt this kinder puzzled them they tackled the peonshis niggersbut it was all no sabe they tackled another mana kind of halfbreed kanaka who except the priest was the only man who came to see him and was supposed to be mighty sweet on the darter or niecebut they didnt even get the color outer him then the first thing we knowed was that old sobriente was found dead in the well  in the well sah said the colonel starting up the well on my propahty  no said his companion the old well that was afterwards shut up yours was dug by the last tenant jack raintree who allowed that he didnt want to take any sobriente in his reglar whiskey and water well the halfbreed kanaka cleared out after the old mans death and so did that darter or niece and the church to whom old sobriente had left this house let it to raintree for next to nothin  i dont see what all that has got to do with that wandering tramp said the colonel who was by no means pleased with this history of his property  ill tell ye a few days after raintree took it over he was lookin round the garden which old sobriente had always kept shut up agin strangers and he finds a lot of driedup slumgullion scattered all about the borders and beds just as if the old man had been using it for fertilizing well raintree aint no fool he allowed the old man wasnt one either and he knew that slumgullion wasnt worth no more than mud for any good it would do the garden so he put this yer together with sobrientes good luck and allowed to himself that the old coyote had been secretly goldwashin all the while he seemed to be standin off agin it but where was the mine whar did he get the gold thats what got raintree he hunted all over the garden prospected every part of itye kin see the holes yetbut he never even got the color        that is a viscid cementlike refuse of goldwashing  he paused and then as the colonel made an impatient gesture he went on  well one night just afore you took the place and when raintree was gettin just sick of it he happened to be walkin in the garden he was puzzlin his brain agin to know how old sobriente made his pile when all of a suddenst he saw suthin amovin in the brush beside the house he calls out thinkin it was one of the boys but got no answer then he goes to the bushes and a tall figger all in black starts out afore him he couldnt see any face for its head was covered with a hood but he saw that it held suthin like a big cross clasped agin its breast this made him think it was one them priests until he looks agin and sees that it wasnt no cross it was carryin but a pickaxe he makes a jump towards it but it vanished he traipsed over the hull gardenwent though evry bushbut it was clean gone then the hull thing flashed upon him with a cold shiver the old man bein found dead in the well the goin away of the halfbreed and the girl the findin o that slumgullion the old man had made a strike in that garden the halfbreed had discovered his secret and murdered him throwin him down the well it war no livin man that he had seen but the ghost of old sobriente  the colonel emptied the remaining contents of his glass at a single gulp and sat up its my opinion sah that raintree had that night more than his usual allowance of cornjuice on board and its only a wonder sah that he didnt see a few pink alligators and skyblue snakes at the same time but whats this got to do with that wanderin tramp  theyre all the same thing colonel and in my opinion that there tramp aint no more alive than that figger was  but you were the one that saw this tramp with your own eyes retorted the colonel quickly and you never before allowed it was a spirit  exactly i saw it whar a minit afore nothin had been standin and a minit after nothin stood said larry hawkins with a certain serious emphasis but i warnt goin to say it to anybody and i warnt goin to give you and the hacienda away and ez nobody knew raintrees story i jest shut up my head but you kin bet your life that the man i saw warnt no livin man  well see sah said the colonel rising from his chair with his fingers in the armholes of his nankeen waistcoat ef he ever intrudes on my property again but look yar dont ye go sayin anything of this to pollyyou know what women are  a faint color came into larrys face an animation quite different to the lazy deliberation of his previous monologue shone in his eyes as he said with a certain rough respect he had not shown before to his companion thats why im tellin ye so that ef she happened to see anything and got skeert yed know how to reason her out of it  sh said the colonel with a warning gesture  a young girl had just appeared in the doorway and now stood leaning against the central pillar that supported it with one hand above her head in a lazy attitude strongly suggestive of the colonels southern indolence yet with a grace entirely her own indeed it overcame the negligence of her creased and faded yellow cotton frock and unbuttoned collar and suggestedat least to the eyes of one manthe curving and clinging of the jasmine vine against the outer column of the veranda larry hawkins rose awkwardly to his feet  now what are you two men mumblin and confidin to each other you look for all the world like two old women gossips she said with languid impertinence  it was easy to see that a privileged and recognized autocrat spoke no one had ever questioned polly swingers right to interrupting interfering and saucy criticisms secure in the hopeless or chivalrous admiration of the men around her she had repaid it with a frankness that scorned any coquetry with an indifference to the ordinary feminine effect or provocation in dress or bearing that was as natural as it was invincible no one had ever known polly to fix up for anybody yet no one ever doubted the effect if she had no one had ever rebuked her charming petulance or wished to  larry gave a weak vague laugh colonel swinger as ineffectively assumed a mock parental severity when you see two gentlemen miss discussin politics together it aint behavin like a lady to interrupt better run away and tidy yourself before the stage comes  the young lady replied to the last innuendo by taking two spirals of soft hair like corn silk from her oval cheek wetting them with her lips and tucking them behind her ears her fathers ungentlemanly suggestion being thus disposed of she returned to her first charge  it aint no politics you aint been swearing enough for that come now its the mysterious stranger yeve been talking about  both men stared at her with unaffected concern  what do you know about any mysterious stranger demanded her father  do you suppose you men kin keep a secret scoffed polly why dick ruggles told me how skeert ye all were over an entire stranger and he advised me not to wander down the road after dark i asked him if he thought i was a pickaninny to be frightened by bogies and that if he hadnt a better excuse for wantin to see me home from the injin spring he might slide  larry laughed again albeit a little bitterly for it seemed to him that the excuse was fully justified but the colonel said promptly dicks a fool and you might have told him there were worse things to be met on the road than bogies run away now and see that the niggers are on hand when the stage comes  two hours later the stage came with a clatter of hoofs and a cloud of red dust which precipitated itself and a dozen thirsty travelers upon the veranda before the hotel barroom it brought also the usual express newspapers and much talk to colonel swinger who always received his guests in a lofty personal fashion at the door as he might have done in his old virginian home but it brought likewisemarvelous to relatean actual guest who had two trunks and asked for a room he was evidently a stranger to the ways of buena vista and particularly to those of colonel swinger and at first seemed inclined to resent the social attitude of his host and his frank and free curiosity when he however found that colonel swinger was even better satisfied to give an account of his own affairs his family pedigree and his present residence he began to betray some interest the colonel told him all the news and would no doubt have even expatiated on his ghostly visitant had he not prudently concluded that his guest might decline to remain in a haunted inn the stranger had spoken of staying a week he had some private mining speculations to watch at wynyards gulchthe next settlement but he did not care to appear openly at the gulch hotel he was a man of thirty with soft pleasing features and a singular litheness of movement which combined with a nutbrown gypsy complexion at first suggested a foreigner but his dialect to the colonels ears was distinctly that of new england and to this was added a puritanical and sanctimonious drawl he looked said the colonel in after years like a blank light mulatter but talked like a blank yankee parson for all that he was acceptable to his host who may have felt that his reminiscences of his plantation on the james river were palling on buena vista ears and was glad of his new auditor it was an advertisement too of the hotel and a promise of its future fortunes gentlemen having propahty interests at the gulch sah prefer to stay at buena vista with another man of propahty than to trust to those newfangled papahcollared gingerbread booths for traders that they call hotels there he had remarked to some of the boys in his preoccupation with the new guest he also became a little neglectful of his old chum and dependent larry hawkins nor was this the only circumstance that filled the head of that shiftless loyal retainer of the colonel with bitterness and foreboding polly swingerthe scornfully indifferent the contemptuously inaccessible the coldly capricious and petulantwas inclined to be polite to the stranger  the fact was that polly after the fashion of her sex took it into her pretty head against all consistency and logic suddenly to make an exception to her general attitude towards mankind in favor of one individual the reasonseeking masculine reader will rashly conclude that this individual was the cause as well as the object but i am satisfied that every fair reader of these pages will instinctively know better miss polly had simply selected the new guest mr starbuck to show others particularly larry hawkins what she could do if she were inclined to be civil for two days she fixed up her distracting hair at him so that its silken floss encircled her head like a nimbus she tucked her oval chin into a white fichu instead of a buttonless collar she appeared at dinner in a newly starched yellow frock she talked to him with company manners said she would admire to go to san francisco and asked if he knew her old friends the fauquier girls from faginia the colonel was somewhat disturbed he was glad that his daughter had become less negligent of her personal appearance he could not but see with the others how it enhanced her graces but he was with the others not entirely satisfied with her reasons and he could not help observingwhat was more or less patent to allthat starbuck was far from being equally responsive to her attentions and at times was indifferent and almost uncivil nobody seemed to be satisfied with pollys transformation but herself  but eventually she was obliged to assert herself the third evening after starbucks arrival she was going over to the cabin of aunt chloe who not only did the washing for buena vista but assisted polly in dressmaking it was not far and the night was moonlit as she crossed the garden she saw starbuck moving in the manzanita bushes beyond a mischievous light came into her eyes she had not expected to meet him but she had seen him go out and there were always possibilities to her surprise however he merely lifted his hat as she passed and turned abruptly in another direction this was more than the little heartbreaker of buena vista was accustomed to  oh mr starbuck she called in her laziest voice  he turned almost impatiently  since youre so civil and pressing i thought id tell you i was just runnin over to aunt chloes she said dryly  i should think it was hardly the proper thing for a young lady to do at this time of night he said superciliously but you know bestyou know the people here  pollys cheeks and eyes flamed yes i reckon i do she said crisply its only a stranger here would think of being rude goodnight mr starbuck  she tripped away after this parthian shot yet feeling even in her triumph that the conceited fool seemed actually relieved at her departure and for the first time she now thought that she had seen something in his face that she did not like but her lazy independence reasserted itself soon and half an hour later when she had left aunt chloes cabin she had regained her selfesteem yet to avoid meeting him again she took a longer route home across the dried ditch and over the bluff scarred by hydraulics and so fell presently upon the old garden at the point where it adjoined the abandoned diggings she was quite sure she had escaped a meeting with starbuck and was gliding along under the shadow of the peartrees when she suddenly stopped an indescribable terror overcame her as she stared at a spot in the garden perfectly illuminated by the moonlight not fifty yards from where she stood for she saw on its surface a human heada mans headseemingly on the level of the ground staring in her direction a hysterical laugh sprang from her lips and she caught at the branches above her or she would have fallen yet in that moment the head had vanished the moonlight revealed the empty gardenthe ground she had gazed atbut nothing more  she had never been superstitious as a child she had heard the negroes talk of the hantsthat is the haunts or spiritsbut had believed it a part of their ignorance and unworthy a white childthe daughter of their master she had laughed with dick ruggles over the illusions of larry and had shared her fathers contemptuous disbelief of the wandering visitant being anything but a living man yet she would have screamed for assistance now only for the greater fear of making her weakness known to mr starbuck and being dependent upon him for help and with it came the sudden conviction that he had seen this awful vision too this would account for his impatience of her presence and his rudeness she felt faint and giddy yet after the first shock had passed her old independence and pride came to her relief she would go to the spot and examine it if it were some trick or illusion she would show her superiority and have the laugh on starbuck she set her white teeth clenched her little hands and started out into the moonlight but alas for womens weakness the next moment she uttered a scream and almost fell into the arms of mr starbuck who had stepped out of the shadows beside her  so you see you have been frightened he said with a strange forced laugh but i warned you about going out alone  even in her fright she could not help seeing that he too seemed pale and agitated at which she recovered her tongue and her selfpossession  anybody would be frightened by being dogged about under the trees she said pertly  but you called out before you saw me he said bluntly as if something had frightened you that was why i came towards you  she knew it was the truth but as she would not confess to her vision she fibbed outrageously  frightened she said with pale but lofty indignation what was there to frighten me im not a baby to think i see a bogie in the dark this was said in the faint hope that he had seen something too if it had been larry or her father who had met her she would have confessed everything  you had better go in he said curtly i will see you safe inside the house  she demurred at this but as she could not persist in her first bold intention of examining the locality of the vision without admitting its existence she permitted him to walk with her to the house and then at once fled to her own room larry and her father noticed their entrance together and their agitated manner and were uneasy yet the colonels paternal pride and larrys lovers respect kept the two men from communicating their thoughts to each other  the confounded pup has been tryin to be familiar and pollys set him down thought larry with glowing satisfaction  hes been trying some of his sanctimonious yankee abolition talk on polly and she shocked him thought the colonel exultingly  but poor polly had other things to think of in the silence of her room another woman would have unburdened herself to a confidante but polly was too loyal to her father to shatter his beliefs and too highspirited to take another and a lesser person into her confidence she was certain that aunt chloe would be full of sympathetic belief and speculations but she would not trust a nigger with what she couldnt tell her own father for polly really and truly believed that she had seen a ghost no doubt the ghost of the murdered sobriente according to larrys story why he should appear with only his head above ground puzzled her although it suggested the catholic idea of purgatory and he was a catholic perhaps he would have risen entirely but for that stupid starbucks presence perhaps he had a message for her alone the idea pleased polly albeit it was a fearful joy and attended with some cold shivering naturally as a gentleman he would appear to herthe daughter of a gentlemanthe successor to his houserather than to a yankee stranger what was she to do for once her calm nerves were strangely thrilled she could not think of undressing and going to bed and two oclock surprised her still meditating and occasionally peeping from her window upon the moonlit but vacant garden if she saw him again would she dare to go down alone suddenly she started to her feet with a beating heart there was the unmistakable sound of a stealthy footstep in the passage coming towards her room was it he in spite of her high resolves she felt that if the door opened she should scream she held her breaththe footsteps came nearerwere before her doorand passed  then it was that the blood rushed back to her cheek with a flush of indignation her room was at the end of the passage there was nothing beyond but a private staircase long disused except by herself as a short cut through the old patio to the garden no one else knew of it and no one else had the right of access to it this insolent human intrusionas she was satisfied it was nowovercame her fear and she glided to the door opening it softly she could hear the stealthy footsteps descending she darted back threw a shawl over her head and shoulders and taking the small derringer pistol which it had always been part of her ostentatious independence to place at her bedhead she as stealthily followed the intruder but the footsteps had died away before she reached the patio and she saw only the small deserted grassgrown courtyard half hidden in shadows in whose centre stood the fateful and long sealedup well a shudder came over her at again being brought into contact with the cause of her frightful vision but as her eyes became accustomed to the darkness she saw something more real and appalling the well was no longer sealed fragments of bricks and boards lay around it one end of a rope coiled around it like a huge snake descended its foul depths and as she gazed with staring eyes the head and shoulders of a man emerged slowly from it but it was not the ghostly apparition of last evening and her terror changed to scorn and indignation as she recognized the face of starbuck  their eyes met an oath broke from his lips he made a movement to spring from the well but as the girl started back the pistol held in her hand was discharged aimlessly in the air and the report echoed throughout the courtyard with a curse starbuck drew back instantly disappeared in the well and polly fell fainting on the steps when she came to her father and larry were at her side they had been alarmed at the report and had rushed quickly to the patio but not in time to prevent the escape of starbuck and his accomplice by the time she had recovered her consciousness they had learned the full extent of that extraordinary revelation which she had so innocently precipitated sobrientes well had really concealed a rich gold ledgeactually tunneled and galleried by him secretly in the pastand its only other outlet was an opening in the garden hidden by a stone which turned on a swivel its existence had been unknown to sobrientes successor but was known to the kanaka who had worked with sobriente who fled with his daughter after the murder but who no doubt was afraid to return and work the mine he had imparted the secret to starbuck another halfbreed son of a yankee missionary and hawaiian wife who had evidently conceived this plan of seeking buena vista with an accomplice and secretly removing such gold as was still accessible the accomplice afterwards identified by larry as the wandering tramp failed to discover the secret entrance from the garden and starbuck was consequently obliged to attempt it from the hotelfor which purpose he had introduced himself as a boarderby opening the disused well secretly at night these facts were obtained from papers found in the otherwise valueless trunks weighted with stones for ballast which starbuck had brought to the hotel to take away his stolen treasure in but which he was obliged to leave in his hurried flight the attempt would have doubtless succeeded but for pollys courageous and timely interference  and now that they had told her all they only wanted to know what had first excited her suspicions and driven her to seek the well as the object of starbucks machinations they had noticed her manner when she entered the house that night and starbucks evident annoyance had she taxed him with her suspicions and so discovered a clue  it was a terrible temptation to polly to pose as a more perfect heroine and one may not blame her if she did not rise entirely superior to it her previous belief that the head of the accomplice at the opening of the garden was that of a ghost she now felt was certainly in the way as was also her conduct to starbuck whom she believed to be equally frightened and whom she never once suspected so she said with a certain lofty simplicity that there were some things which she really did not care to talk about and larry and her father left her that night with the firm conviction that the rascal starbuck had tried to tempt her to fly with him and his riches and had been crushingly foiled polly never denied this and once in later days when admiringly taxed with it by larry she admitted with dovelike simplicity that she may have been too foolishly polite to her fathers guest for the sake of her fathers hotel  however all this was of small account to the thrilling news of a new discovery and working of the old gold ledge at buena vista as the three kept their secret from the world the discovery was accepted in the neighborhood as the result of careful examination and prospecting on the part of colonel swinger and his partner larry hawkins and when the latter gentleman afterwards boldly proposed to polly swinger she mischievously declared that she accepted him only that the secret might not go out of the family     liberty joness discovery   it was at best merely a rocky trail winding along a shelf of the eastern slope of the santa cruz range yet the only road between the sea and the inland valley the hoofprints of a whole century of zigzagging mules were impressed on the soil regularly soaked by winter rains and dried by summer suns during that period the occasional ruts of heavy rude wooden wheelslong obsoletewere still preserved and visible weatherworn boulders and ledges lying in the unclouded glare of an august sky radiated a quivering heat that was intolerable even while above them the masts of gigantic pines rocked their tops in the cold southwestern trades from the unseen ocean beyond a red burning dust lay everywhere as if the heat were slowly and visibly precipitating itself  the creaking of wheels and axles the muffled plunge of hoofs and the cough of a horse in the dust thus stirred presently broke the profound woodland silence then a dirty white canvascovered emigrant wagon slowly arose with the dust along the ascent it was travelstained and worn and with its rawboned horses seemed to have reached the last stage of its journey and fitness the only occupants a man and a girl appeared to be equally jaded and exhausted with the added querulousness of discontent in their sallow and badly nourished faces their voices too were not unlike the creaking they had been pitched to overcome and there was an absence of reserve and consciousness in their speech which told pathetically of an equal absence of society  its no user talkin i tell ye ye haint got no more sense than a coyote im sick and tired of it doggoned if i aint ye aint no more use nor a hossflyand jest ez hinderin it was along o you that we lost the stock at laramie and ef yed bin at all decent and takin wed hev had kempany that helped instead of laggin on yere alone  what did ye bring me for retorted the girl shrilly i might hev stayed with aunt marty i wasnt hankerin to come  bring ye for repeated her father contemptuously i reckoned ye might he o some account here whar wimmin folks is skeerce in the way o helpinand mebbe gettin yer married to some likely feller mighty much chance o that with yer yaller face and skin and bones  ye cant blame me for takin arter you dad she said with a shrill laugh but no other resentment of his brutality  ye want somebody to take arter youwith a club he retorted angrily ye hear wots that yere doin now  she had risen and walked to the tail of the wagon goin to get out and walk im tired o bein jawed at  she jumped into the road the act was neither indignant nor vengeful the frequency of such scenes had blunted their sting she was probably tired of the quarrel and ended it rudely her father however let fly a parthian arrow  ye neednt think im goin to wait for ye ez i hev yeve got to keep tetch with the team or get left and a good riddance of bad rubbidge  in reply the girl dived into the underwood beside the trail picked a wild berry or two stripped a wand of young hazel she had broken off and switching it at her side skipped along on the outskirts of the wood and ambled after the wagon seen in the full merciless glare of a californian sky she justified her fathers description thin and bony her lank frame outstripped the body of her ragged calico dress which was only kept on her shoulders by strapspossibly her fathers castoff braces a boys soft felt hat covered her head and shadowed her only notable feature a pair of large dark eyes looking larger for the hollow temples which narrowed the frame in which they were set  so long as the wagon crawled up the ascent the girl knew she could easily keep up with it or even distance the tired horses she made one or two incursions into the wood returning like an animal from quest of food with something in her mouth which she was tentatively chewing and once only with some inedible mandrono berries plucked solely for their brilliant coloring it was very hot and singularly close the higher current of air had subsided and looking up a singular haze seemed to have taken its place between the treetops suddenly she heard a strange rumbling sound an odd giddiness overtook her and she was obliged to clutch at a sapling to support herself she laughed vacantly though a little frightened and looked vaguely towards the summit of the road but the wagon had already disappeared a strange feeling of nausea then overcame her she spat out the leaves she had been chewing disgustedly but the sensation as quickly passed and she once more sought the trail and began slowly to follow the tracks of the wagon the air blew freshly the treetops began again to rock over her head and the incident was forgotten  presently she paused she must have missed the trail for the wagon tracks had ended abruptly before a large boulder that lay across the mountain trail she dipped into the woods again here there were other wagon tracks that confused her it was like her dogged stupid father to miss the trail she felt a gleam of malicious satisfaction at his discomfiture sooner or later he would have to retrace his steps and virtually come back for her she took up a position where two rough wheel ruts and tracks intersected each other one of which must be the missing trail she noticed too the broader hoofprints of cattle without the following wheel ruts and instead of traces the long smooth trails made by the dragging of logs and knew by these tokens that she must be near the highway or some woodmans hut or ranch she began to be thirsty and was glad presently when her quick rustic ear caught the tinkling of water yet it was not so easy to discover and she was getting footsore and tired again before she found it some distance away in a gully coming from a fissure in a dislocated piece of outcrop it was beautifully clear cold and sparkling with a slightly sweetish taste yet unlike the brackish alkali of the plains it refreshed and soothed her greatly so much that reclining against a tree but where she would be quite visible from the trail her eyes closed dreamily and presently she slept  when she awoke the shafts of sunlight were striking almost level into her eyes she must have slept two hours her father had not returned she knew the passage of the wagon would have awakened her she began to feel strange but not yet alarmed it was only the uncertainty that made her uneasy had her father really gone on by some other trail or had he really hurried on and left her as he said he would the thought brought an odd excitement to her rather than any fear a sudden sense of freedom as if some galling chain had dropped from her sent a singular thrill through her frame yet she felt confused with her independence not knowing what to do with it and momentarily dazzled with the possible gift  at this moment she heard voices and the figures of two men appeared on the trail  they were talking earnestly and walking as if familiar with the spot yet gazing around them as if at some novelty of the aspect  and look there said one there has been some serious disturbance of that outcrop pointing in the direction of the spring the lower part has distinctly subsided he spoke with a certain authority and dominance of position and was evidently the superior as he was the elder of the two although both were roughly dressed  yes it does kinder look as if it had lost its holt like the ledge yonder  and you see i am right the movement was from east to west continued the elder man  the girl could not comprehend what they said and even thought them a little silly but she advanced towards them at which they stopped short staring at her with feminine instinct she addressed the more important one  ye aint passed no wagon nor team goin on hev ye  what sort of wagon said the man  emgrant wagon two yaller hosses old manmy daddrivin she added the latter kinship as a protecting influence against strangers in spite of her previous independence  the men glanced at each other  how long ago  the girl suddenly remembered that she had slept two hours  sens noon she said hesitatingly  since the earthquake  wots that  the man came impatiently towards her how did you come here  got outer the wagon to walk i reckon dad missed the trail and hez got off somewhere where i cant find him  what trail was he onwhere was he going  sank hozay i reckon he was goin up the gradeside o the hill he must hev turned off where theres a big rock hangin over        san jose  did you see him turn off  no  the second man who was in hearing distance had turned away and was ostentatiously examining the sky and the treetops the man who had spoken to her joined him and they said something in a low voice they turned again and came slowly towards her she from some obscure sense of imitation stared at the treetops and the sky as the second man had done but the first man now laid his hand kindly on her shoulder and said sit down  then they told her there had been an earthquake so strong that it had thrown down a part of the hillside including the wagon trail that a wagon team and driver such as she had described had been carried down with it crushed to fragments and buried under a hundred feet of rock in the gulch below a party had gone down to examine but it would be weeks perhaps before they found it and she must be prepared for the worst she looked at them vaguely and with tearless eyes  then ye reckon dads dead  we fear it  then wots agoin to become o me she said simply  they glanced again at each other have you no friends in california said the elder man  nary one  what was your father going to do  dunno i reckon he didnt either  you may stay here for the present said the elder man meditatively can you milk  the girl nodded and i suppose you know something about looking after stock he continued  the girl remembered that her father thought she didnt but this was no time for criticism and she again nodded  come with me said the older man rising i suppose he added glancing at her ragged frock everything you have is in the wagon  she nodded adding with the same cold naivete it aint much  they walked on the girl following at times straying furtively on either side as if meditating an escape in the woodswhich indeed had once or twice been vaguely in her thoughtsbut chiefly to avoid further questioning and not to hear what the men said to each other for they were evidently speaking of her and she could not help hearing the younger repeat her words wots agoin to become o me with considerable amusement and the addition shell take care of herself you bet i call that remark o hers the richest thing out  and i call the state of things that provoked itmonstrous said the elder man grimly you dont know the lives of these people  presently they came to an open clearing in the forest yet so incomplete that many of the felled trees partly lopped of their boughs still lay where they had fallen there was a cabin or dwelling of unplaned unpainted boards very simple in structure yet made in a workmanlike fashion quite unlike the usual log cabin she had seen this made her think that the elder man was a towny and not a frontiersman like the other  as they approached the cabin the elder man stopped and turning to her said  do you know indians  the girl started and then recovering herself with a quick laugh glangthere aint any injins here  not the kind you mean these are very peaceful theres a squaw here whom you willhe stopped hesitated as he looked critically at the girl and then corrected himselfwho will help you  he pushed open the cabin door and showed an interior equally simple but well joined and fitteda marvel of neatness and finish to the frontier girls eye there were shelves and cupboards and other conveniences yet with no ostentation of refinement to frighten her rustic sensibilities  then he pushed open another door leading into a shed and called waya a stout undersized indian woman fitted with a coarse cotton gown but cleaner and more presentable than the girls one frock appeared in the doorway this is waya who attends to the cooking and cleaning he said and by the way what is your name  libby jones  he took a small memorandum book and a stub of pencil from his pocket elizabeth jones he said writing it down the girl interposed a long red hand  no she interrupted sharply not elizabeth but libby short for librty  liberty  yes  liberty jones then well waya this is miss jones who will look after the cows and calvesand the dairy then glancing at her torn dress he added youll find some clean things in there until i can send up something from san jose waya will show you  without further speech he turned away with the other man when they were some distance from the cabin the younger remarked  more like a boy than a girl aint she  so much the better for her work returned the elder grimly  i reckon i was only thinkin she didnt hansome much either as a boy or girl eh doctor he pursued  well as that wont make much difference to the cows calves or the dairy it neednt trouble us returned the doctor dryly but here a sudden outburst of laughter from the cabin made them both turn in that direction they were in time to see liberty jones dancing out of the cabin door in a large cotton pinafore evidently belonging to the squaw who was following her with halflaughing halffrightened expostulations the two men stopped and gazed at the spectacle  dont seem to be takin the old mans death very powfully said the younger with a laugh  quite as much as he deserved i daresay said the doctor curtly if the accident had happened to her he would have whined and whimpered to us for the sake of getting something but have been as much relieved you may be certain shes too young and too natural to be a hypocrite yet  suddenly the laughter ceased and liberty joness voice arose shrill but masterful thar thatll do quit now you jest get back to your scrubbindye hear im boss o this shanty you bet  the doctor turned with a grim smile to his companion thats the only thing that bothered me and ive been waiting for shes settled it shell do come  they turned away briskly through the wood at the end of half an hours walk they found the team that had brought them there in waiting and drove towards san jose it was nearly ten miles before they passed another habitation or trace of clearing and by this time night had fallen upon the cabin they had left and upon the newly made orphan and her indian companion alone and contented in that trackless solitude    liberty jones had been a year at the cabin in that time she had learned that her employers name was doctor ruysdael that he had a lucrative practice in san jose but had also taken up a league or two of wild forest land in the santa cruz range which he preserved and held after a fashion of his own which gave him the reputation of being a crank among the very few neighbors his vast possessions permitted and the equally few friends his singular tastes allowed him it was believed that a man owning such an enormous quantity of timber land who should refuse to set up a sawmill and absolutely forbid the felling of trees who should decline to connect it with the highway to santa cruz and close it against improvement and speculation had given sufficient evidence of his insanity but when to this was added the rumor that he himself was not only devoid of the human instinct of hunting the wild animals with which his domain abounded but that he held it so sacred to their use as to forbid the firing of a gun within his limits and that these restrictions were further preserved and policed by the scattered remnants of a band of aboriginesknown as digger injinsit was seriously hinted that his eccentricity had acquired a political and moral significance and demanded legislative interference but the doctor was a rich man a necessity to his patients a good marksman and it was rumored did not include his fellow men among the animals he had a distaste for killing  of all this however liberty knew little and cared less the solitude appealed to her sense of freedom she did not hanker after a society she had never known at the end of the first week when the doctor communicated to her briefly by letter the convincing proofs of the death of her father and his entombment beneath the sunken cliff she accepted the fact without comment or apparent emotion two months later when her only surviving relative aunt marty of missouri acknowledged the newscommunicated by doctor ruysdaelwith scriptural quotations and the cheerful hope that it would be a lesson to her and she would profit in her new place she left her aunts letter unanswered  she looked after the cows and calves with an interest that was almost possessory patronized and played with the squawyet made her feel her inferiorityand moved among the peaceful aborigines with the domination of a white woman and a superior she tolerated the halfmonthly visits of jim hoskins the young companion of the doctor who she learned was the doctors factor and overseer of the property who lived seven miles away on an agricultural clearing and whose control of her actions was evidently limited by the doctorfor the doctors sake alone nor was mr hoskins inclined to exceed those limits he looked upon her as something abnormala crank as remarkable in her way as her patron was in his neuter of sex and vague of race and he simply restricted his supervision to the bringing and taking of messages she remained sole queen of the domain a rare straggler from the main road penetrating this seclusion might have scarcely distinguished her from waya in her coarse cotton gown and slouched hat except for the free stride which contrasted with her companions waddle once in following an estrayed calf she had crossed the highway and been saluted by a passing teamster in the digger dialect yet the mistake left no sting in her memory and like the digger she shrank from that civilization which had only proved a hard taskmaster  the sole touch of human interest she had in her surroundings was in the rare visits of the doctor and his brief but sincere commendation of her rude and rustic work it is possible that the strange middleaged grayhaired intellectual man whose very language was at times mysterious and unintelligible to her and whose suggestion of power awed her might have touched some untried filial chord in her being although she felt that save for absolute freedom she was little more to him than she had been to her father yet he had never told her she had no sense that she was a hindrance and he had even praised her performance of her duties eagerly as she looked for his coming in his actual presence she felt a singular uneasiness of which she was not entirely ashamed and if she was relieved at his departure it none the less left her to a delightful memory of him a warm sense of his approval and a fierce ambition to be worthy of it for which she would have sacrificed herself or the other miserable retainers about her as a matter of course she had driven waya and the other squaws far along the sparse tableland pasture in search of missing stock she herself had lain out all night on the rocks beside an ailing heifer yet while satisfied to earn his praise for the performance of her duty for some feminine reason she thought more frequently of a casual remark he had made on his last visit you are stronger and more healthy in this air he had said looking critically into her face we have got that abominable alkali out of your system and wholesome food will do the rest she was not sure she had quite understood him but she remembered that she had felt her face grow hot when he spokeperhaps because she had not understood him  his next visit was a day or two delayed and in her anxiety she had ventured as far as the highway to earnestly watch for his coming from her hidingplace in the underwood she could see the team and jim hoskins already waiting for him presently she saw him drive up to the trail in a carryall with a party of ladies and gentlemen he alighted bade goodby to the party and the team turned to retrace its course but in that single moment she had been struck and bewildered by what seemed to her the dazzlingly beautiful apparel of the women and their prettiness she felt a sudden consciousness of her own coarse shapeless calico gown her straggling hair and her felt hat and a revulsion of feeling seized her she crept like a wounded animal out of the underwood and then ran swiftly and almost fiercely back towards the cabin she ran so fast that for a time she almost kept pace with the doctor and hoskins in the wagon on the distant trail then she dived into the underwood again and making a short cut through the forest came at the end of two hours within hailing distance of the cabinfootsore and exhausted in spite of the strange excitement that had driven her back here she thought she heard voiceshis voice among the restcalling her but the same singular revulsion of feeling hurried her vaguely on again even while she experienced a foolish savage delight in not answering the summons in this erratic wandering she came upon the spring she had found on her first entrance in the forest a year ago and drank feverishly a second time at its trickling source she could see that since her first visit it had worn a great hollow below the tree roots and now formed a shining placid pool as she stooped to look at it she suddenly observed that it reflected her whole figure as in a cruel mirrorher slouched hat and loosened hair her coarse and shapeless gown her hollow cheeks and dry yellow skinin all their hopeless uncompromising details she uttered a quick angry halfreproachful cry and turned again to fly but she had not gone far before she came upon the hurrying figures and anxious faces of the doctor and hoskins she stopped trembling and irresolute  ah said the doctor in a tone of frank relief here you are i was getting worried about you waya said you had been gone since morning he stopped and looked at her attentively is anything the matter  his evident concern sent a warm glow over her chilly frame and yet the strange sensation remained nono she stammered  doctor ruysdael turned to hoskins go back and tell waya ive found her  libby felt that the doctor only wanted to get rid of his companion and became awed again  has anybody been bothering you  no  have the diggers frightened you  nowith a gesture of contempt  have you and waya quarreled  narywith a faint tremulous smile  he still stared at her and then dropped his blue eyes musingly are you lonely here would you rather go to san jose  like a flash the figures of the two smartly dressed women started up before her again with every detail of their fresh and wholesome finery as cruelly distinct as had been her own shapeless ugliness in the mirror of the spring no no she broke out vehemently and passionately never  he smiled gently look here ill send you up some books you readdont you she nodded quickly some magazines and papers odd i never thought of it before he added half musingly come along to the cabin and he stopped again and said decisively the next time you want anything dont wait for me to come but write  a few days after he left she received a package of booksan odd collection of novels magazines and illustrated journals of the period she received them eagerly as an evidence of his concern for her but it is to be feared that her youthful nature found little satisfaction in the gratification of fancy many of the people she read of were strange to her many of the incidents related seemed to her mere lies some tales which treated of people in her own sphere she found profoundly uninteresting in one of the cheaper magazines she chanced upon a fashion plate she glanced eagerly through all the others for a like revelation until she got a dozen together when she promptly relegated the remaining literature to a corner and oblivion the text accompanying the plates was in a jargon not always clear but her instinct supplied the rest she dispatched by hoskins a note to doctor ruysdael please send me some brite kalikers and things for sewing you told me to ask a few days later brought the response in a goodsized parcel  yet this did not keep her from her care of the stock nor her rambles in the forest she was quick to utilize her rediscovery of the spring for watering the cattle it was not so far afield as the halfdried creek in the canyon and was a quiet sylvan spot she ate her frugal midday meal there and drank of its waters and secure in her seclusion bathed there and made her rude toilet when the cows were driven home but she did not again look into its mirrored surface when it was tranquil  and so a month passed but when doctor ruysdael was again due at the cabin a letter was brought by hoskins with the news that he was called away on professional business down the coast and could not come until two weeks later in the disappointment that overcame her she did not at first notice that hoskins was gazing at her with a singular expression which was really one of undisguised admiration never having seen this before in the eyes of any man who looked at her she referred it to some vague larking or jocularity for which she was in no mood  say libby youre gettin to be a right smartlookin gal seems to agree with ye up here said hoskins with an awkward laugh darned ef ye aint lookin awful purty  glong said liberty jones more than ever convinced of his badinage  fact said hoskins energetically why doc would tell ye so too see ef he dont  at this liberty jones felt her face grow hot you jess get she said turning away in as much embarrassment as anger yet he hovered near her with awkward attentions that pleased while it still angered her he offered to go with her to look up the cows she flatly declined yet with a strange satisfaction in his evident embarrassment this may have lent some animation to her face for he drew a long breath and said  dont go pertendin ye dont know yer purty say let me and you walk a bit and have a talk together but libby had another idea in her mind and curtly dismissed him then she ran swiftly to the spring for the words the doc will tell ye so too were ringing in her ears the doctor who came with the two beautifully dressed women hewould tell her she was pretty she had not dared to look at herself in that crystal mirror since that dreadful day two months ago she would now  it was a pretty place in the cool shade of the giant trees and the hoofmarks of cattle drinking from the run beneath the pool had not disturbed the margin of that tranquil sylvan basin for a moment she stood tremulous and uncertain and then going up to the shining mirror dropped on her knees before it with her thin red hands clasped on her lap unconsciously she had taken the attitude of prayer perhaps there was something like it in her mind  and then the light glanced full on the figure that she saw there  it fell on a full oval face and throat guileless of fleck or stain smooth as a childs and glowing with health on large dark eyes no longer sunk in their orbits but filled with an eager happy light on bared arms now shapely in contour and cushioned with firm flesh on a dazzling smile the like of which had never been on the face of liberty jones before  she rose to her feet and yet lingered as if loath to part from this delightful vision then a fear overcame her that it was some trick of the water and she sped swiftly back to the house to consult the little mirror which hung in her sleepingroom but which she had never glanced at since the momentous day of the spring she took it shyly into the sunshine and found that it corroborated the reflection of the spring that night she worked until late at the calico doctor ruysdael had sent her and went to bed happy the next day brought her hoskins again with a feeble excuse of inquiring if she had a letter for the doctor and she was surprised to find that he was reinforced by a stranger from hoskinss farm who was equally awkward and vaguely admiring but the appearance of the two men produced a singular phase in her impressions and experience she was no longer indignant at hoskins but she found relief in accepting the compliments of the stranger in preference and felt a delight in hoskinss discomfiture waya promoted to the burlesque of a chaperone grinned with infinite delight and understanding  when at last the day came for the doctors arrival he was duly met by hoskins and as duly informed by that impressible subordinate of the great change in libertys appearance but the doctor was far from being equally impressed with his factors story and indeed showed much more interest in the appearance of the stock which they met along the road once the doctor got out of the wagon to inspect a cow and particularly the coat of a rough draught horse that had been turned out and put under libertys care his skin is like velvet said the doctor the girl evidently understands stock and knows how to keep them in condition  i reckon shes beginning to understand herself too said hoskins golly wait till ye see her  the doctor did see her but with what feelings he did not as frankly express she was not at the cabin when they arrived but presently appeared from the direction of the spring where for reasons of her own she had evidently made her toilet doctor ruysdael was astounded hoskinss praise was not exaggerated and there was an added charm that hoskins was not prepared for she had put on a gown of her own makingthe secret toil of many a long nightamateurishly fashioned from some cheap yellow calico the doctor had sent her yet fitting her wonderfully and showing every curve of her graceful figure unaccented by a corsetan article she had never knowneven the lines of the stiff unyielding calico had a fashion that was nymphlike and suited her unfettered limbs doctor ruysdael was profoundly moved though a philosopher he was practical he found himself suddenly confronted not only by a beautiful girl but a problem it was impossible to keep the existence of this woodland nymph from the knowledge of his distant neighbors it was equally impossible for him to assume the responsibility of keeping a goddess like this in her present position he had noticed her previous improvement but had never dreamed that pure and wholesome living could in two months work such a miracle and he was to a certain degree responsible he had created hera beautiful frankenstein whose lustrous appealing eyes were even now menacing his security and position  perhaps she saw trouble and perplexity in the face where she had expected admiration and pleasure for a slight chill went over her as he quickly praised the appearance of the stock and spoke of her own improvement but when they were alone he turned to her abruptly  you said you had no wish to go to san jose  no yet she was conscious that her greatest objection had been removed and she colored faintly  listen to me he said dryly you deserve a better position than thisa better home and surroundings than you have here you are older tooa woman almostand you must look ahead  a look of mingled fright reproach and appeal came into her eloquent face yer wantin to send me away she stammered  no he said frankly it is you who are growing away this is no longer the place for you  but i want to stay i dont wanter go i ami was happy here  but im thinking of giving up this place it takes up too much of my time you must be provided  you are going away she said passionately  yes  take me with you ill go anywhereto san josewherever you go dont turn me off as dad did for ill foller you as i never followed dad ill go with youor ill die  there was neither fear nor shame in her words it was the outspoken instinct of the animal he had been rearing he was convinced and appalled by it  i am returning to san jose at once he said gravely you shall go with mefor the present get yourself ready  he took her to san jose and temporarily to the house of a patienta widow ladywhile he tried alone to grapple with the problem that now confronted him but that problem became more complicated at the end of the third day by liberty jones falling suddenly and alarmingly ill the symptoms were so grave that the doctor in his anxiety called in a brother physician in consultation when the examination was over the two men withdrew and stared at each other  of course there is no doubt that the symptoms all point to slow arsenical poisoning said the consulting doctor  yes said ruysdael quickly yet it is utterly inexplicable both as to motive and opportunity  humph said the other grimly young ladies take arsenic in minute doses to improve the complexion and promote tissue forgetting that the effects are cumulative when they stop suddenly your young friend has sworn off too quickly  but it is impossible said doctor ruysdael impatiently she is a mere childa country girlignorant of such habits  humph the peasants in the tyrol try it on themselves after noticing the effect on the coats of cattle  doctor ruysdael started a recollection of the sleek draught horse flashed upon him he rose and hastily reentered the patients room in a few moments he returned do you think i could remove her at once to the mountains he said gravely  yes with care and a return to graduated doses of the same poison you know its the only remedy just now answered the other  by noon the next day the doctor and his patient had returned to the cabin but ruysdael himself carried the helpless liberty jones to the spring and deposited her gently beside it you may drink now he said gravely  the girl did so eagerly apparently imbibing new strength from the sparkling water the doctor meanwhile coolly filled a phial from the same source and made a hasty test of the contents by the aid of some other phials from his case the result seemed to satisfy him then he said gravely  and this is the spring you had discovered  the girl nodded  and you and the cattle have daily used it  she nodded again wonderingly then she caught his hand appealingly  you wont send me away  he smiled oddly as he glanced from the waters of the hill to the brimming eyes no  nor tremulously go awayyourself  the doctor looked this time only into her eyes there was a tremendous idea in his own which seemed in some way to have solved that dreadful problem  no we will stay here together    six months later there was a paragraph in the san francisco press the wonderful arsenical spring in the santa cruz mountain known as liberty spring discovered by doctor ruysdael has proved such a remarkable success that we understand the temporary huts for patients are to be shortly replaced by a magnificent spa hotel worthy of the spot and the eligible villa sites it has brought into the market it will be a source of pleasure to all to know that the beautiful nympha worthy successor to the farfamed elise of the german brunnenwho has administered the waters to so many grateful patients will still be in attendance although it is rumored that she is shortly to become the wife of the distinguished discoverer
