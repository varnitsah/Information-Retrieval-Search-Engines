who is that beautiful creature said john seymour as a light sylphlike form tripped up the steps of the veranda of the hotel where he was lounging away his summer vacation  that why dont you know man that is the celebrated the divine lillie ellis the most adroit fisher of men that has been seen in our days  by george but shes pretty though said john following with enchanted eyes the distant motions of the sylphide  the vision that he saw was of a delicate little fairy form a complexion of pearly white with a cheek of the hue of a pink shell a fair sweet infantine face surrounded by a fleecy radiance of soft golden hair the vision appeared to float in some white gauzy robes and when she spoke or smiled what an innocent fresh untouched unspoiled look there was upon the face john gazed and thought of all sorts of poetical similes of a daisy just wet with morning dew of a violet by a mossy stone in short of all the things that poets have made and provided for the use of young gentlemen in the way of falling in love  this john seymour was about as good and honest a man as there is going in this world of ours he was a generous just manly religious young fellow he was heir to a large solid property he was a wellread lawyer established in a flourishing business he was a man that all the world spoke well of and had cause to speak well of the only duty to society which john had left as yet unperformed was that of matrimony three and thirty years had passed and with every advantage for supporting a wife with a charming home all ready for a mistress john as yet had not proposed to be the defender and provider for any of the more helpless portion of creation the cause of this was in the first place that john was very happy in the society of a sister a little older than himself who managed his house admirably and was a charming companion to his leisure hours and in the second place that he had a secret bashful selfdepreciation in regard to his power of pleasing women which made him ill at ease in their society not that he did not mean to marry he certainly did but the fair being that he was to marry was a distant ideal a certain undefined and cloudlike creature and up to this time he had been waiting to meet her without taking any definite steps towards that end to say the truth john seymour like many other outwardly solid soberminded respectable citizens had deep within himself a little private bit of romance he could not utter it he never talked it he would have blushed and stammered and stuttered wofully and made a very poor figure in trying to tell any one about it but nevertheless it was there a secluded chamber of imagery and the future mrs john seymour formed its principal ornament  the wife that john had imaged his dreamwife was not at all like his sister though he loved his sister heartily and thought her one of the best and noblest women that could possibly be  but his sister was all plain prosegood strong earnest respectable prose it is true but yet prose he could read english history with her talk accounts and business with her discuss politics with her and valued her opinions on all these topics as much as that of any man of his acquaintance but with the visionary mrs john seymour aforesaid he never seemed to himself to be either reading history or settling accounts or talking politics he was off with her in some sort of enchanted cloudland of happiness where she was all to him and he to hera sort of rapture of protective love on one side and of confiding devotion on the other quite inexpressible and that john would not have talked of for the world  so when he saw this distant vision of airy gauzes of pearly whiteness of seashell pink of infantine smiles and waving golden curls he stood up with a shy desire to approach the wonderful creature and yet with a sort of embarrassed feeling of being very awkward and clumsy he felt somehow as if he were a great coarse behemoth his arms seemed to him awkward appendages his hands suddenly appeared to him rough and his fingers swelled and stumpy when he thought of asking an introduction he felt himself growing very hot and blushing to the roots of his hair  want to be introduced to her seymour said carryl ethridge ill trot you up i know her  no thank you said john stiffly in his heart he felt an absurd anger at carryl for the easy assured way in which he spoke of the sacred creature who seemed to him something too divine to be lightly talked of and then he saw carryl marching up to her with his air of easy assurance he saw the bewitching smile come over that fair flowery face he saw carryl with unabashed familiarity take her fan out of her hand look at it as if it were a mere common earthly fan toss it about and pretend to fan himself with it  i didnt know he was such a puppy said john to himself as he stood in a sort of angry bashfulness envying the man that was so familiar with that loveliness  illustration i didnt know he was such a puppy  ah john john you wouldnt for the world have told to man or woman what a fool you were at that moment  what a fool i am was his mental commentary just as if it was any thing to me and he turned and walked to the other end of the veranda  i think youve hooked another fish lillie said belle trevors in the ear of the little divinity  who  why that seymour there at the end of the veranda he is looking at you do you know he is rich very rich and of an old family didnt you see how he started and looked after you when you came up on the veranda  oh i saw plain enough said the divinity with one of her unconscious babylike smiles  what are you ladies talking said carryl ethridge  oh secrets said belle trevors you are very presuming sir to inquire  mr ethridge said lillie ellis dont you think it would be nice to promenade  this was said with such a pretty coolness such a quiet composure as showed miss lillie to be quite mistress of the situation there was of course no sort of design in it  ethridge offered his arm at once and the two sauntered to the end of the veranda where john seymour was standing  the blood rushed in hot currents over him and he could hear the beating of his heart he felt somehow as if the hour of his fate was coming he had a wild desire to retreat and put it off he looked over the end of the veranda with some vague idea of leaping it but alas it was ten feet above ground and a lovers leap would have only ticketed him as out of his head there was nothing for it but to meet his destiny like a man  carryl came up with the lady on his arm and as he stood there for a moment in the coolest most indifferent tone in the world said oh by the by miss ellis let me present my friend mr seymour  illustration let me present my friend mr seymour  the die was cast  johns face burned like fire he muttered something about being happy to make miss elliss acquaintance looking all the time as if he would be glad to jump over the railing or take wings and fly to get rid of the happiness  miss ellis was a belle by profession and she understood her business perfectly in nothing did she show herself master of her craft more than in the adroitness with which she could soothe the bashful pangs of new votaries and place them on an easy footing with her  mr seymour she said affably to tell the truth i have been desirous of the honor of your acquaintance ever since i saw you in the breakfastroom this morning  i am sure i am very much flattered said john his heart beating thick and fast may i ask why you honor me with such a wish  well to tell the truth because you strikingly resemble a very dear friend of mine said miss ellis with her sweet unconscious simplicity of manner  i am still more flattered said john with a quicker beating of the heart only i fear that you may find me an unpleasant contrast  oh i think not said lillie with another smile we shall soon be good friends too i trust  i trust so certainly said john earnestly  belle trevors now joined the party and the four were soon chatting together on the best footing of acquaintance john was delighted to feel himself already on easy terms with the fair vision  you have not been here long said lillie to john  no i have only just arrived  and you were never here before  no miss ellis i am entirely new to the place  i am an old habituée here said lillie and can recommend myself as authority on all points connected with it  then said john i hope you will take me under your tuition  certainly free of charge she said with another ravishing smile  you havent seen the boiling spring yet she added  no i havent seen any thing yet  well then if youll give me your arm across the lawn ill show it to you  all of this was done in the easiest most matterofcourse manner in the world and off they started john in a flutter of flattered delight at the gracious acceptance accorded to him  ethridge and belle trevors looked after them with a nod of intelligence at each other  hooked by george said ethridge  well itll be a good thing for lillie wont it  for her oh yes a capital thing for her  well for him too  well i dont know john is a pretty nice fellow a very nice fellow besides being rich and all that and lillie is somewhat shopworn by this time let me see she must be seven and twenty  oh yes shes all that said belle with ingenuous ardor why she was in society while i was a schoolgirl yes dear lillie is certainly twentyseven if not more but she keeps her freshness wonderfully  well she looks fresh enough i suppose to a good honest artless fellow like john seymour who knows as little of the world as a milkmaid john is a great innocent country steer fed on clover and dew and as honest and ignorant of all sorts of naughty wicked things as his mother or sister he takes lillie in a sacred simplicity quite refreshing but to me lillie is played out i know her like a book i know all her smiles and wiles advices and devices and her system of tactics is an old story with me i shant interrupt any of her little games let her have her little field all to herself its time she was married to be sure  meanwhile john was being charmingly ciceroned by lillie and scarcely knew whether he was in the body or out all that he felt and felt with a sort of wonder was that he seemed to be acceptable and pleasing in the eyes of this little fairy and that she was leading him into wonderland  they went not only to the boiling spring but up and down so many wild woodland paths that had been cut for the adornment of the carmel springs and so well pleased were both parties that it was suppertime before they reappeared on the lawn and when they did appear lillie was leaning confidentially on johns arm with a wreath of woodbine in her hair that he had arranged there wondering all the while at his own wonderful boldness and at the grace of the fair entertainer  illustration lillie was leaning confidentially on johns arm  the returning couple were seen from the windows of mrs chit who sat on the lookout for useful information and who forthwith ran to the apartments of mrs chat and told her to look out at them  billy this who was smoking his cigar on the veranda immediately ran and called harry that to look at them and laid a bet at once that lillie had hooked seymour  shell have him by george she will  oh pshaw she is always hooking fellows but you see she dont get married said matteroffact harry it wont come to any thing now ill bet everybody said she was engaged to danforth but it all ended in smoke  whether it would be an engagement or would all end in smoke was the talk of carmel springs for the next two weeks  at the end of that time the mind of carmel springs was relieved by the announcement that it was an engagement  the important deciding announcement was first authentically made by lillie to belle trevors who had been invited into her room that night for the purpose  well belle its all over he spoke out tonight  he offered himself  certainly  and you took him  of course i did i should be a fool not to  oh so i think decidedly said belle kissing her friend in a rapture you dear creature how nice its splendid  lillie took the embrace with her usual sweet composure and turned to her lookingglass and began taking down her hair for the night it will be perceived that this young lady was not overcome with emotion but in a perfectly collected state of mind  hes a little bald and getting rather stout she said reflectively but hell do  i never saw a creature so dead in love as he is said belle  a quiet smile passed over the soft peachblow cheeks as lillie answered  oh dear yes he perfectly worships the ground i tread on  lil you fortunate creature you positively its the best match that there has been about here this summer hes rich of an old respectable family and then he has good principles you know and all that said belle  i think hes nice myself said lillie as she stood brushing out a golden tangle of curls dear me she added how much better he is than that danforth really danforth was a little too horrid his teeth were dreadful do you know i should have had something of a struggle to take him though he was so terribly rich then danforth had been horridly dissipatedyou dont knowmaria sanford told me such shocking things about him and she knows they are true now i dont think john has ever been dissipated  illustration i think hes nice myself  oh no said belle i heard all about him he joined the church when he was only twenty and has been always spoken of as a perfect model i only think you may find it a little slow living in springdale he has a fine large oldfashioned house there and his sister is a very nice woman but they are a sort of respectable retired setnever go into fashionable company  oh i dont mind it said lillie i shall have things my own way i know one isnt obliged to live in springdale nor with pokey old sisters you know and john will do just as i say and live where i please  she said this with her simple soft air of perfect assurance twisting her shower of bright golden curls with her gentle childlike face and soft beseeching blue eyes and dimpling little mouth looking back on her out of the mirror by these the little queen had always ruled from her cradle and should she not rule now was it any wonder that john was half out of his wits with joy at thought of possessing her simply and honestly she thought not he was to be congratulated though it wasnt a bad thing for her either  belle said lillie after an interval of reflection i wont be married in white satinthat im resolved on now she said facing round with increasing earnestness there have been five weddings in our set and all the girls have been married in just the same dresswhite satin and point lace white satin and point lace over and over till im tired of it im determined ill have something new  well i would im sure said belle say white tulle for instance you know you are so petite and fairylike  no i shall write out to madame la roche and tell her she must get up something wholly original i shall send for my whole trousseau papa will be glad enough to come down since he gets me off his hands and no more fuss about bills you know do you know belle that creature is just wild about me hed like to ransack all the jewellers shops in new york for me hes going up tomorrow just to choose the engagement ring he says he cant trust to an order that he must go and choose one worthy of me  oh its plain enough that that game is all in your hands as to him lillie but lil what will your cousin harry say to all this  well of course he wont like it but i cant help it if he dont harry ought to know that its all nonsense for him and me to think of marrying he does know it  to tell the truth i always thought lil you were more in love with harry than anybody you ever knew  lillie laughed a little and then the prettiest sweetpea flush deepened the pink of her cheeks  to say the truth belle i could have been if he had been in circumstances to marry but you see i am one of those to whom the luxuries are essential i never could rub and scrub and work in fact i had rather not live at all than live poor and harry is poor and he always will be poor its a pity too poor fellow for hes nice well he is off in india i know he will be tragical and gloomy and all that she said and then the soft childface smiled to itself in the glasssuch a pretty little innocent smile  all this while john sat up with his heart beating very fast writing all about his engagement to his sister and up to this point his nearest dearest most confidential friend it is almost too bad to copy the letter of a shy man who finds himself in love for the first time in his life but we venture to make an extract  it is not her beauty merely that drew me to her though she is the most beautiful human being i ever saw it is the exquisite feminine softness and delicacy of her character that sympathetic pliability by which she adapts herself to every varying feeling of the heart you my dear sister are the noblest of women and your place in my heart is still what it always was but i feel that this dear little creature while she fills a place no other has ever entered will yet be a new bond to unite us she will love us both she will gradually come into all our ways and opinions and be insensibly formed by us into a noble womanhood her extreme beauty and the great admiration that has always followed her have exposed her to many temptations and caused most ungenerous things to be said of her  hitherto she has lived only in the fashionable world and her literary and domestic education as she herself is sensible has been somewhat neglected  but she longs to retire from all this she is sick of fashionable folly and will come to us to be all our own gradually the charming circle of cultivated families which form our society will elevate her taste and form her mind  love is womans inspiration and love will lead her to all that is noble and good my dear sister think not that any new ties are going to make you any less to me or touch your place in my heart i have already spoken of you to lillie and she longs to know you you must be to her what you have always been to meguide philosopher and friend  i am sure i never felt better impulses more humble more thankful more religious than i do now that the happiness of this soft gentle fragile creature is to be henceforth in my hands is to me a solemn and inspiring thought what man is worthy of a refined delicate woman i feel my unworthiness of her every hour but so help me god i shall try to be all to her that a husband should and you my sister i know will help me to make happy the future which she so confidingly trusts to me  believe me dear sister i never was so much your affectionate brother  john seymour  psi forgot to tell you that lillie remarkably resembles the ivory miniature of our dear sainted mother she was very much affected when i told her of it i think naturally lillie has very much such a character as our mother though circumstances in her case have been unfavorable to the development of it  whether the charming vision was realized whether the little sovereign now enthroned will be a just and clement one what immunities and privileges she will allow to her slavesis yet to be seen in this story     chapter ii   what she thinks of it  springdale was one of those beautiful rural towns whose flourishing aspect is a striking exponent of the peculiarities of newengland life the ride through it presents a refreshing picture of wide cool grassy streets overhung with green arches of elm with rows of large handsome houses on either side each standing back from the street in its own retired square of gardens green turf shady trees and flowering shrubs it was so to speak a little city of countryseats it spoke of wealth thrift leisure cultivation quiet thoughtful habits and moral tastes  some of these mansions were of ancestral reputation and had been in the family whose name they bore for generations back a circumstance sometimes occurring even in newengland towns where neither law nor custom unites to perpetuate property in certain family lines  the seymour house was a wellknown respected mansion for generations back old judge seymour the grandfather was the lineal descendant of parson seymour the pastor who first came with the little colony of springdale when it was founded as a church in the wilderness amid all the dangers of wild beasts and indians  this present seymour mansion was founded on the spot where the house of the first minister was built by the active hands of his parishioners and from generation to generation order piety education and high respectability had been the tradition of the place  the reader will come in with us on this bright june morning through the grassy front yard which has only the usual newengland fault of being too densely shaded the house we enter has a wide cool hall running through its centre and out into a back garden now all aglow with every beauty of june the broad alleys of the garden showed bright stores of all sorts of good oldfashioned flowers well tended and kept clumps of stately hollyhocks and scarlet peonies roses of every hue purple blush goldcolor and white were showering down their leaves on the grassy turf honeysuckles climbed and clambered over arbors and great stately tufts of virginwhite lilies exalted their majestic heads in saintly magnificence the garden was miss grace seymours delight and pride every root in it was fragrant with the invisible blossoms of memorymemories of the mother who loved and planted and watched them before her and the grandmother who had cared for them before that the spirit of these charming oldfashioned gardens is the spirit of family love and if ever blessed souls from their better home feel drawn back to any thing on earth we think it must be to their flowergarden  miss grace had been up early and now with her garden hat on and scissors in hand was coming up the steps with her white apron full of roses white lilies meadowsweets and honeysuckle for the parlorvases when the servant handed her a letter  from john she said good fellow and then she laid it on the mantelshelf of the parlor while she busied herself in arranging her flowers  illustration from john good fellow  i must get these into water or they will wilt she said  the large parlor was like many that you and i have seen in a certain respectable class of houseswide cool shady and with a mellow old tone to every thing in its furniture and belongings it was a parlor of the past and not of today yet exquisitely neat and wellkept the turkey carpet was faded it had been part of the wedding furnishing of graces mother years ago the great wide motherly chintzcovered sofa which filled a recess commanding the window was as different as possible from any smart modern article of the name the heavy clawfooted mahogany chairs the tall clock that ticked in one corner the footstools and ottomans in faded embroideryall spoke of days past so did the portraits on the wall one was of a fair rosy young girl in a white gown with powdered hair dressed high over a cushion it was the portrait of graces mother another was that of a minister in gown and bands with blacksilk gloved hands holding up conspicuously a large bible this was the remote ancestor the minister then there was the picture of johns father placed lovingly where the eyes seemed always to be following the slight whiterobed figure of the young wife the walls were papered with an oldfashioned paper of a peculiar pattern bought in france seventyfive years before the vases of indiachina that adorned the mantels the framed engravings of architecture and pictures in rome all were memorials of the taste of those long passed away yet the room had a fresh sweet sociable air the roses and honeysuckles looked in at the windows the table covered with books and magazines and the familiar workbasket of miss grace with its work gave a sort of impression of modern family household life it was a wide open hospitable generousminded room that seemed to breathe a fragrance of invitation and general sociability it was a room full of associations and memories and its daily arrangement and ornamentation made one of the pleasant tasks of miss graces life  she spread down a newspaper on the large square centretable and emptying her apronful of flowers upon it took her vases from the shelf and with her scissors sat down to the task of clipping and arranging them  just then letitia ferguson came across the garden and entered the back door after her with a knot of choice roses in her hand and a plate of seedcakes covered with a hemstitched napkin the fergusons and the seymours occupied adjoining houses and were on footing of the most perfect undress intimacy they crossed each others gardens and came without knocking into each others doors twenty times a day apropos to any bit of chitchat that they might have a question to ask a passage in a book to show a household receipt that they had been trying letitia was the most intimate and confidential friend of grace in fact the whole ferguson family seemed like another portion of the seymour family there were two daughters of whom letitia was the eldest then came the younger rose a nice charming wellinformed good girl always cheerful and chatty and with a decent share of ability at talking lively nonsense the brothers of the family like the young men of newengland country towns generally were off in the world seeking their fortunes old judge ferguson was a gentleman of the old schoolformal stately polite always complimentary to ladies and with a pleasant little budget of oldgentlemanly hobbies and prejudices which it afforded him the greatest pleasure to air in the society of his friends old mrs ferguson was a pattern of motherliness with her quaint oldfashioned dress her elaborate caps her daily and minute inquiries after the health of all her acquaintances and the tender pityingness of her nature for every thing that lived and breathed in this world of sin and sorrow  letitia and grace as two older sisters of families had a peculiar intimacy and discussed every thing together from the mode of clearing jelly up to the profoundest problems of science and morals they were both charming wellmannered welleducated wellread women and trusted each other to the uttermost with every thought and feeling and purpose of their hearts  as we have said letitia ferguson came in at the back door without knocking and coming softly behind miss grace laid down her bunch of roses among the flowers and then set down her plate of seedcakes  then she said i brought you some specimens of my souvenir de malmaison bush and my first trial of your receipt  oh thanks said miss grace how charming those roses are it was too bad to spoil your bush though  no it does it good to cut them it will flower all the more but try one of those cakesare they right  excellent you have hit it exactly said grace exactly the right proportion of seeds i was hurrying she added to get these flowers in water because a letter from john is waiting to be read  a letter how nice said miss letitia looking towards the shelf john is as faithful in writing as if he were your lover  he is the best lover a woman can have said grace as she busily sorted and arranged the flowers for my part i ask nothing better than john  let me arrange for you while you read your letter said letitia taking the flowers from her friends hands  miss grace took down the letter from the mantelpiece opened and began to read it miss letitia meanwhile watched her face as we often carelessly watch the face of a person reading a letter  miss grace was not technically handsome but she had an interesting kindly sincere face and her friend saw gradually a dark cloud rising over it as one watches a shadow on a field  when she had finished the letter with a sudden movement she laid her head forward on the table among the flowers and covered her face with her hands she seemed not to remember that any one was present  illustration she laid her head forward on the table  letitia came up to her and laying her hand gently on hers said what is it dear  miss grace lifted her head and said in a husky voice  nothing only it is so sudden john is engaged  engaged to whom  to lillie ellis  john engaged to lillie ellis said miss ferguson in a tone of shocked astonishment  so he writes me he is completely infatuated by her  how very sudden said miss letitia who could have expected it lillie ellis is so entirely out of the line of any of the women he has ever known  thats precisely whats the matter said miss grace john knows nothing of any but good noble women and he thinks he sees all this in lillie ellis  theres nothing to her but her wonderful complexion said miss ferguson and her pretty little coaxing ways but she is the most utterly selfish heartless little creature that ever breathed  well she is to be johns wife said miss grace sweeping the remainder of the flowers into her apron and so ends my life with john i might have known it would come to this i must make arrangements at once for another house and home this house so much so dear to me will be nothing to her and yet she must be its mistress she added looking round on every thing in the room and then bursting into tears  now miss grace was not one of the crying sort and so this emotion went to her friends heart miss letitia went up and put her arms round her  come gracie she said you must not take it so seriously john is a noble manly fellow he loves you and he will always be master of his own house  no he wontno married man ever is said miss grace wiping her eyes and sitting up very straight no man that is a gentleman is ever master in his own house he has only such rights there as his wife chooses to give him and this woman wont like me im sure  perhaps she will said letitia in a faltering voice  no she wont because i have no faculty for lying or playing the hypocrite in any way and i shant approve of her these soft slippery pretty little fibbing women have always been my abomination  oh my dear grace said miss ferguson do let us make the best of it  i did think said miss grace wiping her eyes that john had some sense i wasnt such a fool nor so selfish as to want him always to live for me i wanted him to marry and if he had got engaged to your rose for instance  o letitia i always did so hope that he and rose would like each other  we cant choose for our brothers said miss letitia and hard as it is we must make up our minds to love those they bring to us who knows what good influences may do for poor lillie ellis she never has had any yet her family are extremely common sort of people without any culture or breeding and only her wonderful beauty brought them into notice and they have always used that as a sort of stock in trade  and john says in this letter that she reminds him of our mother said miss grace and he thinks that naturally she was very much such a character just think of that now  he must be far gone said miss ferguson but then you see she is distractingly pretty she has just the most exquisitely pearly pure delicate saintlike look at times that you ever saw and then she knows exactly how she does look and just how to use her looks and john cant be blamed for believing in her i who know all about her am sometimes taken in by her  well said miss grace mrs lennox was at newport last summer at the time that she was there and she told me all about her i think her an artful unscrupulous unprincipled woman and her being made mistress of this house just breaks up our pleasant sociable life here she has no literary tastes she does not care for reading or study she wont like our set here and she will gradually drive them from the house she wont like me and she will want to alienate john from meso there is just the situation  you may read that letter added miss grace wiping her eyes and tossing her brothers letter into miss letitias lap miss letitia took the letter and read it good fellow she exclaimed warmly you see just what i sayhis heart is all with you  oh johns heart is all light enough said miss grace and i dont doubt his love hes the best noblest most affectionate fellow in the world i only think he reckons without his host in thinking he can keep all our old relations unbroken when he puts a new mistress into the house and such a mistress  but if she really loves him  pshaw she dont that kind of woman cant love they are like cats that want to be stroked and caressed and to be petted and to lie soft and warm and they will purr to any one that will pet themthats all as for love that leads to any selfsacrifice they dont begin to know any thing about it  gracie dear said miss ferguson this sort of thing will never do if you meet your brother in this way you will throw him off and maybe make a fatal breach meet it like a good christian as you are you know she said gently where we have a right to carry our troubles and of whom we should ask guidance  oh i do know titia said miss grace but i am letting myself be wicked just a little you know to relieve my mind i ought to put myself to school to make the best of it but it came on me so very suddenly yes she added i am going to take a course of my bible and fénelon before i see johnpoor fellow  and try to have faith for her said miss letitia  well ill try to have faith said miss grace but i do trust it will be some days before john comes down on me with his rapturesmen in love are such fools  but dear me said miss letitia as her head accidentally turned towards the window who is this riding up gracie as sure as you live it is john himself  john himself repeated miss grace becoming pale  now do dear be careful said miss letitia ill just run out this back door and leave you alone and just as miss letitias light heels were heard going down the back steps johns heavy footsteps were coming up the front ones     chapter iii   the sister  grace seymour was a specimen of a class of whom we are happy to say new england possesses a great many  she was a highly cultivated intelligent and refined woman arrived at the full age of mature womanhood unmarried and with no present thought or prospect of marriage i presume all my readers who are in a position to run over the society of our rural newengland towns can recall to their minds hundreds of such they are women too thoughtful too conscientious too delicate to marry for any thing but a purely personal affection and this affection for various reasons has not fallen in their way  the tendency of life in these towns is to throw the young men of the place into distant fields of adventure and enterprise in the far western and southern states leaving at their old homes a population in which the feminine element largely predominates it is not generally speaking the most cultivated or the most attractive of the brethren who remain in the place where they were born the ardent the daring the enterprising are off to the ends of the earth and the choice of the sisters who remain at home is therefore confined to a restricted list and so it ends in these delightful rosegardens of single women which abound in new englandwomen who remain at home as housekeepers to aged parents and charming persons in society women over whose graces of conversation and manner the married men in their vicinity go off into raptures of eulogium which generally end with why hasnt that woman ever got married  it often happens to such women to expend on some brother that stock of heroworship and devotion which it has not come in their way to give to a nearer friend alas it is building on a sandy foundation for just as the union of hearts is complete the chemical affinity which began in the cradle and strengthens with every year of life is dissolved by the introduction of that third element which makes of the brother a husband while the new combination casts out the oldsometimes with a disagreeable effervescence  john and grace seymour were two only children of a very affectionate family and they had grown up in the closest habits of intimacy they had written to each other those long letters in which thoughtful people who live in retired situations delight letters not of outward events but of sentiments and opinions the phases of the inner life they had studied and pursued courses of reading together they had together organized and carried on works of benevolence and charity  the brother and sister had been left joint heirs of a large manufacturing property employing hundreds of hands in their vicinity and the care and cultivation of these workpeople the education of their children had been most conscientiously upon their minds half of every sunday they devoted together to labors in the sunday school of their manufacturing village and the two worked so harmoniously together in the interests of their life that grace had never felt the want of any domestic ties or relations other than those that she had  our readers may perhaps therefore concede that among the many claimants for their sympathy in this crossgrained world of ours some few grains of it may properly be due to grace  things are trials that try us afflictions are what afflict us and under this showing grace was both tried and afflicted by the sudden engagement of her brother when the whole groundwork on which ones daily life is built caves in and falls into the cellar without one moments warning it is not in human nature to pick ones self up and reconstruct and rearrange in a moment so grace thought at any rate but she made a hurried effort to dash back her tears and gulp down a rising in her throat anxious only not to be selfish and not to disgust her brother in the outset with any personal egotism  so she ran to the front door to meet him and fell into his arms trying so hard to seem congratulatory and affectionate that she broke out into sobbing  my dear gracie said john embracing and kissing her with that gushing fervor with which newly engaged gentlemen are apt to deluge every creature whom they meet youve got my letter well were not you astonished  o john it was so sudden was all poor grace could say and you know john since mother died you and i have been all in all to each other  and so we shall be gracie why yes of course we shall he said stroking her hair and playing with her trembling thin white hands why this only makes me love you the more now and you will love my little lillie fact is you cant help it we shall both of us be happier for having her here  well you know john i never saw her said grace deprecatingly and so you cant wonder  oh yes of course dont wonder in the least it comes rather suddenand then you havent seen her look here is her photograph said john producing one from the most orthodox innermost region directly over his heart look there isnt it beautiful  it is a very sweet face said grace exerting herself to be sympathetic and thankful that she could say that much truthfully  illustration it is a very sweet face  i cant imagine said john what ever made her like me you know she has refused half the fellows in the country i hadnt the remotest idea that she would have any thing to say to me but you see theres no accounting for tastes and john plumed himself as young gentlemen do who have carried off prizes  you see he added its odd but she took a fancy to me the first time she saw me now you know gracie i never found it easy to get along with ladies at first but lillie has the most extraordinary way of putting a fellow at his ease why she made me feel like an old friend the first hour  indeed  look here said john triumphantly drawing out his pocketbook and producing thence a knot of rosecolored satin ribbon did you ever see such a lovely color as this its so exquisite you see well she always is wearing just such knots of ribbon the most lovely shades why there isnt one woman in a thousand could wear the things she does every thing becomes her sometimes its rose color or lilac or pale bluejust the most trying things to others are what she can wear  dear john i hope you looked for something deeper than the complexion in a wife said grace driven to moral reflections in spite of herself  oh of course said john she has such soft gentle winning ways she is so sympathetic shes just the wife to make home happy to be a bond of union to us all now in a wife what we want is just that lillies mind for instance hasnt been cultivated as yours and letitias she isnt at all that sort of girl shes just a dear gentle little confiding creature that youll delight in youll form her mind and shell look up to you you know shes young yet  young john why shes seven and twenty said grace with astonishment  oh no my dear gracie that is all a mistake she told me herself shes only twenty you see the trouble is she went into company injudiciously early a mere baby in fact and that causes her to have the name of being older than she is but i do assure you shes only twenty she told me so herself  oh indeed said grace prudently choking back the contradiction which she longed to utter i know it seems a good many summers since i heard of her as a belle at newport  ah yes exactly you see she went into company as a young lady when she was only thirteen she told me all about it her parents were very injudicious and they pushed her forward she regrets it now she knows that it wasnt the thing at all shes very sensitive to the defects in her early education but i made her understand that it was the heart more than the head that i cared for i dare say gracie shell fall into all our little ways without really knowing and you in point of fact will be mistress of the house as much as you ever were lillie is delicate and never has had any care and will be only too happy to depend on you shes one of the gentle dependent sort you know  to this statement grace did not reply she only began nervously sweeping together the débris of leaves and flowers which encumbered the table on which the newly arranged flowervases were standing then she arranged the vases with great precision on the mantelshelf as she was doing it so many memories rushed over her of that room and her mother and the happy peaceful family life that had hitherto been led there that she quite broke down and sitting down in the chair she covered her face and went off in a good hearty crying spell  poor john was inexpressibly shocked he loved and revered his sister beyond any thing in the world and it occurred to him in a dim wise that to be suddenly dispossessed and shut out in the cold when one has hitherto been the first object of affection is to make the best of it a real and sore trial  but grace soon recovered herself and rose up smiling through her tears what a fool i am making of myself she said the fact is john i am only a little nervous you mustnt mind it you know she said laughing we old maids are like catswe find it hard to be put out of our old routine i dare say we shall all of us be happier in the end for this and i shall try to do all i can to make it so perhaps john id better take that little house of mine on elm street and set up my tent in it and take all the old furniture and old pictures and oldtime things youll be wanting to modernize and make over this house you know to suit a young wife  nonsense gracie no such thing said john do you suppose i want to leave all the past associations of my life and strip my home bare of all pleasant memorials because i bring a little wife here why the very idea of a wife is somebody to sympathize in your tastes and lillie will love and appreciate all these dear old things as you and i do she has such a sympathetic heart if you want to make me happy gracie stay here and let us live as near as may be as before  so we will john said grace so cheerfully that john considered the whole matter as settled and rushed upstairs to write his daily letter to lillie     chapter iv   preparation for marriage  miss lillie ellis was sitting upstairs in her virgin bower which was now converted into a tumultuous seething caldron of millinery and mantuamaking such as usually precedes a wedding to be sure orders had been forthwith despatched to paris for the bridal regimentals and for a good part of the trousseau but that did not seem in the least to stand in the way of the timehonored confusion of sewing preparations at home which is supposed to waste the strength and exhaust the health of every bride elect  whether young women while disengaged do not have proper underclothing or whether they contemplate marriage as an awful gulf which swallows up all future possibilities of replenishing a wardrobecertain it is that no sooner is a girl engaged to be married than there is a blind and distracting rush and pressure and haste to make up for her immediately a stock of articles which up to that hour she has managed to live very comfortably and respectably without it is astonishing to behold the number of inexpressible things with french names which unmarried young ladies never think of wanting but which there is a desperate push to supply and have ranged in order the moment the matrimonial state is in contemplation  therefore it was that the virgin bower of lillie was kneedeep in a tangled mass of stuffs of various hues and description that the sharp sound of tearing off breadths resounded there that miss clippins and miss snippings and miss nippins were sewing there day and night that a sewingmachine was busily rattling in mammas room and that there were all sorts of pinking and quilling and braiding and hemming and whipping and ruffling and oversewing and catstitching and hemstitching and other female mysteries going on  as for lillie she lay in a loose negligé on the bed ready every five minutes to be called up to have something measured or tried on or fitted and to be consulted whether there should be fifteen or sixteen tucks and then an insertion or sixteen tucks and a series of puffs her labors wore upon her and it was smilingly observed by miss clippins across to miss nippins that miss lillie was beginning to show her engagement bones in the midst of these preoccupations a letter was handed to her by the giggling chambermaid it was a thick letter directed in a bold honest hand miss lillie took it with a languid little yawn finished the last sentences in a chapter of the novel she was reading and then leisurely broke the seal and glanced it over it was the one that the enraptured john had spent his morning in writing  miss ellis now if youll try on this jacketoh i beg your pardon said miss clippins observing the letter we can wait of course and then all three laughed as if something very pleasant was in their minds  no said lillie giving the letter a toss itll keep and she stood up to have a jaunty little blue jacket with its pluffy bordering of swans down fitted upon her  its too bad now to take you from your letter said miss clippins with a sly nod  im sure you take it philosophically said miss nippins with a giggle  why shouldnt i said the divine lillie i get one every day and its all the old story ive heard it ever since i was born  well now to be sure you have lets see said miss clippins this is the seventyfourth or seventyfifth offer was it  oh you must ask mamma she keeps the lists im sure i dont trouble my head said the little beauty and she looked so natty and jaunty when she said it just arching her queenly white neck and making soft downy dimples in her cheeks as she gave her fresh little childlike laugh turning round and round before the lookingglass and issuing her orders for the fitting of the jacket with a precision and real interest which showed that there were things in the world which didnt become old stories even if one had been used to them ever since one was born  lillie never was caught napping when the point in question was the fit of her clothes  when released from the little blue jacket there was a rosecolored morningdress to be tried on and a grave discussion as to whether the honiton lace was to be set on plain or frilled  so important was this case that mamma was summoned from the sewingmachine to give her opinion mrs ellis was a fat fair rosy matron of most undisturbed conscience and digestion whose main business in life had always been to see to her childrens clothes she had brought up lillie with faithful and religious zeal that is to say she had always ruffled her underclothes with her own hands and darned her stockings sick or well and also as before intimated kept a list of her offers which she was ready in confidential moments to tell off to any of her acquaintance the question of ruffled or plain honiton was of such vital importance that the whole four took some time in considering it in its various points of view  sarah selfridge had hers ruffled said lillie  and the effect was perfectly sweet said miss clippins  perhaps lillie you had better have it ruffled said mamma  but three rows laid on plain has such a lovely effect said miss nippins  perhaps then she had better have three rows laid on plain said mamma  or she might have one row ruffled on the edge with three rows laid on plain with a satin fold said miss clippins thats the way i fixed miss elliotts  that would be a nice way said mamma perhaps lillie youd better have it so  oh come now all of you just hush said lillie i know just how i want it done  the words may sound a little rude and dictatorial but lillie had the advantage of always looking so pretty and saying dictatorial things in such a sweet voice that everybody was delighted with them and she took the matter of arranging the trimming in hand with a clearness of head which showed that it was a subject to which she had given mature consideration mrs ellis shook her fat sides with a comfortable motherly chuckle  lillie always did know exactly what she wanted shes a smart little thing  and when all the trying on and arranging of folds and frills and pinks and bows was over lillie threw herself comfortably upon the bed to finish her letter  shrewd miss clippins detected the yawn with which she laid down the missive  illustration shrewd miss clippins detected the yawn  seems to me your letters dont meet a very warm reception she said  well every day and such long ones lillie answered turning over the pages see there she went on opening a drawer what a heap of them i cant see for my part what any one can want to write a letter every day to anybody for john is such a goose about me  hell get over it after hes been married six months said miss clippins nodding her head with the air of a woman that has seen life  im sure i shant care said lillie with a toss of her pretty head its borous any way  our readers may perhaps imagine from the story thus far that our little lillie is by no means the person in reality that john supposes her to be when he sits thinking of her with such devotion and writing her such long borous letters  she is not john is in love not with the actual lillie ellis but with that ideal personage who looks like his mothers picture and is the embodiment of all his mothers virtues the feeling as it exists in johns mind is not only a most respectable but in fact a truly divine one and one that no mortal man ought to be ashamed of the love that quickens all the nature that makes a man twice manly and makes him aspire to all that is high pure sweet and religiousis a feeling so sacred that no unworthiness in its object can make it any less beautiful more often than not it is spent on an utter vacancy men and women both pass through this divine initiationthis sacred inspiration of our natureand find when they have come into the innermost shrine where the divinity ought to be that there is no god or goddess there nothing but the cold black ashes of commonplace vulgarity and selfishness both of them when the grand discovery has been made do well to fold their robes decently about them and make the best of the matter if they cannot love they can at least be friendly they can tolerate as philosophers pity as christians and finding just where and how the burden of an illassorted union galls the least can then and there strap it on their backs and walk on not only without complaint but sometimes in a cheerful and hilarious spirit  not a word of all this thinks our friend john as he sits longing aspiring and pouring out his heart day after day in letters that interrupt lillie in the allimportant responsibility of getting her wardrobe fitted  shall we think this smooth little fairskinned lillie is a coldhearted monster because her heart does not beat faster at these letters which she does not understand and which strike her as unnecessarily prolix and prosy why should john insist on telling her his feelings and opinions on a vast variety of subjects that she does not care a button for she doesnt know any thing about ritualism and antiritualism and whats more she doesnt care she hates to hear so much about religion she thinks its pokey john may go to any church he pleases for all her as to all that about his favorite poems she dont like poetrynever coulddont see any sense in it and john will be quoting ever so much in his letters then as to the love partsit may be all quite new and exciting to john but she has as she said heard that story over and over again till it strikes her as quite a matter of course without doubt the whole world is a desert where she is not the thing has been asserted over and over by so many gentlemen of credible character for truth and veracity that she is forced to believe it and she cannot see why john is particularly to be pitied on this account he is in no more desperate state about her than the rest of them and secretly lillie has as little pity for lovers pangs as a nice little white cat has for mice they amuse her they are her appropriate recreation and she pats and plays with each mouse in succession without any comprehension that it may be a serious thing for him  when lillie was a little girl eight years old she used to sell her kisses through the slats of the fence for papers of candy and thus early acquired the idea that her charms were a capital to be employed in trading for the good things of life she had the misfortuneand a great one it isto have been singularly beautiful from the cradle and so was praised and exclaimed over and caressed as she walked through the streets she was sent for far and near borrowed to be looked at her picture taken by photographers if one reflects how many foolish and inconsiderate people there are in the world who have no scruple in making a pet and plaything of a pretty child one will see how this one unlucky lot of being beautiful in childhood spoiled lillies chances of an average share of good sense and goodness the only hope for such a case lies in the chance of possessing judicious parents lillie had not these her father was a shrewd grocer and nothing more and her mother was a competent cook and seamstress while he traded in sugar and salt and she made pickles and embroidered underlinen the pretty lillie was educated as pleased heaven  pretty girls unless they have wise mothers are more educated by the opposite sex than by their own put them where you will there is always some man busying himself in their instruction and the burden of masculine teaching is generally about the same and might be stereotyped as follows you dont need to be or do any thing your business in life is to look pretty and amuse us you dont need to study you know all by nature that a woman need to know you are by virtue of being a pretty woman superior to any thing we can teach you and we wouldnt for the world have you any thing but what you are when lillie went to school this was what her masters whispered in her ear as they did her sums for her and helped her through her lessons and exercises and looked into her eyes this was what her young gentlemen friends themselves delving in latin and greek and mathematics told her when they came to recreate from their severer studies in her smile men are held to account for talking sense pretty women are told that lively nonsense is their best sense now and then an admirer bolder than the rest ventured to take lillies education more earnestly in hand and recommended to her just a little readingenough to enable her to carry on conversation and appear to know something of the ordinary topics discussed in societybut informed her by the by that there was no sort of need of being either profound or accurate in these matters as the mistakes of a pretty woman had a grace of their own  at seventeen lillie graduated from dr sibthorpes school with a finished education she had somehow or other picked her way through various ologies and exercises supposed to be necessary for a wellinformed young lady she wrote a pretty hand spoke french with a good accent and could turn a sentimental note neatly and that my dear said dr sibthorpe to his wife is all that a woman needs who so evidently is intended for wife and mother as our little lillie dr sibthorpe in fact had amused himself with a semipaternal flirtation with his pupil during the whole course of her school exercises and parted from her with tears in his eyes greatly to her amusement for lillie after all estimated his devotion at just about what it was worth it amused her to see him make a fool of himself  of course the next thing wasto be married and lillies life now became a round of dressing dancing going to wateringplaces travelling and in other ways seeking the fulfilment of her destiny  she had precisely the accessible easy softness of manner that leads every man to believe that he may prove a favorite and her run of offers became quite a source of amusement her arrival at wateringplaces was noted in initials in the papers her dress on every public occasion was described and as acknowledged queen of love and beauty she had everywhere her little court of men and women flatterers the women flatterers around a belle are as much a part of the cortége as the men they repeat the compliments they hear and burn incense in the virgins bower at hours when the profaner sex may not enter  the life of a petted creature consists essentially in being deferred to for being pretty and useless a petted child runs a great risk if it is ever to outgrow childhood but a pet woman is a perpetual child the pet woman of society is everybodys toy everybody looks at her admires her praises and flatters her stirs her up to play off her little airs and graces for their entertainment and passes on men of profound sense encourage her to chatter nonsense for their amusement just as we delight in the tottering steps and stammering mispronunciations of a goldenhaired child when lillie has been in washington she has had judges of the supreme court and secretaries of state delighted to have her give her opinions in their respective departments scholars and literary men flocked around her to the neglect of many a more instructed woman satisfied that she knew enough to blunder agreeably on every subject  nor is there any thing in the christian civilization of our present century that condemns the kind of life we are describing as in any respect unwomanly or unbecoming something very like it is in a measure considered as the appointed rule of attractive young girls till they are married  lillie had numbered among her admirers many lights of the church she had flirted with bishops priests and deaconswho none of them would for the world have been so ungallant as to quote to her such dreadful professional passages as she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth  in fact the clergy when off duty are no safer guides of attractive young women than other mortal men and lillie had so often seen their spiritual attentions degenerate into downright temporal lovemaking that she held them in as small reverence as the rest of their sex only one dreadful john the baptist of her acquaintance one of the camelshairgirdle and locustandwildhoney species once encountering lillie at saratoga and observing the ways and manners of the court which she kept there took it upon him to give her a spiritual admonition  miss lillie he said i see no chance for the salvation of your soul unless it should please god to send the smallpox upon you i think i shall pray for that  oh horrors dont id rather never be saved lillie answered with a fervent sincerity  the story was repeated afterwards as an amusing bon mot and a specimen of the barbarity to which religious fanaticism may lead and yet we question whether john the baptist had not the right of it  for it must at once appear that had the smallpox made the abovementioned change in lillies complexion at sixteen the entire course of her life would have taken another turn the whole world then would have united in letting her know that she must live to some useful purpose or be nobody and nothing schoolmasters would have scolded her if she idled over her lessons and her breaking down in arithmetic and mistakes in history would no longer have been regarded as interesting clergymen consulted on her spiritual state would have told her freely that she was a miserable sinner who except she repented must likewise perish in short all those bitter and wholesome truths which strengthen and invigorate the virtues of plain people might possibly have led her a long way on towards saintship  as it was little lillie was confessedly no saint and yet if much of a sinner society has as much to answer for as she she was the daughter and flower of the christian civilization of the nineteenth century and the land of woman that on the whole men of quite distinguished sense have been fond of choosing for wives and will go on seeking to the end of the chapter  did she love john well she was quite pleased to be loved by him and she liked the prospect of being his wife she was sure he would always let her have her own way and that he had a plenty of worldly means to do it with  lillie if not very clever in a literary or scientific point of view was no fool she had in fact under all her softness of manner a great deal of that real hard grit which shrewd worldly people call common sense she saw through all the illusions of fancy and feeling right to the tough material core of things however soft and tender and sentimental her habits of speech and action were in her professional capacity of a charming woman still the fair lillie had she been a man would have been respected in the business world as one that had cut her eyeteeth and knew on which side her bread was buttered  a husband she knew very well was the man who undertook to be responsible for his wifes bills he was the giver bringer and maintainer of all sorts of solid and appreciable comforts  lillies bills had hitherto been sore places in the domestic history of her family the career of a fashionable belle is not to be supported without something of an outlay and that innocence of arithmetical combinations over which she was wont to laugh bewitchingly among her adorers sometimes led to results quite astounding to the prosaic hardworking papa who stood financially responsible for all her finery  mamma had often been called in to calm the tumult of his feelings on such semiannual developments and she did it by pointing out to him that this heavy present expense was an investment by which lillie was in the end to make her own fortune and that of her family  when lillie contemplated the marriageservice with a view to going through it with john there was one clause that stood out in consoling distinctnesswith all my worldly goods i thee endow  as to the other clause which contains the dreadful word obey about which our modern women have such fearful apprehensions lillie was ready to swallow it without even a grimace  obey john her face wore a pretty air of droll assurance at the thought it was too funny  my dear said belle trevors who was one of lillies incenseburners and a bridesmaid elect have you the least idea how rich he is  he is well enough off to do about any thing i want said lillie  well you know he owns the whole village of spindlewood with all those great factories besides law business said belle but then they live in a dreadfully slow pokey way down there in springdale they havent the remotest idea how to use money  i can show him how to use it said lillie  he and his sister keep a nice sort of oldfashioned place there and jog about in an old countrified carriage picking up poor children and visiting schools she is a very superior woman that sister  i dont like superior women said lillie  but you must like her you know john is perfectly devoted to her and i suppose she is to be a fixture in the establishment  we shall see about that said lillie one thing at a time i dont mean he shall live at springdale its horridly pokey to live in those little country towns he must have a house in new york  and a place at newport for the summer said belle trevors  yes said lillie a cottage in newport does very well in the season and then a country place well fitted up to invite company to in the other months of summer  delightful said belle if you can make him do it  see if i dont said lillie  you dear funny creature youhow you do always ride on the top of the wave said belle  its what i was born for said lillie by the by belle i got a letter from harry last night  poor fellow had he heard  why of course not i didnt want he should till its all over its best you know  he is such a good fellow and so devotedit does seem a pity  devoted well i should rather think he was said lillie i believe he would cut off his right hand for me any day but i never gave him any encouragement ive always told him i could be to him only as a sister you know  you ought not to write to him said belle  what can i do he is perfectly desperate if i dont and still persists that he means to marry me some day spite of my screams  well hell have to stop making love to you after youre married  oh pshaw i dont believe that oldfashioned talk lovers make a variety in life i dont see why a married woman is to give up all the fun of having admirers of course one isnt going to do any thing wrong you know but one doesnt want to settle down into darby and joan at once why some of the young married women the most stunning belles at newport last year got a great deal more attention after they were married than they did before you see the fellows like it because they are so sure not to be drawn in  i think its too bad on us girls though said belle you ought to leave us our turn  oh ill turn over any of them to you belle said lillie theres harry to begin with what do you say to him  thank you i dont think i shall take up with secondhand articles said belle with some spirit  but here the entrance of the chambermaid with a fresh dress from the dressmakers resolved the conversation into a discussion so very minute and technical that it cannot be recorded in our pages     chapter v   wedding and weddingtrip  well and so they were married with all the newest modern forms ceremonies and accessories  every possible thing was done to reflect lustre on the occasion there were eight bridesmaids and every one of them fair as the moon and eight groomsmen with whitesatin ribbons and white rosebuds in their buttonholes and there was a bishop assisted by a priest to give the solemn benedictions of the church and there was a marriagebell of tuberoses and lilies of enormous size swinging over the heads of the pair at the altar and there were voluntaries on the organ and chantings and what not all solemn and impressive as possible in the midst of all this the fair lillie promised forsaking all others to keep only unto him so long as they both should liveto love honor and obey until death did them part  during the whole agitating scene lillie kept up her presence of mind and was perfectly aware of what she was about so that a very fresh original and crisp style of trimming that had been invented in paris specially for her wedding toilet received no detriment from the least unguarded movement we much regret that it is contrary to our literary principles to write half or one third in french because the weddingdress by far the most important object on this occasion and certainly one that most engrossed the thoughts of the bride was one entirely indescribable in english just as there is no word in the hottentot vocabulary for holiness or purity so there are no words in our savage english to describe a ladys dress and therefore our fair friends must be recommended on this point to exercise their imagination in connection with the study of the finest french plates and they may get some idea of lillie in her wedding robe and train  then there was the wedding banquet where everybody ate quantities of the most fashionable indigestible horrors with praiseworthy courage and enthusiasm for what is to become of paté de fois gras if we dont eat it what is to become of us if we do is entirely a secondary question  on the whole there was not one jot nor tittle of the most exorbitant requirements of fashion that was not fulfilled on this occasion the house was a crush of wilting flowers and smelt of tuberoses enough to give one a vertigo for a month a band of music brayed and clashed every minute of the time and a jam of people in elegant dresses shrieked to each other above the din and several of lillies former admirers got tipsy in the supperroom in short nothing could be finer and it was agreed on all hands that it was stunning accounts of it and of all the brides dresses presents and even wardrobe went into the daily papers and thus was the charming lillie ellis made into mrs john seymour  then followed the approved wedding journey the programme of which had been drawn up by lillie herself with carte blanche from john and included every place where a brides new toilets could be seen in the most select fashionable circles they went to niagara and trenton they went to newport and saratoga to the white mountains and montreal and mrs john seymour was a meteor of fashionable wonder and delight at all these places her dresses and her diamonds her hats and her bonnets were all wonderful to behold the stir and excitement that she had created as simple miss ellis was nothing to the stir and excitement about mrs john seymour it was the mere grub compared with the fullblown butterflythe bud compared with the rose wherever she appeared her old admirers flocked in her train the unmarried girls were so to speak nowhere marriage was a new lease of power and splendor and she revelled in it like a hummingbird in the sunshine  and was john equally happy well to say the truth johns head was a little turned by the possession of this curious and manifold creature that fluttered and flapped her wings about the eyes and ears of his understanding and appeared before him every day in some new device of the toilet fair and fresh smiling and bewitching kissing and coaxing laughing and crying and in all ways bewildering him the once soberminded john till he scarce knew whether he stood on his head or his heels he knew that this sort of rattling scatterbrained life must come to an end some time he knew there was a sober serious lifework for him something that must try his mind and soul and strength and that would by and by leave him neither time nor strength to be the mere wandering attaché of a gay bird whose string he held in hand and who now seemed to pull him hither and thither at her will  john thought of all these things at intervals and then when he thought of the quiet sober respectable life at springdale of the good old staple families with their steady waysof the girls in his neighborhood with their reading societies their sewingcircles for the poor their bookclubs and artunions for practice in various accomplishmentshe thought with apprehension that there appeared not a spark of interest in his charmers mind for any thing in this direction she never had read any thingknew nothing on all those subjects about which the women and young girls in his circle were interested while in springdale there were none of the excitements which made her interested in life he could not help perceiving that lillies five hundred particular friends were mostly of the other sex and wondering whether he alone when the matter should be reduced to that could make up to her for all her retinue of slaves  like most good boys who grow into good men john had unlimited faith in women whatever little defects and flaws they might have still at heart he supposed they were all of the same substratum as his mother and sister the moment a woman was married he imagined that all the lovely domestic graces would spring up in her no matter what might have been her previous disadvantages merely because she was a woman he had no doubt of the usual orthodox oakandivy theory in relation to man and woman and that his wife when he got one would be the clinging ivy that would bend her flexible tendrils in the way his strong will and wisdom directed he had never perhaps seen in southern regions a fine tree completely smothered and killed in the embraces of a gay flaunting parasite and so received no warning from vegetable analogies  somehow or other he was persuaded he should gradually bring his wife to all his own ways of thinking and all his schemes and plans and opinions this might he thought be difficult were she one of the pronounced strongminded sort accustomed to thinking and judging for herself such a one he could easily imagine there might be a risk in encountering in the close intimacy of domestic life even in his dealings with his sister he was made aware of a force of character and a vigor of intellect that sometimes made the carrying of his own way over hers a matter of some difficulty were it not that grace was the best of women and her ways always the very best of ways john was not so sure but that she might prove a little too masterful for him  but this lovely bit of pink and white this downy gauzy airy little elf this creature so slim and slender and unsubstantialsurely he need have no fear that he could not mould and control and manage her oh no he imagined her melting like a moonbeam into all manner of sweet compliances becoming an image and reflection of his own better self and repeated to himself the lines of wordsworth    i saw her on a nearer view   a spirit yet a woman too   her household motions light and free   and steps of virgin liberty   a creature not too bright or good   for human natures daily food   for transient pleasures simple wiles   praise blame love kisses tears and smiles  john fancied he saw his little lillie subdued into a pattern wife weaned from fashionable follies eagerly seeking mental improvement under his guidance and joining him and grace in all sorts of edifying works and ways  the reader may see from the conversations we have detailed that nothing was farther from lillies intentions than any such conformity  the intentions of the married pair in fact ran exactly contrary to one another john meant to bring lillie to a sober rational useful family life and lillie meant to run a career of fashionable display and make john pay for it  neither at present stated their purposes precisely to the other because they were honeymooning john as yet was the enraptured lover and lillie was his pink and white sultanahis absolute mistress her word was law and his will was hers how the case was ever to be reversed so as to suit the terms of the marriage service john did not precisely inquire  but when husband and wife start in life with exactly opposing intentions which think you is likely to conquerthe man or the woman that is a very nice question and deserves further consideration     chapter vi   honeymoon and after  we left mr and mrs john seymour honeymooning the honeymoon dear ladies is supposed to be the period of male subjection the young queen is enthroned and the first of her slaves walks obediently in her train carries her fan her parasol runs of her errands packs her trunk writes her letters buys her any thing she cries for and is ready to do the impossible for her on every suitable occasion  a great strong man sometimes feels awkwardly when thus led captive but the greatest strongest and most boastful often go most obediently under womanrule for which see shakspeare concerning cleopatra and julius caesar and mark antony  but then all kingdoms and all sway and all authority must come to an end nothing lasts you see the plain prose of life must have its turn after the poetry and honeymoonsstretch them out to their utmost limithave their terminus  so at the end of six weeks john and lillie somewhat dusty and travelworn were received by grace into the old familymansion at springdale  grace had read her bible and fénelon to such purpose that she had accepted her cross with open arms  dear reader grace was not a severe angular oldmaid sister ready to snarl at the advent of a young beauty but an elegant and accomplished woman with a wide culture a trained and disciplined mind a charming taste and polished manners and above all a thorough selfunderstanding and discipline though past thirty she still had admirers and lovers yet till now her brother insensibly to herself had blocked up the doorway of her heart and the perfectness of the fraternal friendship had prevented the wish and the longing by which some fortunate man might have found and given happiness  grace had resolved she would love her new sister that she would look upon all her past faults and errors with eyes of indulgence that she would put out of her head every story she ever had heard against her and unite with her brother to make her lot a happy one  john is so good a man she said to miss letitia ferguson that i am sure lillie cannot but become a good woman  so grace adorned the wedding with her presence in an elegant parisian dress ordered for the occasion and presented the young bride with a set of pearl and amethyst that were perfectly bewitching and kisses and notes of affection had been exchanged between them and during various intervals and for weeks past grace had been pleasantly employed in preparing the familymansion to receive the new mistress  johns bachelor apartments had been new furnished and furbished and made into a perfect bower of roses  the rest of the house after the usual household process of purification had been rearranged as john and his sister had always kept it since their mothers death in the way that she loved to see it there was something quaint and sweet and antique about it that suited grace its unfashionable difference from the smart flippant stereotyped rooms of today had a charm in her eyes  lillie however surveyed the scene the first night that she took possession with a quiet determination to remodernize on the very earliest opportunity what would mrs frippit and mrs nippit say to such rooms she thought but then there was time enough to attend to that not a shade of these internal reflections was visible in her manner she said oh how sweet how perfectly charming how splendid in all proper places and john was delighted  she also fell into the arms of grace and kissed her with effusion and john saw the sisterly union which he had anticipated auspiciously commencing  the only trouble in graces mind was from a terrible sort of clairvoyance that seems to beset very sincere people and makes them sensitive to the presence of any thing unreal or untrue fair and soft and caressing as the new sister was and determined as grace was to believe in her and trust her and like hershe found an invisible chilly barrier between her heart and lillie she scolded herself and in the effort to confide became unnaturally demonstrative and said and did more than was her wont to show affection and yet to her own mortification she found herself after all seeming to herself to be hypocritical and professing more than she felt  as to the fair lillie who as we have remarked was no fool she took the measure of her new sister with that instinctive knowledge of character which is the essence of womanhood lillie was not in love with john because that was an experience she was not capable of but she had married him and now considered him as her property her subjecthers with an intensity of ownership that should shut out all former proprietors  we have heard much talk of late concerning the husbands ownership of the wife but dear ladies is that any more pronounced a fact than every wifes ownership of her husbandan ownership so intense and pervading that it may be said to be the controlling nerve of womanhood let any one touch your right to the first place in your husbands regard and see  well then lillie saw at a glance just what grace was and what her influence with her brother must be and also that in order to live the life she meditated john must act under her sway and not under his sisters and so the resolve had gone forth in her mind that graces dominion in the family should come to an end and that she would as sole empress reconstruct the state but of course she was too wise to say a word about it  dear me she said the next morning when grace proposed showing her through the house and delivering up the keys im sure i dont see why you want to show things to me im nothing of a housekeeper you know all i know is what i want and ive always had what i wanted you know but you see i havent the least idea how its to be done why at home ive been everybodys baby mamma laughs at the idea of my knowing any thing so grace dear you must just be prime minister and ill be the goodfornothing queen and just sign the papers and all that you know  grace found the first week that to be housekeeper to a young duchess in an american village and with american servants was no sinecure  the young mistress the next week tumbled into the wash an amount of muslin and lace and french puffing and fluting sufficient to employ two artists for two or three days and by which honest bridget as she stood at her family washtub was sorely perplexed  but in america no woman ever dies for want of speaking her mind and the lower orders have their turn in teaching the catechism to their superiors which they do with an effectiveness that does credit to democracy  and would ye be plased to step here miss saymour said bridget to grace in a voice of suppressed emotion and pointing oratorically with her soapy right arm to a snowwreath of french finery and puffing on the floor what i asks miss grace is who is to do all this im sure it would take me and katy a week workin day and night let alone the cookin and the silver and the beds and all them its a pity now somebody shouldnt spake to that young crather fur shes nothin but a baby and likely dont know any thing as ladies mostly dont about whats right and proper bridgets christian charity and condescension in this last sentence was some mitigation of the crisis but still grace was appalled we all of us my dear sisters have stood appalled at the tribunal of good bridgets rising in their majesty and declaring their ultimatum  illustration who is to do all this  bridget was a treasure in the town of springdale where servants were scarce and poor and what was more she was a treasure that knew her own worth grace knew very well how she had been beset with applications and offers of higher wages to draw her to various hotels and boardinghouses in the vicinity but had preferred the comparative dignity and tranquillity of a private gentlemans family  but the family had been small orderly and systematic and grace the most considerate of housekeepers still it was not to be denied that though an indulgent and considerate mistress bridget was in fact mistress of the seymour mansion and that her mind and will concerning the washing must be made known to the young queen  it was a sore trial to speak to lillie but it would be sorer to be left at once desolate in the kitchen department and exposed to the marauding inroads of unskilled hibernians  in the most delicate way grace made lillie acquainted with the domestic crisis as in old times a prime minister might have carried to one of the charleses the remonstrance and protest of the house of commons  oh im sure i dont know how its to be done said lillie gayly mamma always got my things done somehow they always were done and always must be you just tell her so i think its always best to be decided with servants face em down in the beginning  but you see lillie dear its almost impossible to get servants at all in springdale and such servants as ours everybody says are an exception if we talk to bridget in that way shell just go off and leave us and then what shall we do  what in the world does john want to live in such a place for said lillie peevishly there are plenty of servants to be got in new york and thats the only place fit to live in well its no affair of mine tell john he married me and must take care of me he must settle it some way i shant trouble my head about it  the idea of living in new york and uprooting the old timehonored establishment in springdale struck grace as a sort of sacrilege yet she could not help feeling with a kind of fear that the young mistress had power to do it  dont darling talk so for pitys sake she said i will go to john and we will arrange it somehow  a long consultation with faithful john in the evening revealed to him the perplexing nature of the material processes necessary to get up his fair puff of thistledown in all that wonderful whiteness and fancifulness of costume which had so entranced him  lillie cried and said she never had any trouble before about getting her things done she was sure mamma or trixie or somebody did them or got them doneshe never knew how or when with many tears and sobs she protested her ardent desire to realize the scriptural idea of the fowls of the air and the lilies of the field which were fed and clothed like solomon in all his glory without ever giving a moments care to the matter  john kissed and embraced and wiped away her tears and declared she should have every thing just as she desired it if it took the half of his kingdom  after consoling his fair one he burst into graces room in the evening just at the hour when they used to have their old brotherly and sisterly confidential talks  you see gracepoor lillie dear little thingyou dont know how distressed she is and grace we must find somebody to do up all her folderols and fizgigs for her you know you see shes been used to this kind of thing cant do without it  well ill try tomorrow john said grace patiently there is mrs atkinsshe is a very nice woman  oh exactly just the thing said john yes well get her to take all lillies things every week that settles it  do you know john at the prices that mrs atkins asks you will have to pay more than for all your family service together what we have this week would be twenty dollars at the least computation and it is worth it toothe work of getting up is so elaborate  john opened his eyes and looked grave like all stable newengland families the seymours while they practised the broadest liberality had instincts of great sobriety in expense needless profusion shocked them as out of taste and a quiet and decent reticence in matters of selfindulgence was habitual with them  such a price for the fine linen of his little angel rather staggered him but he gulped it down  well well oracle he said cost what it may she must have it as she likes it the little creature you see has never been accustomed to calculate or reflect in these matters and it is trial enough to come down to our stupid way of livingso different you know from the gay life she has been leading  miss seymours saintship was somewhat rudely tested by this remark that anybody should think it a sacrifice to be johns wife and a trial to accept the homestead at springdale with all its tranquillity and comfortsthat john under her influence should speak of the springdale life as stupidwas a little drop too much in her cup a bright streak appeared in either cheek as she said  well john i never knew you found springdale stupid before im sure we have been happy hereand her voice quavered  pshaw gracie you know what i mean i dont mean that i find it stupid i dont like the kind of rattlebrained life weve been leading this six weeks but then it just suits lillie and its so sweet and patient of her to come here and give it all up and say not a word of regret and then you see i shall be just up to my ears in business now and cant give up all my time to her as i have theres ever so much law business coming on and all the factory matters at spindlewood and i can see that lillie will have rather a hard time of it you must devote yourself to her gracie like a dear good soul as you always were and try to get her interested in our kind of life of course all our set will call and that will be something and thenthere will be some invitations out  oh yes john well manage it said grace who had by this time swallowed her anger and shouldered her cross once more with a womanly perseverance oh yes the fergusons and the wilcoxes and the lennoxes will all call and we shall have picnics and lawn teas and musicals and parties  yes yes i see said john gracie isnt she a dear little thing didnt she look cunning in that white wrapper this morning how do women do those things i wonder said john dont you think her manners are lovely  they are very sweet and she is charmingly pretty said grace and i love her dearly  and so affectionate dont you think so continued john shes a person that you can do any thing with through her heart shes all heart and very little head i ought not to say that either i think she has fair natural abilities had they ever been cultivated  my dear john said grace you forget what time it is goodnight     chapter vii   will she like it  john said grace when are you going out again to our sunday school at spindlewood they are all asking after you do you know it is now two months since they have seen you  i know it said john i am going tomorrow you see gracie i couldnt well before  oh i have told them all about it and i have kept things up but then there are so many who want to see you and so many things that you alone could settle and manage  oh yes ill go tomorrow said john and after this i shall be steady at it i wonder if we could get lillie to go said he doubtfully  grace did not answer lillie was a subject on which it was always embarrassing to her to be appealed to she was so afraid of appearing jealous or unappreciative and her opinions were so different from those of her brother that it was rather difficult to say any thing  do you think she would like it grace  indeed john you must know better than i if anybody could make her take an interest in it it would be you  before his marriage john had always had the idea that pretty affectionate little women were religious and selfdenying at heart as matters of course no matter through what labyrinths of fashionable follies and dissipation they had been wandering still a talent for saintship was lying dormant in their natures which it needed only the touch of love to develop the wings of the angel were always concealed under the fashionable attire of the belle and would unfold themselves when the hour came a nearer acquaintance with lillie he was forced to confess had not so far confirmed this idea though hers was a face so fair and pure that when he first knew her it suggested ideas of prayer and communion with angels yet he could not disguise from himself that in all near acquaintance with her she had proved to be most remarkably of the earth earthy she was alive and fervent about fashionable gossipof who is who and what does what she was alive to equipages to dress to sightseeing to dancing to any thing of which the whole stimulus and excitement was earthly and physical at times too he remembered that she had talked a sort of pensive sentimentalism of a slightly religious nature but the least idea of a moral purpose in lifeof selfdenial and devotion to something higher than immediate selfgratificationseemed never to have entered her head what is more john had found his attempts to introduce such topics with her always unsuccessful lillie either gaped in his face and asked him what time it was or playfully pulled his whiskers and asked him why he didnt take to the ministry or adroitly turned the conversation with kissing and compliments  sunday morning came shining down gloriously through the dewy elmarches of springdale the green turf on either side of the wide streets was mottled and flecked with vivid flashes and glimmers of emerald like the sheen of a changeable silk as here and there long arrows of sunlight darted down through the leaves and touched the ground  the gardens between the great shady houses that flanked the street were full of tall white and crimson phloxes in all the majesty of their summer bloom and the air was filled with fragrance and lillie after a two hours toilet came forth from her chamber fresh and lovely as the bride in the canticles thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee she was killingly dressed in the ruralsimplicity style all her robes and sashes were of purest white and a knot of fielddaisies and grasses with french dewdrops on them twinkled in an infinitesimal bonnet on her little head and her hair was all créped into a filmy golden aureole round her face in short dear reader she was a perfectly gotup angel and wanted only some tulle clouds and an opening heaven to have gone up at once as similar angels do from the parisian stage  you like me dont you she said as she saw the delight in johns eyes  john was tempted to lay hold of his plaything  dont nowyoull crumple me she said fighting him off with a dainty parasol positively you shant touch me till after church  john laid the little white hand on his arm with pride and looked down at her over his shoulder all the way to church he felt proud of her they would look at her and see how pretty she was he thought and so they did lillie had been used to admiration in church it was one of her fields of triumph she had received compliments on her toilet even from young clergymen who in the course of their preaching and praying found leisure to observe the beauties of nature and grace in their congregation she had been quite used to knowing of young men who got good seats in church simply for the purpose of seeing her consequently going to church had not the moral advantages for her that it has for people who go simply to pray and be instructed john saw the turning of heads and the little movements and whispers of admiration and his heart was glad within him the thought of her mingled with prayer and hymn even when he closed his eyes and bowed his head she was there  perhaps this was not exactly as it should be yet let us hope the angels look tenderly down on the sins of too much love john felt as if he would be glad of a chance to die for her and when he thought of her in his prayers it was because he loved her better than himself  as to lillie there was an extraordinary sympathy of sentiment between them at that moment john was thinking only of her and she was thinking only of herself as was her usual habitherself the one object of her life the one idol of her love  not that she knew in so many words that she the little frail bit of dust and ashes that she was was her own idol and that she appeared before her maker in those solemn walls to draw to herself the homage and the attention that was due to god alone but yet it was true that for years and years lillies unconfessed yet only motive for appearing in church had been the display of herself and the winning of admiration  but is she so much worse than othersthan the clergyman who uses the pulpit and the sacred office to show off his talentsthan the singers who sing gods praises to show their voiceswho intone the agonies of their redeemer or the glories of the te deum confident on the comments of the newspaper press on their performance the next week no lillie may be a little sinner but not above others in this matter  lillie said john to her after dinner assuming a careless matterofcourse air would you like to drive with me over to spindlewood and see my sunday school  your sunday school john why bless me do you teach sunday school  certainly i do grace and i have a school of two hundred children and young people belonging to our factories i am superintendent  i never did hear of any thing so odd said lillie what in the world can you want to take all that trouble forgo basking over there in the hot sun and be shut up with a room full of those illsmelling factorypeople why im sure it cant be your duty i wouldnt do it for the world nothing would tempt me why gracious john you might catch smallpox or something  pooh lillie child you dont know any thing about them they are just as cleanly and respectable as anybody  oh well they may be but these irish and germans and swedes and danes and all that low class do smell soyou neednt tell me nowthat workingclass smell is a thing that cant be disguised  but lillie these are our people they are the laborers from whose toils our wealth comes and we owe them something  well you pay them something dont you  i mean morally we owe our efforts to instruct their children and to elevate and guide them lillie i feel that it is wrong for us to use wealth merely as a means of selfgratification we ought to labor for those who labor for us we ought to deny ourselves and make some sacrifices of ease for their good  you dear old preachy creature said lillie how good you must be but really i havent the smallest vocation to be a missionarynot the smallest i cant think of any thing that would induce me to take a long hot ride in the sun and to sit in that stivedup room with those common creatures  john looked grave lillie he said you shouldnt speak of any of your fellowbeings in that heartless way  well now if you are going to scold me im sure i dont want to go im sure if everybody that stays at home and has comfortable times sundays instead of going out on missions is heartless there are a good many heartless people in the world  i beg your pardon my darling i didnt mean dear that you were heartless but that what you said sounded so i knew you didnt really mean it i didnt ask you dear to go to workonly to be company for me  and i ask you to stay at home and be company for me im sure it is lonesome enough here and you are off on business almost all your days and you might stay with me sundays you could hire some poor pious young man to do all the work over there there are plenty of them dear knows that it would be a real charity to help and that could preach and pray better than you can i know i dont think a man that is busy all the week ought to work sundays it is breaking the sabbath  but lillie i am interested in my sunday school i know all my people and they know me and no one else in the world could do for them what i could  well i should think you might be interested in me nobody else can do for me what you can and i want you to stay with me thats just the way with you men you dont care any thing about us after you get us  now lillie darling you know that isnt so  its just so you care more for your old missionary work now than you do for me im sure i never knew that id married a homemissionary  darling please now dont laugh at me and try to make me selfish and worldly you have such power over me you ought to be my inspiration  ill be your commonsense john when you get on stilts and run benevolence into the ground ill pull you down now i know it must be bad for a man that has as much as you do to occupy his mind all the week to go out and work sundays and its foolish when you could perfectly well hire somebody else to do it and stay at home and have a good time  but lillie i need it myself  need itwhat for i cant imagine  to keep me from becoming a mere selfish worldly man and living for mere material good and pleasure  you dear old don quixote well you are altogether in the clouds above me i cant understand a word of all that  well goodby darling said john kissing her and hastening out of the room to cut short the interview  milton has described the peculiar influence of woman over man in lowering his moral tone and bringing him down to what he considered the peculiarly womanly level you women he said to his wife when she tried to induce him to seek favors at court by some concession of principleyou women never care for any thing but to be fine and to ride in your coaches in father adams description of the original eve he says    all higher knowledge in her presence falls   degraded wisdom in discourse with her   loses discountenanced and like folly shows  something like this effect was always produced on johns mind when he tried to settle questions relating to his higher nature with lillie he seemed somehow always to get the worst of it all her womanly graces and fascinations so powerful over his senses and imagination arrayed themselves formidably against him and for the time seemed to strike him dumb what he believed and believed with enthusiasm when he was alone or with grace seemed to drizzle away and be belittled when he undertook to convince her of it lest john should be called a muff and a spoon for this peculiarity we cite once more the high authority aforesaid where milton makes poor adam tell the angel     yet when i approach   her loveliness so absolute she seems   and in herself complete so well to know   her own that what she wills to do or say   seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  john went out from lillies presence rather humbled and overcrowed when the woman that a man loves laughs at his moral enthusiasms it is like a black frost on the delicate tips of budding trees it is uphill work as we all know to battle with indolence and selfishness and selfseeking and hardhearted worldliness then the highest and holiest part of our nature has a bashfulness of its own it is a heavenly stranger and easily shamed a nimbletongued skilful woman can so easily show the ridiculous side of what seemed heroism and what is called commonsense so generally is only some neatly put phase of selfishness poor john needed the angel at his elbow to give him the caution which he is represented as giving to father adam     what transports thee so   an outsidefair no doubt and worthy well   thy cherishing thy honor and thy love   not thy subjection weigh her with thyself   then value ofttimes nothing profits more   than selfesteem grounded on just and right   well managed of that skill the more them knowest   the more she will acknowledge thee her head   and to realities yield all her shows  but john had no angel at his elbow he was a fellow with a great heartgood as goldwith upward aspirations but with slow speech and when not sympathized with he became confused and incoherent and even dumb so his only way with his little pink and white empress was immediate and precipitate flight  lillie ran to the window when he was gone and saw him and grace get into the carriage together and then she saw them drive to the old ferguson house and rose ferguson came out and got in with them well she said to herself he shant do that many times moreim resolved  no she did not say it it would be well for us all if we did put into words plain and explicit many instinctive resolves and purposes that arise in our hearts and which for want of being so expressed influence us undetected and unchallenged if we would say out boldly i dont care for right or wrong or good or evil or anybodys rights or anybodys happiness or the general good or god himselfall i care for or feel the least interest in is to have a good time myself and i mean to do it come what maywe should be only expressing a feeling which often lies in the dark backroom of the human heart and saying it might alarm us from the drugged sleep of life it might rouse us to shake off the slow creeping paralysis of selfishness and sin before it is for ever too late  but lillie was a creature who had lost the power of selfknowledge she was my dear sir what you suppose the true woman to bea bundle of blind instincts and among these the strongest was that of property in her husband and power over him she had lived in her power over men it was her field of ambition she knew them thoroughly women are called ivy and the ivy has a hundred little fingers in every inch of its length that strike at every flaw and crack and weak place in the strong wall they mean to overgrow and so had lillie she saw at a glance that the sober thoughtful christian life of springdale was wholly opposed to the life she wanted to lead and in which john was to be her instrument she saw that if such women as grace and rose had power with him she should not have and her husband should be hers alone he should do her will and be her subjectso she thought smiling at herself as she looked in the lookingglass and then curled herself peacefully and languidly down in the corner of the sofa and drew forth the french novel that was her usual sunday companion  lillie liked french novels there was an atmosphere of things in them that suited her the young married women had lovers and admirers and there was the constant stimulus of being courted and adored under the safe protection of a goodnatured mari  in france the flirting is all done after marriage and the young girl looks forward to it as her introduction to a career of conquest in america so great is our democratic liberality that we think of uniting the two systems we are getting on in that way fast a knowledge of french is beginning to be considered as the pearl of great price to gain which all else must be sold the girls must go to the french theatre and be stared at by french débauchées who laugh at them while they pretend they understand what thank heaven they cannot then we are to have series of french novels carefully translated and puffed and praised even by the religious press written by the corps of french female reformers which will show them exactly how the naughty french women manage their cards so that by and by we shall have the latest phase of eclecticismthe union of american and french manners the girl will flirt till twenty à laméricaine and then marry and flirt till forty à la française this was about lillies plan of life could she hope to carry it out in springdale     chapter viii   spindlewood  it seemed a little like old times to grace to be once more going with rose and john over the pretty romantic road to spindlewood  john did not reflect upon how little she now saw of him and how much of a trial the separation was but he noticed how bright and almost gay she was when they were by themselves once more he was gay too  in the congenial atmosphere of sympathy his confidence in himself and his own right in the little controversy that had occurred returned not that he said a word of it he did not do so and would not have done so for the world grace and rose were full of anecdotes of this that and the other of their scholars and all the particulars of some of their new movements were discussed the people had of their own accord raised a subscription for a library which was to be presented to john that day with a request that he would select the books  gracie that must be your work said john you know i shall have an important case next week  oh yes rose and i will settle it said grace rose well get the catalogues from all the bookstores and mark the things  well want books for the children just beginning to read and then books for the young men in johns bibleclass and all the way between said rose it will be quite a work to select  and then to bargain with the bookstores and make the money go far as possible said grace  and then therell be the covering of the books said rose ill tell you i think ill manage to have a lawn tea at our house and the girls shall all come early and get the books coveredthatll be charming  i think lillie would like that put in john  i should be so glad said rose what a lovely little thing she is i hope shell like it i wanted to get up something pretty for her i think at this time of the year lawn teas are a little variety  oh shell like it of course said john with some sinking of heart about the sundayschool books  there were so many pressing to shake hands with john and congratulate him so many histories to tell so many cases presented for consultation that it was quite late before they got away and tea had been waiting for them more than an hour when they returned  lillie looked pensive and had that indescribable air of patient martyrdom which some women know how to make so very effective lillie had good general knowledge of the science of martyrdoma little spice and flavor of it had been gently infused at times into her demeanor ever since she had been at springdale she could do the uncomplaining sufferer with the happiest effect she contrived to insinuate at times how she didnt complainhow dull and slow she found her life and yet how she endeavored to be cheerful  i know she said to john when they were by themselves that you and grace both think im a horrid creature  why no dearest indeed we dont  but you do though oh i feel it the fact is john i havent a particle of constitution and if i should try to go on as grace does it would kill me in a month ma never would let me try to do any thing and if i did i was sure to break all down under it but if you say so ill try to go into this school  oh no lillie i dont want you to go in i know darling you could not stand any fatigue i only wanted you to take an interestjust to go and see them for my sake  well john if you must go and must keep it up i must try to go ill go with you next sunday it will make my head ache perhaps but no matter if you wish it you dont think badly of me do you she said coaxingly playing with his whiskers  no darling not the least  i suppose it would be a great deal better for you if you had married a strong energetic woman like your sister i do admire her so but it discourages me  darling id a thousand times rather have you what you are said john for      what she wills to do   seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  o john come you ought to be sincere  sincere lillie i am sincere  you really would rather have poor poor little me than a woman like graciea great strong energetic woman and lillie laid her soft cheek down on his arm in pensive humility  yes a thousand million times said john in his enthusiasm catching her in his arms and kissing her i wouldnt for the world have you any thing but the darling little lillie you are i love your faults more than the virtues of other women you are a thousand times better than i am i am a great coarse blockhead compared to you i hope i didnt hurt your feelings this noon you know lillie im hasty and apt to be inconsiderate i dont really know that i ought to let you go over next sunday  o john you are so good certainly if you go i ought to and i shall try my best then john told her all about the books and the lawn tea and lillie listened approvingly  so they had a lawn tea at the fergusons that week where lillie was the cynosure of all eyes mr mathews the new young clergyman of springdale was there mr mathews had been credited as one of the admirers of rose ferguson but on this occasion he promenaded and talked with lillie and lillie alone with an exclusive devotion  what a lovely young creature your new sister is he said to grace she seems to have so much religious sensibility  i say lillie said john mathews seemed to be smitten with you i had a notion of interfering  did you ever see any thing like it john i couldnt shake the creature off i was so thankful when you came up and took me hes roses admirer and he hardly spoke a word to her i think its shameful  the next sunday lillie rode over to spindlewood with john and rose and mr mathews  never had the picturesque of religion received more lustre than from her presence john was delighted to see how they all gazed at her and wondered lillie looked like a firstrate french picture of the youthful madonnawhite pure and patient the day was hot and the hall crowded and john noticed what he never did before the close smell and confined air and it made him uneasy when we are feeling with the nerves of some one else we notice every roughness and inconvenience john thought he had never seen his school appear so little to advantage yet lillie was an image of patient endurance trying to be pleased and john thought her as she sat and did nothing more of a saint than rose and grace who were laboriously sorting books and gathering around them large classes of factory boys to whom they talked with an exhausting devotedness  when all was over lillie sat back on the carriagecushions and smelled at her gold vinaigrette  you are all worn out dear said john tenderly  its no matter she said faintly  o lillie darling does your head ache  a littleyou know it was close in there im very sensitive to such things i dont think they affect others as they do me said lillie with the voice of a dying zephyr  lillie it is not your duty to go said john if you are not made ill by this i never will take you again you are too precious to be risked  how can you say so john im a poor little creatureno use to anybody  hereupon john told her that her only use in life was to be lovely and to be lovedthat a thing of beauty was a joy forever c c but lillie was too much exhausted on her return to appear at the teatable she took to her bed at once with sick headache to the poignant remorse of john you see how it is gracie he said poor dear little thing she is willing enough but theres nothing of her we mustnt allow her to exert herself her feelings always carry her away  the next sunday john sat at home with lillie who found herself too unwell to go to church and was in a state of such low spirits as to require constant soothing to keep her quiet  it is fortunate that i have you and rose to trust the school with said john you see its my first duty to take care of lillie     chapter ix   a crisis  one of the shrewdest and most subtle modern french writers has given his views of womankind in the following passage  there are few women who have not found themselves at least once in their lives in regard to some incontestable fact faced down by precise keen searching inquiryone of those questions pitilessly put by their husbands the very idea of which gives a slight chill and the first word of which enters the heart like a stroke of a dagger hence comes the maxim every woman liesobliging liesvenial liessublime lieshorrible liesbut always the obligation of lying  this obligation once admitted must it not be a necessity to know how to lie well in france the women lie admirably our customs instruct them so well in imposture and woman is so naively impertinent so pretty so graceful so true in her lying they so well understand its usefulness in social life for avoiding those violent shocks which would destroy happinessit is like the cotton in which they pack their jewelry  lying is to them the very foundation of language and truth is only the exception they speak it as they are virtuous from caprice or for a purpose according to their character some women laugh when they lie and some cry some become grave and others get angry having begun life by pretending perfect insensibility to that homage which flatters them most they often finish by lying even to themselves who has not admired their apparent superiority and calm at the moment when they were trembling for the mysterious treasures of their love who has not studied their ease and facility their presence of mind in the midst of the most critical embarrassments of social life there is nothing awkward about it their deception flows as softly as the snow falls from heaven  yet there are men that have the presumption to expect to get the better of the parisian womanof the woman who possesses thirtyseven thousand ways of saying no and incommensurable variations in saying yes  this is a frenchmans view of life in a country where women are trained more systematically for the mere purposes of attraction than in any other country and where the pursuit of admiration and the excitement of winning lovers are represented by its authors as constituting the main staple of womans existence france unfortunately is becoming the great societyteacher of the world what with french theatres french operas french novels and the universal rush of american women for travel france is becoming so powerful on american fashionable society that the things said of the parisian woman begin in some cases to apply to some women in america  lillie was as precisely the woman here described as if she had been born and bred in paris she had all the thirtyseven thousand ways of saying no and the incommensurable variations in saying yes as completely as the best french teaching could have given it she possessed and had used all that graceful facility in the story of herself that she had told john in the days of courtship her power over him was based on a dangerous foundation of unreality hence during the first few weeks of her wedded life came a critical scene in which she was brought in collision with one of those pitiless questions our author speaks of  her weddingpresents manifold and brilliant had remained at home in the charge of her mother during the weddingjourney one bright day a few weeks after her arrival in springdale the boxes containing the treasures were landed there and john with all enthusiasm busied himself with the work of unpacking these boxes and drawing forth the treasures  now it so happened that lillies maternal grandfather a nice pious old gentleman had taken the occasion to make her the edifying and suggestive present of a large elegantly bound family bible  the binding was unexceptionable and lillie assigned it a proper place of honor among her weddinggear alas she had not looked into it nor seen what dangers to her power were lodged between its leaves  but john who was curious in the matter of books sat quietly down in a corner to examine it and on the middle page under the head family record he found in a large bold hand the date of the birth of lillie ellis in figures of the most uncompromising plainness and thence with one flash of his welltrained arithmetical sense came the perception that instead of being twenty years old she was in fact twentysevenand that of course she had lied to him  illustration he found the date of the birth of lillie ellis  it was a horrid and a hard word for an american young man to have suggested in relation to his wife if we may believe the french romancer a frenchman would simply have smiled in amusement on detecting this petty feminine ruse of his beloved but american men are in the habit of expecting the truth from respectable women as a matter of course and the want of it in the smallest degree strikes them as shocking only an englishman or an american can understand the dreadful pain of that discovery to john  the anglosaxon race have so to speak a worship of truth and they hate and abhor lying with an energy which leaves no power of tolerance  the celtic races have a certain sympathy with deception they have a certain appreciation of the value of lying as a fine art which has never been more skilfully shown than in the passage from de balzac we have quoted the woman who is described by him as lying so sweetly and skilfully is represented as one of those women qui ont je ne sais quoi de saint et de sacré qui inspirent tant de respect que lamoura woman who has an indescribable something of holiness and purity which inspires respect as well as love it was no detraction from the character of jesus according to the estimate of renan to represent him as consenting to a benevolent fraud and seeming to work miracles when he did not work them by way of increasing his good influence over the multitude  but john was the offspring of a generation of men for hundreds of years who would any of them have gone to the stake rather than have told the smallest untruth and for him who had been watched and guarded and catechised against this sin from his cradle till he was as true and pure as a crystal rock to have his faith shattered in the woman he loved was a terrible thing  as he read the fatal figures a mist swam before his eyesa sort of faintness came over him it seemed for a moment as if his very life was sinking down through his boots into the carpet he threw down the book hastily and turning stepped through an open window into the garden and walked quickly off  where in the world is john going said lillie running to the door and calling after him in imperative tones  john john come back i havent done with you yet but john never turned his head  how very odd what in the world is the matter with him she said to herself  john was gone all the afternoon he took a long long walk all by himself and thought the matter over he remembered that fresh childlike almost infantine face that looked up into his with such a bewitching air of frankness and candor as she professed to be telling all about herself and her history and now which or what of it was true it seemed as if he loathed her and yet he couldnt help loving her while he despised himself for doing it  when he came home to supper he was silent and morose lillie came running to meet him but he threw her off saying he was tired she was frightened she had never seen him look like that  john what is the matter with you said grace at the teatable you are upsetting every thing and dont drink your tea  nothingonlyi have some troublesome business to settle he said getting up to go out again you neednt wait for me i shall be out late  what can be the matter  lillie indeed had not the remotest idea yet she remembered his jumping up suddenly and throwing down the bible and mechanically she went to it and opened it she turned it over and the record met her eye  provoking she said stupid old creature must needs go and put that out in full lillie took a paperfolder and cut the leaf out quite neatly then folded and burned it  she knew now what was the matter john was angry at her but she couldnt help wondering that he should be so angry if he had laughed at her teased her taxed her with the trick she would have understood what to do but this terrible gloom this awful commotion of the elements frightened her  she went to her room saying that she had a headache and would go to bed but she did not she took her french novel and read till she heard him coming and then she threw down her book and began to cry he came into the room and saw her leaning like a little white snowwreath over the table sobbing as if her heart would break to do her justice lillies sobs were not affected she was lonesome and thoroughly frightened and when she heard him coming her nerves gave out johns heart yearned towards her his shortlived anger had burned out and he was perfectly longing for a reconciliation he felt as if he must have her to love no matter what she was he came up to her and stroked her hair o lillie he said why couldnt you have told me the truth what made you deceive me  i was afraid you wouldnt like me if i did said lillie in her sobs  o lillie i should have liked you no matter how old you wereonly you should have told me the truth  i know iti know itoh it was wrong of me and lillie sobbed and seemed in danger of falling into convulsions and johns heart gave out he gathered her in his arms i cant help loving you and i cant live without you he said be you what you may  lillies little heart beat with triumph under all her sobs she had got him and should hold him yet  there can be no confidence between husband and wife lillie said john gravely unless we are perfectly true with each other promise me dear that you will never deceive me again  lillie promised with ready fervor o john she said i never should have done so wrong if i had only come under your influence earlier the fact is i have been under the worst influences all my life i never had anybody like you to guide me  john may of course be excused for feeling that his flattering little penitent was more to him than ever and as to lillie she gave a sigh of relief that was over anyway and she had him not only safe but more completely hers than before  a generous man is entirely unnerved by a frank confession if lillie had said one word in defence if she had raised the slightest shadow of an argument john would have roused up all his moral principle to oppose her but this poor little white watersprite dissolving in a rain of penitent tears quite washed away all his anger and all his heroism  the next morning lillie all fresh in a ravishing toilet with fielddaisies in her hair was in a condition to laugh gently at john for his emotion of yesterday she triumphed softly not too obviously in her power he couldnt do without herdo what she mightthat was plain  now john she said dont you think we poor women are judged rather hardly men you know tell all sorts of lies to carry on their great politics and their ambition and nobody thinks it so dreadful of them  i doi should interposed john  oh well youyou are an exception it is not one man in a hundred that is so good as you are now we women have only one poor little ambitionto be pretty to please you men and as soon as you know we are getting old you dont like us and can you think its so very shocking if we dont come square up to the dreadful truth about our age youth and beauty is all there is to us you know  o lillie dont say so said john who felt the necessity of being instructive and of improving the occasion to elevate the moral tone of his little elf goodness lasts my dear when beauty fades  oh nonsense now john dont talk humbug id like to see you following goodness when beauty is gone ive known lots of plain old maids that were perfect saints and angels and yet men crowded and jostled by them to get the pretty sinners i dare say now she added with a bewitching look over her shoulder at him youd rather have me than miss almira carrawayhadnt you now  and lillie put her white arm round his neck and her downy cheek to his and said archly come now confess  then john told her that she was a bad naughty girl and she laughed and on the whole the pair were more hilarious and loving than usual  but yet when john was away at his office he thought of it again and found there was still a sore spot in his heart  she had cheated him once would she cheat him again and she could cheat so prettily so serenely and with such a candid face it was a dangerous talent  no she wasnt like his mother he thought with a sigh the je ne sais quoi de saint et de sacré which had so captivated his imagination did not cover the saintly and sacred nature it was a mere outward purity of complexion and outline and then graceshe must not be left to find out what he knew about lillie he had told grace that she was only twentytold it on her authority and now must he become an accomplice if called on to speak of his wifes age must he accommodate the truth to her story or must he palter and evade here was another brick laid on the wall of separation between his sister and himself it was rising daily here was another subject on which he could never speak frankly with grace for he must defend lillieevery impulse of his heart rushed to protect her  but it is a terrible truth and one that it will not hurt any of us to bear in mind that our judgments of our friends are involuntary  we may long with all our hearts to confide we may be fascinated entangled and wish to be blinded but blind we cannot be the friend that has lied to us once we may long to believe but we cannot nay more it is the worse for us if in our desire to hold the dear deceiver in our hearts we begin to chip and hammer on the great foundations of right and honor and to say within ourselves after all why be so particular then when we have searched about for all the reasons and apologies and extenuations for wrongdoing are we sure that in our human weakness we shall not be pulling down the moral barriers in ourselves the habit of excusing evil and finding apologies and wishing to stand with one who stands on a lower moral plane is not a wholesome one for the soul  as fate would have it the very next day after this little scene who should walk into the parlor where lillie john and grace were sitting but that terror of american democracy the censustaker armed with the whole power of the republic this official steps with elegant ease into the most sacred privacies of the family flutterings and denials are in vain bridget and katy and anne no less than seraphina and isabella must give up the critical secrets of their lives  john took the paper into the kitchen honest old bridget gave in her age with effrontery as twintyfive anne giggled and flounced and declared on her word she didnt knowthey could put it down as they liked but anne you must tell or you may be sent to jail you know  anne giggled still harder and tossed her head then its to jail ill have to go for i dont know  dear me said lillie with an air of edifying candor what a fuss they make set down my age twentyseven john she added  grace started and looked at john he met her eye and blushed to the roots of his hair  why whats the matter said lillie are you embarrassed at telling your age  oh nothing said john writing down the numbers hastily and then finding a sudden occasion to give directions in the garden he darted out its so silly to be ashamed of our age said lillie as the censustaker withdrew  of course said grace and she had the humanity never to allude to the subject with her brother     chapter x   changes  scenea chamber at the seymour house little discovered weeping john rushing in with empressement  lillie you shall tell me what ails you  nothing ails me john  yes there does you were crying when i came in  oh well thats nothing  oh but it is a great deal what is the matter i can see that you are not happy  oh pshaw john i am as happy as i ought to be i dare say there isnt much the matter with me only a little blue and i dont feel quite strong  you dont feel strong ive noticed it lillie  well you see john the fact is that i never have got through this month without going to the seaside mamma always took me the doctors told her that my constitution was such that i couldnt get along without it but i dare say i shall do well enough in time you know  but lillie said john if you do need seaair you must go i cant leave my business thats the trouble  oh no john dont think of it i ought to make an effort to get along you see its very foolish in me but places affect my spirits so its perfectly absurd how i am affected  well lillie i hope this place doesnt affect you unpleasantly said john  its a nice darling place john and its very silly in me but it is a fact that this house somehow has a depressing effect on my spirits you know its not like the houses ive been used to it has a sort of old look and i cant help feeling that it puts me in mind of those who are dead and gone and then i think i shall be dead and gone too some day and it makes me cry so isnt it silly of me john  poor little pussy said john  you see john our rooms are lovely but they arent modern and cheerful like those ive been accustomed to they make me feel pensive and sad all the time but im trying to get over it  why lillie said john would you like the rooms refurnished it can easily be done if you wish it  oh no no dear you are too good and im sure the rooms are lovely and it would hurt gracies feelings to change them no i must try and get over it i know just how silly it is and i shall try to overcome it if i had only more strength i believe i could  well darling you must go to the seaside i shall have you sent right off to newport gracie can go with you  oh no john not for the world gracie must stay and keep house for you shes such a help to you that it would be a shame to take her away but i think mamma would go with meif you could take me there and engage my rooms and all that why mamma could stay with me you know to be sure it would be a trial not to have you there but then if i could get up my strength you know  exactly certainly and lillie how would you like the parlors arranged if you had your own way  oh john dont think of it  but i just want to know for curiosity now how would you have them if you could  well then john dont you think it would be lovely to have them frescoed did you ever see the folingsbees rooms in new york they were so lovelyone was all in blue and the other in crimson opening into each other with carved furniture and those marquetrie tables and all sorts of little french things they had such a gay and cheerful look  now lillie if you want our rooms like that you shall have them  o john you are too good i couldnt ask such a sacrifice  oh pshaw it isnt a sacrifice i dont doubt i shall like them better myself your taste is perfect lillie and now i think of it i wonder that i thought of bringing you here without consulting you in every particular a woman ought to be queen in her own house i am sure  but gracie now john i know she has associations with all the things in this house and it would be cruel to her said lillie with a sigh  pshaw gracie is a good sensible girl and ready to make any rational change i suppose we have been living rather behind the times and are somewhat rusty thats a fact but gracie will enjoy new things as much as anybody i dare say  well john since you are set on it theres charlie ferrola one of my particular friends hes an architect and does all about arranging rooms and houses and furniture he did the folingsbees and the hortons and the jeromes and no end of real nobby peoples houses and made them perfectly lovely people say that one wouldnt know that they werent in paris in houses that he does  now our john was by nature a good solid chip of the old anglosaxon block and if there was any thing that he had no special affinity for it was for french things he had small opinion of french morals and french ways in general but then at this moment he saw his lillie whom but half an hour before he found all pale and teardrenched now radiant and joyous sleek as a hummingbird with the light in her eyes and the rattle on the tip of her tongue and he felt so delighted to see her bright and gay and joyous that he would have turned his house into the jardin mabille if that were possible  lillie had the prettiest little caressing tricks and graces imaginable and she perched herself on his knee and laughed and chatted so gayly and pulled his whiskers so saucily and then springing up began arraying herself in such an astonishing daintiness of device and fluttering before him with such a variety of wellassorted plumage that john was quite taken off his feet he did not care so much whether what she willed to do were wisest virtuousest discreetest best as feel that what she wished to do must be done at any rate  illustration she perched herself on his knee  why darling he said in his rapture why didnt you tell me all this before here you have been growing sad and blue and losing your vivacity and spirits and never told me why  i thought it was my duty john to try to bear it said lillie with the sweet look of a virgin saint i thought perhaps i should get used to things in time and i think it is a wifes duty to accommodate herself to her husbands circumstances  no its a husbands duty to accommodate himself to his wifes wishes said john whats that fellows address ill write to him about doing our house forthwith  but john do pray tell gracie that its your wish i dont want her to think that its i that am doing this now pray do think whether you really want it yourself you see it must be so natural for you to like the old things they must have associations and i wouldnt for the world now be the one to change them and after all how silly it was of me to feel blue  dont say any more lillie let me seenext week he said taking out his pocketbook and looking over his memorandanext week ill take you down to newport and you write today to your mother to meet you there and be your guest ill write and engage the rooms at once  i dont know what i shall do without you john  oh well i couldnt stay possibly but i may run down now and then for a night you know  well we must make that do said lillie with a pensive sigh  thus two very important moves on miss lillies checkerboard of life were skilfully made the house was to be refitted and the newport precedent established  now dear friends dont think lillie a pirate or a conspirator or a wolfinsheepsclothing or any thing else but what she wasa pretty little selfish woman undeveloped in her conscience and affections and strong in her instincts and perceptions in a blind way using what means were most in her line to carry her purposes lillie had always found her prettiness her littleness her helplessness and her tears so very useful in carrying her points in life that she resorted to them as her lawful stock in trade neither were her blues entirely shamming there comes a time after marriage when a husband if he be any thing of a man has something else to do than make direct love to his wife he cannot be on duty at all hours to fan her and shawl her and admire her his love must express itself through other channels he must be a full man for her sake and as a man must go forth to a whole world of interests that takes him from her now what in this case shall a woman do whose only life lies in petting and adoration and display  springdale had no beau monde no fashionable circle no bois de boulogne and no beaux to make amends for a husbands engrossments grace was sisterly and kind but what on earth had they in common to talk about lillies wardrobe was in all the freshness of bridal exuberance and there was nothing more to be got and so for the moment no stimulus in this line but then where to wear all these fine french dresses lillie had been called on and invited once to little social evening parties through the whole round of old respectable families that lived under the elmarches of springdale and she had found it rather stupid there was not a man to make an admirer of except the young minister who after the first afternoon of seeing her returned to his devotion to rose ferguson  you know ladies aesop has a pretty little fable as follows a young man fell desperately in love with a cat and prayed to jupiter to change her to a woman for his sake jupiter was so obliging as to grant his prayer and behold a soft satinskinned purring graceful woman was given into his arms  but the legend goes on to say that while he was delighting in her charms she heard the sound of mice behind the wainscot and left him forthwith to rush after her congenial prey  lillie had heard afar the sound of mice at newport and she longed to be after them once more had she not a prestige now as a rich young married lady had she not jewels and gems to show had she not any number of mousetraps in the way of ravishing toilets she thought it all over till she was sick with longing and was sure that nothing but the seaair could do her any good and so she fell to crying and kissing her faithful john till she gained her end like a veritable little cat as she was     chapter xi   newport or the paradise of nothing to do  behold now our lillie at the height of her hearts desire installed in fashionable apartments at newport under the placid chaperonship of dear mamma who never saw the least harm in any earthly thing her lillie chose to do  all the dash and flash and furbelow of uppertendom were there and lillie now felt the full power and glory of being a rich pretty young married woman with oceans of money to spend and nothing on earth to do but follow the fancies of the passing hour  this was lillies highest ideal of happiness and didnt she enjoy it  wasnt it something to flame forth in wondrous toilets in the eyes of belle trevors and margy silloway and lottie cavers who were not married and before the simpkinses and the tomkinses and the jenkinses who last year had said hateful things about her and intimated that she had gone off in her looks and was on the way to be an old maid  and wasnt it a triumph when all her old beaux came flocking round her and her parlors became a daily resort and loungingplace for all the idle swains both of her former acquaintance and of the newcomers who drifted with the tide of fashion never had she been so much the rage never had she been declared so stunning the effect of all this good fortune on her health was immediate we all know how the spirits affect the bodily welfare and hence my dear gentlemen we desire it to be solemnly impressed on you that there is nothing so good for a womans health as to give her her own way  lillie now from this simple cause received enormous accessions of vigor while at home with plain sober john trying to walk in the quiet paths of domesticity how did her spirits droop if you only could have had a vision of her brain and spinal system you would have seen how there was no nervous fluid there and how all the fine little cords and fibres that string the muscles were wilting like flowers out of water but now she could bathe the longest and the strongest of any one could ride on the beach half the day and dance the german into the small hours of the night with a degree of vigor which showed conclusively what a fine thing for her the newport air was her dancinglist was always overcrowded with applicants bouquets were showered on her and the most superb turnouts with their masters for charioteers were at her daily disposal  all this made talk the world doesnt forgive success and the ancients informed us that even the gods were envious of happy people it is astonishing to see the quantity of very proper and rational moral reflection that is excited in the breast of society by any sort of success in life how it shows them the vanity of earthly enjoyments the impropriety of setting ones heart on it how does a successful married flirt impress all her friends with the gross impropriety of having ones head set on gentlemens attentions  i must say said belle trevors that dear lillie does astonish me now i shouldnt want to have that dissipated danforth lounging in my rooms every day as he does in lillies and then taking her out driving day after day for my part i dont think its respectable  why dont you speak to her said lottie cavers  oh my dear she wouldnt mind me lillie always was the most imprudent creature and if she goes on so shell certainly get awfully talked about that danforth is a horrid creature i know all about him  as miss belle had herself been driving with the horrid creature only the week before lillie came it must be confessed that her opportunities for observation were of an authentic kind  lillie as queen in her own parlor was all grace and indulgence hers was now to be the sisterly rôle or as she laughingly styled it the maternal with a ravishing morningdress and with a killing little cap of about three inches in extent on her head she enacted the young matron and gave full permission to tom dick and harry to make themselves at home in her room and smoke their cigars there in peace she adored the smell in fact she accepted the present of a fancy box of cigarettes from danforth with graciousness and would sometimes smoke one purely for good company she also encouraged her followers to unveil the tender secrets of their souls confidentially to her and offered gracious mediations on their behalf with any of the flitting newport fair ones when they as in duty bound said that they saw nobody whom they cared about now she was married that she was the only woman on earth for themshe rapped their knuckles briskly with her fan and bid them mind their manners all this mode of proceeding gave her an immense success  illustration and would sometimes smoke one purely for good company  but as we said before all this was talked about and ladies in their letters chronicling the events of the passing hour sent the tidings up and down the country and so miss letitia ferguson got a letter from mrs wilcox with full pictures and comments and she brought the same to grace seymour  i dare say said letitia these things have been exaggerated they always are still it does seem desirable that your brother should go there and be with her  he cant go and be with her said grace without neglecting his business already too much neglected then the house is all in confusion under the hands of painters and there is that young artist up therevery elegant gentlemangiving orders to right and left every one of which involves further confusion and deeper expense for my part i see no end to it poor john has got the old man of the sea on his back in the shape of this woman and i expect shell be the ruin of him yet i cant want to break up his illusion about her because what good will it do he has married her and must live with her and for heavens sake let the illusion last while it can im going to draw off and leave them to each other theres no other way  you are gracie  yes you see john came to me all stammering and embarrassment about this making over of the old place but i put him at ease at once the most natural thing in the world john said i of course lillie has her taste and its her right to have the house arranged to suit it and then i proposed to take all the old family things and furnish the house that i own on elm street and live there and let john and lillie keep house by themselves you see there is no helping the thing married people must be left to themselves nobody can help them they must make their own discoveries fight their own battles sink or swim together and i have determined that not by the winking of an eye will i interfere between them  well but do you think john wants you to go  he feels badly about it and yet i have convinced him that its best poor fellow all these changes are not a bit to his taste he liked the old place as it was and the old ways but john is so unselfish he has got it in his head that lillie is very sensitive and peculiar and that her spirits require all these changes as well as newport air  well said letitia if a man begins to say a in that line he must say b  of course said grace and also c and d and so on down to x y z a woman armed with sickheadaches nervousness debility presentiments fears horrors and all sorts of imaginary and real diseases has an eternal armory of weapons of subjugation what can a man do can he tell her that she is lying and shamming half the time she isnt she can actually work herself into about any physical state she chooses the fortnight before lillie went to newport she really looked pale and ate next to nothing and she managed admirably to seem to be trying to keep up and not to complainyet you see how she can go on at newport  it seems a pity john couldnt understand her  my dear i wouldnt have him for the world whenever he does he will despise her and then he will be wretched for john is no hypocrite any more than i am no i earnestly pray that his soapbubble may not break  well then said letitia at least he might go down to newport for a day or two and his presence there might set some things right it might at least check reports you might just suggest to him that unfriendly things were being said  well ill see what i can do said grace  so by a little feminine tact in suggestion grace despatched her brother to spend a day or two in newport  his coming and presence interrupted the lounging hours in lillies room the introduction to my husband shortened the interviews john was courteous and affable but he neither smoked nor drank and there was a mutual repulsion between him and many of lillies habitués  i say dan said bill sanders to danforth as they were smoking on one end of the veranda you are driven out of your lodgings since seymour came  no more than the rest of you said danforth  i dont know about that dan i think you might have been taken for master of those premises look here now dan why didnt you take little lill yourself everybody thought you were going to last year  didnt want her knew too much said danforth didnt want to keep her shes too cursedly extravagant its jolly to have this sort of concern on hand but id rather seymourd pay her bills than i  who thought you were so practical dan  practical that i am im an old bird take my advice boys now keep shy of the girls and flirt with the married onesthen you dont get roped in  i say boys said tom nichols isnt she a case now what a head she has i bet she can smoke equal to any of us  yes i keep her in cigarettes said danforth shes got a box of them somewhere under her ruffles now  what if seymour should find them said tom  seymour pooh hes a muff and a prig i bet you he wont find her out shes the jolliest little humbugger there is going shed cheat a fellow out of the sight of his eyes its perfectly wonderful  how came seymour to marry her  he why hes a pious youth green as grass itself and i suppose she talked religion to him did you ever hear her talk religion  a roar of laughter followed this out of which danforth went on by george boys she gave me a prayerbook once ive got it yet  well if that isnt the best thing i ever heard said nichols  it was at the time she was laying siege to me you see she undertook the part of guardian angel and used to talk lots of sentiment the girls get lots of that out of george sands novels about the holiness of doing just as youve a mind to and all that said danforth  by george dan you oughtnt to laugh she may have more good in her than you think  oh humbug dont i know her  well at any rate shes a wonderful creature to hold her looks by george how she does hold out youd say now she wasnt more than twenty  yes she understands getting herself up said danforth and touches up her cheeks a bit now and then  she dont paint though  dont paint dont she id like to know if she dont but she does it like an artist like an old master in fact  or like a young mistress said tom and then laughed at his own wit  now it so happened that john was sitting at an open window above and heard occasional snatches of this conversation quite sufficient to impress him disagreeably he had not heard enough to know exactly what had been said but enough to feel that a set of coarse lowminded men were making quite free with the name and reputation of his lillie and he was indignant  she is so pretty so frank and so impulsive he said such women are always misconstrued im resolved to caution her  lillie he said who is this danforth  charlie danforthoh hes a millionnaire that i refused he was wild about meis now for that matter he perfectly haunts my rooms and is always teasing me to ride with him  well lillie if i were you i wouldnt have any thing to do with him  john i dont mean to any more than i can help i try to keep him off all i can but one doesnt want to be rude you know  my darling said john you little know the wickedness of the world and the cruel things that men will allow themselves to say of women who are meaning no harm you cant be too careful lillie  oh i am careful mamma is here you know all the while and i never receive except she is present  john sat abstractedly fingering the various objects on the table then he opened a drawer in the same mechanical manner  why lillie whats this what in the world are these  o john sure enough well there is something i was going to ask you about danforth used always to be sending me things you know before we were marriedflowers and confectionery and one thing or other and since i have been here now he has done the same and i really didnt know what to do about it you know i didnt want to quarrel with him or get his illwill hes a highspirited fellow and a man one doesnt want for an enemy so i have just passed it over easy as i could  but lillie a box of cigarettesof course they can be of no use to you  of course they are only a sort of curiosity that he imports from spain with his cigars  ive a great mind to send them back to him myself said john  oh dont john why how it would look as if you were angry or thought he meant something wrong no ill contrive a way to give em back without offending him i am up to all such little ways  come now she added dont lets be cross just the little time you have to stay with me i do wish our house were not all torn up so that i could go home with you and leave newport and all its bothers behind  well lillie you could go and stay with me at gracies said john brightening at this proposition  dear gracieso she has got a house all to herself how i shall miss her but really john i think she will be happier since you would insist on revolutionizing our house you know  but lillie it was to please you  oh i know it but you know i begged you not to well john i dont think i should like to go in and settle down on grace perhaps as i am here and the seaair and bathing strengthens me so we may as well put it through i will come home as soon as the house is done  but perhaps you would want to go with me to new york to select the furniture  oh the artist does all that charlie ferrola will give his orders to simon  sauls and they will do every thing up complete its the way they all dosaves lots of trouble  john went home after three days spent in newport feeling that lillie was somehow an injured fair one and that the envious world bore down always on beauty and prosperity  but incidentally he heard and overheard much that made him uneasy he heard her admired as a bully girl a fast one he heard of her smoking he overheard something about painting  the time was that john thought lillie an embryo angelan angel a little bewildered and gone astray and with wings a trifle the worse for the worlds wearbut essentially an angel of the same nature with his own revered mother  gradually the mercury had been falling in the tube of his estimation he had given up the angel and now to himself he called her a silly little pussy but he did it with a smile it was such a neat white graceful pussy and all his own pussy too and purred and rubbed its little head on no coatsleeve but hisof that he was certain only a bit silly she would still fib a little john feared especially when he looked back to the chapter about her ageand then perhaps about the cigarettes  well she might perhaps in a wild excited hour have smoked one or two just for fun and the thing had been exaggerated she had promised fairly to return those cigaretteshe dared not say to himself that he feared she would not he kept saying to himself that she would it was necessary to say this often to make himself believe it  as to paintingwell john didnt like to ask her because what if she shouldnt tell him the truth and if she did paint was it so great a sin poor little thing he would watch and bring her out of it after all when the house was all finished and arranged and he got her back from newport there would be a long quiet domestic winter at springdale and they would get up their readingcircles and he would set her to improving her mind and gradually the vision of this empty fashionable life would die out of her horizon and she would come into his ways of thinking and doing  but after all john managed to be proud of her when he read in the columns of the herald the account of the splandangerous ball in newport and of the entrancingly beautiful mrs js who appeared in a radiant dress of silvery gauze made à la nuage c c john was rather pleased than otherwise lillie danced till daylightit showed that she must be getting back her strengthand she was voted the belle of the scene who wouldnt take the comfort that is to be got in any thing john owned this fashionable meteorwhy shouldnt he rejoice in it  two years ago had anybody told him that one day he should have a wife that told fibs and painted and smoked cigarettes and danced all night at newport and yet that he should love her and be proud of her he would have said is thy servant a dog he was then a considerate thoughtful john serious and careful in his lifeplans and the wife that was to be his companion was something celestial but so it is by degrees we accommodate ourselves to the actual and existing to all intents and purposes for us it is the inevitable     chapter xii   home À la pompadour  well lillie came back at last and john conducted her over the transformed seymour mansion where literally old things had passed away and all things become new  there was not a relic of the past the house was furbished and resplendentit was gildedit was frescoedit was à la pompadour and à la louis quinze and louis quatorze and à la every thing frenchy and pretty and gay and glistening for though the parlors at first were the only apartments contemplated in this renaissance yet it came to pass that the parlors when all tricked out cast such invidious reflections on the chambers that the chambers felt themselves old and rubbishy and prayed and stretched out hands of imploration to have something done for them  so the spare chamber was first included in the glorification programme but when the spare chamber was once made into a pompadour pavilion it so flouted and despised the other oldfashioned yankee chambers that they were ready to die with envy and in short there was no way to produce a sense of artistic unity peace and quietness but to do the whole thing over which was done triumphantly  the french emperor louis napoleon who was a shrewd sort of a man in his day and way used to talk a great deal about the logic of events which language being interpreted my dear gentlemen means a good deal in domestic life it means for instance that when you drive the first nail or tear down the first board in the way of alteration of an old house you will have to make over every room and corner in it and pay as much again for it as if you built a new one  john was able to sympathize with lillie in her childish delight in the new house because he loved her and was able to put himself and his own wishes out of the question for her sake but when all the bills connected with this change came in he had emotions with which lillie could not sympathize first because she knew nothing about figures and was resolved never to know any thing and like all people who know nothing about them she cared nothingand second because she did not love john  now the truth is lillie would have been quite astonished to have been told this she and many other women suppose that they love their husbands when unfortunately they have not the beginning of an idea what love is let me explain it to you my dear lady loving to be admired by a man loving to be petted by him loving to be caressed by him and loving to be praised by him is not loving a man all these may be when a woman has no power of loving at allthey may all be simply because she loves herself and loves to be flattered praised caressed coaxed as a cat likes to be coaxed and stroked and fed with cream and have a warm corner  but all this is not love it may exist to be sure where there is love it generally does but it may also exist where there is no love love my dear ladies is selfsacrifice it is a life out of self and in another its very essence is the preferring of the comfort the ease the wishes of another to ones own for the love we bear them love is giving and not receiving love is not a sheet of blottingpaper or a sponge sucking in every thing to itself it is an outspringing fountain giving from itself loves motto has been dropped in this world as a chance gem of great price by the loveliest the fairest the purest the strongest of lovers that ever trod this mortal earth of whom it is recorded that he said it is more blessed to give than to receive now in love there are ten receivers to one giver there are ten persons in this world who like to be loved and love love where there is one who knows how to love that o my dear ladies is a nobler attainment than all your french and music and dancing you may lose the very power of it by smothering it under a load of early selfindulgence by living just as you are all wanting to liveliving to be petted to be flattered to be admired to be praised to have your own way and to do only that which is easy and agreeableyou may lose the power of selfdenial and selfsacrifice you may lose the power of loving nobly and worthily and become a mere sheet of blottingpaper all your life  you will please to observe that in all the married life of these two as thus far told all the accommodations compliances changes have been made by john for lillie  he has been step by step giving up to her his ideal of life and trying as far as so different a nature can to accommodate his to hers and she accepts all this as her right and due  she sees no particular cause of gratitude in itit is what she expected when she married her own specialty the thing which she has always cultivated is to get that sort of power over man by which she can carry her own points and purposes and make him flexible to her will nor does a suspicion of the utter worthlessness and selfishness of such a life ever darken the horizon of her thoughts  johns bills were graver than he expected it is true he was rich but riches is a relative term as related to the style of living hitherto practised in his establishment johns income was princely and left a large balance to be devoted to works of general benevolence but he perceived that in this year that balance would be all absorbed and this troubled him  then again his establishment being now given up by his sister must be reorganized with lillie at its head and lillie declared in the outset that she could not and would not take any trouble about any thing  john would have to get servants and the servants would have to see to things she was resolved for one thing that she wasnt going to be a slave to housekeeping  by great pains and importunity and an offer of high wages grace and john retained bridget in the establishment and secured from new york a seamstress and a waitress and other members to make out a domestic staff  this sisterhood were from the isle of erin and not an unfavorable specimen of that important portion of our domestic life they were quickwitted wellversed in a certain degree of household and domestic skill guided in welldoing more by impulsive good feeling than by any very enlightened principle the dominant idea with them all appeared to be that they were living in the house of a millionnaire where money flowed through the establishment in a golden stream out of which all might drink freely and rejoicingly with no questions asked mrs lillie concerned herself only with results and paid no attention to ways and means she wanted a dainty and generous table to be spread for her at all proper hours with every pleasing and agreeable variety to which she should come as she would to the table of a boardinghouse without troubling her head where any thing came from or went to bridget having been for some years under the training and surveillance of grace seymour was more than usually competent as cook and provider but bridget had abundance of the irish astuteness which led her to feel the genius of circumstances and to shape her course accordingly  with grace she had been accurate saving and economical for miss grace was so bridget had felt under her sway the beauty of that economy which saves because saving is in itself so fitting and so respectable and because in this way a power for a wise generosity is accumulated she was sympathetic with the ruling spirit of the establishment  but under the new mistress bridget declined in virtue the announcement that the mistress of a family isnt going to give herself any trouble nor bother her head with care about any thing is one the influence of which is felt downward in every department why should bridget give herself any trouble to save and economize for a mistress who took none for herself she had worked hard all her life why not take it easy and it was so much easier to send daily a basket of cold victuals to her cousin on vine street than to contrive ways of making the most of things that bridget felt perfectly justified in doing it if once in a while a little tea and a paper of sugar found their way into the same basket who would ever miss it  the seamstress was an elegant lady she kept all lillies dresses and laces and wardrobe and had something ready for her to put on when she changed her toilet every day if this very fine lady wore her mistresss skirts and sashes and laces and jewelry on the sly to evening parties among the upper servant circles of springdale who was to know it mrs john seymour knew nothing about where her things were nor what was their condition and never wanted to trouble herself to inquire  it may therefore be inferred that when john began to settle up accounts and look into financial matters they seemed to him not to be going exactly in the most promising way  he thought he would give lillie a little practical insight into his businessshow her exactly what his income was and make some estimates of his expenses just that she might have some little idea how things were going  so john with great care prepared a nice little accountbook prefaced by a table of figures showing the income of the spindlewood property and the income of his law business and his income from other sources against this he placed the necessary outgoes of his business and showed what balance might be left then he showed what had hitherto been spent for various benevolent purposes connected with the schools and his establishments at spindlewood he showed what had been the bills for the refitting of the house and what were now the running current expenses of the family  he hoped that he had made all these so plain and simple that lillie might easily be made to understand them and that thus some clear financial boundaries might appear in her mind then he seized a favorable hour and produced his book  lillie he said i want to make you understand a little about our expenditures and income  oh dreadful john dont pray i never had any head for things of that kind  but lillie please let me show you persisted john ive made it just as simple as can be  illustration i never had the least head for figures  o john nowi justcantthere now dont bring that book now itll just make me lowspirited and cross i never had the least head for figures mamma always said so and if there is any thing that seems to me perfectly dreadful it is accounts i dont think its any of a womans businessits all mans work and men have got to see to it now please dont she added coming to him coaxingly and putting her arm round his neck  but you see lillie john persevered in a pleading toneyou see all these alterations that have been made in the house have involved very serious expenses and then too we are living at a very different rate of expense from what we ever lived before  there it is john now you oughtnt to reproach me with it for you know it was your own idea i didnt want the alterations made but you would insist on it i didnt think it was best but you would have them  but lillie it was all because you wanted them  well i dare say but i shouldnt have wanted them if i thought it was going to bring in all this bother and trouble and make me have to look over old accounts and all such things id rather never have had any thing and here lillie began to cry  come now my darling do be a sensible woman and not act like a baby  there john its just as i knew it would be i always said you wanted a different sort of a woman for a wife now you knew when you took me that i wasnt in the least strongminded or sensible but a poor little helpless thing and you are beginning to get tired of me already you wish you had married a woman like grace i know you do  lillie how silly please do listen now you have no idea how simple and easy what i want to explain to you is  well john i cant tonight anyhow because i have a headache just this talk has got my head to thumping soits really dreadful and im so lowspirited i do wish you had a wife that would suit you better and forthwith mrs lillie dissolved in tears and john stroked her head and petted her and called her a nice little pussy and begged her pardon for being so rough with her and in short acted like a fool generally  if that woman was my wife now i fancy i hear some youth with a promising moustache remark id make her behave  well sir supposing she was your wife what are you going to do about it  what are you going to do when accounts give your wife a sick headache so that she cannot possibly attend to them are you going to enact the blue beard and rage and storm and threaten to cut her head off what good would that do cutting off a wrong little head would not turn it into a right one an ancient proverb significantly remarks you cant have more of a cat than her skinand no amount of fuming and storming can make any thing more of a woman than she is such as your wife is sir you must take her and make the best of it perhaps you want your own way dont you wish you could get it  but didnt she promise to obey didnt she of course then why is it that i must be all the while yielding points and she never well sir that is for you to settle the marriage service gives you authority so does the law of the land john could lock up mrs lillie till she learned her lessons he could do any of twenty other things that no gentleman would ever think of doing and the law would support him in it but because john is a gentleman and not paddy from cork he strokes his wifes head and submits  we understand that our brethren the methodists have recently decided to leave the word obey out of the marriageservice our friends are as all the world knows a most wise and prudent denomination and guided by a very practical sense in their arrangements if they have left the word obey out it is because they have concluded that it does no good to put it ina decision that johns experience would go a long way to justify     chapter xiii   johns birthday  my dear lillie quoth john one morning next week wednesday is my birthday  is it how charming what shall we do  well lillie it has always been our customgraces and mineto give a grand fête here to all our workpeople we invite them all over en masse and have the house and grounds all open and devote ourselves to giving them a good time  lillies countenance fell  now really john how trying what shall we do you dont really propose to bring all those low dirty little factory children in spindlewood through our elegant new house just look at that satin furniture and think what it will be when a whole parcel of freckled towheaded snubbynosed children have eaten bread and butter and doughnuts over it now john there is reason in all things this house is not made for a missionary asylum  john thus admonished looked at his house and was fain to admit that there was the usual amount of that good selfish hard gritcalled common sensein lillies remarks  rooms have their atmosphere their necessities their artistic proprieties apartments à la louis quatorze represent the ideas and the sympathies of a period when the rich lived by themselves in luxury and the poor were trodden down in the gutter when there was only aristocratic contempt and domination on one side and servility and smothered curses on the other with the change of the apartments to the style of that past era seemed to come its maxims and morals as artistically indicated for its completeness so john walked up and down in his louis quinze salon and into his pompadour boudoir and out again into the louis quatorze diningrooms and reflected he had had many reflections in those apartments before of all illadapted and unsuitable pieces of furniture in them he had always felt himself the most unsuitable and illadapted he had never felt at home in them he never felt like lolling at ease on any of those elegant sofas as of old he used to cast himself into the motherly arms of the great chintz one that filled the recess his lillie with her smart paraphernalia of hoops and puffs and ruffles and pinkings and bows seemed a perfectly natural and indigenous production there but he himself seemed always to be out of place his lillie might have been any of balzacs charming duchesses with their thirtyseven thousand ways of saying yes but as to himself he must have been taken for her steward or gardener who had accidentally strayed in and was fraying her satin surroundings with rough coats and heavy boots there was not in fact in all the reorganized house a place where he felt himself to be at all the proper thing nowhere where he could lounge and read his newspaper without a feeling of impropriety nowhere that he could indulge in any of the slight hottentotisms wherein unrenewed male nature delightswithout a feeling of rebuke  john had not philosophized on the causes of this he knew in a general and unconfessed way that he was not comfortable in his new arrangements but he supposed it was his own fault he had fallen into rusty oldfashioned bachelor ways and like other things that are not agreeable to the natural man he supposed his trim resplendent genteel house was good for him and that he ought to like it and by grace should attain to liking it if he only tried long enough  only he took long rests every day while he went to graces on elm street and stretched himself on the old sofa and sat in his mothers old armchair and told grace how very elegant their house was and how much taste the architect had shown and how much lillie was delighted with it  but this silent walk of johns up and down his brilliant apartments opened his eyes to another troublesome prospect he was a christian man with a high aim and ideal in life he believed in the sermon on the mount and other radical preaching of that nature and he was a very honest man and hated humbug in every shape nothing seemed meaner to him than to profess a sham but it began in a cloudy way to appear to him that there is a manner of arranging ones houses that makes it difficultyes wellnigh impossibleto act out in them any of the brotherhood principles of those discourses  there are houses where the selfrespecting poor or the honest laboring man and woman cannot be made to enter or to feel at home they are made for the selfish luxury of the privileged few then john reflected uneasily that this change in his house had absorbed that whole balance which usually remained on his accounts to be devoted to benevolent purposes and with which this year he had proposed to erect a readingroom for his workpeople  lillie said john as he walked uneasily up and down i wish you would try to help me in this thing i always have done itmy father and mother did it before meand i dont want all of a sudden to depart from it it may seem a little thing but it does a great deal of good it produces kind feeling it refines and educates and softens them  oh well john if you say so i must i suppose said lillie with a sigh i can have the carpets and furniture all covered i suppose itll be no end of trouble but ill try but i must say i think all this kind of petting of the workingclasses does no sort of good it only makes them uppish and exacting you never get any gratitude for it  but you know dearie what is said about doing good hoping for nothing again said john  now john please dont preach of all things havent i told you that ill try my best i am going toill work with all my strengthyou know that isnt muchbut i shall exert myself to the utmost if you say so  my dear i dont want you to injure yourself  oh i dont mind said lillie with the air of a martyr the servants i suppose will make a fuss about it and i shouldnt wonder if it was the means of sending them every one off in a body and leaving me without any help in the house just as the follingsbees and the simpkinses are coming to visit us  i didnt know that you had invited the follingsbees and simpkinses said john  didnt i tell you i meant to said mrs lillie innocently  i dont like those follingsbees lillie he is a man i have no respect for he is one of those shoddy upstarts not at all our sort of folks im sorry you asked him  but his wife is my particular friend said lillie and they were very polite to mamma and me at newport and we really owe them some attention  well lillie since you have asked them i will be polite to them and i will try and do every thing to save you care in this entertainment ill speak to bridget myself she knows our ways and has been used to managing  and so as john was greatly beloved by bridget and as all the domestic staff had the true irish fealty to the man of the house and would run themselves off their feet in his service any dayit came to pass that the fête was holden as of yore in the grounds grace was there and helped and so were letitia and rose ferguson and all passed off better than could be expected but john did not enjoy it he felt all the while that he was dragging lillie as a thousandpound weight after him and he inly resolved that once out of that days festival he would never try to have it again  lillie went to bed with sick headache and lay two days after it during which she cried and lamented incessantly she knew she was not the wife for john she always told him he wouldnt be satisfied with her and now she saw he wasnt but she had tried her very best and now it was cruel to think she should not succeed any better  my dearest child said john who to say the truth was beginning to find this thing less charming than it used to be i am satisfied i am much obliged to you im sure you have done all that could be asked  well im sure i hope those folks of yours were pleased quoth lillie as she lay looking like a martyr with a cloth wet in icewater bound round her head they ought to be they have left greasespots all over the sofa in my boudoir from one end to the other and cake and raisins have been trodden into the carpets and the turf around the oval is all cut up and they have broken my little diana and such a din as there wasoh me it makes my head ache to think of it  illustration oh me it makes my head ache to think of it  never mind lillie ill see to it and set it all right  no you cant one of the children broke that model of the leaning tower too i found it you cant teach such children to let things alone oh dear me my head  there there pussy only dont worry said john in soothing tones  dont think me horrid please dont said lillie piteously i did try to have things go right didnt i  certainly you did dearie so dont worry ill get all the spots taken out and all the things mended and make every thing right  so john called rosa on his way downstairs show me the sofa that they spoiled said he  sofa said rosa  yes i understand the children greased the sofa in mrs seymours boudoir  oh dear no nothing of the sort ive been putting every thing to rights in all the rooms and they look beautifully  didnt they break something  oh no nothing the little things were good as could be  that leaning tower and that little diana suggested john  oh dear me no i broke those a month ago and showed them to mrs seymour and promised to mend them oh she knows all about that  ah said john i didnt know that well rosa put every thing up nicely and divide this money among the girls for extra trouble he added slipping a bill into her hand  im sure theres no trouble said rosa we all enjoyed it and i believe everybody did only im sorry it was too much for mrs seymour she is very delicate  yes she is said john as he turned away drawing a long slow sigh  that long slow sigh had become a frequent and unconscious occurrence with him of late when our ideals are sick unto death when they are slowly dying and passing away from us we sigh thus john said to himself softlyno matter what but he felt the pang of knowing again what he had known so often of late that his lillies word was not golden what she said would not bear close examination therefore why examine  evidently she is determined that this thing shall not go on said john well i shall never try again its of no use and john went up to his sisters and threw himself down upon the old chintz sofa as if it had been his mothers bosom his sister sat there sewing the sun came twinkling through a rustic framework of ivy which it had been the pride of her heart to arrange the week before all the old family pictures and heirlooms and sketches and pencillings were arranged in the most charming way so that her rooms seemed a reproduction of the old home  hang it all said john with a great flounce as he turned over on the sofa im not up to par this morning  now grace had that perfect intuitive knowledge of just what the matter was with her brother that women always have who have grown up in intimacy with a man these fine female eyes see farther between the rough cracks and ridges of the oak bark of manhood than men themselves nothing would have been easier had grace been a jealous exigeante woman than to have passed a fine probe of sisterly inquiry into the weak places where the ties between john and lillie were growing slack and untied and loosened them more and more she could have done it so tenderly so conscientiously so pityinglyencouraging john to talk and to complain and taking part with himtill there should come to be two parties in the family the brother and sister against the wife  how strong the temptation was those may feel who reflect that this one subject caused an almost total eclipse of the lifelong habit of confidence which had existed between grace and her brother and that her brother was her life and her world  but grace was one of those women formed under the kindly severe discipline of puritan new england to act not from blind impulse or instinct but from high principle the habit of selfexamination and selfinspection for which the religious teaching of new england has been peculiar produced a race of women who rose superior to those mere feminine caprices and impulses which often hurry very generous and kindlynatured persons into ungenerous and dishonorable conduct grace had been trained by a father and mother whose marriage union was an ideal of mutual love honor and respect to feel that marriage was the holiest and most awful of obligations to her the idea of a husband or a wife betraying each others weaknesses or faults by complaints to a third party seemed something sacrilegious and she used all her womanly tact and skill to prevent any conversation that might lead to such a result  lillie is entirely knocked up by the affair yesterday she had a terrible headache this morning said john  poor child she is a delicate little thing said grace  she couldnt have had any labor continued john for i saw to every thing and provided every thing myself and bridget and rosa and all the girls entered into it with real spirit and lillie did the best she could poor girl but i could see all the time she was worrying about her new fizgigs and folderols in the house hang it i wish they were all in the red sea burst out john glad to find something to vent himself upon if i had known that making the house over was going to be such a restraint on a fellow i would never have done it  oh well never mind that now said grace your house will get rubbed down by and by and the new gloss taken off and so will your wife and you will all be cosey and easy as an old shoe young mistresses you see have nerves all over their house at first they tremble at every dent in their furniture and wink when you come near it as if you were going to hit it a blow but that wears off in time and they learn to take it easy  john looked relieved but after a minute broke out again  i say gracie lillie has gone and invited the simpkinses and the follingsbees here this fall just think of it  well i suppose you expect your wife to have the right of inviting her company said grace  but you know gracie they are not at all our sort of folks said john none of our set would ever think of visiting them and itll seem so odd to see them here follingsbee is a vulgar sharper who has made his money out of our country by dishonest contracts during the war i dont know much about his wife lillie says she is her intimate friend  oh well john we must get over it in the quietest way possible it wouldnt be handsome not to make the agreeable to your wifes company and if you dont like the quality of it why you are a good deal nearer to her than any one else can beyou can gradually detach her from them  then you think i ought to put a good face on their coming said john with a sigh of relief  oh certainly of course what else can you do its one of the things to be expected with a young wife  and do you think the wilcoxes and the fergusons and the rest of our set will be civil  why of course they will said grace rose and letitia will certainly and the others will follow suit after all john perhaps we old families as we call ourselves are a little bit pharisaical and selfrighteous and too apt to thank god that we are not as other men are itll do us good to be obliged to come a little out of our crinkles  it isnt any old family feeling about follingsbee said john but i feel that that man deserves to be in states prison much more than many a poor dog that is there now  and that may be true of many another even in the selectest circles of good society said grace but we are not called on to play providence nor pronounce judgments the common courtesies of life do not commit us one way or the other the lord himself does not express his opinion of the wicked but allows all an equal share in his kindliness  well gracie you are right and ill constrain myself to do the thing handsomely said john  the thing with you men said grace is that you want your wives to see with your eyes all in a minute what has got to come with years and intimacy and the gradual growing closer and closer together the husband and wife of themselves drop many friendships and associations that at first were mutually distasteful simply because their tastes have grown insensibly to be the same  john hoped it would be so with himself and lillie for he was still very much in love with her and it comforted him to have grace speak so cheerfully as if it were possible  you think lillie will grow into our ways by and byhe said inquiringly  well if we have patience and give her time you know john that you knew when you took her that she had not been brought up in our ways of living and thinking lillie comes from an entirely different set of people from any we are accustomed to but a man must face all the consequences of his marriage honestly and honorably  i know it said john with a sigh i say gracie do you think the fergusons like lillie i want her to be intimate with them  well i think they admire her said grace evasively and feel disposed to be as intimate as she will let them  because said john rose ferguson is such a splendid girl she is so strong and so generous and so perfectly true and reliableit would be the joy of my heart if lillie would choose her for a friend  then pray dont tell her so said grace earnestly and dont praise her to lillieand above all things never hold her up as a pattern unless you want your wife to hate her  john opened his eyes very wide  so said he slowly i never thought of that you think she would be jealous and john smiled as men do at the idea that their wives may be jealous not disliking it on the whole  i know i shouldnt be in much charity with a woman my husband proposed to me as a model that is to say supposing i had one said grace  that reminds me said john suddenly rising up from the sofa do you know gracie that colonel sydenham has come back from his cruise  i had heard of it said grace quietly now john dont interrupt me im just going to turn this corner and must countone two three four five six  john looked at his sister how handsome she looks when her cheeks have that color he thought i wonder if there ever was any thing in that affair between them     chapter xiv   a great moral conflict  now john dear i have something very particular that i want you to promise me said mrs lillie a day or two after the scenes last recorded our lillie had recovered her spirits and got over her headache and had come down and done her best to be delightful and when a very pretty woman who has all her life studied the art of pleasing does that she generally succeeds  john thought to himself he didnt care what she was he loved her and that she certainly was the prettiest most bewitching little creature on earth he flung his sighs and his doubts and fears to the wind and suffered himself to be coaxed and cajoled and led captive in the most amiable manner possible  his fair one had a point to carrya point that instinct told her was to be managed with great adroitness  well said john over his newspaper what is this something so very particular  first sir put down that paper and listen to me said mrs lillie coming up and seating herself on his knee and sweeping down the offending paper with an air of authority  yesm said john submissively lets seehow was that in the marriage service i promised to obey didnt i  of course you did that service is always interpreted by contrariesever since eve made adam mind her in the beginning said mrs lillie laughing  and got things into a pretty mess in that way said john but come now what is it  well john you know the follingsbees are coming next week  i know it said john looking amiable and conciliatory  well dear there are some things about our establishment that are not just as i should feel pleased to receive them to  ah said john why lillie i thought we were fine as a fiddle from the top of the house to the bottom  oh its not the house the house is splendid i shouldnt be in the least ashamed to show it to anybody but about the table arrangements  now really lillie what can one have more than real old china and heavy silver plate i rather pique myself on that i think it has quite a good rich solid old air  well john to say the truth why do we never have any wine i dont care for iti never drink it but the decanters and the different colored glasses and all the apparatus are such an adornment and then the follingsbees are such judges of wine he imports his own from spain  johns face had been hardening down into a firm decided look while lillie stroking his whiskers and playing with his collar went on with this address  at last he said lillie i have done almost every thing you ever asked but this one thing i cannot doit is a matter of principle i never drink wine never have it on my table never give it because i have pledged myself not to do it  now john here is some more of your quixotism isnt it  well lillie i suppose you will call it so said john but listen to me patiently my father and i labored for a long time to root out drinking from our village at spindlewood it seemed for the time as if it would be the destruction of every thing there the fact was there was rum in every family the parents took it daily the children learned to love and long after it by seeing the parents and drinking little sweetened remains at the bottoms of tumblers there were every year families broken up and destroyed and fine fellows going to the very devil with this thing and so we made a movement to form a temperance society i paid lecturers and finally lectured myself at last they said to me its all very well for you rich people that have twice as fine houses and twice as many pleasures as we poor folks to pick on us for having a little something comfortable to drink in our houses if we could afford your fine nice wines and all that we wouldnt drink whiskey you must all have your wine on the table whiskey is the poor mans wine  i think said lillie they were abominably impertinent to talk so to you i should have told them so  perhaps they thought i was impertinent in talking to them about their private affairs said john but i will tell you what i said to them i said my good fellows i will clear my house and table of wine if you will clear yours of rum on this agreement i formed a temperance society my father and i put our names at the head of the list and we got every man and boy in spindlewood it was a complete victory and since then there hasnt been a more temperate thrifty set of people in these united states  didnt your mother object  my mother no indeed i wish you could have known my mother it was no small sacrifice to her and father not that they cared a penny for the wine itself but the poetry and hospitality of the thing the fine old cheery associations connected with it were a real sacrifice but when we told my mother how it was she never hesitated a moment all our cellar of fine old wines was sent round as presents to hospitals except a little that we keep for sickness  well really said lillie in a dry cool tone i suppose it was very good of you perfectly saintlike and all that but it does seem a great pity why couldnt these people take care of themselves i dont see why you should go on denying yourself just to keep them in the ways of virtue  oh its no selfdenial now im quite used to it said john cheerily i am young and strong and just as well as i can be and dont need wine in fact i never think of it the fergusons who are with us in the spindlewood business took just the same view of it and did just as we did and the wilcoxes joined us in fact all the good old families of our set came into it  well couldnt you just while the follingsbees are here do differently  no lillie theres my pledge you see no its really impossible  lillie frowned and looked disconsolate  john i really do think you are selfish you dont seem to have any consideration for me at all its going to make it so disagreeable and uncomfortable for me the follingsbees are accustomed to wine every day im perfectly ashamed not to give it to them  do em good to fast awhile then said john laughing like a hardhearted monster youll see they wont suffer materially bridget makes splendid coffee  its a shame to laugh at what troubles me john the follingsbees are my friends and of course i want to treat them handsomely  we will treat them just as handsomely as we treat ourselves said john and mortal man or woman ought not to ask more  i dont care said lillie after a pause i hate all these moral movements and society questions they are always in the way of peoples having a good time and i believe the world would wag just as well as it does if nobody had ever thought of them people will call you a real muff john  how very terrible said john laughing what shall i do if i am called a muff and what a jolly little mrs muff you will be he said pinching her cheek  you neednt laugh john said lillie pouting you dont know how things look in fashionable circles the follingsbees are in the very highest circle they have lived in paris and been invited by the emperor  i havent much opinion of americans who live in paris and are invited by the emperor said john but be that as it may i shall do the best i can for them and mr young says angels could no more so goodby puss i must go to my office and dont lets talk about this any more  and john put on his cap and squared his broad shoulders and marching off with a resolute stride went to his office and had a most uncomfortable morning of it you see my dear friends that though nature has set the seal of sovereignty on man in broad shoulders and bushy beard though he fortify and incase himself in rough overcoats and heavy boots and walk with a dashing air and whistle like a freeman we all know it is not an easy thing to wage a warfare with a pretty little creature in lace cap and tiny slippers who has a faculty of looking very pensive and grieved and making up a sad little mouth as if her heart were breaking  john never doubted that he was right and in the way of duty and yet though he braved it out so stoutly with lillie and though he marched out from her presence victoriously as it were with drums beating and colors flying yet there was a dismal sinking of heart under it  im right i know i am of course i cant give up here its a matter of principle of honor he said over and over to himself perhaps if lillie had been here i never should have taken such a pledge but as i have theres no help for it  then he thought of what lillie had suggested about its looking niggardly in hospitality and was angry with himself for feeling uncomfortable what do i care what dick follingsbee thinks said he to himself a man that i despise a cheat and a swindlera man of no principle lillie doesnt know the sacrifice it is to me to have such people in my house at all hang it all i wish lillie was a little more like the women ive been used tolike grace and rose and my mother but poor thing i oughtnt to blame her after all for her unfortunate bringing up but its so nice to be with women that can understand the grounds you go on a man never wants to fight a woman id rather give up hook and line and let lillie have her own way in every thing but then it wont do a fellow must stop somewhere well ill make it up in being a model of civility to these confounded people that i wish were in the red sea lets see ill ask lillie if she dont want to give a party for them when they come by george she shall have every thing her own way theresend to new york for the supper turn the house topsyturvy illuminate the grounds and do any thing else she can think of yes yes she shall have carte blanche for every thing  all which john told mrs lillie when he returned to dinner and found her enacting the depressed wife in a most becoming lace cap and wrapper that made her look like a suffering angel and the treaty was sealed with many kisses  you shall have carte blanche dearest he said for every thing but what we were speaking of and that will content you wont it  and lillie with lingering pensiveness very graciously acknowledged that it would and seemed so touchingly resigned and made such a merit of her resignation that john told her she was an angel in fact he had a sort of indistinct remorseful feeling that he was a sort of cruel monster to deny her any thing lillie had sense enough to see when she could do a thing and when she couldnt she had given up the case when john went out in the morning and so accepted the treaty of peace with a good degree of cheerfulness and she was soon busy discussing the matter you see weve been invited everywhere and havent given any thing she said and this will do up our social obligations to everybody here and then we can show off our rooms they really are made to give parties in  yes so they are said john delighted to see her smile again they seem adapted to that and i dont doubt youll make a brilliant affair of it lillie  trust me for that john said lillie ill show the follingsbees that something can be done here in springdale as well as in new york and so the great question was settled     chapter xv   the follingsbees arrive  next week the follingsbees alighted so to speak from a cloud of glory they came in their own carriage and with their own horses all in silk and silver purple and fine linen with rings on their fingers and bells on their toes as the old song has it we pause to caution our readers that this last clause is to be interpreted metaphorically  illustration the follingsbees  springdale stood astonished the quiet respectable old town had not seen any thing like it for many a long day the ostlers at the hotel talked of it the boys followed the carriage and hung on the slats of the fence to see the party alight and said to one another in their artless vocabulary golly aint it bully  there was mr dick follingsbee with a pair of waxed towcolored moustaches like the french emperors and ever so much longer he was a little thin lightcolored man with a yellow complexion and sandy hair who with the appendages aforesaid looked like some kind of large insect with very long antennae there was mrs follingsbeea tall handsome darkeyed darkhaired dashing woman french dressed from the tip of her lace parasol to the toe of her boot there was mademoiselle thérèse the french maid an inexpressibly fine lady and there was la petite marie mrs follingsbees threeyearold hopeful a lean brighteyed little thing with a great scarlet bow on her back that made her look like a walking butterfly on the whole the tableau of arrival was so impressive that bridget and annie rosa and all the kitchen cabinet were in a breathless state of excitement  how do i find you ma chère said mrs follingsbee folding lillie rapturously to her breast ive been just dying to see you how lovely every thing looks oh ciel how like dear paris she said as she was conducted into the parlor and sunk upon the sofa  pretty well done too for america said mr follingsbee gazing round and settling his collar mr follingsbee was one of the class of returned travellers who always speak condescendingly of any thing american as soso or tolerable or pretty faira considerateness which goes a long way towards keeping up the spirits of the country  i say dick said his lady have you seen to the bags and wraps  all right madam  and my basket of medicines and the books  ok replied dick sententiously  oh how often must i tell you not to use those odious slang terms said his wife reprovingly  oh mrs john seymour knows me of old said mr follingsbee winking facetiously at lillie weve had many a jolly lark together havent we lill  certainly we have said lillie affably but come darling she added to mrs follingsbee dont you want to be shown your room  go it then my dearie and ill toddle up with the folderols and whatyoumaycalls said the incorrigible dick there wife mrs john seymour shall go first so that you shant be jealous of her and me you know we came pretty near being in interesting relations ourselves at one time didnt we now he said with another wink  it is said that a thoroughpaced naturalist can reconstruct a whole animal from one specimen bone in like manner we imagine that from these few words of dialogue our expert readers can reconstruct mr and mrs follingsbee he vulgar shallow sharp keen at a bargain and utterly without scruples with a sort of hilarious animal good nature that was in a state of constant ebullition he was as richard baxter said of a better man always in that state of hilarity that another would be in when he hath taken a cup too much  dick follingsbee began life as a peddler he was now reputed to be master of untold wealth kept a yacht and racehorses ran his own theatre and patronized the whole world and creation in general with a jocular freedom mrs follingsbee had been a country girl with small early advantages but considerable ambition she had married dick follingsbee and helped him up in the world as a clever ambitious woman may the last few years she had been spending in paris improving her mind and manners in reading dumas and madame george sands novels and availing herself of such outskirt advantages of the court of the tuileries as industrious painstaking americans not embarrassed by selfrespect may command  mrs follingsbee like many another of our republicans who besieged the purlieus of the late empire felt that a residence near the court at a time when every thing good and decent in france was hiding in obscure corners and every thing parvenu was wide awake and active entitled her to speak as one having authority concerning french character french manners and customs this lady assumed the sentimental literary rôle she was always cultivating herself in her own way that is to say she was assiduous in what she called keeping up her french  in the opinion of many of her class of thinkers french is the key of the kingdom of heaven and of course it is worth ones while to sell all that one has to be possessed of it mrs follingsbee had not been in the least backward to do this but as to getting the golden key she had not succeeded she had formed the acquaintance of many disreputable people she had read french novels and french plays such as no wellbred french woman would suffer in her family she had lost such innocence and purity of mind as she had to lose and after all had not got the french language  however there are losses that do not trouble the subject of them because they bring insensibility just as mrs follingsbees ear was not delicate enough to perceive that her rapid and confident french was not parisian so also her conscience and moral sense were not delicate enough to know that she had spent her labor for that which was not bread she had only succeeded in acquiring such an air that on a careless survey she might have been taken for one of the demimonde of paris while secretly she imagined herself the fascinating heroine of a french romance  the friendship between mrs follingsbee and lillie was of the most impassioned nature though as both of them were women of a good solid perception in regard to their own material interests there were excellent reasons on both sides for this enthusiasm  notwithstanding the immense wealth of the follingsbees there were circles to which mrs follingsbee found it difficult to be admitted with the usual human perversity these of course became exactly the ones and the only ones she particularly cared for her ambition was to pass beyond the ranks of the shoddy aristocracy to those of the oldestablished families now the seymours the fergusons and the wilcoxes were families of this sort and none of them had ever cared to conceal the fact that they did not intend to know the follingsbees the marriage of lillie into the seymour family was the opening of a door and mrs follingsbee had been at lillies feet during her newport campaign on the other hand lillie having taken the sense of the situation at springdale had cast her thoughts forward like a discreet young woman and perceived in advance of her a very dull domestic winter enlivened only by readingcircles and such slow teaparties as unsophisticated springdale found agreeable the idea of a long visit to the newyork alhambra of the follingsbees in the winter with balls parties unlimited operaboxes was not a thing to be disregarded and so when mrs follingsbee ma chèred lillie lillie my deared mrs follingsbee and the pair are to be seen at this blessed moment sitting with their arms tenderly round each others waists on a causeuse in mrs follingsbees dressingroom  you dont know mignonne said mrs follingsbee how perfectly ravissante these apartments are im so glad poor charlie did them so well for you i laid my commands on him poor fellow  pray how does your affair with him get on said lillie  o dearest youve no conception what a trial it is to me to keep him in the bounds of reason he has such struggles of mind about that stupid wife of his think of it my dear a man like charlie ferrola all poetry romance ideality tied to a woman who thinks of nothing but her childrens teeth and bowels and turns the whole house into a nursery oh ive no patience with such people  well poor fellow its a pity he ever got married said lillie  well it would be all well enough if this sort of woman ever would be reasonable but they wont they dont in the least comprehend the necessities of genius they want to yoke pegasus to a cart you see now i understand charlie perfectly i could give him that which he needs i appreciate him i make a bower of peace and enjoyment for him where his artistic nature finds the repose it craves  and she pitches into him about you said lillie not slow to perceive the true literal rendering of all this  of course ma chèretears him rends him lacerates his soul sometimes he comes to me in the most dreadful states really dear i have apprehended something quite awful i shouldnt in the least be surprised if he should blow his brains out  and mrs follingsbee sighed deeply gave a glance at herself in an opposite mirror and smoothed down a bow pensively as the prima donna at the grand opera generally does when her lover is getting ready to stab himself  oh i dont think hes going to kill himself said mrs lillie who it must be understood was secretly somewhat sceptical about the power of her friends charms and looked on this little french romance with the eye of an outsider never you believe that dearest these men make dreadful tearings and shocking eyes and mouths but they take pretty good care to keep in the world after all you see if a mans dead theres an end of all things and i fancy they think of that before they quite come to any thing decisive  chère étourdie said mrs follingsbee regarding lillie with a pensive smile you are just your old self i see you are now at the height of your powerjeune madame un mari qui vous adore ready to put all things under your feet how can you feel for a worn lonely heart like mine that sighs for congeniality  bless me now said lillie briskly you dont tell me that youre going to be so silly as to get in love with charlie yourself its all well enough to keep these fellows on the tragic high ropes but if a woman falls in love herself theres an end of her power and darling just think of it you wouldnt have married that creature if you could hes poor as a rat and always will be these desperately interesting fellows always are now you have money without end and of course you have position and your husband is a man you can get any thing in the world out of  oh as to that i dont complain of dick said mrs follingsbee hes coarse and vulgar to be sure but he never stands in my way and i never stand in his and as you say hes free about money but still darling sometimes it seems to me such a weary thing to live without sympathy of soul a marriage without congeniality mon dieu what is it and then the harsh cold laws of human society prevent any relief they forbid natures that are made for each other from being to each other what they can be  you mean that people will talk about you said lillie well i assure you dearest they will talk awfully if you are not very careful i say this to you frankly as your friend you know  ah ma petite you dont need to tell me that i am careful said mrs follingsbee i am always lecturing charlie and showing him that we must keep up les convenances but is it not hard on us poor women to lead always this repressed secretive life  what made you marry mr follingsbee said lillie with apparent artlessness  darling i was but a child i was ignorant of the mysteries of my own nature of my capabilities as charlie said to me the other day we never learn what we are till some congenial soul unlocks the secret door of our hearts the fact is dearest that american society with its straitlaced puritanical notions bears terribly hard on womans heart poor charlie he is no less one of the victims of society  oh nonsense said lillie you take it too much to heart you mustnt mind all these men say they are always being desperate and tragic charlie has talked just so to me time and time again i understand it all he talked exactly so to me when he came to newport last summer you must take matters easy my dearyou with your beauty and your style and your money why you can lead all new york captive forty fellows like charlie are not worth spoiling ones dinner for come cheer up positively i shant let you be blue ma reine let me ring for your maid to dress you for dinner au revoir  the fact was that mrs lillie having formerly set down this lovely charlie on the list of her own adorers had small sympathy with the sentimental romance of her friend  what a fool she makes of herself she thought as she contemplated her own sylphlike figure and wonderful freshness of complexion in the glass dont i know charlie ferrola he wants her to get him into fashionable life and knows the way to do it to think of that stout middleaged party imagining that charlie ferrolas going to die for her charms its too funny how stout the dear old thing does get to be sure  illustration mr charlie ferrola  it will be observed here that our dear lillie did not want for perspicacity there is nothing so absolutely clearsighted in certain directions as selfishness entire want of sympathy with others clears up ones vision astonishingly and enables us to see all the weak points and ridiculous places of our neighbors in the most accurate manner possible  as to mr charlie ferrola our lillie was certainly in the right in respect to him he was one of those blossoms of male humanity that seem as expressly designed by nature for the ornamentation of ladies boudoirs as an italian greyhound he had precisely the same graceful shivery adaptation to live by petting and caresses his tastes were all so exquisite that it was the most difficult thing in the world to keep him out of misery a moment he was in a chronic state of disgust with something or other in our lower world from morning till night  his profession was nominally that of architecture and landscape gardening but in point of fact consisted in telling certain rich blasé stupid fashionable people how they could quickest get rid of their money he ruled despotically in the follingsbee halls he bought and rejected pictures and jewelry ordered and sent off furniture with the air of an absolute master amusing himself meanwhile with running a french romance with the handsome mistress of the establishment as a consequence he had not only opportunities for much quiet feathering of his own nest but the éclat of always having the use of the follingsbees carriages horses and operaboxes and being the acknowledged and supreme head of fashionable dictation ladies sometimes pull caps for such charming individuals as we have seen in the case of mrs follingsbee and lillie  for it is not to be supposed that mrs follingsbee though she had assumed the gushing style with her young friend wanted spirit or perception on her part her darling lillie had left a nettle in her bosom which rankled there  the vanity of these thin light watery blondes she said to herself as she looked into her own great dark eyes in the mirrorthinking charlie ferrola cares for her i know just what he thinks of her thank heaven poor thing dont you think mrs john seymour has gone off astonishingly since her marriage she said to thérèse  mon dieu madame qoui said the obedient tirewoman scraping the very back of her throat in her zeal madame seymour has the real american maigreur these thin women madame they have no substance there is noting to them for young girl they are charming but as woman they are just noting at all now you will see madame what i tell you in a year or two people shall ask was she ever handsome but you madame you come to your prime like great rose oh dere is no comparison of you to mrs john seymour  and thérèse found her words highly acceptable after the manner of all her tribe who prophesy smooth things unto their mistresses  it may be imagined that the entertaining of dick follingsbee was no small strain on the conjugal endurance of our faithful john but he was on duty and endured without flinching that gentlemans free and easy jokes and patronizing civilities  i do wish darling youd teach that creature not to call you lillie in that abominably free manner he said to his wife the first day after dinner  mercy on us john what can i do all the world knows that dick follingsbees an oddity and everybody agrees to take what he says for what its worth if i should go to putting on any airs hed behave ten times worse than he does the only way is to pass it over quietly and not to seem to notice any thing he says or does my way is to smile and look gracious and act as if i hadnt heard any thing but what is perfectly proper  its a tremendous infliction lillie  poor man is it said lillie putting her arm round his neck and stroking his whiskers well now hes a good man to bear it so well so he is and they shant plague him long but john you must confess mrs follingsbee is nice poor woman she is mortified with the way dick will go on but she cant do any thing with him  yes i can get on with her said john in fact john was one of the men so loyal to women that his path of virtue in regard to them always ran down hill mrs follingsbee was handsome and had a gift in language and some considerable tact in adapting herself to her society and as she put forth all her powers to win his admiration she succeeded  grace had done her part to assist john in his hospitable intents by securing the prompt cooperation of the fergusons the very first evening after their arrival old mrs ferguson with letitia and rose called not formally but socially as had always been the custom of the two families dick follingsbee was out enjoying an evening cigara circumstance on which john secretly congratulated himself as a favorable feature in the case he felt instinctively a sort of uneasy responsibility for his guests and judging the fergusons by himself felt that their call was in some sort an act of selfabnegation on his account and he was anxious to make it as easy as possible mrs follingsbee was presentable so he thought but he dreaded the irrepressible dick and had much the same feeling about him that one has on presenting a pet spaniel or pointer in a ladys parlorthere was no answering for what he might say or do  the fergusons were disposed to make themselves most amiable to mrs follingsbee and with this intent miss letitia started the subject of her parisian experiences as being probably one where she would feel herself especially at home mrs follingsbee of course expanded in rapturous description and was quite clever and interesting  you must feel quite a difference between that country and this in regard to facilities of living said miss letitia  ah indeed do i not said mrs follingsbee casting up her eyes life here in america is in a state of perfect disorganization  we are a young people here madam said john we havent had time to organize the smaller conveniences of life  yes thats what i mean said mrs follingsbee now you men dont feel it so very much but it bears hard on us poor women life here in america is perfect slavery to womena perfect dead grind you see theres no career at all for a married woman in this country as there is in france marriage there opens a brilliant prospect before a girl it introduces her to the world it gives her wings in america it is clipping her wings chaining her down shutting her upno more gayety no more admiration nothing but cradles and cribs and bibs and tuckers little narrowing wearing domestic cares hard vulgar domestic slaveries and so our women lose their bloom and health and freshness and are moped to death  i cant see the thing in that light mrs follingsbee said old mrs ferguson i dont understand this modern talk i am sure for one i can say i have had all the career i wanted ever since i married you know dear when one begins to have children ones heart goes into them we find nothing hard that we do for the dear little things ive heard that the parisian ladies never nurse their own babies from my very heart i pity them  oh my dear madam said mrs follingsbee why insist upon it that a cultivated intelligent woman shall waste some of the most beautiful years of her life in a mere animal function that after all any healthy peasant can perform better than she the french are a philosophical nation and in paris you see this thing is all systematic its altogether better for the child its taken to the country and put to nurse with a good strong woman who makes that her only business she just lives to be a good animal you see and so is a better one than a more intellectual being can be thus she gives the child a strong constitution which is the main thing  yes said miss letitia i was told when in paris that this system is universal the dressmaker who works at so much a day sends her child out to nurse as certainly as the woman of rank and fashion there are no babies as a rule in french households  and you see how good this is for the mother said mrs follingsbee the first year or two of a childs life it is nothing but a little animal and one person can do for it about as well as another and all this time while it is growing physically the mother has for art for selfcultivation for society and for literature of course she keeps her eye on her child and visits it often enough to know that all goes right with it  yes said miss letitia and the same philosophical spirit regulates the education of the child throughout an american gentleman who wished to live in paris told me that having searched all over it he could not accommodate his family including himself and wife and two children without taking two of the suites that are usually let to one family the reason he inferred was the perfection of the system which keeps the french family reduced in numbers the babies are out at nurse sometimes till two and sometimes till three years of age and at seven or eight the girl goes into a pension and the boy into a college till they are ready to be taken outthe girl to be married and the boy to enter a profession so the leisure of parents for literature art and society is preserved  it seems to me the most perfectly dreary dreadful way of living i ever heard of said mrs ferguson with unwonted energy how i pity people who know so little of real happiness  yet the french are dotingly fond of children said mrs follingsbee its a national peculiarity you can see it in all their literature dont you remember victor hugos exquisite description of a mothers feelings for a little child in notre dame de paris i never read any thing more affecting its perfectly subduing  they cant love their children as i did mine said mrs ferguson its impossible and if thats whats called organizing society i hope our society in america never will be organized it cant be that children are well taken care of on that system i always attended to every thing for my babies myself because i felt god had put them into my hands perfectly helpless and if there is any thing difficult or disagreeable in the case how can i expect to hire a woman for money to be faithful in what i cannot do for love  but dont you think dear madam that this system of personal devotion to children may be carried too far said mrs follingsbee perhaps in france they may go to an extreme but dont our american women as a rule sacrifice themselves too much to their families  sacrifice said mrs ferguson how can we our children are our new life we live in them a thousand times more than we could in ourselves no i think a mother that doesnt take care of her own baby misses the greatest happiness a woman can know a baby isnt a mere animal and it is a great and solemn thing to see the coming of an immortal soul into it from day to day my very happiest hours have been spent with my babies in my arms  there may be women constituted so as to enjoy it said mrs follingsbee but you must allow that there is a vast difference among women  there certainly is said mrs ferguson as she rose with a frigid courtesy and shortened the call my dear girls said the old lady to her daughters when they returned home i disapprove of that woman i am very sorry that pretty little mrs seymour has so bad a friend and adviser why the woman talks like a fejee islander baby a mere animal to be sure it puts me out of temper to hear such talk the woman talks as if she had never heard of such a thing as love in her life and dont know what it means  oh well mamma said rose you know we are oldfashioned folks and not up to modern improvements  well said miss letitia i should think that that poor little weird child of mrs follingsbees with the great red bow on her back had been brought up on this system yesterday afternoon i saw her in the garden with that maid of hers apparently enjoying a free fight they looked like a pair of goblinsan old and a young one i never saw any thing like it  what a pity said rose for shes a smart bright little thing and its cunning to hear her talk french  well said mrs ferguson straightening her back and sitting up with a grand air i am one of eight children that my mother nursed herself at her own breast and lived to a good honorable old age after it people called her a handsome woman at sixty she could ride and walk and dance with the best and nobody kept up a keener interest in reading or general literature her conversation was sought by the most eminent men of the day as something remarkable she was always with her children we always knew we had her to run to at any moment and we were the first thing with her she lived a happy loving useful life and her children rose up and called her blessed  as we do you dear mamma said rose kissing her so dont be oratorical darling mammy because we are all of your mind here     chapter xvi   mrs john seymours party and what came of it  mrs john seymours party marked an era in the annals of springdale of this you may be sure my dear reader when you consider that it was projected and arranged by mrs lillie in strict counsel with her friend mrs follingsbee who had lived in paris and been to balls at the tuileries of course it was a tiptop newyorkparis party with all the new fashionable unspeakable crinkles and wrinkles all the high divine spick and span new ways of doing things which however like the eleusinian mysteries being in their very nature incommunicable except to the elect must be left to the imagination  a french artiste whom mrs follingsbee patronized as my confectioner came in state to springdale with a retinue of appendages and servants sufficient for a circus took formal possession of the seymour mansion and became for the time being absolute dictator as was customary in the old roman republic in times of emergency  mr follingsbee was forward fussy and advisory in his own peculiar freeandeasy fashion and mrs follingsbee was instructive and patronizing to the very last degree lillie had bewailed in her sympathizing bosom johns unaccountable and most singular moral quixotism in regard to the wine question and been comforted by her appreciative discourse mrs follingsbee had a sort of indefinite faith in french phrases for mending all the broken places in life a thing said partly in french became at once in her view elucidated even though the words meant no more than the same in english so she consoled lillie as follows  oh ma chère i understand perfectly your husband may be un peu borné as they say in paris but still un homme très respectable mrs follingsbee here scraped her throat emphatically just as her french maid dida sublime example of the virtues and let me tell you darling you are very fortunate to get such a man it is not often that a woman can get an establishment like yours and a good man into the bargain so if the goodness is a little ennuyeuse one must put up with it then again people of old established standing may do about what they like socially their position is made people only say well that is their way the seymours will do so and so now we have to do twice as much of every thing to make our position as certain other people do we might flood our place with champagne and burgundy and get all the young fellows drunk as we generally do and yet people will call our parties bourgeois and yours recherché if you give them nothing but tea and biscuit now theres my dick he respects your husband you can see he does in his odious slang way he says hes some and a brick and hes a little anxious to please him though he professes not to care for anybody now dick has pretty sharp sense after all or hed never have been just where he is  our friend john during these days preceding the party the party itself and the clearing up after it enacted submissively that part of unconditional surrender which the master of the house if well trained generally acts on such occasions he resembled the prize ox which is led forth adorned with garlands ribbons and docility to grace a triumphal procession he went where he was told did as he was bid marched to the right marched to the left put on gloves and cravat and took them off entirely submissive to the word of his little general and exhibited in short an edifying spectacle of that pleasant domestic animal a tame husband he had to make atonement for being a reformer and for endeavoring to live like a christian by conceding to his wife all this latitude of indulgence and he meant to go through it like a man and a philosopher to be sure in his eyes it was all so much unutterable bosh and nonsense and bosh and nonsense for which he was eventually to settle the bills but he armed himself with the patient reflection that all things have their end in timethat fireworks and chinese lanterns bands of music and kid gloves ruffs and puffs and pinkings and quillings and all sorts of unspeakable eatables with french names would ere long float down the stream of time and leave their record only in a few bad colds and days of indigestion which also time would mercifully cure  so john steadied his soul with a view of that comfortable future when all this fuss should be over and the coast cleared for something better moreover john found this good result of his patience that he learned a little something in a christian way by it men of elevated principle and moral honesty often treat themselves to such large slices of contempt and indignation in regard to the rogues of society as to forget a common brotherhood of pity it is sometimes wholesome for such men to be obliged to tolerate a scamp to the extent of exchanging with him the ordinary benevolences of social life  john in discharging the duty of a host to dick follingsbee found himself after a while looking on him with pity as a poor creature like the rich fool in the gospels without faith or love or prayer spending life as a moth doesin vain attempts to burn himself up in the candle and knowing nothing better in fact after a while the stiff towcolored moustache smart stride and flippant air of this poor little man struck him somewhere in the region between a smile and a tear and his enforced hospitality began to wear a tincture of real kindness there is no less pathos in moral than in physical imbecility  it is an observable social phenomenon that when any family in a community makes an advance very greatly ahead of its neighbors in style of living or splendor of entertainments the fact causes great searchings of spirit in all the region round about and abundance of talk wherein the thoughts of many hearts are revealed  springdale was a country town containing a choice knot of the old respectable trueblue bostonaristocracy families two or three of them had winter houses in beacon street and went there after christmas to enjoy the lectures concerts and select gayeties of the modern athens others like the fergusons and seymours were in intimate relationship with the same circle  now it is well known that the real old trueblue simonpure boston family is one whose claims to be considered the thing and the only thing are somewhat like the claim of apostolic succession in ancient churches it is easy to see why certain affluent cultivated and eminently wellconducted people should be considered the thing in their day and generation but why they should be considered as the only thing is the point insoluble to human reason and to be received by faith alone also why certain other people equally affluent cultivated and wellconducted are not the thing is one of the divine mysteries about which whoso observes boston society will do well not too curiously to exercise his reason  these trueblue families however have claims to respectability which make them on the whole quite a venerable and pleasurable feature of society in our young topsyturvy american community some of them have family records extending clearly back to the settlement of massachusetts bay and the family estate is still on grounds first cleared up by aboriginal settlers being of a puritan nobility they have an ancestral record affording more legitimate subject of family selfesteem than most other nobility their history runs back to an ancestry of unworldly faith and prayer and selfdenial of incorruptible public virtue sturdy resistance of evil and pursuit of good  there is also a literary aroma pervading their circles dim suggestions of the north american review of the dial of cambridgea sort of vague mielfleur of authorship and poetryis supposed to float in the air around them and it is generally understood that in their homes exist tastes and appreciations denied to less favored regions almost every one of them has its great manits father grandfather cousin or great uncle who wrote a book or edited a review or was a president of the united states or minister to england whose opinions are referred to by the family in any discussion as good christians quote the bible  it is true that in some few instances the pleroma of aristocratic dignity undergoes a sort of acetic fermentation and comes out in ungenial qualities now and then at a public wateringplace a man or woman appears no otherwise distinguished than by a remarkable talent for being disagreeable and it is amusing to find on inquiry that this repulsiveness of demeanor is entirely on account of belonging to an ancient family  such is the tendency of democracy to a general mingling of elements that this frigidity is deemed necessary by these good souls to prevent the commonalty from being attracted by them and sticking to them as straws and bits of paper do to amber but more generally the trueblue old families are simple and urbane in their manners and their pretensions are as miss edgeworth says presented rather intaglio than in cameo of course they most thoroughly believe in themselves but in a bland and genial way noblesse oblige is with them a secret spring of gentle address and social suavity they prefer their own set and their own ways and are comfortably sure that what they do not know is not worth knowing and what they have not been in the habit of doing is not worth doing but still they are indulgent of the existence of human nature outside of their own circle  the seymours and the fergusons belonged to this sort of people and of course mr john seymours marriage afforded them opportunity for some wholesome moral discipline the ferguson girls were frank social magnanimous young women of that class to whom the saying or doing of a rude or unhandsome thing by any human being was an utter impossibility and whose cheeks would flush at the mere idea of asserting personal superiority over any one nevertheless they trod the earth firmly as girls who felt that they were born to a certain position judge ferguson was a gentleman of the old school devoted to past ideas fond of the english classics and with small faith in any literature later than dr johnson he confessed to a toleration for scotts novels and had been detected by his children both laughing and crying over the stories of charles dickens for the amiable weaknesses of human nature still remain in the best regulated mind to women and children the judge was benignity itself imitating the grand monarque who bowed even to a chambermaid he believed in good orderly respectable old ways and entertainments and had a quiet horror of all that is loud or noisy or pretentious which sometimes made his social duties a trial to him as was the case in regard to the seymour party  the arrangements of the party including the preparations for an extensive illumination of the grounds and fireworks were on so unusual a scale as to rouse the whole community of springdale to a fever of excitement of course the wilcoxes and the lennoxes were astonished and disgusted when had it been known that any of their set had done any thing of the kind how horribly out of taste just the result of john seymours marrying into that class of society mrs lennox was of opinion that she ought not to go she was of the determined and spicy order of human beings and often like a certain french countess felt disposed to thank heaven that she generally succeeded in being rude when the occasion required mrs lennox regarded snubbing in the light of a moral duty devolving on people of condition when the foundations of things were in danger of being removed by the inroads of the vulgar commonalty on the present occasion mrs lennox was of opinion that quiet respectable people of good family ought to ignore this kind of proceeding and not think of encouraging such things by their presence  mrs wilcox generally shaped her course by mrs lennox still she had promised letitia ferguson to be gracious to the seymours in their exigency and to call on the follingsbees so there was a confusion all round the young people of both families declared that they were going just to see the fun bob lennox with the usual vivacity of young america said he didnt care a hang who set a ball rolling if only something was kept stirring the subject was discussed when mrs lennox and mrs wilcox were making a morning call upon the fergusons  for my part said mrs lennox im principled on this subject those follingsbees are not proper people they are of just that vulgar pushing class against which i feel it my duty to set my face like a flint and im astonished that a man like john seymour should go into relations with them you see it puts all his friends in a most embarrassing position  dear mrs lennox said rose ferguson indeed it is not mr seymours fault these persons are invited by his wife  well what business has he to allow his wife to invite them a man should be master in his own house  but my dear mrs lennox said mrs ferguson such a pretty young creature and just married of course it would be unhandsome not to allow her to have her friends  certainly said judge ferguson a gentleman cannot be rude to his wifes invited guests for my part i think seymour is putting the best face he can on it and we must all do what we can to help him we shall all attend the seymour party  well said mrs wilcox i think we shall go to be sure it is not what i should like to do i dont approve of these follingsbees mr wilcox was saying this morning that his money was made by frauds on the government which ought to have put him in the state prison  now i say said mrs lennox such people ought to be put down socially i have no patience with their airs and that mrs follingsbee i have heard that she was a milliner or shopgirl or some such thing and to see the airs she gives herself one would think it was the empress eugenie herself come to queen it over us in america i cant help thinking we ought to take a stand i really do  but dear mrs lennox we are not obliged to cultivate further relations with people simply from exchanging ordinary civilities with them on one evening said judge ferguson  but my dear sir these pushing vulgar rich people take advantage of every opening give them an inch and they will take an ell said mrs lennox now if i go they will be claiming acquaintance with me in newport next summer well i shall cut themdead  trust you for that said miss letitia laughing indeed mrs lennox i think you may go wherever you please with perfect safety people will never saddle themselves on you longer than you want them so you might as well go to the party with the rest of us  and besides you know said mrs wilcox all our young people will go whether we go or not your tom was at my house yesterday and he is going with my girls they are all just as wild about it as they can be and say that it is the greatest fun that has been heard of this summer  in fact there was not a man woman or child in a circle of fifteen miles round who could show shade or color of an invitation who was not out in full dress at mrs john seymours party people in a city may pick and choose their entertainments and she who gives a party there may reckon on a falling off of about onethird for various other attractions but in the country where there is nothing else stirring one may be sure that not one person able to stand on his feet will be missing a party in a good old sleepy respectable country place is a godsend it is equal to an earthquake for suggesting materials of conversation and in so many ways does it awaken and vivify the community that one may doubt whether after all it is not a moral benefaction and the giver of it one to be ranked in the noble army of martyrs  everybody went even mrs lennox when she had sufficiently swallowed her moral principles sent in all haste to new york for an elegant spick and span new dress from madame de tullegigs expressly for the occasion was she to be outshone by unprincipled upstarts perish the thought it was treason to the cause of virtue and the standing order of society of course the best thing to be done is to put certain people down if you can but if you cannot do that the next best thing is to outshine them in their own way it may be very naughty for them to be so dressy and extravagant and very absurd improper immoral unnecessary and in bad taste but still if you cannot help it you may as well try to do the same and do a little more of it mrs lennox was in a feverish state till all her trappings came from new york the bill was something stunning but then it was voted by the young people that she had never looked so splendidly in her life and she comforted herself with marking out a certain sublime distance and reserve of manner to be observed towards mrs seymour and the follingsbees  the young people however came home delighted tom aged twentytwo instructed his mother that follingsbee was a brick and a real jolly fellow and he had accepted an invitation to go on a yachting cruise with him the next month jane lennox moreover began besetting her mother to have certain details in their house rearranged with an eye to the seymour glorification  now jane dear thats just the result of allowing you to visit in this flash vulgar genteel society said the troubled mamma  bless your heart mamma the world moves on you know and we must move with it a little or be left behind for my part im perfectly ashamed of the way we let things go at our house it really is not respectable now i like mrs follingsbee for my part shes clever and amusing it was fun to hear all about the balls at the tuileries and the opera and things in paris mamma when are we going to paris  oh i dont know my dear you must ask your father he is very unwilling to go abroad  papa is so slow and conservative in his notions said the young lady for my part i cannot see what is the use of all this talk about the follingsbees he is goodnatured and funny and i am sure i think shes a splendid woman and by the way she gave me the address of lots of places in new york where we can get french things did you notice her lace it is superb and she told me where lace just like it could be bought onethird less than they sell at stewarts  thus we see how the startingout of an old respectable family in any new ebullition of fancy and fashion is like a dandelion going to seed you have not only the airy fairy globe but every feathery particle thereof bears a germ which will cause similar feather bubbles all over the country and thus old respectable grassplots become in time half dandelion it is to be observed that in all questions of life and fashion the world and the flesh to say nothing of the third partner of that ancient firm have us at decided advantage it is easy to see the flash of jewelry the dazzle of color the rush and glitter of equipage and to be dizzied by the babble and gayety of fashionable life while it is not easy to see justice patience temperance selfdenial these are things belonging to the invisible and the eternal and to be seen with other eyes than those of the body  then again there is no one thing in all the items which go to make up fashionable extravagance which taken separately and by itself is not in some point of view a good or pretty or desirable thing and so whenever the forces of invisible morality begin an encounter with the troops of fashion and folly the world and the flesh as we have just said generally have the best of it  it may be very shocking and dreadful to get money by cheating and lying but when the money thus got is put into the forms of yachts operas pictures statues and splendid entertainments of which you are freely offered a share if you will only cultivate the acquaintance of a sharper will you not then begin to say everybody is going why not i as to countenancing dives why he is countenanced and my holding out does no good what is the use of my sitting in my corner and sulking nobody minds me thus dives gains one after another to follow his chariot and make up his court  our friend john simply by being a loving indulgent husband had come into the position in some measure of demoralizing the public conscience of bringing in luxury and extravagance and countenancing people who really ought not to be countenanced he had a sort of uneasy perception of this fact yet at each particular step he seemed to himself to be doing no more than was right or reasonable it was a fact that through all springdale people were beginning to be uneasy and uncomfortable in houses that used to seem to them nice enough and ashamed of a style of dress and entertainment and living that used to content them perfectly simply because of the changes of style and living in the johnseymour mansion  of old the seymour family had always been a bulwark on the side of a temperate selfrestraint and reticence in worldly indulgence of a kind that parents find most useful to strengthen their hands when children are urging them on to expenses beyond their means for they could say the seymours are richer than we are and you see they dont change their carpets nor get new sofas nor give extravagant parties and they give simple reasonable quiet entertainments and do not go into any modern follies so the seymours kept up the fergusons and the fergusons the seymours and the wilcoxes and the lennoxes encouraged each other in a style of quiet reasonable living saving money for charity and time for reading and selfcultivation and by moderation and simplicity keeping up the courage of less wealthy neighbors to hold their own with them  the johnseymour party therefore was like the bursting of a great dam which floods a whole region there was not a family who had not some trouble with the inundation even where like rose and letitia ferguson they swept it out merrily and thought no more of it  it was all very pretty and pleasant and im glad it went off so well said rose ferguson the next day but i have not the smallest desire to repeat any thing of the kind we who live in the country and have such a world of beautiful things around us every day and so many charming engagements in riding walking and rambling and so much to do cannot afford to go into this sort of thing we really have not time for it  that pretty creature said mrs ferguson speaking of lillie is really a charming object i hope she will settle down now to domestic life she will soon find better things to care for i trust a baby would be her best teacher i am sure i hope she will have one  a baby is mammas infallible recipe for strengthening the character said rose laughing  well as the saying is they bring love with them said mrs ferguson and love always brings wisdom     chapter xvii   after the battle  well grace the follingsbees are gone at last i am thankful to say said john as he stretched himself out on the sofa in graces parlor with a sigh of relief if ever i am caught in such a scrape again i shall know it  yes it is all well over said grace  over i wish you would look at the bills why gracie i had not the least idea when i gave lillie leave to get what she chose what it would come to with those people at her elbow to put things into her head i could not interfere you know after the thing was started and i thought i would not spoil lillies pleasure especially as i had to stand firm in not allowing wine it was well i did for if wine had been given and taken with the reckless freedom that all the rest was it might have ended in a general riot  as some of the great fashionable parties do where young women get merry with champagne and young men get drunk said grace  well said john i dont exactly like the whole turn of the way things have been going at our house lately i dont like the influence of it on others it is not in the line of the life i want to lead and that we have all been trying to lead  well said gracie things will be settled now quietly i hope  i say said john could not we start our little reading sociables that were so pleasant last year you know we want to keep some little pleasant thing going and draw lillie in with us when a girl has been used to lively society she cant come down to mere nothing and i am afraid she will be wanting to rush off to new york and visit the follingsbees  well said grace letitia and rose were speaking the other day of that and wanting to begin you know we were to read froude together as soon as the evenings got a little longer  oh yes that will be capital said john  do you think lillie will be interested in froude asked grace  i really cant say said john with some doubting of heart perhaps it would be well to begin with something a little lighter at first  any thing you please john what shall it be  but i dont want to hold you all back on my account said john  well then again john theres our old studyclub the fergusons and mr mathews were talking it over the other night and wondering when you would be ready to join us we were going to take up leckys history of morals and have our sessions tuesday eveningsone tuesday at their house and the other at mine you know  i should enjoy that of all things said john but i know it is of no use to ask lillie it would only be the most dreadful bore to her  and you couldnt come without her of course said grace  of course not that would be too cruel to leave the poor little thing at home alone  lillie strikes me as being naturally clever said grace if she only would bring her mind to enter into your tastes a little im sure you would find her capable  but gracie youve no conception how very different her sphere of thought is how entirely out of the line of our ways of thinking ill tell you said john dont wait for me you have your tuesdays and go on with your lecky and i will keep a copy at home and read up with you and i will bring lillie in the evening after the reading is over and we will have a little music and lively talk and a dance or charade you know then perhaps her mind will wake up by degrees  sceneafter tea in the seymour parlor john at a table reading lillie in a corner embroidering  lillie look here john i want to ask you something  johnputting down his book and crossing to her well dear  lillie there would you make a green leaf there or a brown one  johnendeavoring to look wise well a brown one  lillie thats just like you john now dont you see that a brown one would just spoil the effect  oh would it said john innocently well what did you ask me for  why you tiresome creature i wanted you to say something what are you sitting moping over a book for you dont entertain me a bit  dear lillie i have been talking about every thing i could think of said john apologetically  well i want you to keep on talking and put up that great heavy book what is it any way  leckys history of morals said john  how dreadful do you really mean to read it  certainly we are all reading it  who all  why gracie and letitia and rose ferguson  rose ferguson i dont believe it why rose isnt twenty yet she cannot care about such stuff  she does care and enjoys it too said john eagerly  it is a pity then you didnt get her for a wife instead of me said lillie in a tone of pique  now this sort of thing does well enough occasionally said by a pretty woman perfectly sure of her ground in the early days of the honeymoon but for steady domestic diet is not to be recommended husbands get tired of swearing allegiance over and over and john returned to his book quietly without reply he did not like the suggestion and he thought that it was in very poor taste lillie embroidered in silence a few minutes and then threw down her work pettishly  how close this room is  john read on  john do open the door  john rose opened the door and returned to his book  now theres that draft from the hallwindow john youll have to shut the door  john shut it and read on  oh dear me said lillie throwing herself down with a portentous yawn i do think this is dreadful  what is dreadful said john looking up  it is dreadful to be buried alive here in this gloomy town of springdale where there is nothing to see and nowhere to go and nothing going on  we have always flattered ourselves that springdale was a most attractive place said john i dont know of any place where there are more beautiful walks and rambles  but i detest walking in the country what is there to see and you get your shoes muddy and burrs on your clothes and dont meet a creature i got so tired the other day when grace and rose ferguson would drag me off to what they call the glen they kept ohing and ahing and exclaiming to each other about some stupid thing every step of the wayold pokey nutgalls bare twigs of trees and red and yellow leaves and ferns i do wish you could have seen the armful of trash that those two girls carried into their respective houses i would not have such stuff in mine for any thing i am tired of all this talk about nature i am free to confess that i dont like nature and do like art and i wish we only lived in new york where there is something to amuse one  illustration but i detest walking in the country  well lillie dear i am sorry but we dont live in new york and are not likely to said john  why cant we mrs follingsbee said that a man in your profession and with your talents could command a fortune in new york  if it would give me the mines of golconda i would not go there said john  how stupid of you you know you would though  no lillie i would not leave springdale for any money  that is because you think of nobody but yourself said lillie men are always selfish  on the contrary it is because i have so many here depending on me of whom i am bound to think more than myself said john  that dreadful missionwork of yours i suppose said lillie that always stands in the way of having a good time  lillie said john shutting his book and looking at her what is your ideal of a good time  why having something amusing going on all the timesomething bright and lively to keep one in good spirits said lillie  i thought that you would have enough of that with your party and all said john  well now its all over and duller than ever said lillie i think a little spirt of gayety makes it seem duller by contrast  yet lillie said john you see there are women who live right here in springdale who are all the time busy interested and happy with only such sources of enjoyment as are to be found here their time does not hang heavy on their hands in fact it is too short for all they wish to do  they are different from me said lillie  then since you must live here said john could you not learn to be like them could you not acquire some of these tastes that make simple country life agreeable  no i cant i never could said lillie pettishly  then said john i dont see that anybody can help your being unhappy and opening his book he sat down and began to read  lillie pouted awhile and then drew from under the sofapillow a copy of indiana and establishing her feet on the fender she began to read  lillie had acquired at school the doubtful talent of reading french with facility and was soon deep in the fascinating pages whose theme is the usual one of french novelsa young wife tired of domestic monotony with an unappreciative husband solacing herself with the devotion of a lover lillie felt a sort of pique with her husband he was evidently unappreciative he was thinking of all sorts of things more than of her and growing stupid as husbands in french romances generally do she thought of her handsome cousin harry the only man that she ever came anywhere near being in love with and the image of his dark handsome eyes and glossy curls gave a sort of piquancy to the story  john got deeply interested in his book and looking up from time to time was relieved to find that lillie had something to employ her  i may as well make a beginning he said to himself i must have my time for reading and she must learn to amuse herself  after a while however he peeped over her shoulder  why darling he said where did you get that  it is mrs follingsbees said lillie  dear it is a bad book said john dont read it  it amuses me and helps pass away time said lillie and i dont think it is bad it is beautiful besides you read what amuses you and it is a pity if i cant read what amuses me  i am glad to see you like to read french continued john and i can get you some delightful french stories which are not only pretty and witty but have nothing in them that tend to pull down ones moral principles edmond abouts mariages de paris and tolla are charming french things and as he says they might be read aloud by a man between his mother and his sister without a shade of offence  thank you sir said mrs lillie you had better go to rose ferguson and get her to give you a list of the kinds of books she prefers  lillie said john severely your remarks about rose are in bad taste i must beg you to discontinue them there are subjects that never ought to be jested about  thank you sir for your moral lessons said lillie turning her back on him defiantly putting her feet on the fender and going on with her reading  john seated himself and went on with his book in silence  now this mode of passing a domestic evening is certainly not agreeable to either party but we sustain the thesis that in this sort of interior warfare the woman has generally the best of it when it comes to the science of annoyance commend us to the lovely sex their methods have a finesse a suppleness a universal adaptability that does them infinite credit and man with all his strength and all his majesty and his commanding talent is about as well off as a buffalo or a bison against a tiny rainbowwinged gnat or mosquito who bites sings and stings everywhere at once with an infinite grace and facility  a woman without magnanimity without generosity who has no love and whom a man loves is a terrible antagonist to give up or to fight often seems equally impossible  how is a man going to make a woman have a good time who is determined not to have it lillie had sense enough to see that if she settled down into enjoyment of the little agreeablenesses and domesticities of the winter society in springdale she should lose her battle and john would keep her there for life the only way was to keep him as uncomfortable as possible without really breaking her power over him  in the longrun in these encounters of will the woman has every advantage the constant dropping that wears away the stone has passed into a proverb  lillie meant to go to new york and have a long campaign at the follingsbees the thing had been all promised and arranged between them and it was necessary that she should appear sufficiently miserable and that john should be made sufficiently uncomfortable to consent with effusion at last when her intentions were announced  these purposes were not distinctly stated to herself for as we have before intimated uncultivated natures who have never thought for a serious moment on selfeducation or the way their character is forming act purely from a sort of instinct and do not even in their own minds fairly and squarely face their own motives and purposes if they only did their good angel would wear a less dejected look than he generally must  lillie had power enough in that small circle to stop and interrupt almost all its comfortable literary culture the reading of froude was given up john could not go to the study club and after an evening or two of trying to read up at home he used to stay an hour later at his office lillie would go with him on tuesday evening after the readings were over and then it was understood that all parties were to devote themselves to making the evening pass agreeable to her she was to be put forward kept in the foreground and every thing arranged to make her appear the queen of the fête they had tableaux where rose made lillie into marvellous pictures which all admired and praised they had little dances which lillie thought rather stupid and humdrum because they were not en grande toilette yet lillie always made a great merit of putting up with her life at springdale a pleasant english writer has a lively paper on the advantages of being a cantankerous fool in which he goes to show that men or women of inferior moral parts little selfcontrol and great selfishness often acquire an absolute dominion over the circle in which they move merely by the exercise of these traits every one being anxious to please and pacify them and keep the peace with them there is a constant succession of anxious compliances and compromises going on around them by all of which they are benefited in getting their own will and way  the one person who will not give up and cannot be expected to be considerate or accommodating comes at last to rule the whole circle he is counted on like the fixed facts of nature everybody else must turn out for him so lillie reigned in springdale in every little social gathering where she appeared the one uneasy question was would she have a good time and anxious provision made to that end lillie had declared that reading aloud was a bore which was definitive against readingparties she liked to play and sing so that was always a part of the programme lillie sang well but needed a great deal of urging her throat was apt to be sore and she took pains to say that the harsh winter weather in springdale was ruining her voice a good part of an evening was often spent in supplications before she could be induced to make the endeavor  lillie had taken up the whim of being jealous of rose jealousy is said to be a sign of love we hold another theory and consider it more properly a sign of selfishness look at noblehearted unselfish women and ask if they are easily made jealous look again at a woman who in her whole life shows no disposition to deny herself for her husband or to enter into his tastes and views and feelings are not such as she the most frequently jealous  her husband in her view is a piece of her property every look word and thought which he gives to any body or thing else is a part of her private possessions unjustly withheld from her  independently of that lillie felt the instinctive jealousy which a passée queen of beauty sometimes has for a young rival  she had eyes to see that rose was daily growing more and more beautiful and not all that young girls considerateness her selfforgetfulness her persistent endeavors to put lillie forward and make her the queen of the hour could disguise this fact lillie was a keensighted little body and saw at a glance that once launched into society together rose would carry the day all the more that no thought of any day to be carried was in her head  rose ferguson had one source of attraction which is as great a natural gift as beauty and which when it is found with beauty makes it perfectly irresistible to wit perfect unconsciousness of self this is a wholly different trait from unselfishness it is not a moral virtue attained by voluntary effort but a constitutional gift and a very great one fénelon praises it as a christian grace under the name of simplicity but we incline to consider it only as an advantage of natural organization there are many excellent christians who are haunted by themselves and in some form or other are always busy with themselves either conscientiously pondering the right and wrong of their actions or approbatively sensitive to the opinions of others or aesthetically comparing their appearance and manners with an interior standard while there are others who have received the gift beyond the artists eye or the musicians ear of perfect selfforgetfulness their religion lacks the element of conflict and comes to them by simple impulse    glad souls without reproach or blot   who do his will and know it not  rose had a frank open joyousness of nature that shed around her a healthy charm like fine breezy weather or a bright morning making every one feel as if to be good were the most natural thing in the world she seemed to be thinking always and directly of matters in hand of things to be done and subjects under discussion as much as if she were an impersonal being  she had been educated with every solid advantage which old boston can give to her nicest girls and that is saying a good deal returning to a country home at an early age she had been made the companion of her father entering into all his literary tastes and receiving constantly from association with him that manly influence which a womans mind needs to develop its completeness living the whole year in the country the fergusons developed within themselves a multiplicity of resources they read and studied and discussed subjects with their father for as we all know the discussion of moral and social questions has been from the first and always will be a prime source of amusement in newengland families and many of them keep up with great spirit a family debating society in which whoever hath a psalm a doctrine or an interpretation has free course  rose had never been into fashionable life technically so called she had not been brought out there never had been a milestone set up to mark the place where her education was finished and so she had gone on unconsciouslystudying reading drawing and cultivating herself from year to year with her head and hands always so full of pleasurable schemes and plans that there really seemed to be no room for any thing else we have seen with what interest she cooperated with grace in the various good works of the factory village in which her father held shares where her activity found abundant scope and her beauty and grace of manner made her a sort of idol  rose had once or twice in her life been awakened to selfconsciousness by applicants rapping at the front door of her heart but she answered with such a kind frank earnest no i thank you sir as made friends of her lovers and she entered at once into pleasant relations with them her nature was so healthy and free from all morbid suggestion her yes and no so perfectly frank and positive that there seemed no possibility of any tragedy caused by her  why did not john fall in love with rose why did not he o most sapient senate of womanhood why did not your brother fall in love with that nice girl you know of who grew up with you all at his very elbow and was as everybody else could see just the proper person for him  well why didnt he there is the doctrine of election the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded john was some six years older than rose he had romped with her as a little girl drawn her on his sled picked up her hairpins and worn her tippet when they had skated together as girl and boy they had made each other christmas and new years presents all their lives and to say the truth loved each other honestly and truly nevertheless john fell in love with lillie and married her did you ever know a case like it     chapter xviii   a brick turns up  the snow had been all night falling silently over the long elm avenues of springdale  it was one of those soft moist dreamy snowfalls which come down in great loose feathers resting in magical frostwork on every tree shrub and plant and seeming to bring down with it the purity and peace of upper worlds  graces little cottage on elm street was imbosomed as newengland cottages are apt to be in a tangle of shrubbery evergreens syringas and lilacs which on such occasions become bowers of enchantment when the morning sun looks through them  grace came into her parlor which was cheery with the dazzling sunshine and running to the window began to examine anxiously the state of her various greeneries pausing from time to time to look out admiringly at the wonderful snowlandscape with its many tremulous tints of rose lilac and amethyst  the only thing wanting was some one to speak to about it and with a half sigh she thought of the good old times when john would come to her chamberdoor in the morning to get her out to look on scenes like this  positively she said to herself i must invite some one to visit me one wants a friend to help one enjoy solitude the stock of social life in springdale in fact was running low the lennoxes and the wilcoxes had gone to their boston homes and rose ferguson was visiting in new york and letitia found so much to do to supply her place to her father and mother that she had less time than usual to share with grace then again the elmstreet cottage was a walk of some considerable distance whereas when grace lived at the old homestead the fergusons were so near as to seem only one family and were dropping in at all hours of the day and evening  whom can i send for thought grace to herself and she ran over mentally in a moment the list of available friends and acquaintances reader perhaps you have never really estimated your friends till you have tried them by the question which of them you could ask to come and spend a week or fortnight with you alone in a countryhouse in the depth of winter such an invitation supposes great faith in your friend in yourself or in human nature  grace at the moment was unable to think of anybody whom she could call from the approaching festivities of holiday life in the cities to share her snow patmos with her so she opened a book for company and turned to where her dainty breakfasttable with its hot coffee and crisp rolls stood invitingly waiting for her before the cheerful open fire  at this moment she saw what she had not noticed before a letter lying on her breakfast plate grace took it up with an exclamation of surprise which however was heard only by her canary birds and her plants  years before when grace was in the first summer of her womanhood she had been very intimate with walter sydenham and thoroughly esteemed and liked him but as many another good girl has done about those days she had conceived it her duty not to think of marriage but to devote herself to making a home for her widowed father and her brother there was a certain romance of selfabnegation in this disposition of herself which was rather pleasant to grace and in which both the gentlemen concerned found great advantage as long as her father lived and john was unmarried and devoted to her she had never regretted it  sydenham had gone to seek his fortune in california he had begged to keep up intercourse by correspondence but grace was not one of those women who are willing to drain the heart of the man they refuse to marry by keeping up with him just that degree of intimacy which prevents his seeking another grace had meant her refusal to be final and had sincerely hoped that he would find happiness with some other woman and to that intent had rigorously denied herself and him a correspondence yet from time to time she had heard of him through an occasional letter to john or by a chance californian newspaper since johns marriage had so altered her course of life grace had thought of him more frequently and with some questionings as to the wisdom of her course  this letter was from him and we shall give our readers the benefit of it  dear graceyou must pardon me this beginningin the old style of other days for though many years have passed in which i have been trying to walk in your ways and keep all your commandments i have never yet been able to do as you directed and forget you and here i am beginning dear gracejust where i left off on a certain evening long long ago i wonder if you remember it as plainly as i do i am just the same fellow that i was then and there if you remember you admitted that were it not for other duties you might have considered my humble supplication i gathered that it would not have been impossible per se as metaphysicians say to look with favor on your humble servant  gracie i have been living i trust not unworthily of you your photograph has been with me round the worldin the miners tent on shipboard among scenes where barbarous men do congregate and everywhere it has been a presence to warn to comfort to command and if i have come out of many trials firmer better more established in right than before if i am more believing in religion and in every way grounded and settled in the way you would have meit has been your spiritual presence and your power over me that has done it besides that i may as well tell you i have never given up the hope that by and by you would see all this and in some hour give me a different answer  when therefore i learned of your fathers death and afterwards of johns marriage i thought it was time for me to return again i have come to new york and if you do not forbid shall come to springdale  will you be a little glad to see me gracie why not we are both alone now let us take hands and walk the same path together shall we  yours till death and after  walter sydenham  would she to say the truth the question as asked now had a very different air from the question as asked years before when full of life and hope and enthusiasm she had devoted herself to making an ideal home for her father and brother what other sympathy or communion she had asked herself then should she ever need than these friends so very dear and if she needed more there in the future was johns ideal wife who somehow always came before her in the likeness of rose ferguson and johns ideal children whom she was sure she should love and pet as if they were her own  and now here she was in a house all by herself coming down to her meals one after another without the excitement of a cheerful face opposite to her and with all possibility of confidential intercourse with her brother entirely cut off lillie in this matter acted with much grace and spirit the part of the dog in the manger and while she resolutely refused to enter into any of johns literary or intellectual tastes seemed to consider her wifely rights infringed upon by any other woman who would she would absolutely refuse to go up with her husband and spend an evening with grace alleging it was pokey and stupid and that they always got talking about things that she didnt care any thing about if then john went without her to spend the evening he was sure to be received on his return with a dead and gloomy silence more fearful sometimes than the most violent of objurgations that look of patient heartbroken woe those longdrawn sighs were a reception that he dreaded to say the truth a great deal more than a direct attack or any faultfinding to which he could have replied and so on the whole john made up his mind that the best thing he could do was to stay at home and rock the cradle of this fretful baby whose wisdomteeth were so hard to cut and so long in coming it was a pretty baby and when made the sole and undivided object of attention when every thing possible was done for it by everybody in the house condescended often to be very graceful and winning and playful and had numberless charming little ways and tricks the difference between lillie in good humor and lillie in bad humor was a thing which john soon learned to appreciate as one of the most powerful forces in his life if you knew my dear reader that by pursuing a certain course you could bring upon yourself a drizzling dreary northeast rainstorm and by taking heed to your ways you could secure sunshine flowers and birdsinging you would be very careful after a while to keep about you the right atmospheric temperature and if going to see the very best friend you had on earth was sure to bring on a fit of rheumatism or toothache you would soon learn to be very sparing of your visits for this reason it was that grace saw very little of john that she never now had a sisterly conversation with him that she preferred arranging all those little business matters in which it would be convenient to have a masculine appeal solely and singly by herself the thing was never referred to in any conversation between them it was perfectly understood without words there are friends between whom and us has shut the coffinlid and there are others between whom and us stand sacred duties considerations never to be enough reverenced which forbid us to seek their society or to ask to lean on them either in joy or sorrow the whole thing as regards them must be postponed until the future life such had been graces conclusion with regard to her brother she well knew that any attempt to restore their former intimacy would only diminish and destroy what little chance of happiness yet remained to him and it may therefore be imagined with what changed eyes she read walter sydenhams letter from those of years ago  there was a sound of stamping feet at the front door and john came in all ruddy and snowpowdered but looking on the whole uncommonly cheerful  well gracie he said the fact is i shall have to let lillie go to new york for a week or two to see those follingsbees hang them but whats the matter gracie have you been crying or sitting up all night reading or what  the fact was that gracie had for once been indulging in a good cry rather pitying herself for her loneliness now that the offer of relief had come she laughed though and handing john her letter said  look here john heres a letter i have just had from walter sydenham  john broke out into a loud hilarious laugh  the blessed old brick said he has he turned up again  read the letter john said grace i dont know exactly how to answer it  john read the letter and seemed to grow more and more quiet as he read it then he came and stood by grace and stroked her hair gently  i wish gracie dear he said you had asked my advice about this matter years ago you loved walteri can see you did and you sent him off on my account it is just too bad of all the men i ever knew he was the one i should have been best pleased to have you marry  it was not wholly on your account john you know there was our father said grace  yes yes gracie but he would have preferred to see you well married he would not have been so selfish nor i either it is your selfabnegation you dear overgood women that makes us men seem selfish we should be as good as you are if you would give us the chance i think gracie though youre not aware of it there is a spice of pharisaism in the way in which you good girls allow us men to swallow you up without ever telling us what you are doing i often wondered about your intimacy with sydenham and why it never came to any thing and i can but half forgive you how selfish i must have seemed  oh no john indeed not  come you neednt put on these meek airs i insist upon it you have been feeling selfrighteous and abused said john laughing but alls well that ends well sit down now and write him a real sensible letter like a nice honest woman as you are  and say yes sir and thank you too said grace laughing  well something in that way said john you can fence it in with as many makebelieves as is proper and now gracie this is deuced lucky you see sydenham will be down here at once and it wouldnt be exactly the thing for you to receive him at this house and our only hotel is perfectly impracticable in winter and that brings me to what i am here about lillie is going to new york to spend the holidays and i wanted you to shut up and come up and keep house for us you see you have only one servant and we have four to be looked after you can bring your maid along and then i will invite walter to our house where he will have a clear field and you can settle all your matters between you  so lillie is going to the follingsbees said grace  yes she had a long desperately sentimental letter from mrs follingsbee urging imploring and entreating and setting forth all the splendors and glories of new york between you and me it strikes me that that mrs follingsbee is an affected goose but i couldnt say so to lillie by no manner of means she professes an untold amount of admiration and friendship for lillie and sets such brilliant prospects before her that i should be the most hardhearted old turk in existence if i were to raise any objections and in fact lillie is quite brilliant in anticipation and makes herself so delightful that i am almost sorry that i agreed to let her go  when shall you want me john  well this evening say and by the way couldnt you come up and see lillie a little while this morning she sent her love to you and said she was so hurried with packing and all that that she wanted you to excuse her not calling  oh yes ill come said grace goodnaturedly as soon as i have had time to put things in a little order  and write your letter said john gayly as he went out dont forget that  grace did not forget the letter but we shall not indulge our readers with any peep over her shoulder only saying that though written with an abundance of precaution it was one with which walter sydenham was well satisfied  then she made her few arrangements in the housekeeping line called in her grand vizier and prime minister from the kitchen and held with her a counsel of ways and means put on her indiarubbers and polish boots and walked up through the deep snowdrifts to the springdale postoffice where she dropped the fateful letter with a good heart on the whole and then she went on to johns the old home to offer any parting services to lillie that might be wanted  it is rather amusing in any family circle to see how some one member by dint of persistent exactions comes to receive always in all the exigencies of life an amount of attention and devotion which is never rendered back lillie never thought of such a thing as offering any services of any sort to grace grace might have packed her trunks to go to the moon or the pacific ocean quite alone for matter of any help lillie would ever have thought of if grace had headache or toothache or a bad cold lillie was always so sorry but it never occurred to her to go and sit with her to read to her or offer any of a hundred little sisterly offices when she was in similar case john always summoned grace to sit with lillie during the hours that his business necessarily took him from her it really seemed to be johns impression that a toothache or headache of lillies was something entirely different from the same thing with grace or any other person in the world and lillie fully shared the impression  grace found the little empress quite bewildered in her multiplicity of preparations and neglected details all of which had been deferred to the last day and rosa and anna and bridget in fact the whole staff were all busy in getting her off  so good of you to come gracie and if you would do this and wont you see to that and if you could just do the other and grace both could and would and did what no other pair of hands could in the same time john apologized for the lack of any dinner the fact is gracie bridget had to be getting up a lot of her things that were forgotten till the last moment and i told her not to mind we could do on a cold lunch bridget herself had become so wholly accustomed to the ways of her little mistress that it now seemed the most natural thing in the world that the whole house should be upset for her  but at last every thing was ready and packed the trunks and boxes shut and locked and the keys sorted and john and lillie were on their way to the station  i shall find out walter in new york and bring him back with me said john cheerily as he parted from grace in the hall i leave you to get things all to rights for us  it would not have been a very agreeable or cheerful piece of work to tidy the disordered house and take command of the domestic forces under any other circumstances but now grace found it a very nice diversion to prevent her thoughts from running too curiously on this future meeting after all she thought to herself he is just the same venturesome imprudent creature that he always was jumping to conclusions and insisting on seeing every thing in his own way how could he dare write me such a letter without seeing me ten years make great changes how could he be sure he would like me and she examined herself somewhat critically in the lookingglass  well she said he may thank me for it that we are not engaged and that he comes only as an old friend and perfectly free for all he has said to be nothing more unless on seeing each other we are so agreed i am so sorry the old place is all demolished and befrenchified it wont look natural to him and i am not the kind of person to harmonize with these cold polished glistening slippery surroundings that have no home life or association in them  but grace had to wake from these reflections to culinary counsels with bridget and to arrangements of apartments with rosa her own exacting carefulness followed the careless footsteps of the untrained handmaids and rearranged every plait and fold so that by nightfall the next day she was thoroughly tired  she beguiled the last moments while waiting for the coming of the cars in arranging her hair and putting on one of those wonderful parisian dresses which adapt themselves so precisely to the air of the wearer that they seem to be in themselves works of art then she stood with a fluttering color to see the carriage drive up to the door and the two get out of it  it is almost too bad to spy out such meetings and certainly one has no business to describe them but walter sydenham carried all before him by an old habit which he had of taking all and every thing for granted as from the first moment he did with grace he had no idea of hesitations or holdings off and would have none and met gracie as if they had parted only yesterday and as if her word to him always had been yes instead of no  in fact they had not been together five minutes before the whole life of youth returned to them boththat indestructible youth which belongs to warm hearts and buoyant spirits  such a merry evening as they had of it when john as the wood fire burned low on the hearth with some excuse of letters to write in his library left them alone together walter put on her finger a diamond ring saying  there gracie now when shall it be you see youve kept me waiting so long that i cant spare you much time i have an engagement to be in montreal the first of february and i couldnt think of going alone they have merry times there in midwinter and im sure it will be ever so much nicer for you than keeping house alone here  grace said of course that it was impossible but walter declared that doing the impossible was precisely in his line and pushed on his various advantages with such spirit and energy that when they parted for the night grace said she would think of it which promise at the breakfasttable next morning was interpreted by the unblushing walter and reported to john as a full consent before noon that day walter had walked up with john and grace to take a survey of the cottage and had given john indefinite power to engage workmen and artificers to rearrange and enlarge and beautify it for their return after the wedding journey for the rest of the visit all the three were busy with pencil and paper projecting balconies bowwindows pantries library and diningroom till the old cottage so blossomed out in imagination as to leave only a germ of its former self  walters visit brought back to john a deal of the warmth and freedom which he had not known since he married we often live under an insensible pressure of which we are made aware only by its removal john had been so much in the habit lately of watching to please lillie of measuring and checking his words or actions that he now bubbled over with a wild free delight in finding himself alone with grace and walter he laughed sang whistled skipped upstairs two at a time and scarcely dared to say even to himself why he was so happy he did not face himself with that question and went dutifully to the library at stated times to write to lillie and made much of her little letters     chapter xix   the castle of indolence  if john managed to be happy without lillie in springdale lillie managed to be blissful without him in new york  the bird let loose in eastern skies never hastened more fondly home than she to its glitter and gayety its life and motion dash and sensation she rustled in all her bravery of curls and frills pinkings and quillingsa marvellous specimen of parisian frostwork without one breath of reason or philosophy or conscience to melt it  the follingsbees house might stand for the original of the castle of indolence               halls where who can tell   what elegance and grandeur wide expand   the pride of turkey and of persias land   soft quilts on quilts on carpets carpets spread   and couches stretched around in seemly band   and endless pillows rise to prop the head   so that each spacious room was one full swelling bed  it was not without some considerable profit that mrs follingsbee had read balzac and dumas and had charlie ferrola for master of arts in her establishment the effect of the whole was perfect it transported one bodily back to the times of montespan and pompadour when life was all one glittering uppercrust and pretty women were never troubled with even the shadow of a duty  it was with a rebound of joyousness that lillie found herself once more with a crowded list of invitations calls operas dancing and shopping that kept her pretty little head in a perfect whirl of excitement and gave her not one moment for thought  mrs follingsbee to say the truth would have been a little careful about inviting a rival queen of beauty into the circle were it not that charlie ferrola after an attentive consideration of the subject had assured her that a goldenhaired blonde would form a most complete and effective tableau in contrast with her own dark rich style of beauty neither would lose by it so he said and the impression as they rode together in an elegant open barouche with ermine carriage robes would be stunning so they called each other ma soeur and drove out in the park in a ravishing little ponyphaeton all foamed over with ermine drawn by a lovely pair of creamcolored horses whose harness glittered with gold and silver after the fashion of the count of monte cristo in truth if dick follingsbee did not remind one of solomon in all particulars he was like him in one that he made silver and gold as the stones of the street in new york  lillies presence however was all desirable because it would draw the calls of two or three old new york families who had hitherto stood upon their dignity and refused to acknowledge the shoddy aristocracy the beautiful mrs john seymour therefore was no less useful than ornamental and advanced mrs follingsbees purposes in her excelsior movements  now i suppose said mrs follingsbee to lillie one day when they had been out making fashionable calls together we really must call on charlies wife just to keep her quiet  i thought you didnt like her said lillie  i dont i think she is dreadfully common said mrs follingsbee she is one of those women who cant talk any thing but baby and bores charlie half to death but then you know when there is a liaison like mine with charlie one cant be too careful to cultivate the wives les convenances you know are the allimportant things i send her presents constantly and send my carriage around to take her to church or opera or any thing that is going on and have her children at my fancy parties yet for all that the creature has not a particle of gratitude those narrowminded women never have you know i am very susceptible to peoples atmospheres and i always feel that that creature is just as full of spite and jealousy as she can stick in her skin  it will be remarked that this was one of those idiomatic phrases which got lodged in mrs follingsbees head in a less cultivated period of her life as a rusty needle sometimes hides in a cushion coming out unexpectedly when excitement gives it an honest squeeze  now i should think pursued mrs follingsbee that a woman who really loved her husband would be thankful to have him have such a rest from the disturbing family cares which smother a mans genius as a house like ours offers him how can the artistic nature exercise itself in the very grind of the thing when this child has a cold and the other the croup and there is fussing with mustardpaste and ipecac and paregoricall those realities you know why charlie tells me he feels a great deal more affection for his children when he is all calm and tranquil in the little boudoir at our house and he writes such lovely little poems about them i must show you some of them but this creature doesnt appreciate them a bit she has no poetry in her  well i must say i dont think i should have said lillie honestly i should be just as mad as i could be if john acted so  oh my dear the cases are different charlie has such peculiarities of genius the artistic nature you know requires soothing here they stopped and rang at the door of a neat little house and were ushered into a pair of those characteristic parlors which show that they have been arranged by a homeworshipper and a mother there were plants and birds and flowers and little genre pictures of children animals and household interiors arranged with a loving eye and hand  did you ever see any thing so perfectly characteristic said mrs follingsbee looking around her as if she were going to faint  this woman drives charlie perfectly wild because she has no appreciation of high art now i sent her photographs of michel angelos moses and night and morning and i really wish you would see where she hung themaway in yonder dark corner  i think myself they are enough to scare the owls said lillie after a moments contemplation  but my dear you know they are the thing said mrs follingsbee people never like such things at first and one must get used to high art before one forms a taste for it the thing with her is she has no docility she does not try to enter into charlies tastes  the woman with no docility entered at this momenta little snowdrop of a creature with a pale pure madonna face and that sad air of hopeless firmness which is seen unhappily in the faces of so many women  i had to bring baby down she said i have no nurse today and he has been threatened with croup  illustration i had to bring baby down  the dear little fellow said mrs follingsbee with officious graciousness so glad you brought him down come to his aunty she inquired lovingly as the little fellow shrank away and regarded her with round astonished eyes why will you not come to my next reception mrs ferrola she added you make yourself quite a stranger to us you ought to give yourself some variety  the fact is mrs follingsbee said mrs ferrola receptions in new york generally begin about my bedtime and if i should spend the night out i should have no strength to give to my children the next day  but my dear you ought to have some amusement  my children amuse me if you will believe it said mrs ferrola with a remarkably quiet smile  mrs follingsbee was not quite sure whether this was meant to be sarcastic or not she answered however well your husband will come at all events  you may be quite sure of that said mrs ferrola with the same quietness  well said mrs follingsbee rising with patronizing cheerfulness delighted to see you doing so well and if it is pleasant i will send the carriage round to take you a drive in the park this afternoon goodmorning  and like a rustling cloud of silks and satins and perfumes she bent down and kissed the baby and swept from the apartment  mrs ferrola with a movement that seemed involuntary wiped the babys cheek with her handkerchief and folding it closer to her bosom looked up as if asking patience where patience is to be found for the asking  there i didnt i tell you said mrs follingsbee when she came out just one of those provoking meek obstinate impracticable creatures with no adaptation in her  oh gracious me said lillie i cant imagine more dire despair than to sit all day tending baby  well so you would think and charlie has offered to hire competent nurses and wants her to dress herself up and go into society and she just wont do it and sticks right down by the cradle there with her children running over her like so many squirrels  oh i hope and trust i never shall have children said lillie fervently because you see theres an end of every thing no more fun no more frolics no more admiration or good times nothing but this frightful baby that you cant get rid of  yet as lillie spoke she knew in her own slippery little heart that the shadow of this awful cloud of maternity was resting over her though she laced and danced and bid defiance to every law of nature with a blind and ignorant wilfulness not caring what consequences she might draw down on herself if only she might escape this  and was there then no soft spot in this womans heart anywhere generally it is thought that the throb of the childs heart awakens a heart in the mother and that the mother is born again with her child it is so with unperverted nature as god meant it to be and you shall hear from the lips of an irish washerwoman a genuine poetry of maternal feeling for the little one who comes to make her toil more toilsome that is wholly withered away out of luxurious circles where there is every thing to make life easy just as the chinese have contrived fashionable monsters where human beings are constrained to grow in the shape of flowerpots so fashionable life contrives at last to grow a woman who hates babies and will risk her life to be rid of the crowning glory of womanhood  there was a time in lillies life when she was sixteen years of age which was a turningpoint with her and decided that she should be the heartless woman she was if at that age and at that time she had decided to marry the man she really loved marriage might indeed have proved to her a sacrament it might have opened to her a door through which she could have passed out from a career of selfish worldliness into that gradual discipline of unselfishness which a true lovemarriage brings  but she did not the man was poor and she was beautiful her beauty would buy wealth and worldly position and so she cast him off yet partly to gratify her own lingering feeling and partly because she could not wholly renounce what had once been hers she kept up for years with him just that illusive simulacrum which such women call friendship which while constantly denying constantly takes pains to attract and drains the heart of all possibility of loving another  harry endicott was a young man of fine capabilities sensitive interesting handsome full of generous impulses whom a good woman might easily have led to a full completeness he was not really lillies cousin but the cousin of her mother yet under the name of cousin he had constant access and family intimacy  this winter harry endicott suddenly returned to the fashionable circles of new yorkreturned from a successful career in india with an ample fortune he was handsomer than ever took stylish bachelor lodgings set up a most distracting turnout and became a sort of marquis of farintosh in fashionable circles was ever any thing so lucky or so unlucky for our lillielucky if life really does run on the basis of french novels and if all that is needed is the sparkle and stimulus of new emotions unlucky nay even gravely terrible if life really is established on a basis of moral responsibility and dogged by the fatal necessity that whatsoever man or woman soweth that shall he or she also reap  in the most critical hour of her youth when love was sent to her heart like an angel to beguile her from selfishness and make selfdenial easy lillies pretty little right hand had sowed to the world and the flesh and of that sowing she was now to reap all the disquiets the vexations the tremors that go to fill the pages of french novelsrecords of women who marry where they cannot love to serve the purposes of selfishness and ambition and then make up for it by loving where they cannot marry if all the women in america who have practised and are practising this species of moral agriculture should stand forth together it would be seen that it is not for nothing that france has been called the society educator of the world  the apartments of the follingsbee mansion with their dreamy voluptuousness were eminently adapted to be the background and scenery of a dramatic performance of this kind there were vistas of drawingrooms with delicious boudoirs like side chapels in a temple of venus with handsome charlie ferrola gliding in and out or lecturing dreamily from the corner of some sofa on the last most important crinkle of the artistic roseleaf demonstrating conclusively that beauty was the only true morality and that there was no sin but bad taste and that nobody knew what good taste was but himself and his clique there was the discussion far from edifying of modern improved theories of society seen from an improved philosophic point of view of all the peculiar wants and needs of etherealized beings who have been refined and cultivated till it is the most difficult problem in the world to keep them comfortable while there still remains the most imperative necessity that they should be made happy though the whole universe were to be torn down and made over to effect it  the idea of not being happy and in all respects as blissful as they could possibly be made was one always assumed by the follingsbee clique as an injustice to be wrestled with anybody that did not affect them agreeably that jarred on their nerves or interrupted the delicious reveries of existence with the sharp sawsetting of commonplace realities in their view ought to be got rid of summarily whether that somebody were husband or wife parent or child  natures that affected each other pleasantly were to spring together like dewdrops and sail off on rosy clouds with each other to the land of dojustasyouhaveamindto  the only thing never to be enough regretted which prevented this immediate and blissful union of particles was the impossibility of living on rosy clouds and making them the means of conveyance to the desirable country before mentioned many of the fair illuminatae who were quite willing to go off with a kindred spirit were withheld by the necessities of infinite pairs of french kid gloves and gallons of colognewater and indispensable clouds of mechlin and point lace which were necessary to keep around them the poetry of existence  although it was well understood among them that the religion of the emotions is the only true religion and that nothing is holy that you do not feel exactly like doing and every thing is holy that you do still these fair confessors lacked the pluck of primitive christians and could not think of taking joyfully the spoiling of their goods even for the sake of a kindred spirit hence the necessity of living in deplored marriagebonds with husbands who could pay rent and taxes and stand responsible for unlimited bills at stewarts and tiffanys hence the philosophy which allowed the possession of the body to one man and of the soul to another which one may see treated of at large in any writings of the day  as yet lillie had been kept intact from all this sort of thing by the hard brilliant enamel of selfishness that little shrewd gritty common sense which enabled her to see directly through other peoples illusions has if we mistake not by this time revealed itself to our readers as an element in her mind but now there is to come a decided thrust at the heart of her womanhood and we shall see whether the paralysis is complete or whether the woman is alive  if lillie had loved harry endicott poor had loved him so much that at one time she had seriously balanced the possibility of going to housekeeping in a little unfashionable house and having only one girl and hand in hand with him walking the paths of economy selfdenial and prudencethe reader will see that harry endicott rich harry endicott enthroned in fashionable success harry endicott plus fast horses splendid equipages a fine city house and a country house on the hudson was something still more dangerous to her imagination  but more than this was the stimulus of harry endicott out of her power and beyond the sphere of her charms she had a feverish desire to see him but he never called forthwith she had a confidential conversation with her bosom friend who entered into the situation with enthusiasm and invited him to her receptions but he didnt come  the fact was that harry endicott hated lillie now with that kind of hatred which is love turned wrongside out he hated her for the misery she had caused him and was in some danger of feeling it incumbent on himself to go to the devil in a wholly unnecessary manner on that account  he had read the story of monte cristo with its highly wrought plot of vengeance and had determined to avenge himself on the woman who had so tortured him and to make her feel if possible what he had felt  so when he had discovered the hours of driving observed by mrs follingsbee and lillie in the park he took pains from time to time to meet them face to face and to pass lillie with an unrecognizing stare then he dashed in among mrs follingsbees circle making himself everywhere talked of till they were beset on all hands by the inquiry dont you know young endicott why i should think you would want to have him visit here  after this had been played far enough he suddenly showed himself one evening at mrs follingsbees and apologized in an offhand manner to lillie when reminded of passing her in the park that really he wasnt thinking of meeting her and didnt recognize her she was so altered it had been so many years since they had met c all in a tone of cool and heartless civility every word of which was a daggers thrust not only into her vanity but into the poor little bit of a real heart which fashionable life had left to lillie  every evening after he had gone came a long confidential conversation with mrs follingsbee in which every word and look was discussed and turned and all possible or probable inferences therefrom reported after which lillie often laid a sleepless head on a hot and tumbled pillow poor miserable child suffering her punishment without even the grace to know whence it came or what it meant hitherto lillie had been walking only in the limits of that kind of permitted wickedness which although certainly the remotest thing possible from the christianity of christ finds a great deal of tolerance and patronage among communicants of the altar she had lived a gay vain selfpleasing life with no object or purpose but the simple one to get each day as much pleasurable enjoyment out of existence as possible mental and physical indolence and inordinate vanity had been the keynotes of her life she hated every thing that required protracted thought or that made trouble and she longed for excitement the passion for praise and admiration had become to her like the passion of the opiumeater for his drug or of the brandydrinker for his dram but now she was heedlessly steering to what might prove a more palpable sin  harry the serf once half despised for his slavish devotion now stood before her proud and free and tantalized her by the display he made of his indifference and preference for others she put forth every art and effort to recapture him but the most dreadful stroke of fate of all was that rose ferguson had come to new york to make a winter visit and was much talked of in certain circles where harry was quite intimate and he professed himself indeed an ardent admirer at her shrine     chapter xx   the van astrachans  the van astrachans a proud rich old family who took a certain defined position in newyork life on account of some ancestral passages in their family history had invited rose to spend a month or two with them and she was therefore moving as a star in a very high orbit  now these van astrachans were one of those cold glittering inaccessible pinnacles in mrs follingsbees fashionable alpclimbing which she would spare no expense to reach if possible it was one of the families for whose sake she had mrs john seymour under her roof and the advent of rose whom she was pleased to style one of mrs seymours most intimate friends was an unhopedfor stroke of good luck because there was the necessity of calling on rose of taking her out to drive in the park and of making a party on her account from which of course the van astrachans could not stay away  it will be seen here that our friend mrs follingsbee like all ladies whose watchword is excelsior had a peculiar difficult and slippery path to climb  the van astrachans were good old dutchreformed christians unquestioning believers in the bible in general and the ten commandments in particularpersons whose moral constitutions had been nourished on the great stocky beefsteaks and sirloins of plain old truths which go to form english and dutch nature theirs was a style of character which rendered them utterly hopeless of comprehending the etherealized species of holiness which obtained in the innermost circles of the follingsbee illuminati mr van astrachan buttoned under his coat not only many solid inches of what carlyle calls good christian fat but also a pocketbook through which millions of dollars were passing daily in an easy and comfortable flow to the great advantage of many of his fellowcreatures no less than himself and somehow or other he was pigheaded in the idea that the bible and the ten commandments had something to do with that stability of things which made this necessary flow easy and secure  he was slowmoulded accurate and fond of security and was of opinion that nineteen centuries of christianity ought to have settled a few questions so that they could be taken for granted and were not to be kept open for discussion  moreover mr van astrachan having read the accounts of the first french revolution and having remarked all the subsequent history of that country was confirmed in his idea that pitching every thing into pi once in fifty years was no way to get on in the affairs of this world  he had strong suspicions of every thing french and a mind very ill adapted to all those delicate reasonings and shadings and speculations of which mr charlie ferrola was particularly fond which made every thing in morals and religion an open question  he and his portly wife planted themselves like two canons of the sanctuary every sunday in the tiptop highestpriced pew of the most orthodox old church in new york and if the worthy man sometimes indulged in gentle slumbers in the highpadded walls of his slip it was because he was so well assured of the orthodoxy of his minister that he felt that no interest of society would suffer while he was off duty but may heaven grant us in these days of dissolving views and general undulation large armies of these solidplanted artillery on the walls of our zion  blessed be the people whose strength is to sit still much needed are they when the activity of free inquiry seems likely to chase us out of house and home and leave us like the dove in the deluge no rest for the sole of our foot  let us thank god for those dutchreformed churches great solid breakwaters that stand as the dykes in their ancestral holland to keep out the muddy waves of that sea whose waters cast up mire and dirt  but let us fancy with what quakings and shakings of heart mrs follingsbee must have sought the alliance of these tremendously solid old christians they were precisely what she wanted to give an air of solidity to the cobweb glitter of her state and we can also see how necessary it was that she should ostentatiously visit charlie ferfolas wife and speak of her as a darling creature her particular friend whom she was doing her very best to keep out of an early grave  charlie ferrola said that the van astrachans were obtuse and so to a certain degree they were in social matters they had a kind of confiding simplicity they were so much accustomed to regard positive morals in the light of immutable laws of nature that it would not have been easy to have made them understand that sliding scale of estimates which is in use nowadays they would probably have had but one word and that a very disagreeable one to designate a married woman who was in love with anybody but her husband consequently they were the very last people whom any gossip of this sort could ever reach or to whose ears it could have been made intelligible  mr van astrachan considered dick follingsbee a swindler whose proper place was the states prison and whose morals could only be mentioned with those of sodom and gomorrah  nevertheless as mrs follingsbee made it a point of rolling up her eyes and sighing deeply when his name was mentionedas she attended church on sunday with conspicuous faithfulness and subscribed to charitable societies and all manner of good worksas she had got appointed directress on the board of an orphan asylum where mrs van astrachan figured in association with her that good lady was led to look upon her with compassion as a worthy woman who was making the best of her way to heaven notwithstanding the opposition of a dissolute husband  as for rose she was as fresh and innocent and dewy in the hot whirl and glitter and glare of new york as a waving spray of sweetbrier brought in fresh with all the dew upon it  she really had for lillie a great deal of that kind of artistic admiration which nice young girls sometimes have for very beautiful women older than themselves and was like almost every one else somewhat bejuggled and taken in by that air of infantine sweetness and simplicity which had survived all the hot glitter of her life as if a rose fresh with dew should lie unwilted in the mouth of a furnace  moreover lillies face had a beauty this winter it had never worn the softness of a real feeling the pathos of real suffering at times touched her face with something that was always wanting in it before the bitter waters of sin that she would drink gave a strange feverish color to her cheek and the poisoned perfume she would inhale gave a strange new brightness to her eyes  rose sometimes looked on her and wondered so innocent and healthy and lighthearted in herself she could not even dream of what was passing she had been brought up to love john as a brother and opened her heart at once to his wife with a sweet and loyal faithfulness when she told mrs van astrachan that mrs john seymour was one of her friends from springdale married into a family with which she had grown up with great intimacy it seemed the most natural thing in the world to the good lady that rose should want to visit her that she should drive with her and call on her and receive her at their house and with her of course must come mrs follingsbee  mr van astrachan made a dead halt at the idea of dick follingsbee he never would receive that man under his roof he said and he never would enter his house and when mr van astrachan once said a thing of this kind as mr hosea biglow remarks a meetinghouse wasnt sotter  but then mrs follingsbees situation was confidentially stated to lillie and by lillie confidentially stated to rose and by rose to mrs van astrachan and it was made to appear how dick follingsbee had entirely abandoned his wife going off in the ways of balaam the son of bosor and all other bad ways mentioned in scripture habitually leaving poor mrs follingsbee to entertain company alone so that he was never seen at her parties and had nothing to do with her  so much the better for them remarked mr van astrachan  in that case my dear i dont see that it would do any harm for you to go to mrs follingsbees party on roses account i never go to parties as you know and i certainly should not begin by going there but still i see no objection to your taking rose  if mr van astrachan had seen objections you never would have caught mrs van astrachan going for she was one of your fullblooded women who never in her life engaged to do a thing she didnt mean to do and having promised in the marriage service to obey her husband she obeyed him plumb with the air of a person who is fulfilling the prophecies though her chances in this way were very small as mr van astrachan generally called her ma and obeyed all her orders with a stolid precision quite edifying to behold he took her advice always and was often heard naively to remark that mrs van astrachan and he were always of the same opinionan expression happily defining that state in which a man does just what his wife tells him to     chapter xxi   mrs follingsbees party and what came of it  our vulgar idea of a party is a week or fortnight of previous discomfort and chaotic tergiversation and the mistress of it all distracted and worn out with endless cares such a party bursts in on a wellordered family state as a bomb bursts into a city leaving confusion and disorder all around but it would be a pity if such a lifelong devotion to the arts and graces as mrs follingsbee had given backed by dick follingsbees fabulous fortune and administered by the exquisite charlie ferrola should not have brought forth some appreciable results one was that the great castle of indolence was prepared for the fête with no more ripple of disturbance than if it had been a nereids bower far down beneath the reach of tempests where the golden sand is never ruffled and the crimson and blue sea flowers never even dream of commotion  charlie ferrola wore it is true a brow somewhat oppressed with care and was kept tucked up on a rosecolored satin sofa and served with lachrymae christi and montefiascone and all other substitutes for the dews of hybla while he draughted designs for the floral arrangements which were executed by obsequious attendants in felt slippers and the whole process of arrangement proceeded like a dream of the lotuseaters paradise  madame de tullegig was of course retained primarily for the adornment of mrs follingsbees person it was understood however on this occasion that the composition of the costumes was to embrace both hers and lillies that they might appear in a contrasted tableau and bring out each others points it was a subject worthy a parisian artiste and drew so seriously on madame de tullegigs brainpower that she assured mrs follingsbee afterwards that the effort of composition had sensibly exhausted her  before we relate the events of that evening as they occurred we must give some little idea of the position in which the respective parties now stood  harry endicott by his mothers side was related to mrs van astrachan mr van astrachan had been in a certain way guardian to him and his success in making his fortune was in consequence of capital advanced and friendly patronage thus accorded in the family therefore he had the entrée of a son and had enjoyed the opportunity of seeing rose with a freedom and frequency that soon placed them on the footing of old acquaintanceship rose was an easy person to become acquainted with in an ordinary and superficial manner she was like those pellucid waters whose great clearness deceives the eye as to their depth her manners had an easy and gracious frankness and she spoke right on with an apparent simplicity and fearlessness that produced at first the impression that you knew all her heart a longer acquaintance however developed depths of reserved thought and feeling far beyond what at first appeared  harry at first had met her only on those superficial grounds of banter and badinage where a gay young gentleman and a gay young lady may reconnoitre before either side gives the other the smallest peep of the key of what dr holmes calls the sidedoor of their hearts  harry to say the truth was in a bad way when he first knew rose he was restless reckless bitter turned loose into society with an ample fortune and nothing to do he was in danger according to the homely couplet of dr watts of being provided with employment by that undescribable personage who makes it his business to look after idle hands  rose had attracted him first by her beauty all the more attractive to him because in a style entirely different from that which hitherto had captivated his imagination rose was tall wellknit and graceful and bore herself with a sort of slender but majestic lightness like a meadowlily her wellshaped classical head was set finely on her graceful neck and she had a staglike way of carrying it that impressed a stranger sometimes as haughty but rose could not help that it was a trick of nature her hair was of the glossiest black her skin fair as marble her nose a little nicelyturned aquiline affair her eyes of a deep violet blue and shadowed by long dark lashes her mouth a little larger than the classical proportion but generous in smiles and laughs which revealed perfect teeth of dazzling whiteness there gentlemen and ladies is rose fergusons picture and if you add to all this the most attractive impulsiveness and selfunconsciousness you will not wonder that harry endicott at first found himself admiring her and fancied driving out with her in the park and that when admiring eyes followed them both as a handsome pair harry was well pleased  rose too liked harry endicott a young girl of twenty is not a severe judge of a handsome lively young man who knows far more of the world than she does and though harrys conversation was a perfect catherinewheel of all sorts of wild talksneering bitter and sceptical and giving expression to the most heterodox sentiments with the evident intention of shocking respectable authoritiesrose rather liked him than otherwise though she now and then took the liberty to stand upon her dignity and opened her great blue eyes on him with a grave inquiring look of surprisea look that seemed to challenge him to stand and defend himself from time to time too she let fall little bits of independent opinion well poised and well turned that hit exactly where she meant they should and harry began to stand a little in awe of her  harry had never known a woman like rose a woman so poised and selfcentred so cultivated so capable of deep and just reflections and so religious his experience with women had not been fortunate as has been seen in this narrative and insensibly to himself rose was beginning to exercise an influence over him the sphere around her was cool and bright and wholesome as different from the hot atmosphere of passion and sentiment and flirtation to which he had been accustomed as a newengland summer morning from a sultry night in the tropics her power over him was in the appeal to a wholly different part of his natureintellect conscience and religious sensibility and once or twice he found himself speaking to her quietly seriously and rationally not from the purpose of pleasing her but because she had aroused such a strain of thought in his own mind there was a certain class of brilliant sayings of his of a cleverly irreligious and sceptical nature at which rose never laughed when this sort of firework was let off in her presence she opened her eyes upon him wide and blue with a calm surprise intermixed with pity but said nothing and after trying the experiment several times he gradually felt this silent kind of look a restraint upon him  at the same time it must not be conjectured that at present harry endicott was thinking of falling in love with rose in fact he scoffed at the idea of love and professed to disbelieve in its existence and beside all this he was gratifying an idle vanity and the wicked love of revenge in visiting lillie sometimes professing for days an exclusive devotion to her in which there was a little too much reality on both sides to be at all safe or innocent and then when he had wound her up to the point where even her involuntary looks and words and actions towards him must have compromised her in the eyes of others he would suddenly recede for days and devote himself exclusively to rose driving ostentatiously with her in the park where he would meet lillie face to face and bow triumphantly to her in passing all these proceedings talked over with mrs follingsbee seemed to give promise of the most impassioned french romance possible  rose walked through all her part in this little drama wrapped in a veil of sacred ignorance had she known the whole the probability is that she would have refused harrys acquaintance but like many another nice girl she tripped gayly near to pitfalls and chasms of which she had not the remotest conception  lillies want of selfcontrol and imprudent conduct had laid her open to reports in certain circles where such reports find easy credence but these were circles with which the van astrachans never mingled the only accidental point of contact was the intimacy of rose with the seymour family and rose was the last person to understand an allusion if she heard it the reading of rose had been carefully selected by her father and had not embraced any novels of the french romantic school neither had she like some modern young ladies made her mind a highway for the tramping of every kind of possible fictitious character which a novelist might choose to draw nor taken an interest in the dissections of morbid anatomy in fact she was oldfashioned enough to like scotts novels and though she was just the kind of girl thackeray would have loved she never could bring her fresh young heart to enjoy his pictures of worldworn and decaying natures  the idea of sentimental flirtations and lovemaking on the part of a married woman was one so beyond her conception of possibilities that it would have been very difficult to make her understand or believe it  on the occasion of the follingsbee party therefore rose accepted harry as an escort in simple good faith she was by no means so wise as not to have a deal of curiosity about it and not a little of dazed and dazzled sense of enjoyment in prospect of the perfect labyrinth of fairyland which the follingsbee mansion opened before her  on the eventful evening mrs follingsbee and lillie stood together to receive their gueststhe former in gold color with magnificent point lace and diamond tiara while lillie in heavenly blue with wreaths of misty tulle and pearl ornaments seemed like a filmy cloud by the setting sun  rose entering on harry endicotts arm in the full bravery of a wellchosen toilet caused a buzz of admiration which followed them through the rooms but rose was nothing to the illuminated eyes of mrs follingsbee compared with the portly form of mrs van astrachan entering beside her and spreading over her the wings of motherly protection that muchdesired matron serene in her point lace and diamonds beamed around her with an innocent kindliness shedding respectability wherever she moved as a certain russian prince was said to shed diamonds  illustration rose entering on harry endicotts arm  why that is mrs van astrachan  you dont tell me so is it possible  which where is she how in the world did she get here were the whispered remarks that followed her wherever she moved and mrs follingsbee looking after her could hardly suppress an exulting te deum it was done and couldnt be undone  mrs van astrachan might not appear again at a salon of hers for a year but that could not do away the patent fact witnessed by so many eyes that she had been there once just as a modern newspaper or magazine wants only one article of a celebrated author to announce him as among their stated contributors for all time and to flavor every subsequent issue of the journal with expectancy so mrs follingsbee exulted in the idea that this one evening would flavor all her receptions for the winter whether the good ladys diamonds ever appeared there again or not in her secret heart she always had the perception when striving to climb up on this kind of ladder that the time might come when she should be found out and she well knew the absolute and uncomprehending horror with which that good lady would regard the french principles and french practice of which charlie ferrola and co were the expositors and exemplars  this was what charlie ferrola meant when he said that the van astrachans were obtuse they never could be brought to the niceties of moral perspective which show one exactly where to find the vanishing point for every duty  be that as it may there at any rate she was safe and sound surrounded by people whom she had never met before and receiving introductions to the right and left with the utmost graciousness the arrangements for the evening had been made at the teatable of the van astrachans with an innocent and trustful simplicity  you know dear said mrs van astrachan to rose that i never like to stay long away from papa so the worthy lady called her husband and so if its just the same to you you shall let me have the carriage come for me early and then you and harry shall be left free to see it out i know young folks must be young she said with a comfortable laugh there was a time dear when my waist was not bigger than yours that i used to dance all night with the best of them but ive got bravely over that now  illustration the van astrachans  yes rose said mr van astrachan you maynt believe it but ma there was the spryest dancer of any of the girls you are pretty nice to look at but you dont quite come up to what she was in those days i tell you i wish you could have seen her said the good man warming to his subject why ive seen the time when every fellow on the floor was after her  papa says mrs van astrachan reprovingly i wouldnt say such things if i were you  yes i would said rose do tell us mr van astrachan  well ill tell you said mr van astrachan you ought to have seen her in a red dress she used to wear  oh come papa what nonsense rose i never wore a red dress in my life it was a pink silk but you know men never do know the names for colors  well at any rate said mr van astrachan hardily pink or red no matter but ill tell you she took all before her that evening there were stuyvesants and van rennselaers and livingstons and all sorts of grand fellows in her train but somehow i cut em out there is no such dancing nowadays as there was when wife and i were young ive been caught once or twice in one of their parties and i dont call it dancing i call it draggletailing they dont take any steps and there is no spirit in it  well said rose i know we moderns are very much to be pitied papa always tells me the same story about mamma and the days when he was young but dear mrs van astrachan i hope you wont stay a moment on my account after you get tired i suppose if you are just seen with me there in the beginning of the evening it will matronize me enough and then i have engaged to dance the german with mr endicott and i believe they keep that up till nobody knows when but i am determined to see the whole through  yes yes see it all through said mr van astrachan young people must be young its all right enough and you wont miss my polly after you get fairly into it near so much as i shall ill sit up for her till twelve oclock and read my paper  rose was at first to say the truth bewildered and surprised by the perfect labyrinth of fairyland which charlie ferrolas artistic imagination had created in the follingsbee mansion  initiated people who had travelled in europe said it put them in mind of the jardin mabille and those who had not were reminded of some of the wonders of the black crook there were apartments turned into bowers and grottoes where the gaslight shimmered behind veils of falling water and through pendant leaves of all sorts of strange waterplants of tropical regions there were all those wonderful leafplants of every weird device of color which have been conjured up by tricks of modern gardening as rappacini is said to have created his strange garden in padua there were beds of hyacinths and crocuses and tulips made to appear like living gems by the jets of gaslight which came up among them in glass flowers of the same form far away in recesses were sofas of soft green velvet turf overshadowed by trailing vines and illuminated with moonlightsoftness by hidden alabaster lamps the air was heavy with the perfume of flowers and the sound of music and dancing from the ballroom came to these recesses softened by distance  the follingsbee mansion occupied a whole square of the city and these enchanted bowers were created by temporary enlargements of the conservatory covering the ground of the garden with money and the croton waterworks and all the newyork greenhouses at disposal nothing was impossible  there was in this reception no vulgar rush or crush or jam the apartments opened were so extensive and the attractions in so many different directions that there did not appear to be a crowd anywhere  there was no general table set with the usual liabilities of rush and crush but four or five wellkept rooms fragrant with flowers and sparkling with silver and crystal were ready at any hour to minister to the guest whatever delicacy or dainty he or she might demand and lightfooted waiters circulated with noiseless obsequiousness through all the rooms proffering dainties on silver trays  mrs van astrachan and rose at first found themselves walking everywhere with a fresh and lively interest it was something quite out of the line of the good ladys previous experience and so different from any thing she had ever seen before as to keep her in a state of placid astonishment rose on the other hand was delighted and excited the more so that she could not help perceiving that she herself amid all these objects of beauty was followed by the admiring glances of many eyes  it is not to be supposed that a girl so handsome as rose comes to her twentieth year without having the pretty secret made known to her in more ways than one or that thus made known it is any thing but agreeable but on the present occasion there was a buzz of inquiry and a crowd of applicants about her and her dancinglist seemed in a fair way to be soon filled up for the evening harry telling her laughingly that he would let her off from every thing but the german but that she might consider her engagement with him as a standing one whenever troubled with an application which for any reason she did not wish to accept  harry assumed towards rose that air of brotherly guardianship which a young man who piques himself on having seen a good deal of the world likes to take with a pretty girl who knows less of it besides he rather valued himself on having brought to the reception the most brilliant girl of the evening  our friend lillie however was in her own way as entrancingly beautiful this evening as the most perfect mortal flesh and blood could be made and harry went back to her when rose went off with her partners as a moth flies to a candle not with any express intention of burning his wings but simply because he likes to be dazzled and likes the bitter excitement he felt now that he had power over hera bad a dangerous power he knew with what of conscience was left in him but he thought let her take her own risk and so many busy gossips saw the handsome young man his great dark eyes kindled with an evil light whirling in dizzy mazes with this cloud of flossy mist out of which looked up to him an impassioned womans face and eyes that said what those eyes had no right to say  there are times in such scenes of bewilderment when women are as truly out of their own control by nervous excitement as if they were intoxicated and lillies looks and words and actions towards harry were as open a declaration of her feelings as if she had spoken them aloud to every one present  the scandals about them were confirmed in the eyes of every one that looked on for there were plenty of people present in whose view of things the worst possible interpretation was the most probable one  rose was in the way during the course of the evening of hearing remarks of the most disagreeable and startling nature with regard to the relations of harry and lillie to each other they filled her with a sort of horror as if she had come to an unwholesome place while she indignantly repelled them from her thoughts as every uncontaminated woman will the first suspicion of the purity of a sister woman in roses view it was monstrous and impossible yet when she stood at one time in a group to see them waltzing she started and felt a cold shudder as a certain instinctive conviction of something not right forced itself on her she closed her eyes and wished herself away wished that she had not let mrs van astrachan go home without her wished that somebody would speak to lillie and caution her felt an indignant rising of her heart against harry and was provoked at herself that she was engaged to him for the german  she turned away and taking the arm of the gentleman with her complained of the heat as oppressive and they sauntered off together into the bowery region beyond  oh now where can i have left my fan she said suddenly stopping  let me go back and get it for you said he of the whiskers who attended her it was one of the dancing young men of new york and it is no particular matter what his name was  thank you said rose i believe i left it on the sofa in the yellow drawingroom he was gone in a moment  rose wandered on a little way through the labyrinth of flowers and shadowy trees and fountains and sat down on an artificial rock where she fell into a deep reverie rising to go back she missed her way and became quite lost and went on uneasily conscious that she had committed a rudeness in not waiting for her attendant  at this moment she looked through a distant alcove of shrubbery and saw harry and lillie standing togethershe with both hands laid upon his arm looking up to him and speaking rapidly with an imploring accent she saw him with an angry frown push lillie from him so rudely that she almost fell backward and sat down with her handkerchief to her eyes he came forward hurriedly and met the eyes of rose fixed upon him  illustration she saw him with an angry frown push lillie from him  mr endicott she said i have to ask a favor of you will you be so good as to excuse me from the german tonight and order my carriage  why miss ferguson what is the matter he said what has come over you i hope i have not had the misfortune to do any thing to displease you  without replying to this rose answered i feel very unwell my head is aching violently and i cannot go through the rest of the evening i must go home at once she spoke it in a decided tone that admitted of no question  without answer harry endicott gave her his arm accompanied her through the final leavetakings went with her to the carriage put her in and sprang in after her  rose sank back on her seat and remained perfectly silent and harry after a few remarks of his had failed to elicit a reply rode by her side equally silent through the streets homeward  he had mr van astrachans latchkey and when the carriage stopped he helped rose to alight and went up the steps of the house  miss ferguson he said abruptly i have something i want to say to you  not now not tonight said rose hurriedly i am too tired and it is too late  tomorrow then he said i shall call when you will have had time to be rested goodnight     chapter xxii   the spiderweb broken  harry did not go back to lead the german as he had been engaged to do in fact in his last apologies to mrs follingsbee he had excused himself on account of his partners sudden indispositionthing which made no small buzz and commotion though the missing gap like all gaps great and little in human society soon found somebody to step into it and the dance went on just as gayly as if they had been there  meanwhile there were in this good city of new york a couple of sleepless individuals revolving many things uneasily during the nightwatches or at least that portion of the nightwatches that remained after they reached hometo wit mr harry endicott and miss rose ferguson  what had taken place in that little scene between lillie and harry the termination of which was seen by rose we are not going to give a minute description the public has already been circumstantially instructed by such edifying books as cometh up as a flower and others of a like turn in what manner and in what terms married women can abdicate the dignity of their sex and degrade themselves so far as to offer their whole life and their whole selves to some reluctant man with too much remaining conscience or prudence to accept the sacrifice  it was from some such wild passionate utterances of lillie that harry felt a recoil of mingled conscience fear and that disgust which man feels when she whom god made to be sought degrades herself to seek there is no edification and no propriety in highly colored and minute drawing of such scenes of temptation and degradation though they are the stock and staple of some french novels and more disgusting english ones made on their model harry felt in his own conscience that he had been acting a most unworthy part that no advances on the part of lillie could excuse his conduct and his thoughts went back somewhat regretfully to the days long ago when she was a fair pretty innocent girl and he had loved her honestly and truly unperceived by himself the character of rose was exerting a powerful influence over him and when he met that look of pain and astonishment which he had seen in her large blue eyes the night before it seemed to awaken many things within him it is astonishing how blindly people sometimes go on as to the character of their own conduct till suddenly like a torch in a dark place the light of another persons opinion is thrown in upon them and they begin to judge themselves under the quickening influence of another persons moral magnetism then indeed it often happens that the graves give up their dead and that there is a sort of interior resurrection and judgment  harry did not seem to be consciously thinking of rose and yet the undertone of all that nights uneasiness was a something that had been roused and quickened in him by his acquaintance with her how he loathed himself for the last few weeks of his life how he loathed that hot lurid murky atmosphere of flirtation and passion and french sentimentality in which he had been livingatmosphere as hard to draw healthy breath in as the odor of wilting tuberoses the day after a party  harry valued roses good opinion as he had never valued it before and as he thought of her in his restless tossings she seemed to him something as pure as wholesome and strong as the air of his native newengland hills as the sweetbrier and sweetfern he used to love to gather when he was a boy she seemed of a piece with all the good old ways of new englandits household virtues its conscientious sense of right its exact moral boundaries and he felt somehow as if she belonged to that healthy portion of his life which he now looked back upon with something of regret  then what would she think of him they had been friends he said to himself they had passed over those boundaries of teasing unreality where most yoking gentlemen and young ladies are content to hold converse with each other and had talked together reasonably and seriously saying in some hours what they really thought and felt and rose had impressed him at times by her silence and reticence in certain connections and on certain subjects with a sense of something hidden and veileda reserved force that he longed still further to penetrate but now he said to himself he must have fallen in her opinion why was she so cold so almost haughty in her treatment of him the night before he felt in the atmosphere around her and in the touch of her hand that she was quivering like a galvanic battery with the suppressed force of some powerful emotion and his own conscience dimly interpreted to him what it might be  to say the truth rose was terribly aroused and there was a great deal in her to be aroused for she had a strong nature and the whole force of womanhood in her had never received such a shock  whatever may be scoffingly said of the readiness of women to pull one another down it is certain that the highest class of them have the feminine esprit de corps immensely strong the humiliation of another woman seems to them their own humiliation and mans lordly contempt for another woman seems like contempt of themselves  the deepest feeling roused in rose by the scenes which she saw last night was concern for the honor of womanhood and her indignation at first did not strike where we are told womans indignation does on the woman but on the man loving john seymour as a brother from her childhood feeling in the intimacy in which they had grown up as if their families had been one the thoughts that had been forced upon her of his wife the night before had struck to her heart with the weight of a terrible affliction she judged lillie as a pure woman generally judges anotherout of herselfand could not and would not believe that the gross and base construction which had been put upon her conduct was the true one she looked upon her as led astray by inordinate vanity and the hopeless levity of an undeveloped unreflecting habit of mind she was indignant with harry for the part that he had taken in the affair and indignant and vexed with herself for the degree of freedom and intimacy which she had been suffering to grow up between him and herself her first impulse was to break it off altogether and have nothing more to say to or do with him she felt as if she would like to take the short course which young girls sometimes take out of the first serious mortification or trouble in their life and run away from it altogether she would have liked to have packed her trunk taken her seat on board the cars and gone home to springdale the next day and forgotten all about the whole of it but then what should she say to mrs van astrachan what account could she give for the sudden breaking up of her visit  then there was harry going to call on her the next day what ought she to say to him on the whole it was a delicate matter for a young girl of twenty to manage alone how she longed to have the counsel of her sister or her mother she thought of mrs van astrachan but then again she did not wish to disturb that good ladys pleasant confidential relations with harry and tell tales of him out of school so on the whole she had a restless and uncomfortable night of it  mrs van astrachan expressed her surprise at seeing rose take her place at the breakfasttable the next morning dear me she said i was just telling jane to have some breakfast kept for you i had no idea of seeing you down at this time  but said rose i gave out entirely and came away only an hour after you did the fact is we country girls cant stand this sort of thing i had such a terrible headache and felt so tired and exhausted that i got mr endicott to bring me away before the german  bless me said mr van astrachan why youre not at all up to snuff why polly you and i used to stick it out till daylight didnt we  well you see mr van astrachan i hadnt anybody like you to stick it out with said rose perhaps that made the difference  oh well now i am sure theres our harry i am sure a girl must be difficult if he doesnt suit her for a beau said the good gentleman  oh mr endicott is all well enough said rose only you observe not precisely to me what you were to the lady you call pollythats all  ha ha laughed mr van astrachan well to be sure that does make a difference but harrys a nice fellow nice fellow miss rose not many fellows like him as i think  yes indeed chimed in mrs van astrachan i havent a son in the world that i think more of than i do of harry he has such a good heart  now the fact was this eulogistic strain that the worthy couple were very prone to fall into in speaking of harry to rose was this morning most especially annoying to her and she turned the subject at once by chattering so fluently and with such minute details of description about the arrangements of the rooms and the flowers and the lamps and the fountains and the cascades and all the fairyland wonders of the follingsbee party that the good pair found themselves constrained to be listeners during the rest of the time devoted to the morning meal  it will be found that good young ladies while of course they have all the innocence of the dove do display upon emergencies a considerable share of the wisdom of the serpent and on this same mother wit and wisdom rose called internally when that day about eleven oclock she was summoned to the library to give harry his audience  truth to say she was in a state of excited womanhood vastly becoming to her general appearance and entered the library with flushed cheeks and head erect like one prepared to stand for herself and for her sex  harry however wore a mortified semipenitential air that on the first glance rather mollified her still however she was not sufficiently clement to give him the least assistance in opening the conversation by the suggestions of any of those nice little oily nothings with which ladies when in a gracious mood can smooth the path for a difficult confession  she sat very quietly with her hands before her while harry walked tumultuously up and down the room  miss ferguson he said at last abruptly i know you are thinking ill of me  miss ferguson did not reply  i had hoped he said that there had been a little something more than mere acquaintance between us i had hoped you looked upon me as a friend  i did mr endicott said rose  and you do not now  i cannot say that she said after a pause but mr endicott if we are friends you must give me the liberty to speak plainly  thats exactly what i want you to do he said impetuously that is just what i wish  allow me to ask then if you are an early friend and family connection of mrs john seymour  i was an early friend and am somewhat of a family connection  that is i understand there has been a ground in your past history for you to be on a footing of a certain family intimacy with mrs seymour in that case mr endicott i think you ought to have considered yourself the guardian of her honor and reputation and not allowed her to be compromised on your account  the blood flushed into harrys face and he stood abashed and silent rose went on  i was shocked i was astonished last night because i could not help overhearing the most disagreeable the most painful remarks on you and herremarks most unjust i am quite sure but for which i fear you have given too much reason  miss ferguson said harry stopping as he walked up and down i confess i have been wrong and done wrong but if you knew all you might see how i have been led into it that woman has been the evil fate of my life years ago when we were both young i loved her as honestly as man could love a woman and she professed to love me in return but i was poor and she would not marry me she sent me off yet she would not let me forget her she would always write to me just enough to keep up hope and interest and she knew for years that all my object in striving for fortune was to win her at last when a lucky stroke made me suddenly rich and i came home to seek her i found her marriedmarried as she owns without lovemarried for wealth and ambition i dont justify myselfi dont pretend to but when she met me with her old smiles and her old charms and told me she loved me still it roused the very devil in me i wanted revenge i wanted to humble her and make her suffer all she had made me and i didnt care what came of it  harry spoke trembling with emotion and rose felt almost terrified with the storm she had raised  o mr endicott she said was this worthy of you was there nothing better higher more manly than this poor revenge you men are stronger than we you have the world in your hands you have a thousand resources where we have only one and you ought to be stronger and nobler according to your advantages you ought to rise superior to the temptations that beset a poor weak illeducated woman whom everybody has been flattering from her cradle and whom you i dare say have helped to flatter turning her head with compliments like all the rest of them come now is not there something in that  well i suppose said harry that when lillie and i were girl and boy together i did flatter her sincerely that is her beauty made a fool of me and i helped make a fool of her  and i dare say said rose you told her that all she was made for was to be charming and encouraged her to live the life of a butterfly or canarybird did you ever try to strengthen her principles to educate her mind to make her strong on the contrary havent you been bowing down and adoring her for being weak it seems to me that lillie is exactly the kind of woman that you men educate by the way you look on women and the way you treat them  harry sat in silence ruminating  now said rose it seems to me its the most cowardly and unmanly thing in the world for men with every advantage in their hands with all the strength that their kind of education gives them with all their opportunitiesa thousand to our oneto hunt down these poor little silly women whom society keeps stunted and dwarfed for their special amusement  miss ferguson you are very severe said harry his face flushing  well said rose you have this advantage mr endicott you know if i am the world will not be everybody will take your part everybody will smile on you and condemn her that is generous is it not i think after all noah claypole isnt so very uncommon a picture of the way that your lordly sex turn round and cast all the blame on ours you will never make me believe in a protracted flirtation between a gentleman and lady where at least half the blame does not lie on his lordships side i always said that a woman had no need to have offers made her by a man she could not love if she conducted herself properly and i think the same is true in regard to men but then as i said before you have the world on your side nine persons out of ten see no possible harm in a mans taking every advantage of a woman if she will let him  but i care more for the opinion of the tenth person than of the nine said harry i care more for what you think than any of them your words are severe but i think they are just  o mr endicott said rose live for something higher than for what i thinkthan for what any one thinks think how many glorious chances there are for a noble career for a young man with your fortune with your leisure with your influence is it for you to waste life in this unworthy way if i had your chances i would try to do something worth doing  roses face kindled with enthusiasm and harry looked at her with admiration  tell me what i ought to do he said  i cannot tell you said rose but where there is a will there is a way and if you have the will you will find the way but first you must try and repair the mischief you have done to lillie by your own account of the matter you have been encouraging and keeping up a sort of silly romantic excitement in her it is worse than silly it is sinful it is trifling with her best interests in this life and the life to come and i think you must know that if you had treated her like an honest plainspoken brother or cousin without any trumpery of gallantry or sentiment things would have never got to be as they are you could have prevented all this and you can put an end to it now  honestly i will try said harry i will begin by confessing my faults like a good boy and take the blame on myself where it belongs and try to make lillie see things like a good girl but she is in bad surroundings and if i were her husband i wouldnt let her stay there another day there are no morals in that circle its all a perfect crush of decaying garbage  i think said rose that if this thing goes no farther it will gradually die out even in that circle and in the better circles of new york i trust it will not be heard of mrs van astrachan and i will appear publicly with lillie and if she is seen with us and at this house it will be sufficient to contradict a dozen slanders she has the noblest kindest husbandone of the best men and truest gentlemen i ever knew  i pity him then said harry  he is to be pitied said rose but his work is before him this woman such as she is with all her faults he has taken for better or for worse and all true friends and good people both his and hers should help both sides to make the best of it  i should say said harry that there is in this no best side  i think you do lillie injustice said rose there is and must be good in every one and gradually the good in him will overcome the evil in her  let us hope so said harry and now miss ferguson may i hope that you wont quite cross my name out of your good book youll be friends with me wont you  oh certainly said rose with a frank smile  well lets shake hands on that said harry rising to go  rose gave him her hand and the two parted in all amity     chapter xxiii   commonsense arguments  harry went straightway from the interview to call upon lillie and had a conversation with her in which he conducted himself like a sober discreet and rational man it was one of those daylight matteroffact kinds of talks with no nonsense about them in which things are called by their right names he confessed his own sins and took upon his own shoulders the blame that properly belonged there and having thus cleared his conscience took occasion to give lillie a deal of grandfatherly advice of a very sedative tendency  they had both been very silly he said and the next step to being silly very often was to be wicked for his part he thought she ought to be thankful for so good a husband and for his own part he should lose no time in trying to find a good wife who would help him to be a good man and do something worth doing in the world he had given people occasion to say illnatured things about her and he was sorry for it but if they stopped being imprudent the world would in time stop talking he hoped some of these days to bring his wife down to see her and to make the acquaintance of her husband whom he knew to be a capital fellow and one that she ought to be proud of  thus by the intervention of good angels the little papernautilus bark of lillies fortunes was prevented from going down in the great ugly maelstrom on the verge of which it had been so heedlessly sailing  harry was not slow in pushing the advantage of his treaty of friendship with rose to its utmost limits and being a young gentleman of parts and proficiency he made rapid progress  the interview of course immediately bred the necessity for at least a dozen more for he had to explain this thing and qualify that and on reflection would find by the next day that the explanation and qualification required a still further elucidation rose also after the first conversation was over was troubled at her own boldness and at the things that she in her state of excitement had said and so was only too glad to accord interviews and explanations as often as sought and on the whole was in the most favorable state towards her penitent  hence came many calls and many conferences with rose in the library to mrs van astrachans great satisfaction and concerning which mr van astrachan had many suppressed chuckles and knowing winks at polly  now pa dont you say a word said mrs van astrachan  oh no polly catch me i see a great deal but i say nothing said the good gentleman with a jocular quiver of his portly person i dont say any thingoh no by no manner of means  neither at present did harry neither do we     chapter xxiv   sentiment v sensibility  the poet has feelingly sung the condition of    the banquet hall deserted   whose lights are fled and garlands dead c  and so we need not cast the daylight of minute description on the follingsbee mansion  charlie ferrola however was summoned away at early daylight just as the last of the revellers were dispersing by a hurried messenger from his wife and a few moments after he entered his house he was standing beside his dying babythe little fellow whom we have seen brought down on mrs ferrolas arm to greet the call of mrs follingsbee  it is an awful thing for people of the flimsy vain painshunning pleasureseeking character of charlie ferrola to be taken at times as such people will be in the grip of an inexorable power and held face to face with the sternest the most awful the most frightful realities of life charlie ferrola was one of those whose softness and pitifulness like that of sentimentalists generally was only one form of intense selfishness the sight of suffering pained him and his first impulse was to get out of the way of it suffering that he did not see was nothing to him and if his wife or children were in any trouble he would have liked very well to have known nothing about it  but here he was by the bedside of this little creature dying in the agonies of slow suffocation rolling up its dark imploring eyes and lifting its poor little helpless hands and charlie ferrola broke out into the most violent and extravagant demonstrations of grief  the pale firm little woman who had watched all night and in whose tranquil face a light as if from heaven was beaming had to assume the care of him in addition to that of her dying child he was another helpless burden on her hands  there came a day when the house was filled with white flowers and people came and went and holy words were spoken and the fairest flower of all was carried out to return to the house no more  that woman is a most unnatural and peculiar woman said mrs follingsbee who had been most active and patronizing in sending flowers and attending to the scenic arrangements of the funeral it is just what i always said she is a perfect statue shes no kind of feeling there was charlie poor fellow so sick that he had to go to bed perfectly overcome and have somebody to sit up with him and there was that woman never shed a tearwent round attending to every thing just like a piece of clockwork well i suppose people are happier for being made so people that have no sensibility are better fitted to get through the world but gracious me i cant understand such people there she stood at the grave looking so calm when charlie was sobbing so that he could hardly hold himself up well it really wasnt respectable i think at least i would keep my veil down and keep my handkerchief up poor charlie he came to me at last and i gave way i was completely broken down i must confess poor fellow he told me there was no conceiving his misery that baby was the very idol of his soul all his hopes of life were centred in it he really felt tempted to rebel at providence he said that he really could not talk with his wife on the subject he could not enter into her submission at all it seemed to him like a want of feeling he said of course it wasnt her fault that she was made one way and he another  in fact mr charlie ferrola took to the pink satin boudoir with a more languishing persistency than ever requiring to be stayed with flagons and comforted with apples and receiving sentimental calls of condolence from fair admirers made aware of the intense poignancy of his grief a lovely poem called my withered blossom which appeared in a fashionable magazine shortly after was the outcome of this experience and increased the fashionable sympathy to the highest degree  honest mrs van astrachan however though not acquainted with mrs ferrola went to the funeral with rose and the next day her carriage was seen at mrs ferrolas door  you poor little darling she said as she came up and took mrs ferrola in her arms you must let me come and not mind me for i know all about it i lost the dearest little baby once and i have never forgotten it there there darling she said as the little woman broke into sobs in her arms yes yes do cry it will do your little heart good  there are people who wherever they move freeze the hearts of those they touch and chill all demonstration of feeling and there are warm natures that unlock every fountain and bid every feeling gush forth the reader has seen these two types in this story  wife said mr van astrachan coming to mrs v confidentially a day or two after i wonder if you remember any of your french what is a liaison  really dear said mrs van astrachan whose reading of late years had been mostly confined to such memoirs as that of mrs isabella graham doddridges rise and progress and baxters saints rest its a great while since i read any french what do you want to know for  well theres ben stuyvesant was saying this morning in wall street that theres a great deal of talk about that mrs follingsbee and that young fellow whose babys funeral you went to ben says theres a liaison between her and him i didnt ask him what twas but its something or other with a french name that makes talk and i dont think its respectable im sorry that you and rose went to her party but then that cant be helped now im afraid this mrs follingsbee is no sort of a woman after all  but pa ive been to call on mrs ferrola poor little afflicted thing said mrs van astrachan i couldnt help it you know how we felt when little willie died  oh certainly polly call on the poor woman by all means and do all you can to comfort her but from all i can find out that handsome jackanapes of a husband of hers is just the poorest trash going they say this follingsbee woman half supports him the time was in new york when such doings wouldnt be allowed and i dont think calling things by french names makes them a bit better so you just be careful and steer as clear of her as you can  i will pa just as clear as i can but you know rose is a friend of mrs john seymour and mrs seymour is visiting at mrs follingsbees  her husband oughtnt to let her stay there another day said mr van astrachan its as much as any womans reputation is worth to be staying with her to think of that fellow being dancing and capering at that jezebels house the night his baby was dying  oh but pa he didnt know it  know it he ought to have known it what business has a man to get a woman with a lot of babies round her and then go capering off twasnt the way i did polly you know when our babies were young i was always on the spot there ready to take the baby and walk up and down with it nights so that you might get your sleep and i always had it my side of the bed half the night id like to have seen myself out at a ball and you sitting up with a sick baby i tell you that if i caught any of my boys up to such tricks id cut them out of my will and settle the money on their wivesthats what i would  well pa i shall try and do all in my power for poor mrs ferrola said mrs van astrachan and you may be quite sure i wont take another step towards mrs follingsbees acquaintance  its a pity said mr van astrachan that somebody couldnt put it into mr john seymours head to send for his wife home  i dont see for my part what respectable women want to be gallivanting and highflying on their own separate account for away from their husbands goods that are sold shouldnt go back to the shopwindows said the good gentleman all whose views of life were of the most oldfashioned domestic kind  well dear we dont want to talk to rose about any of this scandal said his wife  no no it would be a pity to put any thing bad into a nice girls head said mr van astrachan you might caution her in a general way you know tell her for instance that ive heard of things that make me feel you ought to draw off why cant some bird of the air tell that little seymour womans husband to get her home  the little seymour womans husband though not warned by any particular bird of the air was not backward in taking steps for the recall of his wife as shall hereafter appear     chapter xxv   wedding bells  some weeks had passed in springdale while these affairs had been going on in new york the time for the marriage of grace had been set and she had gone to boston to attend to that preparatory shopping which even the most sensible of the sex discover to be indispensable on such occasions  grace inclined in the centre of her soul to bostonian rather than newyork preferences she had the innocent impression that a classical severity and a rigid reticence of taste pervaded even the rebellious department of feminine millinery in the city of the pilgrimsan idea which we rather think young boston would laugh down as an exploded superstition young bostons leading idea at the present hour being apparently to outdo new york in new yorks imitation of paris  in fact grace found it very difficult to find a milliner who if left to her own devices would not befeather and beflower her past all selfrecognition giving to her that generally betousled and flyaway air which comes straight from the demimonde of paris  we apprehend that the recent storms of tribulation which have beat upon those fairy islands of fashion may scatter this frail and fanciful population and send them by shiploads on missions of civilization to our shores in which case the bustle and animation and the brilliant display on the old turnpike spoken of familiarly as the broad road will be somewhat increased  grace however managed by the exercise of a good individual taste to come out of these shopping conflicts in good ordera handsome welldressed charming woman with everybodys best wishes for and sympathy in her happiness  lillie was summoned home by urgent messages from her husband calling her back to take her share in wedding festivities  she left willingly for the fact is that her last conversation with her cousin harry had made the situation as uncomfortable to her as if he had unceremoniously deluged her with a pailful of cold water  there is a chilly disagreeable kind of article called common sense which is of all things most repulsive and antipathetical to all petted creatures whose life has consisted in flattery it is the kind of talk which sisters are very apt to hear from brothers and daughters from fathers and mothers when fathers and mothers do their duty by them which sets the world before them as it is and not as it is painted by flatterers those women who prefer the society of gentlemen and who have the faculty of bewitching their senses never are in the way of hearing from this cold matteroffact region for them it really does not exist every phrase that meets their ear is polished and softened guarded and delicately turned till there is not a particle of homely truth left in it they pass their time in a world of illusions they demand these illusions of all who approach them as the sole condition of peace and favor all gentlemen by a sort of instinct recognize the woman who lives by flattery and give her her portion of meat in due season and thus some poor women are hopelessly buried as suicides used to be in scotland under a mountain of rubbish to which each passerby adds one stone it is only by some extraordinary power of circumstances that a man can be found to invade the sovereignty of a pretty woman with any disagreeable tidings or as junius says to instruct the throne in the language of truth harry was brought up to this point only by such a concurrence of circumstances he was in love with another womana ready cause for disenchantment he was in some sort a family connection and he saw lillies conduct at last therefore through the plain unvarnished medium of common sense moreover he felt a little pinched in his own conscience by the view which rose seemed to take of his part in the matter and manlike was strengthened in doing his duty by being a little galled and annoyed at the woman whose charms had tempted him into this dilemma so he talked to lillie like a brother or in other words made himself disagreeably explicitshowed her her sins and told her her duties as a married woman the charming fair ones who sentimentally desire gentlemen to regard them as sisters do not bargain for any of this sort of brotherly plainness and yet they might do it with great advantage a brother who is not a brother stationed near the ear of a fair friend is commonly very careful not to compromise his position by telling unpleasant truths but on the present occasion harry made a literal use of the brevet of brotherhood which lillie had bestowed on him and talked to her as the generality of real brothers talk to their sisters using great plainness of speech he withered all her poor little trumpery array of hothouse flowers of sentiment by treating them as so much garbage as all men know they are he set before her the gravity and dignity of marriage and her duties to her husband last and most unkind of all he professed his admiration of rose ferguson his unworthiness of her and his determination to win her by a nobler and better life and then showed himself to be a stupid blunderer by exhorting lillie to make rose her model and seek to imitate her virtues  poor lillie the world looked dismal and dreary enough to her she shrunk within herself every thing was withered and disenchanted all her poor little stock of romance seemed to her as disgusting as the withered flowers and crumpled finery and halfmelted icecream the morning after a ball  in this state when she got a warm true letter from john who always grew tender and affectionate when she was long away couched in those terms of admiration and affection that were soothing to her ear she really longed to go back to him she shrunk from the dreary plainness of truth and longed for flattery and petting and caresses once more and she wrote to john an overflowingly tender letter full of longings which brought him at once to her side the most delighted of men when lillie cried in his arms and told him that she found new york perfectly hateful when she declaimed on the heartlessness of fashionable life and longed to go with him to their quiet homeshe was tolerably in earnest and john was perfectly enchanted  poor john was he a muff a spoon we think not we understand well that there is not a woman among our readers who has the slightest patience with lillie and that the most of them are half out of patience with john for his enduring tenderness towards her  but men were born and organized by nature to be the protectors of women and generally speaking the stronger and more thoroughly manly a man is the more he has of what phrenologists call the pet organthe disposition which makes him the charmed servant of what is weak and dependent john had a great share of this quality he was made to be a protector he loved to protect he loved every thing that was helpless and weakyoung animals young children and delicate women  he was a romantic adorer of womanhood as a sort of divine mysterya neverending poem and when his wife was long enough away from him to give scope for imagination to work when she no longer annoyed him with the friction of the sharp little edges of her cold and selfish nature he was able to see her once more in the ideal light of first love after all she was his wife and in that one word to a good man is every thing holy and sacred he longed to believe in her and trust her wholly and now that grace was going from him to belong to another lillie was more than ever his dependence  on the whole if we must admit that john was weak he was weak where strong and noble natures may most gracefully be soweak through disinterestedness faith and the disposition to make the best of the wife he had chosen  and so lillie came home and there was festivity and rejoicing grace found herself floated into matrimony on a tide bringing gifts and tokens of remembrance from everybody that had ever known her for all were delighted with this opportunity of testifying a sense of her worth and every hand was ready to help ring her wedding bells     chapter xxvi   motherhood  it is supposed by some that to become a mother is of itself a healing and saving dispensation that of course the reign of selfishness ends and the reign of better things begins with the commencement of maternity  but old things do not pass away and all things become new by any such rapid process of conversion a whole life spent in selfseeking and selfpleasing is no preparation for the most august and austere of womans sufferings and duties and it is not to be wondered at if the untrained untaught and selfindulgent shrink from this ordeal as lillie did  the next spring while the gables of the new cottage on elm street were looking picturesquely through the blossoming cherrytrees and the smoke was curling up from the chimneys where grace and her husband were cosily settled down together there came to johns house another little lillie  the little creature came in terror and trembling for the mother had trifled fearfully with the great laws of her being before its birth and the very shadow of death hung over her at the time the little new life began  lillies mother now a widow was sent for and by this event installed as a fixture in her daughters dwelling and for weeks the sympathies of all the neighborhood were concentrated upon the sufferer flowers and fruits were left daily at the door every one was forward in offering those kindly attentions which spring up so gracefully in rural neighborhoods everybody was interested for her she was little and pretty and suffering and people even forgot to blame her for the levities that had made her present trial more severe as to john he watched over her day and night with anxious assiduity forgetting every fault and foible she was now more than the wife of his youth she was the mother of his child enthroned and glorified in his eyes by the wonderful and mysterious experiences which had given this new little treasure to their dwelling  to say the truth lillie was too sick and suffering for sentiment it requires a certain amount of bodily strength and soundness to feel emotions of love and for a long time the little lillie had to be banished from the mothers apartment as she lay weary in her darkened room with only a consciousness of a varied succession of disagreeables and discomforts her general impression about herself was that she was a much abused and most unfortunate woman and that all that could ever be done by the utmost devotion of everybody in the house was insufficient to make up for such trials as had come upon her  a nursing mother was found for the little lillie in the person of a goodly irish woman fair fat and loving and the real mother had none of those awakening influences from the resting of the little head in her bosom and the pressure of the little helpless fingers which magnetize into existence the blessed power of love  she had wasted in years of fashionable folly and in a life led only for excitement and selfgratification all the womanly power all the capability of motherly giving and motherly loving that are the glory of womanhood kathleen the whitearmed the gentlebosomed had all the simple pleasures the tendernesses the poetry of motherhood while poor faded fretful lillie had all the prosethe sad hard weary proseof sickness and pain unglorified by love  john did not well know what to do with himself in lillies darkened room where it seemed to him he was always in the way always doing something wrong where his feet always seemed too large and heavy and his voice too loud and where he was sure in his anxious desire to be still and gentle to upset something or bring about some general catastrophe and to go out feeling more like a criminal than ever  the mother and the nurse stationed there like a pair of chief mourners spoke in tones which experienced feminine experts seem to keep for occasions like these and which as hawthorne has said give an effect as if the voice had been dyed black it was a comfort and relief to pass from the funeral gloom to the little pinkruffled chamber among the cherrytrees where the birds were singing and the summer breezes blowing and the pretty kathleen was crooning her irish songs and invoking the holy virgin and all the saints to bless the darlin baby  an its a blessin they brings wid em to a house sir the angels comes down wid em we cant see em sir but bless the darlin she can and she smiles in her sleep when she sees em  illustration an its a blessin they brings wid em sir  rose and grace came often to this bower with kisses and gifts and offerings like a pair of nice fairy godmothers they hung over the pretty little waxen miracle as she opened her great blue eyes with a silent mysterious wonder but alas all these delicious moments this artless love of the new baby life was not for the mother she was not strong enough to enjoy it its cries made her nervous and so she kept the uncheered solitude of her room without the blessing of the little angel  people may mourn in lugubrious phrase about the irish blood in our country for our own part we think the rich tender motherly nature of the irish girl an element a thousand times more hopeful in our population than the faded washedout indifferentism of fashionable women who have danced and flirted away all their womanly attributes till there is neither warmth nor richness nor maternal fulness left in themmere paperdolls without milk in their bosoms or blood in their veins give us rich tender warmhearted bridgets and kathleens whose instincts teach them the real poetry of motherhood who can love unto death and bear trials and pains cheerfully for the joy that is set before them we are not afraid for the republican citizens that such mothers will bear to us they are the ones that will come to high places in our land and that will possess the earth by right of the strongest  motherhood to the woman who has lived only to be petted and to be herself the centre of all things is a virtual dethronement something weaker fairer more delicate than herself comessomething for her to serve and to care for more than herself  it would sometimes seem as if motherhood were a lovely artifice of the great father to wean the heart from selfishness by a peaceful and gradual process the babe is self in another form it is so interwoven and identified with the mothers life that she passes by almost insensible gradations from herself to it and day by day the distinctive love of self wanes as the childlove waxes filling the heart with a thousand new springs of tenderness  but that this benignant transformation of nature may be perfected it must be wrought out in natures own way any artificial arrangement that takes the child away from the mother interrupts that wonderful system of contrivances whereby the mothers nature and being shade off into that of the child and her heart enlarges to a new and heavenly power of loving  when lillie was sufficiently recovered to be fond of any thing she found in her lovely baby only a new toya source of pride and pleasure and a charming occasion for the display of new devices of millinery but she found newport indispensable that summer to the reestablishment of her strength and really she said the baby would be so much better off quietly at home with mamma and kathleen the fact is she said she quite disregards me she cries after kathleen if i take her so that its quite provoking  and so lillie free and unencumbered had her gay season at newport with the follingsbees and the simpkinses and the tompkinses and all the rest of the nice people who have nothing to do but enjoy themselves and everybody flattered her by being incredulous that one so young and charming could possibly be a mother     chapter xxvii   checkmate  if ever our readers have observed two chessplayers both ardent skilful determined who have been carrying on noiselessly the moves of a game they will understand the full significance of this decisive term  up to this point there is hope there is energy there is enthusiasm the pieces are marshalled and managed with good courage at last perhaps in an unexpected moment one two three adverse moves follow each other and the decisive words checkmate are uttered  this is a symbol of what often goes on in the game of life  here is a man going on indefinitely conscious in his own heart that he is not happy in his domestic relations there is a want of union between him and his wife she is not the woman that meets his wants or his desires and in the intercourse of life they constantly cross and annoy each other but still he does not allow himself to look the matter fully in the face he goes on and on hoping that tomorrow will bring something better than todayhoping that this thing or that thing or the other thing will bring a change and that in some indefinite future all will round and fashion itself to his desires it is very slowly that a man awakens from the illusions of his first love it is very unwillingly that he ever comes to the final conclusion that he has made there the mistake of a whole lifetime and that the woman to whom he gave his whole heart not only is not the woman that he supposed her to be but never in any future time nor by any change of circumstances will become that woman for then the difficulty seems radical and final and hopeless  in the pilgrims progress we read that the poor man christian tried to persuade his wife to go with him on the pilgrimage to the celestial city but that finally he had to make up his mind to go alone without her such is the lot of the man who is brought to the conclusion positively and definitely that his wife is always to be a hinderance and never a help to him in any upward aspiration that whatever he does that is needful and right and true must be done not by her influence but in spite of it that if he has to swim against the hard upward current of the river of life he must do so with her hanging on his arm and holding him back and that he cannot influence and cannot control her  such hours of disclosure to a man are among the terrible hidden tragedies of lifetragedies such as are never acted on the stage such a time of disclosure came to john the year after graces marriage and it came in this way  the spindlewood property had long been critically situated sundry financial changes which were going on in the country had depreciated its profits and affected it unfavorably all now depended upon the permanency of one commercial house john had been passing through an interval of great anxiety he could not tell lillie his trouble he had been for months past nervously watching all the incomings and outgoings of his family arranged on a scale of reckless expenditure which he felt entirely powerless to control lillies wishes were importunate she was nervous and hysterical wholly incapable of listening to reason and the least attempt to bring her to change any of her arrangements or to restrict any of her pleasures brought tears and faintings and distresses and scenes of domestic confusion which he shrank from he often tried to set before her the possibility that they might be obliged for a time at least to live in a different manner but she always resisted every such supposition as so frightful so dreadful that he was utterly discouraged and put off and off hoping that the evil day never might arrive  but it did come at last one morning when he received by mail the tidings of the failure of the great house of clapham  co he knew that the time had come when the thing could no longer be staved off he was an indorser to a large amount on the paper of this house and the crisis was inevitable  it was inevitable also that he must acquaint lillie with the state of his circumstances for she was going on with large arrangements and calculations for a newport campaign and sending the usual orders to new york to her milliner and dressmaker for her summer outfit it was a cruel thing for him to be obliged to interrupt all this for she seemed perfectly cheerful and happy in it as she always was when preparing to go on a pleasureseeking expedition but it could not be all this luxury and indulgence must be cut off at a stroke he must tell her that she could not go to newport that there was no money for new dresses or new finery that they should probably be obliged to move out of their elegant house and take a smaller one and practise for some time a rigid economy  john came into lillies elegant apartments which glittered like a tulipbed with many colored sashes and ribbons with sheeny silks and misty laces laid out in order to be surveyed before packing  gracious me john what on earth is the matter with you today how perfectly awful and solemn you do look  i have had bad news this morning lillie which i must tell you  oh dear me john what is the matter nobody is dead i hope  no lillie but i am afraid you will have to give up your newport journey  gracious goodness john what for  to say the truth lillie i cannot afford it  cant afford it why not why john what is the matter  well lillie just read this letter  lillie took it and read it with her hands trembling  well dear me john i dont see any thing in this letter if they have failed i dont see what that is to you  but lillie i am indorser for them  how very silly of you john what made you indorse for them now that is too bad it just makes me perfectly miserable to think of such things i know i should not have done so but i dont see why you need pay it it is their business anyhow  but lillie i shall have to pay it it is a matter of honor and honesty to do it because i engaged to do it  well i dont see why that should be it isnt your debt it is their debt and why need you do it i am sure dick follingsbee said that there were ways in which people could put their property out of their hands when they got caught in such scrapes as this dick knows just how to manage he told me of plenty of people that had done that who were living splendidly and who were received everywhere and people thought just as much of them  o lillie lillie my child said john you dont know any thing of what you are talking about that would be dishonorable and wholly out of the question no lillie dear the fact is he said with a great gulp and a deep sighthe fact is i have failed but i am going to fail honestly if i have nothing else left i will have my honor and my conscience but we shall have to give up this house and move into a smaller one every thing will have to be given up to the creditors to settle the business and then when all is arranged we must try to live economically some way and perhaps we can make it up again but you see dear there can be no more of this kind of expenses at present he said pointing to the dresses and jewelry on the bed  well john i am sure i had rather die said lillie gathering herself into a little white heap and tumbling into the middle of the bed i am sure if we have got to rub and scrub and starve so i had rather die and done with it and i hope i shall  john crossed his arms and looked gloomily out of the window  perhaps you had better he said i am sure i should be glad to  yes i dare say said lillie that is all you care for me now there is dick follingsbee he would be taking care of his wife why he has failed three or four times and always come out richer than he was before  he is a swindler and a rascal said john that is what he is  i dont care if he is said lillie sobbing his wife has good times and goes into the very first society in new york people dont care so long as you are rich what you do well i am sure i cant do any thing about it i dont know how to live without moneythats a fact and i cant learn i suppose you would be glad to see me rubbing around in old calico dresses wouldnt you and keeping only one girl and going into the kitchen like miss dotty peabody i think i see myself and all just for one of your quixotic notions when you might just as well keep all your money as not that is what it is to marry a reformer i never have had any peace of my life on account of your conscience always something or other turning up that you cant act like anybody else i should think at least you might have contrived to settle this place on me and poor little lillie that we might have a house to put our heads in  lillie lillie said john this is too much dont you think that i suffer at all  i dont see that you do said lillie sobbing i dare say you are glad of it it is just like you oh dear i wish i had never been married  i certainly do said john fervently  i suppose so you see it is nothing to you men you dont care any thing about these things if you can get a musty old corner and your books you are perfectly satisfied and you dont know when things are pretty and when they are not and so you can talk grand about your honor and your conscience and all that i suppose the carriages and horses have got to be sold too  certainly lillie said john hardening his heart and his tone  well well she said i wish you would go now and send ma to me i dont want to talk about it any more my head aches as if it would split poor ma she little thought when i married you that it was going to come to this  john walked out of the room gloomily enough he had received this morning his checkmate all illusion was at an end the woman that he had loved and idolized and caressed and petted and indulged in whom he had been daily and hourly disappointed since he was married but of whom he still hoped and hoped he now felt was of a nature not only unlike but opposed to his own he felt that he could neither love nor respect her further and yet she was his wife and the mother of his daughter and the only queen of his household and he had solemnly promised at gods altar that forsaking all others he would keep only unto her so long as they both should live for better for worse john muttered to himselffor better for worse this is the worse and oh it is dreadful  in all johns hours of sorrow and trouble the instinctive feeling of his heart was to go back to the memory of his mother and the nearest to his mother was his sister grace in this hour of his blind sorrow he walked directly over to the little cottage on elm street which grace and her husband had made a perfectly ideal home  when he came into the parlor grace and rose were sitting together with an open letter lying between them it was evident that some crisis of tender confidence had passed between them for the tears were hardly dry on roses cheeks yet it was not painful whatever it was for her face was radiant with smiles and john thought he had never seen her look so lovely at this moment the truth of her beautiful and lovely womanhood her sweetness and nobleness of nature came over him in bitter contrast with the scene he had just passed through and the woman he had left  what do you think john said grace we have some congratulations here to give rose is engaged to harry endicott  indeed said john i wish her joy  but what is the matter john said both women looking up and seeing something unusual in his face  oh trouble said johntrouble upon us all gracie and rose the spindlewood mills have failed  is it possible was the exclamation of both  yes indeed said john you see the thing has been running very close for the last six months and the manufacturing business has been looking darker and darker but still we could have stood it if the house of clapham  co had stood but they have gone to smash gracie i had a letter this morning telling me of it  both women stood a moment as if aghast for the ferguson property was equally involved  poor papa said rose this will come hard on him  i know it said john bitterly it is more for others that i feel than for myselffor all that are involved must suffer with me  but after all john dear said rose dont feel so about us at any rate we shall do very well people that fail honorably always come right side up at last and john how good it is to think whatever you lose you cannot lose your best treasureyour true noble heart and your true friends i feel this minute that we shall all know each other better and be more precious to each other for this very trouble  john looked at her through his tears  dear rose he said you are an angel and from my soul i congratulate the man that has got you he that has you would be rich if he lost the whole world  you are too good to me all of you said rose but now john about that bad newslet me break it to papa and mamma i think i can do it best i know when they feel brightest in the day and i dont want it to come on them suddenly but i can put it in the very best way how fortunate that i am just engaged to harry harry is a perfect prince in generosity you dont know what a good heart he has and it happens so fortunately that we have him to lean on just now oh im sure we shall find a way out of these troubles never fear and rose took the letter and left john and grace together  o gracie gracie said john throwing himself down on the old chintz sofa and burying his face in his hands what a woman there is o gracie i wish i was dead life is played out with me i havent the least desire to live i cant get a step farther  illustration o gracie i wish i was dead  o john john dont talk so said grace stooping over him why you will recover from this you are young and strong it will be settled and you can work your way up again  it is not the money grace i could let that go it is that i have nothing to live fornobody and nothing my wife gracie she is worse than nothingworse oh infinitely worse than nothing she is a chain and a shackle she is my obstacle she tortures me and hinders me every way and everywhere there will never be a home for me where she is and because she is there no other woman can make a home for me oh i wish she would go away and stay away i would not care if i never saw her face again  there was something shocking and terrible to grace about this outpouring it was dreadful to her to be the recipient of such a confidence to hear these words spoken and to more than suspect their truth she was quite silent for a few moments as he still lay with his face down buried in the sofapillow  then she went to her writingdesk took out a little ivory miniature of their mother came and sat down by him and laid her hand on his head  john she said look at this  he raised his head took it from her hand and looked at it soon she saw the tears dropping over it  john she said let me say to you now what i think our mother would have said the great object of life is not happiness and when we have lost our own personal happiness we have not lost all that life is worth living for no john the very best of life often lies beyond that when we have learned to let ourselves go then we may find that there is a better a nobler and a truer life for us  i have given up said john in a husky voice i have lost all  yes replied grace steadily i know perfectly well that there is very little hope of personal and individual happiness for you in your marriage for years to come instead of a companion a friend and a helper you have a moral invalid to take care of but john if lillie had been stricken with blindness or insanity or paralysis you would not have shrunk from your duty to her and because the blindness and paralysis are moral you will not shrink from it will you you sacrifice all your property to pay an indorsement for a debt that is not yours and why do you do it because society rests on every mans faithfulness to his engagements john if you stand by a business engagement with this faithfulness how much more should you stand by that great engagement which concerns all other families and the stability of all society lillie is your wife you were free to choose and you chose her she is the mother of your child and john what that daughter is to be depends very much on the steadiness with which you fulfil your duties to the mother i know that lillie is a most undeveloped and uncongenial person i know how little you have in common but your duties are the same as if she were the best and the most congenial of wives it is every mans duty to make the best of his marriage  but gracie said john is there any thing to be made of her  you will never make me believe john that there are any human beings absolutely without the capability of good they may be very dark and very slow to learn and very far from it but steady patience and love and welldoing will at last tell upon any one  but gracie if you could have heard how utterly without principle she is urging me to put my property out of my hands dishonestly to keep her in luxury  well john you must have patience with her consider that she has been unfortunate in her associates consider that she has been a petted child all her life and that you have helped to pet her consider how much your sex always do to weaken the moral sense of women by liking and admiring them for being weak and foolish and inconsequent so long as it is pretty and does not come in your way i do not mean you in particular john but i mean that the general course of society releases pretty women from any sense of obligation to be constant in duty or brave in meeting emergencies you yourself have encouraged lillie to live very much like a little hummingbird  well i thought said john that she would in time develop into something better  well there lies your mistake you expected too much the work of years is not to be undone in a moment and you must take into account that this is lillies first adversity you may as well make up your mind not to expect her to be reasonable it seems to me that we can make up our minds to bear any thing that we know must come and you may as well make up yours that for a long time you will have to carry lillie as a burden but then you must think that she is your daughters mother and that it is very important for the child that she should respect and honor her mother you must treat her with respect and honor even in her weaknesses we all must we all must help lillie as we can to bear this trial and sympathize with her in it unreasonable as she may seem because after all john it is a real trial to her  i cannot see for my part said john that she loves any thing  the power of loving may be undeveloped in her john but it will come perhaps later in life at all events take this comfort to yourselfthat when you are doing your duty by your wife when you are holding her in her place in the family and teaching her child to respect and honor her you are putting her in gods school of love if we contend with and fly from our duties simply because they gall us and burden us we go against every thing but if we take them up bravely then every thing goes with us god and good angels and good men and all good influences are working with us when we are working for the right and in this way john you may come to happiness or if you do not come to personal happiness you may come to something higher and better you know that you think it nobler to be an honest man than a rich man and i am sure that you will think it better to be a good man than to be a happy one now dear john it is not i that say these things i think but it seems to me it is what our mother would say if she should speak to you from where she is and then dear brother it will all be over soon this lifebattle and the only thing is to come out victorious  gracie you are right said john rising up i see it myself i will brace up to my duty couldnt you try and pacify lillie a little poor girl i suppose i have been rough with her  oh yes john i will go up and talk with lillie and condole with her and perhaps we shall bring her round and then when my husband comes home next week well have a family palaver and he will find some ways and means of setting this business straight that it wont be so bad as it looks now there may be arrangements made when the creditors come together my impression is that whenever people find a man really determined to arrange a matter of this kind honorably they are all disposed to help him so dont be cast down about the business as for lillies discontent treat it as you would the crying of your little daughter for its sugarplums and do not expect any thing more of her just now than there is                                       we have brought our story up to this point we informed our readers in the beginning that it was not a novel but a story with a moral and as people pick all sorts of strange morals out of stories we intend to put conspicuously into our story exactly what the moral of it is  well then it has been very surprising to us to see in these our times that some people who really at heart have the interest of women upon their minds have been so shortsighted and reckless as to clamor for an easy dissolution of the marriagecontract as a means of righting their wrongs is it possible that they do not see that this is a liberty which once granted would always tell against the weaker sex if the woman who finds that she has made a mistake and married a man unkind or uncongenial may on the discovery of it leave him and seek her fortune with another so also may a man and what will become of women like lillie when the first gilding begins to wear off if the man who has taken one of them shall be at liberty to cast her off and seek another have we not enough now of miserable brokenwinged butterflies that sink down down down into the mud of the street but are womenreformers going to clamor for having every woman turned out helpless when the man who has married her and made her a mother discovers that she has not the power to interest him and to help his higher spiritual development it was because woman is helpless and weak and because christ was her great protector that he made the law of marriage irrevocable whosoever putteth away his wife causeth her to commit adultery if the sacredness of the marriagecontract did not hold if the church and all good men and all good women did not uphold it with their might and main it is easy to see where the career of many women like lillie would end men have the power to reflect before the choice is made and that is the only proper time for reflection but when once marriage is made and consummated it should be as fixed a fact as the laws of nature and they who suffer under its stringency should suffer as those who endure for the public good he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not he shall enter into the tabernacle of the lord     chapter xxviii   after the storm  the painful and unfortunate crises of life often arise and darken like a thunderstorm and seem for the moment perfectly terrific and overwhelming but wait a little and the cloud sweeps by and the earth which seemed about to be torn to pieces and destroyed comes out as good as new not a bird is dead not a flower killed and the sun shines just as he did before so it was with johns financial trouble when it came to be investigated and looked into it proved much less terrible than had been feared it was not utter ruin the high character which john bore for honor and probity the general respect which was felt for him by all to whom he stood indebted led to an arrangement by which the whole business was put into his hands and time given him to work it through his brotherinlaw came to his aid advancing money and entering into the business with him our friend harry endicott was only too happy to prove his devotion to rose by offers of financial assistance  in short there seemed every reason to hope that after a period of somewhat close sailing the property might be brought into clear water again and go on even better than before  to say the truth too john was really relieved by that terrible burst of confidence in his sister it is a curious fact that giving full expression to bitterness of feeling or indignation against one we love seems to be such a relief that it always brings a revulsion of kindliness john never loved his sister so much as when he heard her plead his wifes cause with him for though in some bitter impatient hour a man may feel which john did as if he would be glad to sunder all ties and tear himself away from an uncongenial wife yet a good man never can forget the woman that once he loved and who is the mother of his children those sweet sacred visions and illusions of first love will return again and again even after disenchantment and the better and the purer the man is the more sacred is the appeal to him of womans weakness because he is strong and she is weak he feels that it would be unmanly to desert her and if there ever was any thing for which john thanked his sister it was when she went over and spent hours with his wife patiently listening to her complainings and soothing her as if she had been a petted child all the circle of friends in a like manner bore with her for his sake  thanks to the intervention of graces husband and of harry john was not put to the trial and humiliation of being obliged to sell the family place although constrained to live in it under a system of more rigid economy lillies mother although quite a commonplace woman as a companion had been an economist in her day she had known how to make the most of straitened circumstances and being put to it could do it again  to be sure there was an end of newport gayeties for lillie vowed and declared that she would not go to newport and take cheap board and live without a carriage she didnt want the follingsbees and the tompkinses and the simpkinses talking about her and saying that they had failed her mother worked like a servant for her in smartening her up and tidying her old dresses of which one would think that she had a stock to last for many years and thus with everybody sympathizing with her and everybody helping her lillie subsided into enacting the part of a patient persecuted saint she was touchingly resigned and wore an air of pleasing melancholy john had asked her pardon for all the hasty words he said to her in the terrible interview and she had forgiven him with edifying meekness of course she remarked to her mother she knew he would be sorry for the way he had spoken to her and she was very glad that he had the grace to confess it  so life went on and on with john he never forgot his sisters words but received them into his heart as a message from his mother in heaven from that time no one could have judged by any word look or action of his that his wife was not what she had always been to him  meanwhile rose was happily married and settled down in the ferguson place where her husband and she formed one family with her parents it was a pleasant cosey social friendly neighborhood after all john found that his cross was not so very heavy to carry when once he had made up his mind that it must be borne by never expecting much he was never disappointed having made up his mind that he was to serve and to give without receiving he did it and began to find pleasure in it by and by the little lillie growing up by her mothers side began to be a compensation for all he had suffered the little creature inherited her mothers beauty the dazzling delicacy of her complexion the abundance of her golden hair but there had been given to her also her fathers magnanimous and generous nature lillie was a selfish exacting mother and such women often succeed in teaching to their children patience and selfdenial as soon as the little creature could walk she was her fathers constant playfellow and companion he took her with him everywhere he was never weary of talking with her and playing with her and gradually he relieved the mother of all care of her early training when in time two others were added to the nursery troop lillie became a perfect model of a gracious motherly little older sister  did all this patience and devotion of the husband at last awaken any thing like love in the wife lillie was not naturally rich in emotion under the best education and development she would have been rather wanting in the loving power and the whole course of her education had been directed to suppress what little she had and to concentrate all her feelings upon herself  the factitious and unnatural life she had lived so many years had seriously undermined the stamina of her constitution and after the birth of her third child her health failed altogether lillie thus became in time a chronic invalid exacting querulous full of troubles and wants which tasked the patience of all around her during all these trying years her husbands faithfulness never faltered as he gradually retrieved his circumstances she was first in every calculation because he knew that here lay his greatest temptation here he most rigidly performed his duty nothing that money could give to soften the weariness of sickness was withheld and john was for hours and hours whenever he could spare the time himself a personal assiduous unwearied attendant in the sickroom     chapter xxix   the new lillie  illustration  we have but one scene more before our story closes it is night now in lillies sickroom and her mother is anxiously arranging the drapery to keep the firelight from her eyes stepping noiselessly about the room she lies there behind the curtains on her pillowthe wreck and remnant only of what was once so beautiful during all these years when the interests and pleasures of life have been slowly dropping leaf by leaf and passing away like fading flowers lillie has learned to do much thinking it sometimes seems to take a stab a thrust a wound to open in some hearts the capacity of deep feeling and deep thought there are things taught by suffering that can be taught in no other way by suffering sometimes is wrought out in a person the power of loving and of appreciating love during the first year lillie had often seemed to herself in a sort of wild chaotic state the coming in of a strange new spiritual life was something so inexplicable to her that it agitated and distressed her and sometimes when she appeared more petulant and fretful than usual it was only the stir and vibration on her weak nerves of new feelings which she wanted the power to express these emotions at first were painful to her she felt weak miserable and good for nothing it seemed to her that her whole life had been a wretched cheat and that she had ill repaid the devotion of her husband at first these thoughts only made her bitter and angry and she contended against them but as she sank from day to day and grew weaker and weaker she grew more gentle and a better spirit seemed to enter into her  on this evening that we speak of she had made up her mind that she would try and tell her husband some of the things that were passing in her mind  tell john i want to see him she said to her mother i wish he would come and sit with me  this was a summons for which john invariably left every thing he laid down his book as the word was brought to him and soon was treading noiselessly at her bedside  well lillie dear he said how are you  she put out her little wasted hand john dear she said sit down i have something that i want to say to you i have been thinking john that this cant last much longer  what cant last lillie said john trying to speak cheerfully  i mean john that i am going to leave you soon for good and all and i should not think you would be sorry either  oh come come my girl it wont do to talk so said john patting her hand you must not be blue  and so john said lillie going on without noticing this interruption i wanted just to tell you before i got any weaker that i know and feel just how patient and noble and good you have always been to me  o lillie darling said john why shouldnt i be poor little girl how much you have suffered  well now john i know perfectly well that i have never been the wife that i ought to be to you you know it too so dont try to say anything about it i was never the woman to have made you happy and it was not fair in me to marry you i have lived a dreadfully worldly selfish life and now john i am come to the end you dear good man your trials with me are almost over but i want you to know that you really have succeeded john i do love you now with all my heart though i did not love you when i married you and john i do feel that god will take pity on me poor and good for nothing as i am just because i see how patient and kind you have always been to me when i have been so very provoking you see it has made me think how good god must bebecause dear we know that he is better than the best of us  o lillie lillie said john leaning over her and taking her in his arms do live i want you to live dont leave me now now that you really love me  oh no john it is best as it isi think i should not have strength to be very good if i were to get well and you would still have your little cross to carry no dear it is all right and john you will have the best of me in our lillie she looks like me but john she has your good heart and she will be more to you than i could be she is just as sweet and unselfish as i was selfish i dont think i am quite so bad now and i think if i lived i should try to be a great deal better  o lillie i cannot bear to part with you i never have ceased to love you and i never have loved any other woman  i know that john oh how much truer and better you are than i have been but i like to think that you love mei like to think that you will be sorry when i am gone bad as i am or was for i insist on it that i am a little better than i was you remember that story of undine you read me one day it seems as if most of my life i have been like undine before her soul came into her but this last year i have felt the coming in of a soul it has troubled me it has come with a strange kind of pain i have never suffered so much but it has done me goodit has made me feel that i have an immortal soul and that you and i john shall meet in some better place hereafterand there you will be rewarded for all your goodness to me  as john sat there and held the little frail hand his thoughts went back to the time when the wild impulse of his heart had been to break away from this woman and never see her face again and he gave thanks to god who had led him in a better way                                       and so at last passed away the little story of lillies life but in the home which she has left now grows another lillie fairer and sweeter than shethe tender confidant the trusted friend of her father and often when he lays his hand on her golden head he says dear child how like your mother you look  of all that was painful in that experience nothing now remains john thinks of her only as he thought of her in the fair illusion of first lovethe dearest and most sacred of all illusions  the lillie who guides his household and is so motherly to the younger children who shares every thought of his heart who enters into every feeling and sympathyshe is the pure reward of his faithfulness and constancy she is a sacred and saintly lillie springing out of the sod where he laid her mother forgetting all her faults for ever  illustration
