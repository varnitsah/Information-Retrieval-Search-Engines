84162658	the lamplighter     if you talk of murphy and francis moore gentlemen said the lamplighter who was in the chair i mean to say that neither of em ever had any more to do with the stars than tom grig had  and what had he to do with em asked the lamplighter who officiated as vice  nothing at all replied the other just exactly nothing at all  do you mean to say you dont believe in murphy then demanded the lamplighter who had opened the discussion  i mean to say i believe in tom grig replied the chairman whether i believe in murphy or not is a matter between me and my conscience and whether murphy believes in himself or not is a matter between him and his conscience  gentlemen i drink your healths  the lamplighter who did the company this honour was seated in the chimneycorner of a certain tavern which has been time out of mind the lamplighters house of call  he sat in the midst of a circle of lamplighters and was the cacique or chief of the tribe  if any of our readers have had the good fortune to behold a lamplighters funeral they will not be surprised to learn that lamplighters are a strange and primitive people that they rigidly adhere to old ceremonies and customs which have been handed down among them from father to son since the first public lamp was lighted out of doors that they intermarry and betroth their children in infancy that they enter into no plots or conspiracies for who ever heard of a traitorous lamplighter that they commit no crimes against the laws of their country there being no instance of a murderous or burglarious lamplighter that they are in short notwithstanding their apparently volatile and restless character a highly moral and reflective people  having among themselves as many traditional observances as the jews and being as a body if not as old as the hills at least as old as the streets  it is an article of their creed that the first faint glimmering of true civilisation shone in the first streetlight maintained at the public expense  they trace their existence and high position in the public esteem in a direct line to the heathen mythology and hold that the history of prometheus himself is but a pleasant fable whereof the true hero is a lamplighter  gentlemen said the lamplighter in the chair i drink your healths  and perhaps sir said the vice holding up his glass and rising a little way off his seat and sitting down again in token that he recognised and returned the compliment perhaps you will add to that condescension by telling us who tom grig was and how he came to be connected in your mind with francis moore physician  hear hear hear cried the lamplighters generally  tom grig gentlemen said the chairman was one of us and it happened to him as it dont often happen to a public character in our line that he had his whatyoumaycallit cast  his head said the vice  no replied the chairman not his head  his face perhaps said the vice  no not his face  his legs  no not his legs  nor yet his arms nor his hands nor his feet nor his chest all of which were severally suggested  his nativity perhaps  thats it said the chairman awakening from his thoughtful attitude at the suggestion  his nativity  thats what tom had cast gentlemen  in plaster asked the vice  i dont rightly know how its done returned the chairman  but i suppose it was  and there he stopped as if that were all he had to say whereupon there arose a murmur among the company which at length resolved itself into a request conveyed through the vice that he would go on  this being exactly what the chairman wanted he mused for a little time performed that agreeable ceremony which is popularly termed wetting ones whistle and went on thus  tom grig gentlemen was as i have said one of us and i may go further and say he was an ornament to us and such a one as only the good old times of oil and cotton could have produced  toms family gentlemen were all lamplighters  not the ladies i hope asked the vice  they had talent enough for it sir rejoined the chairman and would have been but for the prejudices of society  let women have their rights sir and the females of toms family would have been every one of em in office  but that emancipation hasnt come yet and hadnt then and consequently they confined themselves to the bosoms of their families cooked the dinners mended the clothes minded the children comforted their husbands and attended to the housekeeping generally  its a hard thing upon the women gentlemen that they are limited to such a sphere of action as this very hard  i happen to know all about tom gentlemen from the circumstance of his uncle by his mothers side having been my particular friend  his thats toms uncles fate was a melancholy one  gas was the death of him  when it was first talked of he laughed  he wasnt angry he laughed at the credulity of human nature  they might as well talk he says of laying on an everlasting succession of glowworms and then he laughed again partly at his joke and partly at poor humanity  in course of time however the thing got ground the experiment was made and they lighted up pall mall  toms uncle went to see it  ive heard that he fell off his ladder fourteen times that night from weakness and that he would certainly have gone on falling till he killed himself if his last tumble hadnt been into a wheelbarrow which was going his way and humanely took him home i foresee in this says toms uncle faintly and taking to his bed as he spoke  i foresee in this he says the breaking up of our profession  theres no more going the rounds to trim by daylight no more dribbling down of the oil on the hats and bonnets of ladies and gentlemen when one feels in spirits  any low fellow can light a gaslamp  and its all up  in this state of mind he petitioned the government for  i want a word again gentlemen  what do you call that which they give to people when its found out at last that theyve never been of any use and have been paid too much for doing nothing  compensation suggested the vice  thats it said the chairman  compensation  they didnt give it him though and then he got very fond of his country all at once and went about saying that gas was a deathblow to his native land and that it was a plot of the radicals to ruin the country and destroy the oil and cotton trade for ever and that the whales would go and kill themselves privately out of sheer spite and vexation at not being caught  at last he got rightdown cracked called his tobaccopipe a gaspipe thought his tears were lamp oil and went on with all manner of nonsense of that sort till one night he hung himself on a lampiron in saint martins lane and there was an end of him  tom loved him gentlemen but he survived it  he shed a tear over his grave got very drunk spoke a funeral oration that night in the watchhouse and was fined five shillings for it in the morning  some men are none the worse for this sort of thing  tom was one of em  he went that very afternoon on a new beat  as clear in his head and as free from fever as father mathew himself  toms new beat gentlemen was  i cant exactly say where for that hed never tell but i know it was in a quiet part of town where there were some queer old houses  i have always had it in my head that it must have been somewhere near canonbury tower in islington but thats a matter of opinion  wherever it was he went upon it with a brannew ladder a white hat a brown holland jacket and trousers a blue neckkerchief and a sprig of full blown double wallflower in his buttonhole  tom was always genteel in his appearance and i have heard from the best judges that if he had left his ladder at home that afternoon you might have took him for a lord  he was always merry was tom and such a singer that if there was any encouragement for native talent hed have been at the opera he was on his ladder lighting his first lamp and singing to himself in a manner more easily to be conceived than described when he hears the clock strike five and suddenly sees an old gentleman with a telescope in his hand throw up a window and look at him very hard  tom didnt know what could be passing in this old gentlemans mind  he thought it likely enough that he might be saying within himself heres a new lamplighter  a goodlooking young fellow  shall i stand something to drink  thinking this possible he keeps quite still pretending to be very particular about the wick and looks at the old gentleman sideways seeming to take no notice of him  gentlemen he was one of the strangest and most mysteriouslooking files that ever tom clapped his eyes on  he was dressed all slovenly and untidy in a great gown of a kind of bedfurniture pattern with a cap of the same on his head and a long old flapped waistcoat with no braces no strings very few buttons  in short with hardly any of those artificial contrivances that hold society together  tom knew by these signs and by his not being shaved and by his not being overclean and by a sort of wisdom not quite awake in his face that he was a scientific old gentleman  he often told me that if he could have conceived the possibility of the whole royal society being boiled down into one man he should have said the old gentlemans body was that body  the old gentleman claps the telescope to his eye looks all round sees nobody else in sight stares at tom again and cries out very loud  halloa  halloa sir says tom from the ladder and halloa again if you come to that  heres an extraordinary fulfilment says the old gentleman of a prediction of the planets  is there says tom  im very glad to hear it  young man says the old gentleman you dont know me  sir says tom i have not that honour but i shall be happy to drink your health notwithstanding  i read cries the old gentleman without taking any notice of this politeness on toms part  i read whats going to happen in the stars  tom thanked him for the information and begged to know if anything particular was going to happen in the stars in the course of a week or so but the old gentleman correcting him explained that he read in the stars what was going to happen on dry land and that he was acquainted with all the celestial bodies  i hope theyre all well sir says tom  everybody  hush cries the old gentleman  i have consulted the book of fate with rare and wonderful success  i am versed in the great sciences of astrology and astronomy  in my house here i have every description of apparatus for observing the course and motion of the planets  six months ago i derived from this source the knowledge that precisely as the clock struck five this afternoon a stranger would present himself  the destined husband of my young and lovely niece  in reality of illustrious and high descent but whose birth would be enveloped in uncertainty and mystery  dont tell me yours isnt says the old gentleman who was in such a hurry to speak that he couldnt get the words out fast enough for i know better  gentlemen tom was so astonished when he heard him say this that he could hardly keep his footing on the ladder and found it necessary to hold on by the lamppost  there was a mystery about his birth  his mother had always admitted it  tom had never known who was his father and some people had gone so far as to say that even she was in doubt  while he was in this state of amazement the old gentleman leaves the window bursts out of the housedoor shakes the ladder and tom like a ripe pumpkin comes sliding down into his arms  let me embrace you he says folding his arms about him and nearly lighting up his old bedfurniture gown at toms link youre a man of noble aspect  everything combines to prove the accuracy of my observations  you have had mysterious promptings within you he says i know you have had whisperings of greatness eh he says  i think i have says tom  tom was one of those who can persuade themselves to anything they like  ive often thought i wasnt the small beer i was taken for  you were right cries the old gentleman hugging him again come in  my niece awaits us  is the young lady tolerable goodlooking sir says tom hanging fire rather as he thought of her playing the piano and knowing french and being up to all manner of accomplishments  shes beautiful cries the old gentleman who was in such a terrible bustle that he was all in a perspiration  she has a graceful carriage an exquisite shape a sweet voice a countenance beaming with animation and expression and the eye he says rubbing his hands of a startled fawn  tom supposed this might mean what was called among his circle of acquaintance a game eye and with a view to this defect inquired whether the young lady had any cash  she has five thousand pounds cries the old gentleman  but what of that what of that  a word in your ear  im in search of the philosophers stone  i have very nearly found it  not quite it turns everything to gold thats its property  tom naturally thought it must have a deal of property and said that when the old gentleman did get it he hoped hed be careful to keep it in the family  certainly he says of course  five thousand pounds  whats five thousand pounds to us  whats five million he says whats five thousand million  money will be nothing to us  we shall never be able to spend it fast enough  well try what we can do sir says tom  we will says the old gentleman  your name  grig says tom  the old gentleman embraced him again very tight and without speaking another word dragged him into the house in such an excited manner that it was as much as tom could do to take his link and ladder with him and put them down in the passage  gentlemen if tom hadnt been always remarkable for his love of truth i think you would still have believed him when he said that all this was like a dream  there is no better way for a man to find out whether he is really asleep or awake than calling for something to eat  if hes in a dream gentlemen hell find something wanting in flavour depend upon it  tom explained his doubts to the old gentleman and said that if there was any cold meat in the house it would ease his mind very much to test himself at once  the old gentleman ordered up a venison pie a small ham and a bottle of very old madeira  at the first mouthful of pie and the first glass of wine tom smacks his lips and cries out im awake  wide awake and to prove that he was so gentlemen he made an end of em both  when tom had finished his meal which he never spoke of afterwards without tears in his eyes the old gentleman hugs him again and says noble stranger let us visit my young and lovely niece tom who was a little elevated with the wine replies the noble stranger is agreeable  at which words the old gentleman took him by the hand and led him to the parlour crying as he opened the door here is mr grig the favourite of the planets  i will not attempt a description of female beauty gentlemen for every one of us has a model of his own that suits his own taste best  in this parlour that im speaking of there were two young ladies and if every gentleman present will imagine two models of his own in their places and will be kind enough to polish em up to the very highest pitch of perfection he will then have a faint conception of their uncommon radiance  besides these two young ladies there was their waitingwoman that under any other circumstances tom would have looked upon as a venus and besides her there was a tall thin dismalfaced young gentleman half man and half boy dressed in a childish suit of clothes very much too short in the legs and arms and looking according to toms comparison like one of the wax juveniles from a tailors door grown up and run to seed  now this youngster stamped his foot upon the ground and looked very fierce at tom and tom looked fierce at him  for to tell the truth gentlemen tom more than half suspected that when they entered the room he was kissing one of the young ladies and for anything tom knew you observe it might be his young lady  which was not pleasant  sir says tom before we proceed any further will you have the goodness to inform me who this young salamander  tom called him that for aggravation you perceive gentlemen  who this young salamander may be  that mr grig says the old gentleman is my little boy  he was christened galileo isaac newton flamstead  dont mind him hes a mere child  and a very fine child too says tom  still aggravating youll observe  of his age and as good as fine i have no doubt  how do you do my man with which kind and patronising expressions tom reached up to pat him on the head and quoted two lines about little boys from doctor wattss hymns which he had learnt at a sunday school  it was very easy to see gentlemen by this youngsters frowning and by the waitingmaids tossing her head and turning up her nose and by the young ladies turning their backs and talking together at the other end of the room that nobody but the old gentleman took very kindly to the noble stranger  indeed tom plainly heard the waitingwoman say of her master that so far from being able to read the stars as he pretended she didnt believe he knew his letters in em or at best that he had got further than words in one syllable but tom not minding this for he was in spirits after the madeira looks with an agreeable air towards the young ladies and kissing his hand to both says to the old gentleman which is which  this says the old gentleman leading out the handsomest if one of em could possibly be said to be handsomer than the other  this is my niece miss fanny barker  if youll permit me miss says tom being a noble stranger and a favourite of the planets i will conduct myself as such  with these words he kisses the young lady in a very affable way turns to the old gentleman slaps him on the back and says whens it to come off my buck  the young lady coloured so deep and her lip trembled so much gentlemen that tom really thought she was going to cry  but she kept her feelings down and turning to the old gentleman says dear uncle though you have the absolute disposal of my hand and fortune and though you mean well in disposing of em thus i ask you whether you dont think this is a mistake  dont you think dear uncle she says that the stars must be in error  is it not possible that the comet may have put em out  the stars says the old gentleman couldnt make a mistake if they tried  emma he says to the other young lady  yes papa says she  the same day that makes your cousin mrs grig will unite you to the gifted mooney  no remonstrance  no tears  now mr grig let me conduct you to that hallowed ground that philosophical retreat where my friend and partner the gifted mooney of whom i have just now spoken is even now pursuing those discoveries which shall enrich us with the precious metal and make us masters of the world  come mr grig he says  with all my heart sir replies tom and luck to the gifted mooney say i  not so much on his account as for our worthy selves  with this sentiment tom kissed his hand to the ladies again and followed him out having the gratification to perceive as he looked back that they were all hanging on by the arms and legs of galileo isaac newton flamstead to prevent him from following the noble stranger and tearing him to pieces  gentlemen toms fatherinlaw that was to be took him by the hand and having lighted a little lamp led him across a paved courtyard at the back of the house into a very large dark gloomy room  filled with all manner of bottles globes books telescopes crocodiles alligators and other scientific instruments of every kind  in the centre of this room was a stove or furnace with what tom called a pot but which in my opinion was a crucible in full boil  in one corner was a sort of ladder leading through the roof and up this ladder the old gentleman pointed as he said in a whisper  the observatory  mr mooney is even now watching for the precise time at which we are to come into all the riches of the earth  it will be necessary for he and i alone in that silent place to cast your nativity before the hour arrives  put the day and minute of your birth on this piece of paper and leave the rest to me  you dont mean to say says tom doing as he was told and giving him back the paper that im to wait here long do you  its a precious dismal place  hush says the old gentleman  its hallowed ground farewell  stop a minute says tom  what a hurry youre in  whats in that large bottle yonder  its a child with three heads says the old gentleman and everything else in proportion  why dont you throw him away says tom  what do you keep such unpleasant things here for  throw him away cries the old gentleman  we use him constantly in astrology  hes a charm  i shouldnt have thought it says tom from his appearance must you go i say  the old gentleman makes him no answer but climbs up the ladder in a greater bustle than ever  tom looked after his legs till there was nothing of him left and then sat down to wait feeling so he used to say as comfortable as if he was going to be made a freemason and they were heating the pokers  tom waited so long gentlemen that he began to think it must be getting on for midnight at least and felt more dismal and lonely than ever he had done in all his life  he tried every means of whiling away the time but it never had seemed to move so slow first he took a nearer view of the child with three heads and thought what a comfort it must have been to his parents  then he looked up a long telescope which was pointed out of the window but saw nothing particular in consequence of the stopper being on at the other end  then he came to a skeleton in a glass case labelled skeleton of a gentleman  prepared by mr mooney  which made him hope that mr mooney might not be in the habit of preparing gentlemen that way without their own consent  a hundred times at least he looked into the pot where they were boiling the philosophers stone down to the proper consistency and wondered whether it was nearly done  when it is thinks tom ill send out for sixpennorth of sprats and turn em into gold fish for a first experiment  besides which he made up his mind gentlemen to have a countryhouse and a park and to plant a bit of it with a double row of gaslamps a mile long and go out every night with a frenchpolished mahogany ladder and two servants in livery behind him to light em for his own pleasure  at length and at last the old gentlemans legs appeared upon the steps leading through the roof and he came slowly down  bringing along with him the gifted mooney  this mooney gentlemen was even more scientific in appearance than his friend and had as tom often declared upon his word and honour the dirtiest face we can possibly know of in this imperfect state of existence  gentlemen you are all aware that if a scientific man isnt absent in his mind hes of no good at all  mr mooney was so absent that when the old gentleman said to him shake hands with mr grig he put out his leg  heres a mind mr grig cries the old gentleman in a rapture  heres philosophy  heres rumination  dont disturb him he says for this is amazing  tom had no wish to disturb him having nothing particular to say but he was so uncommonly amazing that the old gentleman got impatient and determined to give him an electric shock to bring him to  for you must know mr grig he says that we always keep a strongly charged battery ready for that purpose  these means being resorted to gentlemen the gifted mooney revived with a loud roar and he no sooner came to himself than both he and the old gentleman looked at tom with compassion and shed tears abundantly  my dear friend says the old gentleman to the gifted prepare him  i say cries tom falling back none of that you know  no preparing by mr mooney if you please  alas replies the old gentleman you dont understand us  my friend inform him of his fate  i cant  the gifted mustered up his voice after many efforts and informed tom that his nativity had been carefully cast and he would expire at exactly thirtyfive minutes twentyseven seconds and five sixths of a second past nine oclock am on that day two months  gentlemen i leave you to judge what were toms feelings at this announcement on the eve of matrimony and endless riches  i think he says in a trembling voice there must be a mistake in the working of that sum  will you do me the favour to cast it up again  there is no mistake replies the old gentleman it is confirmed by francis moore physician  here is the prediction for tomorrow two months  and he showed him the page where sure enough were these words  the decease of a great person may be looked for about this time  which says the old gentleman is clearly you mr grig  too clearly cries tom sinking into a chair and giving one hand to the old gentleman and one to the gifted  the orb of day has set on thomas grig for ever  at this affecting remark the gifted shed tears again and the other two mingled their tears with his in a kind  if i may use the expression  of mooney and cos entire  but the old gentleman recovering first observed that this was only a reason for hastening the marriage in order that toms distinguished race might be transmitted to posterity and requesting the gifted to console mr grig during his temporary absence he withdrew to settle the preliminaries with his niece immediately  and now gentlemen a very extraordinary and remarkable occurrence took place for as tom sat in a melancholy way in one chair and the gifted sat in a melancholy way in another a couple of doors were thrown violently open the two young ladies rushed in and one knelt down in a loving attitude at toms feet and the other at the gifteds  so far perhaps as tom was concerned  as he used to say  you will say there was nothing strange in this  but you will be of a different opinion when you understand that toms young lady was kneeling to the gifted and the gifteds young lady was kneeling to tom  halloa stop a minute cries tom heres a mistake  i need condoling with by sympathising woman under my afflicting circumstances but were out in the figure  change partners mooney  monster cries toms young lady clinging to the gifted  miss says tom  is that your manners  i abjure thee cries toms young lady  i renounce thee  i never will be thine  thou she says to the gifted art the object of my first and allengrossing passion  wrapt in thy sublime visions thou hast not perceived my love but driven to despair i now shake off the woman and avow it  oh cruel cruel man  with which reproach she laid her head upon the gifteds breast and put her arms about him in the tenderest manner possible gentlemen  and i says the other young lady in a sort of ecstasy that made tom start  i hereby abjure my chosen husband too  hear me goblin  this was to the gifted  hear me  i hold thee in the deepest detestation  the maddening interview of this one night has filled my soul with love  but not for thee  it is for thee for thee young man she cries to tom  as monk lewis finely observes thomas thomas i am thine thomas thomas thou art mine  thine for ever mine for ever with which words she became very tender likewise  tom and the gifted gentlemen as you may believe looked at each other in a very awkward manner and with thoughts not at all complimentary to the two young ladies  as to the gifted i have heard tom say often that he was certain he was in a fit and had it inwardly  speak to me  oh speak to me cries toms young lady to the gifted  i dont want to speak to anybody he says finding his voice at last and trying to push her away  i think i had better go  im  im frightened he says looking about as if he had lost something  not one look of love she cries  hear me while i declare    i dont know how to look a look of love he says all in a maze dont declare anything  i dont want to hear anybody  thats right cries the old gentleman who it seems had been listening  thats right  dont hear her  emma shall marry you tomorrow my friend whether she likes it or not and she shall marry mr grig  gentlemen these words were no sooner out of his mouth than galileo isaac newton flamstead who it seems had been listening too darts in and spinning round and round like a young giants top cries let her  let her  im fierce im furious  i give her leave  ill never marry anybody after this  never  it isnt safe  she is the falsest of the false he cries tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth and ill live and die a bachelor  the little boy observed the gifted gravely albeit of tender years has spoken wisdom  i have been led to the contemplation of womankind and will not adventure on the troubled waters of matrimony  what says the old gentleman not marry my daughter  wont you mooney  not if i make her  wont you  wont you  no says mooney i wont  and if anybody asks me any more ill run away and never come back again  mr grig says the old gentleman the stars must be obeyed you have not changed your mind because of a little girlish folly  eh mr grig  tom gentlemen had had his eyes about him and was pretty sure that all this was a device and trick of the waitingmaid to put him off his inclination  he had seen her hiding and skipping about the two doors and had observed that a very little whispering from her pacified the salamander directly  so thinks tom this is a plot  but it wont fit  eh mr grig says the old gentleman  why sir says tom pointing to the crucible if the soups nearly ready    another hour beholds the consummation of our labours returned the old gentleman  very good says tom with a mournful air  its only for two months but i may as well be the richest man in the world even for that time  im not particular ill take her sir  ill take her  the old gentleman was in a rapture to find tom still in the same mind and drawing the young lady towards him by little and little was joining their hands by main force when all of a sudden gentlemen the crucible blows up with a great crash everybody screams the room is filled with smoke and tom not knowing what may happen next throws himself into a fancy attitude and says come on if youre a man without addressing himself to anybody in particular  the labours of fifteen years says the old gentleman clasping his hands and looking down upon the gifted who was saving the pieces are destroyed in an instant  and i am told gentlemen bythebye that this same philosophers stone would have been discovered a hundred times at least to speak within bounds if it wasnt for the one unfortunate circumstance that the apparatus always blows up when its on the very point of succeeding  tom turns pale when he hears the old gentleman expressing himself to this unpleasant effect and stammers out that if its quite agreeable to all parties he would like to know exactly what has happened and what change has really taken place in the prospects of that company  we have failed for the present mr grig says the old gentleman wiping his forehead  and i regret it the more because i have in fact invested my nieces five thousand pounds in this glorious speculation  but dont be cast down he says anxiously  in another fifteen years mr grig    oh cries tom letting the young ladys hand fall  were the stars very positive about this union sir  they were says the old gentleman  im sorry to hear it tom makes answer for its no go sir  no what cries the old gentleman  go sir says tom fiercely  i forbid the banns  and with these words  which are the very words he used  he sat himself down in a chair and laying his head upon the table thought with a secret grief of what was to come to pass on that day two months  tom always said gentlemen that that waitingmaid was the artfullest minx he had ever seen and he left it in writing in this country when he went to colonize abroad that he was certain in his own mind she and the salamander had blown up the philosophers stone on purpose and to cut him out of his property  i believe tom was in the right gentlemen but whether or no she comes forward at this point and says may i speak sir and the old gentleman answering yes you may she goes on to say that the stars are no doubt quite right in every respect but tom is not the man  and she says dont you remember sir that when the clock struck five this afternoon you gave master galileo a rap on the head with your telescope and told him to get out of the way yes i do says the old gentleman  then says the waiting maid i say hes the man and the prophecy is fulfilled  the old gentleman staggers at this as if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest and cries he why hes a boy  upon that gentlemen the salamander cries out that hell be twentyone next ladyday and complains that his father has always been so busy with the sun round which the earth revolves that he has never taken any notice of the son that revolves round him and that he hasnt had a new suit of clothes since he was fourteen and that he wasnt even taken out of nankeen frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in em and touches on a good many more family matters to the same purpose  to make short of a long story gentlemen they all talk together and cry together and remind the old gentleman that as to the noble family his own grandfather would have been lord mayor if he hadnt died at a dinner the year before and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the cousins are married the prediction comes true every way  at last the old gentleman being quite convinced gives in and joins their hands and leaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes and they are all well pleased and the gifted as well as any of them  in the middle of this little family party gentlemen sits tom all the while as miserable as you like  but when everything else is arranged the old gentlemans daughter says that their strange conduct was a little device of the waitingmaids to disgust the lovers he had chosen for em and will he forgive her and if he will perhaps he might even find her a husband  and when she says that she looks uncommon hard at tom  then the waitingmaid says that oh dear she couldnt abear mr grig should think she wanted him to marry her and that she had even gone so far as to refuse the last lamplighter who was now a literary character having set up as a billsticker and that she hoped mr grig would not suppose she was on her last legs by any means for the baker was very strong in his attentions at that moment and as to the butcher he was frantic  and i dont know how much more she might have said gentlemen for as you know this kind of young women are rare ones to talk if the old gentleman hadnt cut in suddenly and asked tom if hed have her with ten pounds to recompense him for his loss of time and disappointment and as a kind of bribe to keep the story secret  it dont much matter sir says tom i aint long for this world  eight weeks of marriage especially with this young woman might reconcile me to my fate  i think he says i could go off easy after that  with which he embraces her with a very dismal face and groans in a way that might move a heart of stone  even of philosophers stone  egad says the old gentleman that reminds me  this bustle put it out of my head  there was a figure wrong  hell live to a green old age  eightyseven at least  how much sir cries tom  eightyseven says the old gentleman  without another word tom flings himself on the old gentlemans neck throws up his hat cuts a caper defies the waitingmaid and refers her to the butcher  you wont marry her says the old gentleman angrily  and live after it says tom  id sooner marry a mermaid with a smalltooth comb and lookingglass  then take the consequences says the other  with those words  i beg your kind attention here gentlemen for its worth your notice  the old gentleman wetted the forefinger of his right hand in some of the liquor from the crucible that was spilt on the floor and drew a small triangle on toms forehead the room swam before his eyes and he found himself in the watch house  found himself where cried the vice on behalf of the company generally  in the watchhouse said the chairman  it was late at night and he found himself in the very watchhouse from which he had been let out that morning  did he go home asked the vice  the watchhouse people rather objected to that said the chairman so he stopped there that night and went before the magistrate in the morning  why youre here again are you says the magistrate adding insult to injury well trouble you for five shillings more if you can conveniently spare the money  tom told him he had been enchanted but it was of no use  he told the contractors the same but they wouldnt believe him  it was very hard upon him gentlemen as he often said for was it likely hed go and invent such a tale  they shook their heads and told him hed say anything but his prayers  as indeed he would theres no doubt about that  it was the only imputation on his moral character that ever i heard of
